&gt; I would not be surprised at all if Watters chose those words specifically to cause outrage because he knew many ont he left would lose their shit over it. 

That's exactly it, right? This is how you become popular in politics. It's all about hating the other side. So "making *them* mad" is it's own virtue by itself. We hate the other guys so much, that we love it when they suffer. So we elect and listen to media trolls that make them suffer so we can laugh at them, because our hate for the other side trumps other priorities like community. 

&gt; But that doesn't make that outrage any less ignorant and unreasonable.

This depends on the context, as a lot of people pointed out. The context we are in is Fauci getting constant and very credible death threats against him and his family. How can politics become so ugly? Why don't we look back up at the previous paragraph for this? And in this context, Watters uses these words: “Now you go in for *the kill shot, the kill shot with an ambush, deadly, because he doesn’t see it coming,”** ... "you know why people don’t trust you, don’t you?′ **Oh, he is dead. He’s dead. He’s done.”** If I had human empathy, I would probably understand someone being a bit irritated by these words in this particular context and situation that Fauci is in.
