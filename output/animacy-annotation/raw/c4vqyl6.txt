Or you could say... **FUCK IT!**

Then go for what I like to call **"Responsible Reckless-Abandon"** or a **"Controlled Free-Fall!"** --I like this clever metaphor if I do say so myself... Lunging forth into the abyss from out of a plane is really dangerous if you have no training or a parachute; just like uninformed/reckless drug-use is! Both can be unforgettable experiences that enhance your life and are super exciting! (but are definitely risky if pursued by some persons).

Essentially, doing lots of risk-mitigated drug-taking (through knowledge/prep/discipline) like me and you'll have it memorized in no time with little to no harm done! 

I'm not saying this is the right approach for everyone studying these things, but it's worth looking in to! Though one shouldn't seek anything addictive/dangerous if you have a history of psychological problems/abuse-history/genetic pre-disposition to addiction or any other health considerations (esp w/ regard to interaction w/ a substance and prescribed Meds you may be taking currently).

Remember, one should do the following basic research if taking any Substance(s) Unknown: 
Class (Stimulant, Depressant etc.)
Safe Dosage Amounts
Drug Half-life Time
Physiological and Neurological Mechanism(s) of Action - What/where/how it will affect/potentially affect you - The HEART, BRAIN AND LUNGS are the most important things to look at organ-wise. 

Know all the Negative/Neutral/Positive effects you might encounter and what causes them - Neurotransmitters/Heart rate changes/Body temperature concerns/respiratory depression, dehydration/over-hydration concerns, Vaso-dilation/constriction etc... Just use COMMON SENSE and be thorough (It's your ass if something shitty happens - Not knowing what's up w/ your body as it malfunctions makes for a **Bad Situation** that rapidly evolves into a *veritable* **Nightmare**).

If you are taking any medications prior to (or simultaneously during) use of a new substance, do the research for every pharmaceutical you have in your biological system - taking particular care to note how/if substances you are taking have known interactions with each other...Pay special attention to identifying if any substances "Stack and Intensify"/ "Potentiate"/ "Negate" or have any Danger of negative consequences to your Physiological and Psychological health resulting from bad interaction(s)...Good example(s) of things to check for, would be things like "Serotonin Syndrome," (a potentially lethal problem resulting from bad/excessive substance interaction/dosing) and things like lowered seizure thresh-holds are good to know about.

Pro-tip: Studying Neurochemistry/Pharmacology is more interesting after taking certain substances! Reading about a substance you're on allows a greater understanding of the Science! Experience/theoretical knowledge dominates in any field really... Makes sense to experience these things first-hand - Though it goes without saying that safe drug-taking is the priority above any experience!

You still have to **study** drugs as a substance-explorer/psychonaut/your drug-title-of-choice academically to fully understand things...but you can do some fun *PRACTICALS* to complement your theoretical knowledge!

Also, I'm inclined to think that you'd pay a little more attention anyhow, especially if you knew you were going to be ingesting the substance(s) in question - Want to be safe right? 

Here's a real-world-hypothetical-scenario (courtesy of the dark recesses of my over-active imagination)...

Simple Bob - A very average man - who lives on through his infamous tale and is notable for nothing at all - Simple Bob - This is his story:

Simple Bob decides to take some **Tramadol Hcl** (an Opiate-Analgesic that can **lower one's Seizure Threshold**) to cope with the boredom of his desk job and deal with anxiety resulting from a peculiar Clock-phobia he has. Bob took the daily max dosage for 24 hrs - 400mg - his simple ass didn't know any better, but he lucked out with dosage - he consumed the drugs throughout the course of his 9 hour work-day at the Cardboard Box manufacturer he works for.

Poor Bob is dumb and useless as shit, but he's useful as a morale booster and unwitting clown - someone to have around to boost anyone's self-confidence. So Bob's overworked, underpaid, tired, very average and a little spacey from the Tramadol Hcl...

An off-kilter, mass-production, cheap, urine-yellow IKEA clock that runs 6.5 mins slow rests above that over-friendly Accounts-Asshole, Brad. It is the object of all of Simple Bob's anger/anxiety and a symbol of all that is wrong in the world in his eyes. 

Somewhat ironically, the **"Face"** of his Chrono-Overlord makes Bob **"Tick."**

I tried to explain the humorous observation/play on words (stated above) to Bob over the course of our 6 years together... 

Needless to say it was a hopeless endeavor and was a concept not even poorly *grasped* by Bob, let alone being understood enough to be "lost* upon his unrefined intellect... My charitable efforts served only to achieve numerous "friendly-but-kinda-dumb" looks on Simple Bob's very average/emotively-limited countenance (Kind of like an inbred dog... Sweet but dumb and about as expressive as his IKEA Clock-nemesis).

Bob is too short to reach his tormentor, too stupid to get a chair and too socially awkward to ask for help (though if only Brad was available, I would probably build a Sun-dial instead of asking him). Ultimately, Simple Bob can't even set the damn time correctly! He feels impotent and resorts to using his simple mind to ineffectively direct anger at the inanimate object telepathically...

Bob has a singular purpose after arriving at work... Waiting for that piece of shit clock that has gotten the better of him to strike 7pm and free him from his Corporate shackles! He relishes the moment of alignment for an instant. Then grabs his lack-luster and dusty coat and hat, punches his time-card and experiences the overwhelming catharsis and happy relief that only the simple-minded feel from having been temporarily emancipated from his Corporate Bondage. 

As a result of Bob being predictably distracted by his freedom (perhaps understandably for a man of Bob's intellectual capacity, attention-span and his life-long struggle to hold more than 1 thought) - Bob is so happy and unaware, that he confuses natural elation with the chemical helper he had earlier!

-Simple Bob promptly forgets taking 400mg Tramadol hcl.

To celebrate his not-special-at-all-and-recurring-daily-emancipation, Simple Bob buys a gram of "Speed" (as Simple Bob knows it), from his drug-dealing, trailer-park-residing, brother-in-law. Unbeknownst to him, Bob is purchasing Desoxyn Crystals AKA Crystal Methamphetamine (A powerful Amphetamine that can **induce seizures** if one is not careful with its use... Seizures may even occur at very low-doses for those pre-disposed to seizures genetically/are Epileptic/take too high a dose).

Does the class remember what Bob took earlier at work? Can you guess what's going to happen? Bob is totally ignorant of his situation...

Simple Bob smokes the entire gram of suprisingly high grade Desoxyn in 20mins (with a crappy tinfoil pipe he fashioned from an old taco-wrapper). Simple Bob promptly falls to the floor, his eyes filled with the fear of not understanding his grave error... the last insignificant seconds of Sad Simple Bob's pitiful existence slip away without epiphany and Bob became just another dumbass victim of Darwin's Law of Natural Selection. He died as a result of his foolhardy drug taking and the resulting fatal seizure-induced Brain aneurism.

He lives on only as a tale of insecurity, insignificance, reckless/uninformed substance use...and more generally...as a testament to human stupidity.

RIP Hypothetical Simple Bob - I'm sure you are hypothetically still making people world-wide feel just a tad smarter :)

Anyways, everyone try and minimize the harm of doing potentially dangerous drugs with common sense and knowledge. Don't forget to enjoy the riiiiiiide!!!
