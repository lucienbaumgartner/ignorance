NTA you're a titan, your husband is a titan, your daughter is too.  Only advice since you've got everything else down amazingly is you can let your daughter know that she can love her grandma, her grandma can even actually love her, but this is something she's ignorant and dangerous with.  Even when you love someone sometimes you have to set boundaries, tell them no.  Be around them less if they hurt us, or she can have you and her dad around to run interference.  I'm sorry she's facing racism from someone she loves.
