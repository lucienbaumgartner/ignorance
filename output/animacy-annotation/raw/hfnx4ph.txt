Thank you so much for your input and words of advice Braavo. After speaking to someone at Admissions for City yesterday, I was made aware about the Grove School of Engineering and there specific requirements for acceptance. I still have to speak to someone at Queens to figure out what there process is, but after speaking with a department advisor at Hunter today, I think I’m leaning toward choosing them. This has been supplemented by what some people such as yourself here on Reddit have told me. I also have a friend whose attending a grad program at Hunter who went to John Jay with me a couple years ago, and she too has enjoyed the school.

I totally agree that ultimately, you get out what you put in. I kind of took college for granted when I originally went the first time fresh out of High School. I was still young and unaware of what I wanted to do with myself. Once I discovered programming and decided I wanted to be a SWE, I would always tell myself and others “I wish I would’ve discovered this passion sooner so that I would’ve studied CS in college”.  Going the self-taught route has proven difficult as far as the job search goes. But now that I’m looking into going back, I’m viewing college from a whole different lens and don’t Plan on taking it for granted. Especially since I’ll actually be studying what I always wished I did in hindsight. Anyway, sorry for the rant lol. Thanks again 👍🏼
