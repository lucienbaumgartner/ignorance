I’m in a similar situation my oldest brother is 28 and doesn’t work or pay rent and he sleeps all day. I wish my mom would kick him out. I get he’s your son and you love him unconditionally but not kicking him out is making all of our lives worse. 
I live in a small house so he pretty much takes over the whole basement and it always smells like shit. cigarette butts,  trash and dishes everywhere. It’s so embarrassing that I can’t have friends or a girl over. I’ve spent too many nights sad af doing nothing cause I’m embarrassed of this disgusting pig living in my basement. My parents gave him so many opportunities more then me and most kids would ever have, parents even bought him a car when he turned 16. He’s so ungrateful and unaware of how pathetic he has come that I don’t feel bad for him at all. My moms pretty much given up at this point and it feels like nothing is changing till I move out.
