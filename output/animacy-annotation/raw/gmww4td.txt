And no: it’s not your fault, esp if you were born into TSCC.  Indoctrination and abuse of the complete trust of a child by adults -and esp when the perpetrator is a parent who is either completely aware, unaware, or somewhere in between aware and unaware of the folly of their ways- is never the child’s fault.

For converts being abused by the cult aspects of TSCC, they likely have a strong codependent streak, for whatever reason, that leaves them primed for narcissistic abuse by TSCC, it’s leaders, and it’s toxic authoritarian shame culture that permeates families.
