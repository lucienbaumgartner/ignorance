&gt; he broadcast really seemed to shove diversity down the viewer's throats

black man on screen = wtf riot forced diversity ????? what the fuck is wrong with you? i don't like him either but saying he's just a "token hire" and that the only reason he's there is because they needed a black guy is insanely racist and ignorant of how he got there. he literally used to be the head of global esports events at riot, he's far from a "token hire".
