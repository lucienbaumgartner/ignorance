Crowder invited him onto his show as a guest and called him stupid and ignorant? That seems highly unlikely. More like he probably disagreed with his viewpoints but was respectful. 

I just clicked on the video where Kyle was a guest just seven days ago and the comments were overwhelmingly positive towards him. You’ll forgive me if I have a hard time believing he said what you said he said. 

However, if you can prove it, I’m more than willing to change my viewpoint. Since you watched the interview Steven did with Kyle in its entirety, just let me know the minute mark he calls him stupid and ignorant and I’ll see for myself. 

I was never into watching an hour long interview with Kyle, but I’m also not the one making claims about Steven here. I’m openminded and willing to admit when I’m wrong and criticize political figures I like, but I don’t go by hearsay. 

And also. Almost the entirety of the right supports Kyle. The majority of right wingers were not angry that he supported BLM lol 

That’s just a fact. 🤷🏻‍♀️
