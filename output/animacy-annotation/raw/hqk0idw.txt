Not true even if we did get access to it the sheikhs speak in a coded language when they read it and they read it a certain way. My brother is actually a sheikh and he has some of the books in his house but 1.) I can only read basic Arabic, and 2.) it’s extremely looked down upon and pretty much forbidden for a juhhal (ignorant) to open or read from those books so even if I could read Arabic I wouldn’t even dare open them. But let’s say I did know Arabic very well and read through it, I still wouldn’t get what the books truly met until I become initiated as a sheikh. They do this on purpose so that the books may never become corrupted by outsiders. That’s why there are ignorant and wise ones. Once a secret gets it out it becomes corrupted by the masses, just look at every other mainstream religion.
