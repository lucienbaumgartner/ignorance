She made a mistake and there is so much more people out there who are still uneducated and unaware of what POC go through and their experiences. All we can hope for Sutton and others like her is that they truly do better and that they listen and educate themselves. PR or not, when someone is not malicious or filled with hate, talking and educating them will always be the best option in my opinion instead of immediately casting doubt on their intentions.
