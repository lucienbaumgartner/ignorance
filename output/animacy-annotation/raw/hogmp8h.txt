This spike proteins stuff is so transparent. They'll talk about how awful it is when they're lying about vaccines, but then act like Covid is no big deal, when it's studies on the spoke proteins on SARS-CoV-2 Nd it the vaccines, that the studies they always cite are done on. It's just quackery that only convinced people actively seeking to confirm their biases or people who are uneducated and ignorant of biology and who think people like this are trustworthy based on the way they're presented in right-wing media and in podcasts and such.
