I can't even count how many things are wrong with this. Your child will never trust you again. If you are worried about such behavior, then you need to have a real conversation with her. You need to talk *with* her, not *at* her, as an adult. 

Also. Cameras only deter actions if they can be seen by the person you're trying to watch (ie security cameras). Since you are trying to prevent her actions, that means you'd have to tell her about the camera. If so, how do you think that conversation would go? How would it make her feel? Remember when you were a teenager, how would that have made you feel?

Cameras that are unseen cannot deter actions bc the target is unaware and thus unaffected by their presence. So if you hid it in her room it wouldn't stop her, it would only let you know if she snuck out. How would you then confront her? How would explain how you knew? When she finds it, what kinds effects do you think this would have on her and on your relationship? 

You need to think very hard about your role as a parent and how you view that role.
