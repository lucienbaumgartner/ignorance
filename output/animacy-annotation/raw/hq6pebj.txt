There’s that victimhood!

I’m assuming you mean the willfully unvaccinated, antivaxxers and Joe Roganites, etc.

The left, or whatever you think the left is, does not see unvaccinated people as “The Other,” persecuted for merely not being part of the in-group.  For one thing, unvaccinated people are self-selected.  One is not born an antivaxxer.  And they aren’t seen as inherently evil, just dangerously ignorant and often selfish and lacking empathy.

That wouldn’t justify harming them, but when you are talking about a contagion, you can’t allow them to help the virus against the rest of humanity, either.  So their stupidity has to be mitigated while the productive people of the world try to solve things.
