Lmao, someone decided to do some snooping after they realized they needed something to latch onto since they couldn’t even answer a simple question. Too bad there’s not much more to discuss. “Gubament bad!” seems to be the crux of your stance, which is just ignorant and boring. 

Feel free to continue to spit out your uneducated, very misguided views of the Constitution and what it means. 

For everyone else: this is a prime example of what it looks like when someone loses a simple debate. Ad hominem after ad hominem, without knowing my age, and equating “BiG wOrDs” with attempts at wisdom when it’s just…vocabulary? Though he would disagree with more funding for education, it’s clear “Taco_Bandito” was failed by his state’s education system. Desperately.
