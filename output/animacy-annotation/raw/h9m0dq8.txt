as sus as the woman's actions may have been (and we only have OP's version mind you, a version riddled with unneccessary shit like "the darker part of dusk" LOL SCARY!), the only thing that we know happened is that an adult was offered a piece of candy. in other words nothing: nothing happened. the notion that someone wants to steal OP's baby is so hilariously self-centered, privileged, paranoid, and ignorant that it could be part of a south park episode where the karens drink chardonnay spiked with pcp and go apeshit crazy. it's the funniest thing i've read all week yet you take it seriously, so i guess to answer your question my reality has a lot of laughs in it and no one wants to steal OP's child. that would be horrible ðŸ¥³
