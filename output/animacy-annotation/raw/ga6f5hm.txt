I worked alone at a nursing home at night, and heard one of my residents take a spill and I found her in a puddle of blood with her walker on top of her. I had to jump into action and control her head wound and simultaneously do neuro checks and check her extremities for further injuries, while calling my supervisor to call an ambulance. It was a scalp gash that required 11 stitches, but she was conscious and unaware of the injury, and was fine, just bruised up and had to be a 1 person assist for ambulation after that. 

I have a few stories from working third alone at the nursing home, lots of moans, residents calling “is anyone out there” in the middle of the night, and residents talking to people who aren’t there. 

One funny story, from the same lady that fell: I helped her to the toilet (probably about a million times per night, she never slept and set off her tabs alarm constantly throughout the night) and she started laughing to herself, and I asked what was funny. She smiled and told me that the little boy in her bed told her a joke. I asked her about the joke, and she looked at my serious and said “it was a dirty joke” and continued to chuckle to herself as I tucked her in. When people are on certain medications, and when your brain is being slowly destroyed by dementia, visual hallucinations are common.
