I was young dumb and unaware of politics during the harper era. What was it about him that made him a good leader? Just FYI I'm being entirely sincere. I know there's alot of political baiting and trapping on reddit, but your opinion is safe with me.

Also I can just google it if you don't feel like explaining. I just find talking with other people more comfortable.
