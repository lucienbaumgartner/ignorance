If you are indeed older than me, I really feel sorry for you to be that old and that ignorant. Cheating men are not a “status symbol” for women; they’re trash. What the fuck makes you think women want to be cheated on any more than men do? We are not “different,” men like you are just so small and ignorant that you truly think somebody owes you something.

Don’t have kids, stop spreading this stupidity to future generations. Make it stop, now.

You don’t “see me,” there’s nothing to see. You’re garbage.
