I played through the entire game unspoiled and unaware that there was such backlash against it. Pretty much avoided all internet discussion about the game. I absolutely loved it and once I finished, I looked forward to finally being able to subscribe to its subreddit and discuss the game with likeminded gamers who similarly appreciated this masterpiece. Boy was I in for a surprise.
