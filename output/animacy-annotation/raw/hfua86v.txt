That’s awfully racist and ignorant of you. 

The women we employed usually had family back home that they were providing for. They lived with us in our house, ate our food and we usually bought them clothes if they needed any. They also had free healthcare if they needed it. They were able to send almost their entire pay back home and they got a holiday so they could see their family back in their country. Sometimes they used their wages as a stepping stone - one of them left Ethiopia because of the war going on and started as a maid then went on to become a hairdresser. 

Sure, we could like, just not have maids. But it would deny people legitimate employment and a route out of their own countries. 

There are massive problems - employers who take away their passports, near slave conditions, people who abuse their maids. But that’s not the norm. More regulation is required, not the abolition of those jobs.
