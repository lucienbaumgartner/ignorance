Freedom is for those who can handle it. Parents have already proven to be ignorant and incapable of handling internet exposure, porn exposure, etc. to their children. They instead buy them ipads, tabs, laptops, ultra fast internet, gaming computers, ensuring they go down the rabbits holes of the internet. Either make is illegal for parents to not have parental control on all devices for any of their children under 25. That doesn't thought would be controlled. Online open source libraries, encyclopedias, knowledge portals, coding, graphic designing etc. all should be readily available for anyone to learn. Music, sports, etc. Not Bollywood music that eulogizes sex in one shape or another but genuine varieties of music. Many things to consider but core point being making sure that anyone under 25 isn't manipulated by Bollywood, Hollywood, consumer culture, porn, dating apps, extremist political ideologies, political propaganda, unregulated social media, low attention span social media like TikTok etc. Once they're fully developed and capable then leave them on their own completely independent, so they can now make responsible decisions.
