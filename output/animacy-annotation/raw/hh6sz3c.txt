I see both sides;

- Is it shitty for OP to just ghost someone they're out with at a bar/club when that person gets too drunk ? Yes.

But;

- Unless you're a 17 year old girl, you should know your limits and exhibit some self control. It's nobodys job to babysit your sloshed ass, or try to coral you all night whilst you're probably being obnoxious and unaware of the situation you are putting others in. 

Id say every situation is different;

- Out with a friend who knowingly has too much and even though is wasted, is still civil and asks for you to get them home?  No problem.

- Or how about you are out with someone who just got dumped or fired or something else serious is happening and they just take it a few drinks too far ? I'll hang in there and try to help em out, atleast make sure they get in an Uber or something to get home.

- But someone who just walks in and starts pounding shot after shot to get wrecked in 45 minutes then proceeds to just be belligerent and uncontrollable ? Yeah I'm out.
