I think you're underestimating how different groups of people would be affected. Madoka's style is very very unique, that's very obvious. The blocky heads, exaggerated eye sizes and distance, along with overall smaller loli proportions are meant to serve the greater story of the anime. Whereas e7 caters to a semi-realism style. I think many who play e7 would agree that the art style is what drew them in the first place, esp. those who dislike the chibi gameplay of gachas like arknights or granblue. These players would prefer a more coherent artstyle, especially if the collab units are broken, meta first picks or BiS pve team units. For them, the madoka art style would be a sore thumb in epic seven (as opposed to guilty gear's style, which was easily integrated because arcsys has always used a similar semi-realism art style). 

I do think that adapting madoka to e7's style would be the correct way (if madoka is even the collab). You would have loli units similar to the likes of ravi, alencia, lilibet, etc. But it would shaft some of the fans of the source material. 

I'm not saying it's a "major roadblock," but I am saying the art style is very very different, and would cause differences between enjoyers of the collab vs. enjoyers of e7. It would be exclusionary and ignorant of us to say it's easy to ignore one or the other groups. That wasn't a problem with guity gear because the art style translates easily between games.
