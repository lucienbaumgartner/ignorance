The ironic thing about perfect worlds is that we lose what makes us human, just how perfectly imperfect we are. 

Look at *The Giver*. No disease, poverty, war... you name it. No nothing 'cept peace and quiet and harmony. Yet the people in the community aren't really living, not actually. They have no choice. Their lives are dictated; their humanity is stripped. 

Sure, if they could choose, and if they had the memories, they could choose wrong. Sometimes people are selfish and ignorant and violent. But sometimes people are selfless and they choose to care for others and to sacrifice for others. 

We have to accept the bad with the good. That's what makes us human. So a perfect world doesn't include us, at least in nothing more than name.
