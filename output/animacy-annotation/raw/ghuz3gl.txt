I had something similar, except funnier (to me, anyway) ...

In college I was walking up a trail as a shortcut to the house I lived in, through some woods, in the dark. It was kind of rural so this was perfectly normal.  I saw and heard someone coming the other way so I stopped in a wider area so they could pass. Apparently this girl was drunk and unaware, and blundered right into me. I could not help laughing  that she had walked right into me but She screamed and ran crashing through the woods.  I tried calling out to see if she was ok, but quickly realized all I could do was walk away as noisily as possible
