That's not luggage.  It's "service luggage."  Must get him through his condition of PTSD of working at Amazon last 2 years.  Don't worry, this service luggage has been registered as a "service anima....." Oh, nevermind.....his AirPods must have blinded him from the idea someone was standing next to him in the luggaged-occupied seat.  He's just another ordinary Seattle "Gump." - Just another purely unaware and rude Seattleite.  I know them too well.
