I don't mean the Liberal party. I mean people on the political left. Doesn't matter if they're Liberals or NDP. It's always is always, "say what we want to hear so we can use you for political gain, or shut up." Hell I got banned from the Canada anti-racism sub, r/onguardforthee simply for pointing out this very fact.

Folks on the right tend to have misunderstanding whereas their counterparts on the left are wilfully ignorant and purposefully racist.
