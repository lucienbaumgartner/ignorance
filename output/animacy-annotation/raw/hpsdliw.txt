It ended? LMAO.

You sound more blinded by propaganda than an islamic terrorist.

U.S. companies exploit the situation and working condition in China, so anything happening there you are supporting it.

U.S. government supports Israel which is basically committing genocide against the people in palestine. And you guys are in total denial.

U.S. government supports Saudi Arabia, I donÂ´t really need to talk about it, do I?

Last time that the U.S. have been accused of crimes against humanity is 2021 (yes, this year).

I could go on, and on.

And  with that being said, if you knew what communism is, you would know that in China there is an "hybrid system" that nowadays has nothing to do communism.

As I said, ignorant and brainwashed.
