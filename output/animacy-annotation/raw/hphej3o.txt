Oh sorry for misunderstanding, that's actually a stupidly easy connection to make, but if you can't make it I'm happy to help! I think in most developed nations, kids are taught to make the key part of that connection around kindergarten.

The piece of fabric known as a flag represents the land, people, and government of a nation. It represents the roots and the history of the nation. If you've ever been in a school, and I clearly shouldn't assume that you have, you'll have recited an anthem, a pledge of allegiance, or something similar depending on where you're from. The connection being made there is between a nation and it's symbols, which among other things includes a flag.

So now that we have made the connection between flags, a nation, and it's government, all we need to do is look back a bit through the history books to see what acts of racism have been perpetuated in a given nation, where the government response has been silent, slow, or worse- enabling. At various points in history, in any given country, you can find examples of any of this. To say otherwise is ignorant and disrespectful, and when done deliberately is it's own form of racism. 

The only thing I'm assuming about you is that you're ignorant, dumb, or possibly both, but rest assured, unless you prove me wrong I don't think your ignorance is overt racism.
