Typically the victims in these cases are uneducated and unaware of their basic rights. For example it's common for employers to convince them they're doing something illegal by being in the country and they'll get the employee arrested and jailed for some made up reason. It's also true that often the victims come in on tourist visas and overstay.

I mean, anyone coming from rural India would probably laugh at the idea of minimum wage laws or just being able to expect action from the government in general.
