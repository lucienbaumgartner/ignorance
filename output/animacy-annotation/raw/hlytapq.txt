You didn't reject anything of mine. You spoke very highly of a terrible politician with a terrible record of judgments, words and actions. You condoned that. It was by your actions and words, and yours alone, that I judged you so harshly on, and even then only to the extent of what they implied.

I never claimed to know your person beyond what you put forth here.

Demonstrate your supposed intelligence by accepting the situation as it really is, rather than twisting it into a narrative that fits your victimized fantasies.

Again, you rejected nothing of mine because there was never opportunity to; we were *never* discussing my opinions or views. You lecture about assumptions, but look at how neatly you fit your own descriptions!

*You* put forth some of your opinions and views on a politician and on their political views and actions. *You* were rejected. *You* responded by using that rejection to fuel accusations of bigotry.

This is projection, plain and simple. Everything you are saying perfectly describes your own actions and words here, but you are so blind and unaware of yourself that you don't even see it. And instead of evaluating yourself, you scramble to build your case by simply making things up.

For example, please, tell us, what "slur" was used against you here? What "slur" did I call you? Or did that just sound so good and righteous in your head that you figured you would make the accusation anyways?

You are acting completely ridiculous. I would laugh if it was not so utterly embarrassing to watch.

You are more than welcome to excuse yourself here. Better to accept your faults, reflect and grow than to simply dig yourself a deeper hole out of spite and misplaced anger.
