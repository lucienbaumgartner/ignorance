He is acting like a 20 year old that's for sure. Completely unaware and lacking empathy of others. I'm not speaking about all 20 year olds, but if I saw this behaviour from someone your age, OP, I would be absolutely furious.  

 Despite that, you've learnt a lesson on how a guy his age can behave, and you very much didn't like what you saw. He acted on his own behalf before looking after the woman friend in his company.
