Tsk. Aruran already had a similar situation like this on when he happened to be streaming Apex legends roughly the same time that Ollie was streaming Apex. Several people from Ollie's stream began to raid Aruran's stream telling him to do an impromptu collab with Ollie. While Aruran eventually agreed to do so, it was the "fans" that initiated it, not Ollie. If Ollie contacted him first before the fans did, THEN Aruran would have been more comfortable in doing the collab. After the stream, Aruran went on twitter to remind people not to mention other streamers on his stream and that you should study the rules before calling yourself a "fan".

I'm all for Aruran collabing for Coco, but you should NEVER force the collab. It's like shoving a ball through a star-shaped hole. It won't fit, and neither side is going to be comfortable with it. Give them time, let them adjust and learn, and the collab will happen eventually.

Sadly the Holopro reddit community is but a small fraction of the many viewers of their streams who unfortunately will be too ignorant and unaware of the rules. I hope this does not affect the talents in the long run...
