To be fair both cyclists and motorists are guilty of bad road etiquette and at times, downright dangerous road use.

The number of cyclists using the roads has increased quite considerably during the pandemic and I have seen examples of some who have poor or no road-sense whatsoever and often ride side-by-side in pairs, well out of any designated cycle lane or away from the side. Some people also ride right into the middle of the road and have no idea there's any traffic around them or the dangers of riding on a road and amongst traffic (especially on country roads where they seem to have no clue what kinds of speeds vehicles can whizz by at).

People can be very selfish, arrogant and unaware of the dangers they are putting others in irrespective of what mode of transport they use but equally so, some people can be very courteous and aware of what's around them and drive/ride accordingly.

I think these days you just have to be extra careful when on public roads.
