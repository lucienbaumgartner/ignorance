My statement does not address inherentcy nor learned behavior. My statement is an observation of their current behavior that demonstrates their base urge which reflects a selfishness. Whether or not that selfishness is learned or inherent is a deeper discussion.

I agree that society, bith current and previous teaches men to be selfish and unaware of the need to respect the other party; however, that does not dimish the fact that many only want a warm hole in which to relieve themselves.
