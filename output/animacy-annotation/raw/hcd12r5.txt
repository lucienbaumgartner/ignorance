I’m pretty sick of the loud assholes running the show and throwing sticks in the spokes just to shout “see how bad the car is!!?”

Too bad it’s not more deadly. Let’s go delta! But it’s enough for Texas and Florida to both lose their gop majority

They wanted a civil war. By politicizing the virus and being duckwits, they got it. And are losing far more constituents than a guns war would take.
