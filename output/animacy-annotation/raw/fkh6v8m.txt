I agree.  But it’s not reality.  Reality is people don’t act responsibly.  People aren’t bad but the vast majority are ignorant of the situation.

I wore my N99 mask out earlier to get cash for the home 2 blocks away.  People looked at me like an alien.  One guy laughed and coughed without covering his mouth.  Was it on purpose?  No clue.

People are selfish and ignorant that mask protected him as much as myself.  And in 10 days?  People will wish they had prepared by obtaining the same mask.
