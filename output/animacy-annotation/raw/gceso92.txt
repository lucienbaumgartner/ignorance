 I watched the video you are referring too, and honestly, he really didn't. I don't know any breadtuber that would disagree with his reading of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific on the problems of capitalism. People like Vaush wouldn't like the conclusion of how to fix those problems, but Vaush is one fucking dipshit. When he talks about how people say he is a socialists, yet he has a job, or yet he has fancy shoes, or whatever. I really fucking doubt that those were coming from leftists, and especially from breadtubers. It seems more like he got in arguments with liberals online who said dumb liberal shit, and he is ascribing that to breadtubers. Even radlibs like contra would not really disagree with most of what he is saying. When he goes on assumptions about how these breadtubers are an implied CIA plant, he is just getting delusional. Liberals and radlibs are not a CIA plant, people can just be dumb and ignorant. That really gets to the point of why I personally don't like Maupin, most of what he talks about is just normal stuff, and no one on the left really disagrees with him. And even the topics I disagree with him on, like a few small things, but mainly on the subject of the modern Chinese state, I could look past. It’s the totems he makes of his enemies on the “left”, built from a mess of interacting with different people online, and his inability to see nuance in modern politics that makes what he does fall short of a good point.
