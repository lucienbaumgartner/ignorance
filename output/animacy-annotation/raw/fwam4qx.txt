He plays a game where he provides just enough cover for people to attribute the cause of his actions and stupidity and not malice. 

So we are supposed to be ok with the notion that the president is tweet white supremacy messages because he is so impulsive and ignorant that he doesn’t even watch the full video of shit he tweets.

That is only ok when lined up against the notion that he is an actual, malicious white supremacist.

So we are supposed to be fine that he is propagating a white nationalist message because he is too incompetent to watch a full 30 second video before tweeting it.

That’s where we are at.

The options are he promotes white nationalism out of stupidity or that he is actually a white supremacists knowingly and maliciously doing this. 

All his supporters will say is that he didn’t knowingly and maliciously so this.

Whether that is the case, and I don’t think it is, we are supposed to be ok with him literally tweet Nazi shit out of stupidity and carelessness? I would get fired for being that careless. I’d get thrown out of my school.

If this was one instance then maybe I’d believe the stupidity notion. But he just tweet Nazi shit like a week who. was censured on Facebook and twitter for it. Has done it many times. Remember when someone got him to retweet a Mussolini quote?

You would think that someone who supposedly keeps being mischaracterized as a Nazi, would be more conscientious about the things they tweet.

But since he isn’t, it really just leads me to believe that this is all on purpose and this is his message.
