It seems you have a pretty agitated sleep. Any chances you might have been a bit too active during your sleep and have hurt yourself somehow? It's not that hard to make yourself some bruises at night if you're moving a lot.

About the cuts, I have seen many people here reporting about cuts appearing suddenly when then wake up. They all have in common these cuts appearing **during the night**. So I guess there might be something you all have in common that you're doing during your deep sleep phases (when you're fully asleep and unaware of what your body could possibly do).

That would also correlate with these figures you saw, heard or feelings that your bed is shaking : I think you might have sleep disorders. Something like hypnagogia ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia)) or false awakenings ([there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_awakening)) It happens a lot if you're nervous or have an agitated sleep.

Is there someone sleeping with you or in the same house who could report what you're doing when you're sleeping?
