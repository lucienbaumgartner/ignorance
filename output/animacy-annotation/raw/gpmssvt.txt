Lol this sub is an absolute Cesspool, thanks for the karma guys! I was genuinely curious and ignorant of the issue beyond headlines, so thanks for the answer. 

If you pay attention to the language used in the article it doesn't sound like Biden has done shit yet about this issue. A lot of "some families" and "may be allowed" thrown around. I understand that he may follow through on this, and that it may take years to reunite some families, but the same pictures comparing these facilities to holocaust camps can be made today. Yes Trump is a shitter, but that doesn't mean you can't criticize Biden. AOC criticized Biden on this very issue.
