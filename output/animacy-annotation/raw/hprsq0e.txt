I’m glad that they’re happy and moved on. But the majority of people would rather get an abortion due to guilt or other reasons, not denying some people do the opposite as my old friend was one of them. And you say you don’t throw away kids and raise them? You’re 50 you say, remember back then when abusing and neglecting your child was the norm and was encouraged even today you guys still want that? Is that taking care of life for you? Ignorant and mindless folk like you shouldn’t be the ones born, astonishing how you made it past childhood with a logic so flawed and broken. You wake the fuck up, I hope you never heated children whom have experienced your ignorance
