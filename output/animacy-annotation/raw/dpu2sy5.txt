The thing is most hunters no matter what animal they are hunting will all ways work to make the first shot count as it will be the only time you have the animal unaware and vulnerable. After this the animal will either try and run or will fight and then you have an issue

This would be the same (if not more so) for a Monster Hunter considering the dangers they would face, so my advice would be one of two things:

1) Use the Sniper Archtype for Slayer, build a character around it. It's not a bad archetype imo and it can be quite flavourful depending how you run it (a hunter who aims to kill in one hit to prevent suffering of the spirit for example)

2) Play an Inquisitor, dedicate yourself to an Ideal (Hunting Monsters to protect the innocent) and pick a domain to match, Bane works with Ranged attacks and the Inquisitor is all about tracking. Add in 6th level divine casting to help shore up that side of things and your good to go.
