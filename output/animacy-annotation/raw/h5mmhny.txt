Sometimes.

It's normal for people to be genuinely aloof and unaware that they're crossing the line. Where it becomes problematic is when those people aren't willing to change their behavior when asked.

'No' is a complete sentence.  It is valid and acceptable. You are a person, worthy of basic respect no matter your age. It's your parents' job to teach that to you, to help you grow strong and independent with a healthy sense of self, and by disregarding whatever it is you want them to do for you, they undermine that development.

Edit: I looked at your post history. If you're old enough to decide on med school, you're old enough to self-determine.
