Not really. They have rigged the game such that the person who tries to follow the rules can only lose. There are no more precedents and they burned the rule books. 

If Dems turn around and abuse this back, even to try and course correct they would only be painted as hypocrites and republicans won't hesitate to call them out on every little thing like they always have. It's a race to the bottom, and their base is so unscrupulous and ignorant that it will believe anything they feed it.
