&gt; I will also say that, Richard Dawkins, five years after the quote you provided, compared trans women to the idea of a white woman wearing blackface insisting that she's black.

If he did that, then that's really wrong, stupid, and ignorant of him to have done so.

It really misses the nuances involved in the 2 issues.
