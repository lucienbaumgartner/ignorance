&gt;	It isn't fair to compare early feminism (19th century-early 20th century) with modern feminism. Early feminists had clear goals: to obtain women's rights by law (voting rights, equal pay, etc..). Now these laws are all in place (in the west and the majority of Asian countries). So modern feminists (in countries where women are equal infront of the law) can only tackle cultural issues.

Big disagree. But then you’ve already stated you’re uninformed about the movement so I’m not surprised. We can’t help those who won’t help themselves. 

It doesn’t seem like you’ve followed my advice. That one month free trial of Google search is waiting for you. Goals are specific to each feminist organization and grassroots movement so you’re going to have to look it up. 

Feminism is bigger now than it was in the first wave and doesn’t have the “advantage” of being sanitized and condensed to a soundbite by decrepit male textbook authors so I get why someone with little knowledge of the movement would be completely unaware of the different goals. 

I personally wouldn’t want to embarrass myself by continuing to prove myself wholly uninformed and ignorant of the subject I’m discussing online, so I probably would have informed myself at this point, but you do you. 

Again, we can’t help those who don’t help themselves so until you inform yourself there’s really nothing we can do.
