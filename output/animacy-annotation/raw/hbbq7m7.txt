Persons who are having audio/visual hallucinations don't look like they are in wonderland after coming out of dental surgery. They for the most part believe what they are seeing and it is overlaid on reality. One of the most common triggers for an outburst is that other people are failing to react to what is happening. So a person with schizoaffective disorder might truly believe there are demons in the room but they are going to be staring at and reacting to those demons not trying to look disconnected and unaware of their surroundings. They also tend to cling hard to proof of reality to prove it. If he was having a true delusional episode he'd be gripping the phone. The desk. His clothes. Asking demand questions and trying to prove falsehoods. Again not disconnected and airy. The people that do look like that are heavily sedated and generally not in an active episode or are high. That seems unlikely given that he had an appearance today and being that out of it would be noticed by officials who would have some very tough questions for staff. I'm sure he was tested in medical to determine.
