People honestly don’t know our history. I told a 49 yr old white man that works in my office that slaves weren’t allowed to learn to read or write as a way of keeping them isolated and ignorant of their general location to keep them confused if they tried to run away. Simple premise really when you realize they were kidnapped and sent to a continent they’ve never been to. Can’t go home if you can’t find it. Guy I told this to was blown away by something I knew as a child and thought everyone knew. Now I know better, our schools don’t teach the totality of what slavery was. Or the aftermath of when it was repealed, George Floyd is not an accident, he was the intended goal.
