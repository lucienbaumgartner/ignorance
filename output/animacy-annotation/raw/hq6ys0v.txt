Even after all of this, you're still choosing to be an ignorant and immature kid. You haven't done jack shit in this argument. You started this argument just to waste my time. You have yet to prove you're right. You're instead just showing me links of articles made by people who don't work at Disney nor Sony. Why aren't you not understanding that?! You need serious help, kid. I'm actually worried about you.
