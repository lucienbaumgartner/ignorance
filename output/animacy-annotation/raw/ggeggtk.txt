You do realize that Zhongli is now the best damage mitigator in the game, right? An HP build Zhong before could mitigate 20k+ damage. Now with a built in **150%** dmg absorption to all types, you get to negate 30,000 damage every 12 seconds. Can your healer give you 30,000 health every 12 seconds???? Zhongli also can petrify for 4 seconds, mitigating more potential damage and also allowing you to attack freely or reposition. He’s easily the best mitigator (counting both healers and tanks). S tier 5 star now 100%, and anyone telling you he’s not is blind and unaware of his practical strength.
