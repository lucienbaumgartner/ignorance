I remember when they kept trying to make Lena Dunham into a feminist cultural hero and every woman of color kept saying she was vile and problematic and they kept being dismissive. A decade later and now they see how absolutely disgusting and ignorant that woman is (her sexually predatory behavior, racism, rape apologia, and misogyny is now IMPOSSIBLE to ignore). But I think because she isn't conventionally attractive and she got a hollywood platform she immediately got a pass. Judging women solely by their look and not by the content of their character is sexism, even if it's sexism in favor of less conventionally attractive women.
