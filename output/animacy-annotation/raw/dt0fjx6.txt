What the Podesta email quote implies

&gt;conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry

is that the political class don't just view their constituents as

&gt;not smart enough to run your own life so weâ€™ll do it for you

but the political class actively conspires to make that so.  It is a goal, not an observation.
