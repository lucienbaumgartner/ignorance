What in the actual fuck? How the hell could messenger rna alter dna? Do you even know the difference between rna and dna? What are the types of rna besides mrna that are in your body and how are they used? Easy question that I would be willing to bet a hefty sum you know nothing about. This has to be one of the most ignorant and incoherent comments I have seen this month. A little reading is not what you need. You need a whole lot of reading to get past your fifth grade mentality.
