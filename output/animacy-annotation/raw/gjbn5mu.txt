Thank you so much. Another insightful answer from you. I wholeheartedly agree with everything you say. So many good questions. I think people just get so swept up over things to find meaning. But from a Christian standpoint, I feel like we already have all the right meaning. We are not to be ignorant and unaware of evil in the world, but that's not something we should be giving power to I feel.
