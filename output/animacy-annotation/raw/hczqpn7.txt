This is complete BS moral panic...   It's a book of writing prompts, it doesn't mean the teachers were chosing those ones or forcing anything on the kids.

Also, all those ones that are listed are ABSOLUTELY the type stuff teens are thinking/talking about anyway. Murder podcasts are like the most popular genre of podcasts, and sex always has been, and always will be, a topic of interest to teens.  Pretending they are completely innocent and unaware of the topics does more harm than good.  Teach them to discuss the topics with grace and have healthy conversation, don't hide from what they have in thier minds and let them make up their own unhealthy ways of dealing with the topics.
