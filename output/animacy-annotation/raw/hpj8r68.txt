It’s really annoying how hard you are trying to defend a pedophile. 

There isn’t any evidence of most rapes or sexual assaults, if you were in charge of our Justice system then I shudder to think of the world that you’re ignorant and naive viewpoint creates. 

The girl is WELL DOCUMENTED to be telling the truth about many aspects of her life; she WAS a baby groupie, she DID have sex with many older rock stars and hang out with them (there are photos), and her timeline for the accusations has always lined up. 

There is nothing pointing towards her claim being untrue (she didn’t even make it as an accusation but a brag, she’s on record saying she doesn’t regret having sex with him, so she’s not trying to demonize or attack him with a false accusation) except your stupid belief that if explicit video of it happening doesn’t exist, then it didn’t happen. 

All of the facts lead to a basic conclusion; David Bowie was a sex pest. He frequently would see or meet women and make statements such as “she’s mine”. He would have threesomes or even orgy’s and was a serial cheater; literally sometimes cheating on 3 or more people at a time. 

He developed an immense cocaine habit which, and in his own words, “lead to blacking out for days or weeks at a time”, even he self admitted that he didn’t remember writing an entire album because he was so high. 

His sanity began to slip. He became an advocate for fascism and developed a fixation on “hitler’s narcism”. 

He crossed the age barrier at least once in his life with Dana Gilliespie (14-17).

So take a sex addict, give him a raging ego complex; give him a crippling drug addiction and hand him a girl who is the miniature image of his future wife (iman). 

It’s very easy to connect the dots, only someone who wants to bury their head in the sand like you would so strongly believe otherwise in the face of all these factors.
