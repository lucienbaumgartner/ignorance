With all due respect, the GOP disrespected voters.

Gerrymandering run amok, voter suppression, voter roll purges, and lies, lies, lies, and goddamned lies, are standard GOP tactics.

The GOP has been pursuing an autocracy of the minority for decades.  Mitt cannot be simultaneously competent and unaware of this.

Mitt Romney is either incompetent, a disingenuous liar, or both.
