That's terrible and ignorant that the neuro laughed at you! Anesthesia can do weird things to brains. I used to be a neurofeedback practitioner and one of the intake questions was if someone had ever had general anesthesia because of its possible effects on the brain.   


I would look into finding a functional neurologist. People with this training are trained to find and treat things that regular neurologists aren't- they're often chiropractors, but functional neurology doesn't involve spinal manipulation. IANFR would be a site to look at practitioners:
