Ok

This is a first amendment audit 


They are becoming more and more common through cop watch communities 

Any space that you or I can access to get forms or the like ( open to the public/viewable to the public) is fair game to film through first amendment 

My cousin who lives in Portland sends me shit like this all the time and traditionally they are more provocative or whiny 

Both the city engineer and the county officer who placed hands on the guy filming are in the wrong 

If this guy doesnâ€™t sue the city. The city should use this as an opportunity to teach its employees. First amendment auditors all stick together if they see a place received a reaction they will return and be far more provocative ( without breaking laws) seeking bigger reactions.


Yes I think there are better ways to spend ones time 


But I also believe our area is ripe with corruption and nepotism 

In this past elections I was removed from the voting polls for asking that the guy campaigning and the woman campaigning as well as the signs that were closer then 50 feet all be removed 

I called the police because the poll worker was putting hands on me

And the cops made me leave and did nothing to enforce the rules 

Most of the public employees in this county are old and unaware that they are here to serve the public and not to insulate and protect the government from the public 



As far as a number one through ten on how crazy this individual is

I would say a 3 just crazy enough to test his rights but not crazy enough to stand his ground and risk jail time over this

I am thankful there are crazy folk out there still to keep those who serve the public in line and accountable
