I’m so sorry you went through that.
It is so short-sighted and ignorant of these parents and pretty much guarantees that their children won’t come and talk to them if they get into difficulties in a sexual relationship. 
My son has had this vaccine because it’s important that he also protects his future partners from this (assuming his future partners are female). As far as I’m aware it hasn’t made him rush out and have sex with every girl he meets.
