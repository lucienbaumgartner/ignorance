I’m saying it like it is. If someone acts with a flag, they’re acting under that flag whether sanctioned by masses or not. 

There are people who walk around in riot gear under the name antifa and of those there are minorities that act violently under the name of the cause. 

Never said it was centralized bud. One of the biggest problems facing america is the inability to think rationally. No, it’s nothing like Trump and many others proposed, but there are those who act in vain under the name BLM and there are those who do it under antifa. The world is full of people acting under misnomers, and others politically charge this by grouping everyone in or out of a category. It is a thing, and especially with decentralized organizations one must remember that they are exactly that, decentralized and bottom up. 

but “there is no such thing as antifa” is patently false and ignorant of you to believe. Take things as they are, don’t abide by your knee jerk anti conservative reactions, not a path to the high road in terms of efficacy. Progress is made through mindfulness and thoughtful consideration, not with stupidly false statements that don’t mean to imply what they say.
