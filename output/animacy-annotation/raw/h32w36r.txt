Rude awakening in that part of her kit has issues. No doubt ppl will still use her, (simps are gonna simp) but seeing she's been the most hyped character since beta outside of Xiao, can't say a 'majority' of ppl will be content if a situational/conditional Q is a part of the culmination of all their time, patience and savings (if they're going into 2.0 blind and unaware of the leaks.) Just feels like another Zhongli storm is coming. Take Childe for example, good character overall but his E handicaps him. Yes, Childe mains exist,  but I rarely ever see them. Albedo is another a great character I enjoy using, but his ult also suffers if particular conditions aren't met. Novelty only lasts for so long.
