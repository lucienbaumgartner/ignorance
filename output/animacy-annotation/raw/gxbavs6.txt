Ah yes... youtube videos... doing what science cant 

One thing that makes depression very difficult to manage is when you are dealing with people that have never experience depression.  They really aren’t being bad or uncaring they just have no idea what you are actually going through and the only experience they have to compare is not even relevant.  

I am saying this as someone who developed depression later in life.  Before it hit me I had the same attitude as your parents.  I know the place I was coming from wasnt one of malice or actually lacking empathy.  I was simply ignorant and unaware of my place of privilege not having an issue that affects the very core of our human wiring.  Now that I’ve gone through it I’m horrified at the way I tried to “help” friends.  Horrified enough that I had to reach out to people I hadn’t spoken to in years to apologize for the abysmal way I treated them. 

What I’m saying doesn’t excuse what they are doing.  Those actions are hurting you not helping you.  The only possible way to get them to understand without having them go through it themselves will be through the help of an educated professional.  

The most important thing you can do for yourself is to get help from a doctor, councilor, and build up a support system.
