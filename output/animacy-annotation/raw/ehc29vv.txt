Yup. It cracks me up tho each time I see people say yeah trust him it’s perfectly normal. Some people are capable of having platonic relationships etc. and “oh all the people posting here have severe trust issues”. 

All of that bs are basically famous last words.  

I’m not saying don’t trust him but boundaries have to be set some way. And **studies show that the affairs with coworkers and friends all started as platonic relationships where neither of the two had any intention of cheating**. 

People are just deluded thinking they can vouch for other people including their SO. My favorite is when THEY think they could have a completely platonic experience with an opposite sex simply because they haven’t been tempted yet.  They just haven’t met the right combination of the opposite sex that will make even them tempted.  

Now, the good person will notice this and they themselves will pull out of that relationship and set boundaries to prevent it from getting further. **This is where the trust lies. You trust your partner to stop it before it gets further.  That’s perfect.  Crushes and infatuation and finding others attractive sexually is perfectly normal. Not letting it get further is the hard part that many people fail at**. 

But, don’t be so naive and ignorant that you believe opposite sex friendships that spend time together and confide in each other are just purely platonic down the road without making sure it stays that way.
