dude, there’s sooooo much more going on in her head than “fuck u im not going to take my meds” which it seems you clearly do not understand. the way you’re approaching it is so self absorbed, obviously it isn’t easy to deal with, but she’s the one going through a SERIOUS medical issue. it’s fine to distance yourself from her, but shaming her for something entirely out of her control is ignorant and disgusting
