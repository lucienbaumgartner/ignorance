&gt; "Well you married a woman so that's obviously where the phase ended".

Oof. "Well, you got married, so obviously you'll never again be attracted to another woman besides your wife. Oh, that's *not* how it works, is it?"

Or - "I'm going to walk away and give you a minute to think about how rude and ignorant that statement was."

If I had a nickle for every rude and presumptuous statement I've heard regarding my bisexuality, I'd be a rich man. I know it hurts and is aggravating, but please consider this: Your sexuality is *yours*...it does not require other people's validation. *You* know you had those relationships, and *you* know what they meant to you (and your partner knows, and accepts it. Which is huge.) When people make statements like this guy's, it's their own ignorance on display. I'm so sorry you've been dealing with this. Be strong in your self-knowledge!
