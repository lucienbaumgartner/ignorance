Partly this is not your fault. Core part of the game did nothing to teach mechanics properly and even worse, made you numb and unaware of how to play your character. Many people experience this frustration when moving to HoT for the first time.

All I can say - be patient, learn the mechanics and remember the moment when you beat him, because this is what gaming is about :)
