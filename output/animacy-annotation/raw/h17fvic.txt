The goal line is a specific thing though, I totally agree that robotic refs will be making out of bounds calls, shot clock violations, _ second violations, backcourt violations and ruling on 2/3 point questions very soon. Those are all matters of objective fact.

What is the objective ruling for whether a player is "set"? The rules for a screen are as follows.

&gt; A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.

&gt; In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be. This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.

What is a "normal step"? Some of these guys take massive strides, so according to the rule book and screen set for Jokic would have to be at least three or four feet away from the defender while one set for Murray could be half the distance.

What is "an opportunity to avoid contact"? If a defender just doesn't look at the screen then it's a foul according to the rulebook. Does Ryan Anderson being defender necessitate screens be set further away since it takes him longer to avoid contact?

Fouls in basketball are mainly subjective rulings, that's why everyone gets pissed off. Robotic refereeing isn't impossible, but it would take totally rewriting the entire rulebook because the rules contain language that makes an artifical intelligence calling the fouls literally impossible.
