I'm often careless and unaware of my environment so I've gotten quite some 'stupid' scars (mostly because of burns). 

 Simple things like trying to flip an omelette and somehow touching the pan (didn't feel anything). Afterwards I saw a line/burn scar on my hand and was like WTF is this?!?

 Bigger scars because I was walking and accidentally touched the engine of a motorcycle that was parked on the pavement (gotta love the law of small countries that does nothing about it). Whether because it was summer or because it hadn't been long since the owner had gotten off, the engine was still hot. At first I just felt that I touched/my skin got stuck on something for a bit and not long after, I had this tingling/burning sensation on my leg, then it started swelling and a week or two later, I was left with a scar.
