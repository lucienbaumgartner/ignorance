I believe she has just taken a bunch of ambien (spelling?) or something so she sounded completely unaware and unaffected by what she had just done or what was going on. 

Her mother ends up coming in the house halfway through and picks up the phone and goes to see the kids... itâ€™s awful. 

The initial quote from the mom in the 911 call in the linked article and the mention of the husband asleep in the basement makes me think it was the same lady.
