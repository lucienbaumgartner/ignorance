You don’t care to argue yet here you are…. It’s okay, I’ll watch. 

Starters, being problematic for being an entitled  cow is very different to being problematic because  you make ignorant and racist comments. 

Next, Brandi might’ve been well liked for being relatable and this is maybe because again BH is a different ball game, different stakes and i audience. With Melbourne the procures, the casts and the high society are different and. clearly Anjali couldn’t keep up. That’s it. Ain’t that deep, don’t have to insult people and their abilities. 

Take care love z
