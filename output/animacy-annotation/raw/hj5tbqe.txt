I think it’s commercial fishing that has the highest mortality rate of any job besides the military so that’s the worst civilian job.

Anything that involves killing another human being will always be the hardest, the closer and more gruesome the harder it gets, so I’d say a marksman in the military is the hardest job. You have to shoot people who look casual or unaware and unable to hurt you. That takes some balls that are needed to save the rest of your buddies.

I have a great deal of respect for people in the military. I love to chat up veterans whenever I get the chance.
