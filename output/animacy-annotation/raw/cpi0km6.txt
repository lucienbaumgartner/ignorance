I have a buddy who works with police k9s in La, the drug dogs there are trained to sit and wait for the handler to acknowledge them when they get a "hit" on the scent they're looking for. 
This mostly serves the purpose of keeping people/the situation calm and unaware that the dog has found something. 

If the dog was barking at you personally, it's probably because he was bored and was hoping to get a reaction from you. so many of those dogs are kenneled when not "working" that they start to get a little stircrazy and have all kinds of weird behaviors you don't see in socialized house pets.
