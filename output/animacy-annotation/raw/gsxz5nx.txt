If you did any research outside of facebook you would know that many countries had no lockdowns at all and implemented mask mandates early on and are already essentially over the virus.

If americans and others were capable of universal mask usage and social distancing there would be no need for damaging lockdowns.

Stop crying fascism whenever something you don't like happens it makes you sound very entitled and unaware of reality.
