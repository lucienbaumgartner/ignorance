While I agree sexual orientation has nothing to do with CRT, I keep getting this feeling that the left’s defense against all of this is to just have a constantly evolving definition of what CRT is so no one can actually pin down a specific point they don’t want taught in schools that falls under the CRT label. 

I am reminded of an anti-CRT law that was being debated in Tennessee, I believe. There were a few left news articles about how it was outrageous and ignorant that Tennessee was going to ban CRT. Then some right counter articles came out that specifically listed what was being banned by the legislature, and it actually seemed like a not horrible proposal. That was then countered with some more left articles pointing out that the things being banned were a bastardization and false representation of CRT in the first place (which is to say that the Tennessee legislature wasn’t actually banning CRT at all). 

If whatever these people are protesting against isn’t actually CRT, I don’t totally understand why CRT proponents care? If the endgame is to ban a bunch of objectionable things that aren’t actually CRT, is there an inherent problem with that, even if people aren’t getting the nomenclature exactly right? It would seem like you have safe harbor to functionally teach CRT at that point anyway.
