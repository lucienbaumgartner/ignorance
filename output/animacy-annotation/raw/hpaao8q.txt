Interesting way to destroy all nuanced conversation. Good luck forming a solid point of view based in reality. I understand some people are stupid as hell and say ignorant and offensive things but to paint such a broad outline of what you deem misogyny is just as ignorant and dangerous to anyone with the ability to think freely. 

Feel free to report or block me for my comment but please try to consider the flaws in that kind of approach. It's the mentality that has created a lot of echo chambers that has impacted on basic critical thinking.

Also I'm not "pro-life" or "anti-women" at all, I just know the topic does have nuance and ignoring that is dangerous. Just as it is with so many sensitive topics in this world.
