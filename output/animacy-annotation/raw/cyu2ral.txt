What a naive and ignorant statement, it's like I'm watching Fox News in the early 80s.

Suppression of information is part of every system of governance ever. It has nothing to do with socialism, it has everything to do with keeping people unaware and uninterested in things the people in power (read: the group that claims a monopoly on violence in a region) don't want them to be interested in. Suppression of information is a massive enterprise in good ol capitalist USA too.
