He is the most unintentionally hilarious individual in existence. Some of the things he has said could not be written by even the funniest people of all time all put in one room together. A true idiot savant in that regard. The only thing I might get angry at is his recent transphobia, but even then he's so hilariously misinformed and ignorant that I don't think he's legitimately transphobic so much as just an colossal dumbass who is just ignorant and misinformed by whatever incel youtubers he's been watching that week.
