&gt;makes me seriously question your ability to understand social interactions in real life.

Once again, I can use your same arguments against you.

Each person is different from another, not everyone has to have the same opinion or and it's okay. Do you force your quiet friend to speak a the time? Do you force someone in class to participate? Do you force everyone to take what you think as granted? ( This last one might be true ) 

I think the only one here that doesn't understand social behavior here is you.


&gt;Do you actually think yours was an appropriate response to someone sharing something they're excited about?

I did, my response was brief and to the point. This is what forums are for. Some agree, others don't.


&gt;The appropriate response is to either say nothing and move on if you don't agree

Like you right now, I assume.

&gt;This is not a contribution, it's detracting from the point of the post and fucking annoying

The irony of the comment



&gt;while being generally rude and unaware of the way they portray themselves are likely the most insufferable people

Point me out exactly where was I rude. The only one here insulting is you.

This is turning into a comedy.
