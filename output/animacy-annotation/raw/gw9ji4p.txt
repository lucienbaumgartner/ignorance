You claiming victory over this argument is the most hilarious and absurd thing I’ve ever heard. Bungie hasn’t sided with you, and you thinking that shows how insanely delusional you are. Bungie sided with me, and that’s clear because they haven’t undone the sunsetting that has happened. Because (big shocker I need to repeat myself yet again) I support the sunsetting of sunsetting, because the system of sunsetting they created was not viable in the long term.
Thank god they sunset all the year 1-3 weapons, because otherwise the game would’ve power creeped to infinity with none of the new content being exciting or fun to play. I’m so glad that unaware and inexperienced people like you have no impact on how the game develops.
I genuinely hope your single brain cell finally multiplies so that you might be able to understand both this debate, as well as future debates.
Overall I give you a 4.5/10 lots of perseverance, but the stupidity really knocked you down. Better luck next time.
