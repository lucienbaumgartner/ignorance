They/them has been used for a single person of unknown gender since the 14th century, and has been expanded in the last few decades to also apply to single individuals of a known gender if that known gender is not male or female. It's acknowledged by the major dictionaries. It's not any more of a made up word than any other word in any language (I mean, we made them all up at some point). 

You're being ignorant and confrontational, and your hate crime comment is a very obvious straw man. If you don't want to use people's correct pronouns, you do you. But please understand that non binary people are not going to choose to be acquainted with you. To me, that sounds like quite the loss.
