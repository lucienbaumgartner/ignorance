Hell no

NTA

Any mother who body shames their kid is disgusting, narrow-minded, ignorant, and just horrible. You're not ungrateful because you have body issues, she MADE you that way from what you said. I think you should try to do your best to distance yourself from her and maybe talk to a counselor about your issues, and how best to work through them. But staying with her and her negative opinions is something that will only continue to affect you for the worse in the long run, I'm afraid. Stay safe, happy holidays, and please if you can try to get help soon.
