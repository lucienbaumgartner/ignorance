i was referring to the original comment that reads as follows:

”The Democrats are holding the government back just as much as the Republicans. Everyone wants to blame Trump but Democrats could just as easily let the government workers start getting paid again. It's caused by both sides. Just because you agree with a side doesn't mean that they aren't continuing to keep the Gov. shut down going.


The *ESSENCE* of the shutdown necessitates that *BOTH* sides are shutting it down. I'm not going to try to swing one side as right, but you can't say its just one side, much less one man, keeping money from the worker's pockets. It's just biased and ignorant.”

that is not an objectively false claim, certainly not as objectively false as “the sky is green”. you’re straw manning an argument so you can feel righteous enough to say it’s not an opinion worth your time. 

if claiming that a gov. shutdown is not *entirely* the fault of the president is such an absurdly stupid and false thing to say then surely it’s easy to explain in a few short sentences. 

they’re in a stalemate where he’s asking for 5 billion dollars (down from his initial 25 billion dollar request, quite the compromise if you ask me) to build a barrier that will deter illegal immigration. we have an almost 4 trillion dollar yearly budget, it’s not unreasonable to say that the democrats could end this and are *at least* 1% at fault. 

it’s so dishonest to say this is as ludicrous a statement as “the sky is green”.
