I don’t think it’s belittling someone’s pain to point out how hard it is to deal with other people belittling your pain.

“oh you have Crohns? I had norovirus once so I totally understand.“

To be annoyed by that is not to belittle norovirus or the pain of that, it’s annoyed with comparing your pain to someone else’s in order to relate - but that statement actually shows no ability to relate at all. It’s a socially awkward, unintentional way of bringing the focus back to yourself. It’s not relating or empathizing, it’s actually belittling the pain of others through comparison and is quite selfish - and yes, totally unaware and innocent. The person doesn’t mean to be rude, but they are. The impact not the intent, is annoying.

I have a friend with colon cancer, I would never say, oh, I have Crohn’s so I totally understand. NOR would I say to a friend with norovirus, I have Crohn’s, as if it’s contest. Don’t compare. Just say, say, “how are you feeling today? I bet that was really awful.”

complaining here to others who understand, actually might help someone respond more graciously to that kind of behavior irl. it is well-intended but awkward, easy to move on from. But it irks when we suffer in silence so much of the time.
