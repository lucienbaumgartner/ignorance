Obama must have driven the racists absolutely nuts.  They couldn't attack his character because it's unassailable.  Barack was everything an American President ought to be in terms of his comportment, empathy, humor, attitude and intelligence.

However, that fact that he is black is just not acceptable to anyone who grew up hating people solely for their skin color because it's the only thing that gives their lives value.

Imagine that.  Imagine being so insecure AND ignorant that you have to rely on hating total strangers in the most superficial sense just to get through the day.

Sad!
