In a world where 99% are animal haters and lack common sense (as is by your statements), what privilege do you think you have to even be respected if you are:

1. Unaware and ignorant of laws but want to confront someone because you "feel" about something. Remember, that's the exact sentiment that is turning this country to trash. I live by laws and I am responsible, if you assume otherwise, you are wrong. Own it and move on. If I am a lawful citizen, I hold no responsibility to answer you. That's what I wrote in my first message. People like you form mobs against lawful citizens. You are free to call the police on me and I'm more than happy to pay the price if I am wrong. Moral, personal, or assumed justice is stupid and is making people like me leave the country. People like make me question on why I continue to help citizens in need when you people aren't courteous enough to stay in your bounds?
2. Your hypotheticals were hyperbole. I don't/can't respect that. If I am following the law, and some ignorant fool is being a hyperbole - AM I SUPPOSED TO RESPECT THAT?
