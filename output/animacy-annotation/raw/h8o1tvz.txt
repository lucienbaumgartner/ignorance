Hey, make sure to mention that this really damaged your trust with her. (read your comments with the other person!) That's a severe misunderstanding and incredibly thoughtless. :I Maybe she was trying to push you, but this was not the thing to push you on, and she didn't stop either. Hurtful, inconsiderate, and ignorant of your feelings. That's never something therapists should be :( I hope you bringing it up goes well. Best of luck &lt;3
