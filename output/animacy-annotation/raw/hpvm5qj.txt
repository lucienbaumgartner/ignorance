Please don't make claims like that about crossdressing. A lot of closeted or questioning trans women (and trans men, and nonbinary folk, etc) cross-dress for many reasons. You can't claim it's a fetish, that's really hurtful to a lot of people, it's ignorant and disingenuous. You have no way of having the omniscient knowledge required to make such a claim in the first place. Don't use TERF and/or reactionary talking points, that shit is dangerous and hurts individuals and our struggle as a whole.
