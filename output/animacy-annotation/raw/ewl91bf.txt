Sorry for being pedantic but Turalyon himself says he's only been fighting for around 1 thousand years. Still though, you're super right about 10k being used a lot in WoW.

Unrelated but also, in case you're unaware and curious about how Turalyon could fight for a thousand years but he's a human and has only been missing for like 40 years, there's an audio drama that explains it but the short answer is that the flow of time in the twisting nether is really janky and Xera made him effectively immortal.
