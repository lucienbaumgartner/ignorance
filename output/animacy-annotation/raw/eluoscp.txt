Yep that certainly sounds pretty different to the situation over here. I wonder if that's just because of how important football clubs have been to our societies historically. You tend to get looked down on if you're a glory hunting fan because for decades clubs have represented their immediate local areas. MK Dons are probably the most widely disliked team in England because they abandoned their local fans and moved away from the area, whereas it's not uncommon for the big American franchises to move around a bit, right?

Being a fan over here has traditionally often been more than just knowing about the team and loving them and foreign fans often seem completely unaware and sometimes disrespectful of that. Of course this is absolutely not always the case and I'm largely speaking in generalities.
