I ignored it because it's 100% irrelevant and ignorant of the facts. As you have ignored everything I have been saying.. And that's fine. You're coming to your conclusion on your own misguided speculation though, and no amount of posturing is going to change that. The mere fact that we don't know everything about the Star Wars universe means that we can't make definitive statements like "here is every time Anakin committed a war crime..." or "I struggle to believe there is no prohibition in the Republic on child murder" when there is nothing, I repeat, nothing that even outlines what can be considered a war crime and what is considered fair play. Also, just as an FYI, murdering civilians being trained to be soldiers in a war, in our reality, isn't a war crime, either. It's just a regular crime.
