Im sure yours did too, going far back enough. Dont sit on that horse too highly.

On my Dads side they did own one. Not proud of the fact, but it is what it is. Moms side was poor and couldnt afford slaves, so they fought in the war instead.

I find it sad and ignorant that folks will just virtue signal like hell over slavery, when it was west African warlords that sold people (POWs) into slavery in the first place. Dont you think thats a key missing component to the whole narrative? It was the original black-on-black crime. Why blame the buyer and not the seller?

Hey, personal question just so I can know who I am addressing. Are you an American communist?
