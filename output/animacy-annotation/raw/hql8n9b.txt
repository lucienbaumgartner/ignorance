I am a Black woman. I understand this article. I understand the tendency of media to not portray dark skin Black women with natural hair. I understand colorism. I have lived and understood this for years. I didn't need to read this article. You are still missing the point. You are extremely ignorant and clueless. Point, blank, period. You read one article. Stop.
