I try really hard to stay away from stupid who dont wear a mask. I find though that people who dont wear them are already so inconsiderate and unaware of their surroundings that they will walk right up to you, get as close as they can and look at you like you are the bad guy when you move away from them for the 5th time. I have yet to not have the maskless people around me not get as close to me as possible or block the only path entirely or just be inconsiderate.
