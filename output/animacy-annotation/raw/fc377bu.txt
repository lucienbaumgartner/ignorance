You're an idiot, the nativity scene was originally popularized in 13th century Italy which is still far enough from his life that there were likely very few accurate descriptions.

It's a scene for remembering the season, and wasn't created by people who are so shallow and ignorant that they need to make everything about race.

Shame on you for ignoring its merit in the interest of spewing self serving racially motivated crap.
