Two things:

&gt; The action, which Mr. Udall did not describe, took place after C.I.A. officials came to suspect that congressional staff members had gained unauthorized access to agency documents during the course of the Intelligence Committee’s years-long investigation into the detention and interrogation program. 

and also:

&gt; The Senate’s investigation into the C.I.A. program took four years to complete and cost more than $40 million, in part because the C.I.A. insisted that committee staff members be allowed to review classified cables only at a secure facility in Northern Virginia. And only after a group of outside contractors had reviewed the documents first.

Who is in charge here? One sees the real structure of the deep state at work, with the supposed elected leaders serving as a screen to justify the actions of the real power. Why else could Congress possibly gain unauthorized access to the work of the intelligence community?

This is the very classic case of the power shifting within the society. The USA is no longer run by the elected representatives, and the real powerholders are so used to the populace remaining calm and unaware that they're getting obvious and sloppy.

The outside contractors made sure the Senators didn't see anything the CIA didn't want them to see. Most powerful to least in this narrative: CIA -&gt; Contractors -&gt; Senate. 

Kudos to the NYT for revealing a glimpse of the power structure, sucks you had to bury the real story so deeply to get past censors.
