Not to mention the fact that, literally, everyone brings something to the table at their job.  If they didn't, they wouldn't be paid because that job wouldn't exist.

People need to cook at restaurants.  People need to work as cashiers.  I'm not saying everyone should be paid as well as surgeons, but the whole "bring something to the table" argument is so flawed and ignorant that it's barely even worth addressing unless the person saying it has some enough sway to actually fix the issue.
