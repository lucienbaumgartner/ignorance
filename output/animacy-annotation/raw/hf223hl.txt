Im the same way. My family is so so helpful and my MIL is not and drains me of ALL energy. Super sweet but literally needs constant reassurance and is so emotional and anxious and narrates her thoughts out loud in a stream of consciousness. My hubby and i are not having visitors at all for the first few weeks (or month or two who knows) but I am DREADING when my mil has to come and "meet" the baby for the first time. She will ask "how can I help" then make everything more trouble than its worth. Shes going to sob when she holds the baby which makes me so angry just thinking about. She was just here for onky 2 days and I am 37 weeks pregnant and ughhhh she drives me freaking insane!!!! I feel bad because she is sweet but just so unaware and annoying. Dreading sharing my baby with her. Soooo yeah, same boat albeit different reasons.
