Disliking ghetto culture (which most popular rap perpetuates) is not racist. And I do not mean rapping about your poverty or tough life. I mean being ghetto, as in selfish, ignorant, and hot tempered. Is that racist? I understand the effects of generational trauma and what it does, but most these rappers simply don’t. I don’t want to perpetuate and enable the recent low effort rap from rappers these days. Just sounds lazy and doesn’t flow at all anymore too.
