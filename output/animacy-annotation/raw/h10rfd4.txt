you argued one of my points and that somehow disproves everything I said? 

Maybe you should stop being so concerned with what others do with their body. This shit doesn't affect you in the slightest. We need herd immunity, not mass vaccination. 

So, before you get all righteous and think you've won this argument, you haven't proven anything to the contrary of what I said. 

I'm not on here to spread misinformation. I'm sharing what I have found. If you have information to prove the contrary, great. Like I said, I'll look at it. But to think that your 3 links are going to convince me to go get this bullshit vaccine is insanely naive and ignorant of you.
