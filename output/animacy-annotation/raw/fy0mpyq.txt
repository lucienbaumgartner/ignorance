Yeah I know, it's just that some people are too stupid and ignorant that they don't even bother to understand what they're arguing against. It's so stupid people love the Wii but hate the Wii U. It's a total upgrade, just because it flopped doesn't mean it's bad. I don't know anyone who bought a Wii U and regretted buying it.
