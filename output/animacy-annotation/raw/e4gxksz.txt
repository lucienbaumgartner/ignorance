Kind of hard to do when you're half asleep as well and next thing you know someone twice your size is holding you down and it takes time to figure out if they are in that state or not in the dark but ok tell me more how I'm violating consent when I'm the one having someone come at me whose not conscious or aware of their strength and could hurt me as a result. Often when I'm asleep as well and I wake up to someone touching me and having sex with me, who I find out the next day was unaware and unconscious in a sleep walk state.

It's not that simple or easy
