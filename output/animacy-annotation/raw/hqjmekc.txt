You are being shown literal examples that are significantly better than your non-existent prototype, which has taken you three years. They are unlike yours, because they exist in playable form.

&gt; My approach is creating very detailed characters where the variance is the players choices impacting the way the relationship goes and that affecting everything.

So, Choice of Games or any visual novel? Having player choice and emotional choice be uncoupled is very, very common.

&gt; There's really not much in common with their ideas and mine. I don't generate names, personalities, and the narrative is not generated from squad progression across an open world or generated dungeons. All their variables are more generic/less specific.

Yes, these have more random variables than yours. They also have way more specificity than what you've shared, but you'd have to actually play them to know this. Or watch the whole GDC video shared, which talks about the depth of relationship mechanics.

&gt; My argument is having the additional dimension to branch in which has its own constraining rules and thereby consistent tools for the player to use strategically is a *transformative difference*.

You think.

Not players. Not readers here. 

"Guy who created his system thinks it's good"

People in this space here are repeatedly telling you this is not transformative.

&gt; You can disagree whether you think it matters, but COG does not have nested expressive/depth branching choices within macro choices. They just have macro choices.

You've obviously never played one of their games. You're ignorant and excited about it.

You're unaware of the [XYZZY Awards](https://xyzzyawards.org/), how they literally judge works by what you're describing, and how COG won in nearly every category.

Good luck launching! (And I do mean that)

That's where app dev gets hard. If you're unable to handle some basic, consistent and honest feedback, wait until you try and take money from people for this. They won't be as kind.
