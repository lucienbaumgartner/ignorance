If there were no rebels women would never of got the vote and the civil rights movement wouldn't of happened. If there were no rebels slavery would still exist. If there were no rebels, many of your favourite revolutionary artists and inventions would not exist. If there were no rebels, we would still believe the earth is flat and there was no evolution. We would not have quantum theory and the theory of relativity. If no were no rebels, terrible regimes of the past would never of fallen. If there were no rebels, you would not have any of the freedoms, knowledge or culture you have today. 

How ungrateful and ignorant of you that comment was, I assume you are uneducated.

"Progress isn't achieved by preachers or guardians of morality, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and sceptics"
