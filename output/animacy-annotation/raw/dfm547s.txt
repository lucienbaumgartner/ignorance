Considering it's one of the biggest files the federal government has to deal with, I'm consistently surprised that the NDP's upper echelon is seemingly unaware and unable to grasp the many nuances of foreign policy (not to mention defence and security). Paul Dewar was one of the only ones who seemed to have had a decent grasp on international relations but he isn't involved with the party anymore is he?

I'm intrigued by the possibility of Stogran entering the race, as it could help address this gap in the party.
