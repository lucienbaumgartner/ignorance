Did you see what they did at the BFV launch party?  They had a big screen where they showed nasty critical comments on the game from social media.  It was their way of saying that anyone criticizing the game, and by extension DICE, is a jerk.  They didn't show polite constructive criticism (of which there has been plenty), just the immature ranting.  That spoke volumes about how DICE sees us.

They're convinced they're doing a great job, and anyone who disagrees is hyper-critical, bigoted and ignorant.  That this game sold a fraction as many copies as the last few BF titles should be a big clue for them, but it probably isn't.
