Joint pain, I developed antibodies to Inflectra /Remicade. A 3 month dose would last 3 weeks and then bad to severe roaming joint pains, especially at night.
The odd part was my GI seemed surprised and unaware of what was happening.  Kinda irritating to see on here that its a somewhat common thing.
All of this in april 2020, the start of the pandemic.
