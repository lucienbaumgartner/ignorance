Because it's too diverse and unaware of genre conventions.  


Most metal, like it or not, focuses on its genre. Bands play their genre, and that's it. Nu Metal bands don't. They just do fucking whatever. That's why Bizkit have "A Lesson Learned", "Nobody Like You" and "Break Stuff" on the same album. Nu Metal blurs lines between genres, whereas other metal genres need these divisions.

In short, Nu Metal doesn't give a fuck. Soulfly has a song that ends with Reggea.
