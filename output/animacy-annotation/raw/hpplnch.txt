I literally have had the same point from the start. Stop being such a daft potato and read. My response to you literally starts with.

&gt;My guy, the point was that 40k doesn't have to focus entirely on humans the way it does. GW chooses too, and it still doesn't even really focus on humans as a lot of focus is put towards Space Marines also.

Saying how 40k has a Space Marine bias and speaking on my point about how it's too focused in one area thus why I brought up series that aren't as focused.

&gt;It is a good example of a series that depicts all factions in a mostly equal light and has a number of extremely popular non human characters.

And ends with this, referencing my original point that I picked series that have balanced portrayals of aliens and humans and how 40k does not do that because it often contains vast Astartes wank.

You've been an immense cockbite and unlike those who I can ignore because they are at least right. You aren't.

&gt;You’re ignorance is seemingly boundless and you have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m blocking you because there are enough stupid people on this sub as it is.

I'm literally one of the most active people on this sub and I've spent significant time here speaking about the Imperium, T'au, Astartes, Emperor, the general impact of various things on 40k. But please go off about how I'm boundlessely ignorant and stupid. 

My guy, you can't see the forrest for the trees. Stop being an arse.
