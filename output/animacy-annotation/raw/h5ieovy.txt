&gt; No you don't
&gt; 
&gt; 

Yes I do. I'm a trained scientist and I work in this field (albeit, not as a researcher).

&gt;Slovakia's health ministry has approved ivermectin for treatment and prophylaxis

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Okay then. **Slovakia** approved it. I guess that settles it then. ðŸ¤£

&gt;Yes, the simple fact is ivermectin has clinical benefits for the treatment and prevention of covid 19.

No, it doesn't. Also, I'm talking about whether it's indicated, not whether it has benefits (it also does not appear to). 

Are you so stupid and ignorant that you don't understand the difference?

&gt;This has been backed up by numerous peer reviewed studies and there are more preprints pending peer review.

You mean cherry picked, poorly designed studies. 

If you take the broad view of the scientific research, it is not indicated. 

**Which is why, AGAIN, every health and governing body in the world (minus fucking Slovakia ðŸ˜‚) does not recommend its use.  

&gt;it's pretty obvious you are incapable of being unbiased so it would probably be a waste of time because dumb American will be a dumb American.

Nobody is "unbiased". I am however a trained scientist and understand the difference between science and pseudoscience. 

&gt;I'm not the one arguing against scientific peer reviewed research, you're the only retard here.

You're talking about cherry picked, poorly designed studies, the most significant of which was just retracted because of egregious fraud. 

You can call me a retard all you want, but you're the one spouting off Alex Jones level pseudoscience.
