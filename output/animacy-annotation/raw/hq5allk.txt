Israel has resources, and Hamas is a group of strongmen controlling an ignorant and desperate people who've known little but war and suffering for 3 generations.

You may feel every Palestinian deserves to die because their leaders tell them that firing rockets at Israeli towns will make their lives better, and some of them foolishly, hopelessly believe it, but I wish we could come to something better. It's been more than 70 years; yeah, it's not fair to ask anyone to stop fighting first, but it's a hell of a lot more realistic to ask the country with modern infrastructure and a real economy to do it than to ask the inhabitants of the cities of rubble to stop for the greater good. And if they somehow did, do you honestly believe that Israel would stop burning and bulldozing their homes?

If you want this to go on forever because you won't ever give a meter, fine; you'll likely get your wish. But I'd like to see someone do something good there for once.
