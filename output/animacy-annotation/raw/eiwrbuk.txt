Check out MegaDeadly99’s comment about all the unhinged rage messages that he sends. The comment didn’t show up any of the 5+ times he tried to post it, but it’s visible in [his post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/megadeadly99). I bolder my 2 favorite parts:

This is rather lengthy, but at the end of the day. **I see myself as being on a CRUSADE** to CALL OUT the EXPLOITERS. First off. At the end of the day, YOU who received those messages have CLEARLY and without a doubt have violated the online code of conduct for PSN services.
Google it, read it and understand what you're all doing ( those who repeatedly abused relentless and practically comical, scripted, algorithmic to a t exploits to manipulate the game and abuse it.
Now I wasn't bragging about my record today; that's where you interpreted it wrong. After playing this game since launch and having to experience the ups and downs and patches, they had a game that was ruined by so many , and it spread like a cancer.

You're basically playing "the same guy, scoring the same goal, the same way" when you get near the top divisions and the game" catered " to their exploits.

I would get DESTROYED by some of you, like 15- 6 whatever; but I never quit. I played the game and had the most frustrating time playing ' defend the glitch'

Now all I was trying to get across was that today, there wasn't 5 or more short side glitchers in consecutive games for the first time since October!

Something was up ! The tuner seems to have brought more parity in the game. Today, I played 4 people in Div 1 and try as they might all game they COULDN'T use their GO TO bread and butter move.
I need to figure out how to post pictures on here. I would LOVE to share the transcripts back and forth from some people.
Everyone who does it ( and you know if you exploit this ) is so unaware and oblivious to it which is the most upsetting part when they reply.
I have sent countless messages to players who allow messages both in victory and defeat. I commend those few Div 1 players who actually START with Horton as their starting defenceman and play a fast back and forth game ( which I'll lose probably) but at least it's not hanging to play ' protect against the glitch'

Many say the short side isn't a 'glitch'

Wrong. When you can score on 6 out of 10 of the exact button/stick configuration ; kid- you're exploiting the game !!
I really would love to have all those 'guys' who killed me 13 -1 14 -2 and scored the SAME goal the SAME way try and argue that what they're doing isn't a problem !!That was just the breaking point for me. It's exploitation pure and simple and there's nothing left to discuss !!

Defend it then

Get gud

Whatever you've changed it from playing hockey to having to constantly know to play for repetitive plays from the same spot like a Swiss clock.
I started out with 1993 nhlpa hockey for the sega genesis
La kings had Granato Gretzky Sandstrom
You could basically 'short side glitch two ways ' so I'm not unaware of EA's play. Anyhow. Back in the day, we'd play. If someone scored 5 or 6 'glitchers' they knew they were probably getting a charley horse They knew better. They knew it was a 'cop out' Yeah two or three go in. I get it. 5 -6 and it's 9-2 and you STILL are chasing the SAME thing. The thing that sucks is that now you don't get the Charley horse anymore, because you're playing online in your parents basement and just love playing the style you choose to, that of pure exploitation.
Who remembers the 'Gartner grind ' ?
How many posts did you see asking about 'the Gartner glitch' and you kids had it planned out like NASA was building a rocket to put a DVD in Elon Musk's floating car ( unless you're a flat earther ) That's how some of you play this game like a Pre programmed robotic style right from the face off. It's shameful.

**Fellas. I play with honour. I'm old school.** All those guys who I said those things to do harmful things to this online gaming world.
What about the guy who says ' I matched w him earlier but I had no intention of playing , so I left my controller down for the WHOLE game and wasted his time, '. No that's not frustrating either.
