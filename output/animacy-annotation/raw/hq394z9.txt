Agreed, I’m all for saying fuck the confederacy and anyone who supports it, however I’m not going to piss on a random Johnny Reb grave. Tbh a lot of them were just incredibly ignorant and uneducated poor people who genuinely thought they were fighting for something, that to me is the most tragic part. The fact that the confederacy managed to manipulate that many people to fight under its flag.
