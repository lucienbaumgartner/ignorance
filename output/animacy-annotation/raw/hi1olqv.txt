No I haven’t. My position is that Alec could’ve taken multiple safety precautions and didn’t do that. Multiple safety precautions were ignored. Union standards weren’t followed. I found out the gun was announced to Alec to be a cold gun which means it shouldn’t have had any ammo in it to begin with which further proves my point of Alec being negligent. How easy is it to check if the gun is loaded at all? You have no counter argument except insults. You keep excusing a man because he is famous. And I’m not someone who hates Alec either, I’ve watched 30 rock idk how many times, the dude is funny and not evil but he is negligent and ignorant of firearms. I’m not saying it’s 100% his fault either. The assistant director is at fault, those who took it to target practice and put live ammo in it are responsible, the armorer is at fault. Alec is at fault too, for not inspecting what was suppose to be a cold gun, and a revolver no less.  Stop blindlessly defending someone responsible for the death of another human.
