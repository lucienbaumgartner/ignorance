Okay I respect that you literally save lives, and many of you want to do well, but you also have to understand there are reasons people are afraid/skeptical of you, like for example: not giving babies anesthetic for surgeries until 1999 because babies "don't feel pain" or being a POC woman and being treated like you're stupid and ignorant of your own bodily needs due to racism/sexism, or other forms of actual malpractice resulting in people suffering or dying which is an unseen epidemic in this country as well (and some say outpaces opiod deaths.) 

I have to tell you, my job isn't easy. Its also totally thankless. Its in an area of economy that everyone takes for granted (society would collapse without it) and NOBODY thanks me for. NOBODY. I get treated like dirt on a regular by entitled clients and vendors alike because its such a cutthroat industry. And yet I do it. 

I've been in this work for 5 years, and since then I have developed a very thick callus. Granted I don't see the blood and piss and don't have to deal with crazy delerious people like you do, so I get that you have it in a whole other magnitude. But I deal with mind-boggling corruption that would probably make you cry due to how fucked up it is. Like "my balls are in a vice and I have to literally pay you whatever you say you want just because you're a big company and there is literally nothing I can do" type of corruption. 

Yu have to accept that this is your job and you don't do it for attention or respect. Otherwise you need to get out of it. That's a you problem, not your customers problem. 

The work of all work is loving everyone despite knowing they are flawed, ignorant, upset, angry, self-destructive, clueless, rude etc.

I hope you feel better soon. I do appreciate you. As many people that you feel don't appreciate you, there are more or many that do. At least you are in an industry people actually know about. Mine is literally invisible (I work in agriculture.)
