It's crazy how delusional this sub is. People are seriously convinced that men go around every day saying to themselves "How evil can I be today?" And they think in a grand strategy of how to harm as many people as possible.

The guy in OP's case is an asshole. I'm not doubting that. But he's probably so closed minded and ignorant that he's oblivious to his actions. In his mind, there's nothing wrong with it.

But really? Do you think it's Robbie Rotten trying to be as evil as possible?
