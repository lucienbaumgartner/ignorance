&gt; Think about a time you were hungry, and tired, and then multiply that by a factor of 1,000.

I think this doesn't do justice to the truth of the matter. 

It's what happens in the depths of the mind. 

There's a saying that there's three great unknowns left: space, the sea, and the mind. If we're not careful, what comes about through the mind - on this planet and in this time and place - is with, no uncertainty, just as horrific andor *more* horrific than anything what we'll find in the other two realms.

This is largely why there's such a premium put on family and love and compassion and kindness. We must find those things and characteristics within us. We must. We are all ***one*** family. We all deserve love and compassion and kindness.

Edit: I should say that *"in this time and place"* isn't entirely accurate. What the mind brings is nearly timeless and endless. This is, largely, I think, what Einstein was talking about when he spoke, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.‚Äù There's something about our individual and collective ideation that can, quite literally, bring about that which we were maybe previously unsure and ignorant of.
