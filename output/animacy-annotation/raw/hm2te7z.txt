Character believes their romantic partner has died? As the cherry on top, they pursue a romantic relationship to bring their love's murderer to light. Of course this becomes awkward when said person isn't dead and unaware that an attempt on their life was made, so the character continues "cheating" to solve the case?

I think it's probably clear that I'm not in the romance genre lol
