A gentle reminder that Ann and Harrell polled better among minority communities and gathered more support from communities such as the Internation District.

The former is polling data from Pew Research that ended up being true and the latter is based off of a number of endorsements + polling data.

We also know from Gallup polls that black Americans *overwhelmingly* oppose defining the police and in fact want *more* police, they just also want them to be reformed/better trained.

Just saying, the public that voted for NTK, Oliver, etc is one that is overwhelming white, privileged, and unaware of the challenges that minority communities face.
