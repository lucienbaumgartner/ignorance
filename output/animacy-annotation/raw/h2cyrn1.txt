It must be really difficult being such a toxic person.

It has everything to do with the whining on reddit being absolutely unproductive and often based in misunderstanding.

People on Reddit tend to think they are a lot smarter than they are, and they think they understand concepts that they have no formal education in from reading comments on Reddit. The problem is that they are wrong and don't understand and build their opinions off of their ignorance.

When they get called out for being wrong and ignorant of reality, they become toxic assholes who call people names and drop into logically fallacious arguments.

Such as you.
