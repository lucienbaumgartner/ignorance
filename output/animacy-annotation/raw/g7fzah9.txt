I know a random person on the internet won't be able to do much to enlighten you, but as a moderate Dane (left within American politics,) this is exactly how liberals see you guys. 
Trump has not been great at handling the pandemic, and any current "dem leaders" are not in charge of your country. If they were, they might've been even worse for all we know, but I'd suggest trying what I'm doing: checking the "opposing side" to realize they really aren't too different from you. Both sides want someone to blame and keep pushing each other further out. Liberals are generally nitpicking facts as much as conservatives (just a guess, but better than assuming "I don't like x side, so they must have a malicious intent")

Just bear ind mind that if you do decide to visit a left-leaning political sub (specifically left-leaning, not just r/politics) that people will seem to be completely stupid and ignorant, that was my first thought visiting this subreddit. Just keep reading though, and don't get too upset or write a 3 paragraph essay on political division like me.
