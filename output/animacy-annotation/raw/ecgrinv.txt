Fuck, this is what I can’t stand! If you don’t have a dash cam (even if you do) people will fight you on it when they’re responsible.

What REALLY bothers is people that don’t tell the truth when they’re the ones fucking at fault.
Or even if they really think the person they hit are the ones that hit them, it just shows that person is crippling unaware and ignorant to their driving surroundings and situations to cling to such a false claim like that, such as your account, is a prime example of what is wrong with people. Fuck dumb bitch lady.

I think there should be a law that if you are trying to salvage your insurance from skyrocketing for you being a dumbass idiot who lies by trying to insinuate the other innocent driver hit you, and it gets proven otherwise either by dash cam evidence or investigation, you need to not only lose your license or have it suspended, but be penalized.
