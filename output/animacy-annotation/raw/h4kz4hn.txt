1. The 1st helicopter has been set on fire yet you still shoot at it.
2. While the 2nd heli passed yourself at 200kmh,you still shoot at him and turn the back of your turret to the 3rd heli which made you  defenseless and unaware of his actions.
3. You didn't use any of your smokes to cover up your exact location that could provide you at least some optic cover and friendly SPAA some time to at least scare off the helicopters.
