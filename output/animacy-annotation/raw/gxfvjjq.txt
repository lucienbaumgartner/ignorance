There are several people saying they have either had their cats prescribed on Fluoxetine or are in the veterinary industry (myself included) and have said it works well. It's really dangerous and ignorant of you to spruik such misleading information (to not try the drug at all and then to also suggest alternative advice which will plain not help), especially if you have no professional veterinary experience.

I work in a primarily cat-only clinic and have seen the use of fluoxetine firsthand on many cats. The medication tends to either 1) work or 2) they view no change in behaviour. There MAY be a side effect of anxiety - drugs affect all animals and humans differently - but this is no reason to not at least try the drug to see if it will help. In my professional experience, as a vet tech of 9 years, I have not yet had a cat have their anxiety get worse on fluoxetine, nor have I had it in dogs, either.

Your suggestions of 'giving kitty more cuddles' is honestly ridiculous and has no basis in the understanding of feline behaviour or veterinary medicine. It is true that there are other techniques to be used to calm an anxious cat (the use of pheromone sprays, giving a cat a calm, quiet hiding space, making sure there is a set routine etc) but just giving them cuddles or soft things isn't going to cut it, at all.
