I think YTA here probably. I feel like you left out a lot of argument from A to Z. If you simply got banned because you said you think 1 month is long enough for pride month, no other comments stated, you would be NTA. But I feel like you left a lot of what you said out here. Some of the extra phrases you said here kind of hint that maybe you were diminishing of lgbtq struggles. It's a lot more than "quite a bit of hate." You also seem a little prudeish and ignorant of what pride month is about when you say "to celebrate sexuality?" like it isn't something worthy to begin with (not even getting into the fact that it's a lot more than "celebrating sexuality"). You come off as considering Pride month a token holiday you don't really agree with or understand, seem unwilling to try understand it, but you're willing to tolerate it only because you think some people have been rude to lgbtq people.
