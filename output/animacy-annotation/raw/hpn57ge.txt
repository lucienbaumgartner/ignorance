Bah.   People are generally weirded out by sex issues the more "sheltered" they are.  Its literally not helping anything.   It just making people ignorant and unhappy.  Its probably the only subject in the world where people actually believe knowing less is beneficial.  It isn't.   Having only a piece of the big picture is dangerous.  And it sounds like that girl was just missing the piece about birth control.
