Yeah, 5k is chump change for those in charge. I know a guy whose boss is so arrogant and ignorant that he doesn't wear a mask yet requires all those under him to wear one. Someone contracted the virus some weeks back and he was furious, immediately donning a mask himself and got the entire office tested. The results were negative for everyone fortunately but he went back to not wearing one.

Friend doesn't want to report the boss out of fear of losing his job. This is the sort of mentality we have to deal with in the workplace and I just hope it is not widespread.
