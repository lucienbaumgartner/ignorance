Everything is about ego/pride, flesh and blood to them. They are so primal and evil, man. They are obsessed with dominating, penetrating, raping, ruling, owning, devouring and creating their reality at all costs, just like the blind God they worship that created them in it's own image. It exists in them, and only them. It doesn't have to exist outside of them to have an effect. They just act in accordance to that system built, blindly, obediently. It serves their egos and pride and keeps them high and manic. They are dopamine devils. They are stuck in primitive mentalities, urges and sensations of the more manically violent humans of the past that we are desperately trying to leave in the past.  


These people can only be bred out of existence by choosing not to be one. To show violence and force against them only breeds more of them, because they are rooted in ego, in fear and hate. They are the beast, and it only serves itself, individually or collectively. They are an ancient evil, an ignorant and blind evil that paves the path to hell in delusional, misguided good intentions.
