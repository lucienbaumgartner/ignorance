[Im afraid you've misinterpreted my comment. Your post suggests (I can clarify what "suggests" means if you so need me to, or a quick google search can give you the definition) that RNG tech is not as fruitful as EV tech. But to be frank, you are wrong and ignorant of the climate disaster that is building up every day. The point of green energy is not to slow human caused climate change, it is to put a stop to it all together. EV tech does not stop it nor reverses it. Once you understand that, and that RNG actually reverses CO2 and methane emissions, you will see why CLNE is such a game changer.  Edit: on the highlighted comment regarding your lack of understanding of EV tech, I was pointing out that you don't understand EV tech enough to know it's weaknesses, thus causing you to turn a blind eye from the benefits of RNG. In short, EV has many a great benefits, but it also has some damning short falls when it comes to commercial use.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p84d8i/an_examination_of_why_your_portfolio_keeps/h9pzaz2/)
