HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
OH MY FUCKING GOD I’M DYING!!!

Shoe doesn’t hate feminism as a whole, just the third wave retarded feminism that is against “manspreading”, “mansplaining”, and all that other bullshit that exists just to put down men for just having a penis. The “wage gap” does not exist and can be debunked by anyone that knows the basics of economics. The same applies to the “pink tax”. She is very left leaning but you wouldn’t know that because you probably have her channel blocked. 

As for skeptic, he is nowhere near “alt-right”, also I love how you say sjw is a made-up label but then proceed to label them and I “alt-right”. It’s just hilarious. He mostly entertains and debunks conspiracy theories now but back when he delved into the left-wing subjects he applied skepticism to their ideological beliefs such as “only men can be sexist”, “only white people can be racist” , and shit like that. He is still left leaning, just look at his video about the Alabama abortion bill, that criticizes people on the left because he belongs to that side and hates seeing it act so stupid. Same with Shoe. 

You are so close-minded and ignorant that it’s fucking hilarious. Do you also watch Steve Shives? Did you call in the bomb threat to Mythcon 2018? I can see someone as misinformed as you doing both of those things.
