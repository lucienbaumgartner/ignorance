When it comes to splitting the assets, it's going to come down quite simply to who has a name on the title/deed/debt.  Creditors don't care what the verbal agreements were to parents, or how you guys split up your expenses, or what's 'fair' in terms of splitting debt and equity.

Assuming you both split and move to apartments/family, you'll both still be on the hook for your joint debts/ownership of assets.  Either person can "buy out" the other by signing a quit-claim, which could be tied to either a financial agreement (ie you buy out his half of the land you guys own, or you give up your equity in exchange for him assuming part of your student line of credit), one of you walks away (ie just signs the quit claim and gives debt and assets to the other), or, one of you forces a sale (meaning neither one wants to walk away and you can't come to an agreement on the assets/debts, in which case going through the court a sale would be forced and you'll both end up splitting what's likely to be a loss based on your info).  

Your local laws may vary on the financial details of what I just listed out, but there's a few things to keep in mind regardless:

- You are the owner of the 25k of student credit debt.  He has no legal obligation to this debt.
- His parents have no legal claim to any money from either of you, although they could probably go to small claims court.  Due to the amount though, the cost/benefit likely isn't worth it, especially considering even if they win they can't just get a lump sum payment, as no one has it
- The 2.5 acre lot and the 'tiny house' is jointly owned by both of you.  Who paid what is irrelevant unless it goes to court to have one or the other buy out the equity or force a sale.
- Your current incomes, from a legal perspective, are irrelevant in terms of how assets will be divided in a legal situation.

Advice?  Get an apartment or move in with family, but keep the families OUT of your discussions.  Sort the financial details out later, but be willing to walk away from your equity in these assets in exchange for his assumption of the debt with them.  Dragging this out further is not going to do anything but become a nightmare...this is one of those know when to fold them situations that you learn from in the future.  Cut ties with his family, the relationship, and the assets of this situation.

Having gone through a very similar situation, I would also suggest not blindsiding the guy.  Unless there's a legitimate fear of violence or damage to your stuff, etc, or there's zero chance of having a conversation, discussing your feelings about your living situation, what you want to do, and why you want to do it, would be appreciated by him long term, whether he admits it or not.  He'll likely feel blindsided and unaware that things were trending poorly for some time and that you just 'up and left' without trying to fix or discuss anything.  While you've had time to think about these things and reach the conclusions and decisions you're now getting to, he has likely not done the same.  He may not be aware of it, and may have told himself they were arguments and not something more significant.  Take the assets, the debts, the parents on both sides...all of it out of the talk, and just discuss why you want to leave, and give him a chance to mentally come to terms with it.  Moving out while he's out of town (or in my case, while I was at work) was, in my opinion, a less than ideal way to handle the situation, and created a tone of bitterness and competition to "get over" on the other person that could've been avoided if things were handled in a better fashion.  That could easily cascade into a drawn out legal fight and cost money and certainly add stress to your situation.

 Again, this wouldn't apply if there's an actual danger here, and I don't have specifics on the long term trend of the relationship, it's just what I've come away with from my own experiences as a hockey playing dude that was in a funky financial situation after a less than stellar ending to a relationship that just happened to involve a newly purchased home.
