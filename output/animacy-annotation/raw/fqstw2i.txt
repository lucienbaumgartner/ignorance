It's a red neck watching the wheels of government turn. Bunch of spoiled brats waving their collective cocks around. If a toddler started screaming over the top of you and banging on a table because you were saying something it didn't like, you try to teach the child how wrong and ignorant that is....maybe parents should insert the caveat that its quite normal behavior in parliament.
