I’ve thought a lot about how to respond to your woefully ignorant and frankly offensive perspective.

To compare a woman being prevented from having an abortion to a man being prevented from raping someone is utterly vile.

Your assertion that in general, women are not harmed by being denied an abortion is uneducated and ignorant of reality.

If you acknowledge the risks and harms of pregnancy (wanted and unwanted) and childbirth but take a position that you don’t think it justifies an abortion then fair enough. I don’t agree but fair enough.

To deny that those harms exist, refuse to educate yourself on that topic and advocate to strip access to abortion makes you a coward.

Virtually every pregnancy and childbirth harms a woman’s body. While the numbers who die might be relatively small, the number who experience severe adverse near death situations is much higher. 

In Australia, that’s 1 in every 80 deliveries. That makes nearly being killed common. And most of those women will be left with injuries and permanent challenges - many of which makes future pregnancy much more dangerous.

This of course, does not include a huge variety of non-life threatening conditions and injuries, some of which will leave women with disabilities, reduced quality of life and additional complications.

The vast range of ways in which women with an unwanted pregnancy is huge.  You have no right to dismiss them. And comparing those challenges to a man being stopped from raping someone is disgusting.
