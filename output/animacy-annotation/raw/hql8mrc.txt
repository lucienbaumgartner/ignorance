Your knowledge of history is incredibly narrow and perverted if you think white people only liberated black &amp; brown people from other whites. That is absolutely not the case. The British Empire used her navy to ensure the abolishment of slavery WORLDWIDE. In Africa, in the Middle East, in South Asia. This was a GLOBAL phenomenon. Are you really that stupid and ignorant that you think only whites have practiced slavery through the ages? Your comment about me being dense is rather ironic. 

  
As I said european history is not perfect, but compared to the histories of other cultures and nations, it is incredibly distinguished. Englightment philosophy, iliberalism, basically the entire notion of individual sovereignty and human rights originates from the western corpus. 

  
This is what I'm proud of. Our rich legacy, our philosophical and artistic achievements. I acknowledge the horrors of slavery, but every society practiced slavery. Only difference is whites actually put an end to it. 

  
Also, FYI, most native indians mostly died via communicable diseases not some systematic ethnic cleansing. 

  
Your stupidity disgusts me. Goodbye.
