The quote below is from Ivey to Podesta in an email. 

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

I would rewrite this to say "Unawareness is weakening AND compliance is fading rapidly".

You wrote "It's amazing how easily manipulated people are." With all of the defensive censorship, etc I now I am shifting toward,in my head, "It's exciting and hope filled to me how much harder it is to manipulate people". The jig is up and vigilance/accountability is on the rise.
