Oh I understand that there are a lot of people who don't see vaccines as this huge moral thing. I just think they are ignorant and naive to fail to see the consequences if everyone thought like them. Same with voting, 'my vote doesn't matter anyway so I don't vote.' is the same type of beat as 'I don't vaccinate but a load of other people do, so it's okay.' You putting yourself in an exceptional position is incredible selfish.
