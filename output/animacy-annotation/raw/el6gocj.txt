my mom's cousin has always struggled with drug and alcohol problems. He's had many accidents.. trips to jail and its a miracle he's still alive.

one story, however, takes the cake. He got drunk and rode his motorcycle at a high right of speed down a two lane highway in our area. The next day, he woke up and had vague memories of hitting an animal on his way home..  he thought it was a dream but he did notice some blood and hair on his bike.. so he retraced his steps and found a small, young whitetailed deer that he hit with the motorcycle.

He was going so fast and hit it so hard that he literally sliced it in to two pieces.. he was unhurt and unaware that it happened.

I would not normally believe this story, but my dad told me the story only AFTER he had driven past the area that it happened and seen the deer, in two pieces, first hand.
