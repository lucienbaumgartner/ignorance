Even if it’s not motivated by race, doesn’t this prove there’s clearly problems with policing in this country? I personally think race has a part but most of these incidents are just because of undertrained cops power tripping. Call me crazy, but no matter my race, I’d rather not have cops that are so undertrained and ignorant that they think a taser is a glock.
