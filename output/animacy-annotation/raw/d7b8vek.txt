I don't have the problem with snipers, there's plenty of counters for them. Find a vehicle, suppress them with a rifle, sprint fast from cover to cover. They are often unaware and easily killable.

Also about tanks, I don't think it's the tanks that need nerfing, infantry just needs a better way of dealing with them. In previous battlefield games you'd get a rocket launcher, and you had enough rockets to destroy any armored vehicle. Now you get two grenades that do 20 damage each and are hard to aim with. You can get a rocket gun but it only does 20 damage and you have to use a bipod. And it doesn't have enough ammo to kill a tank.
