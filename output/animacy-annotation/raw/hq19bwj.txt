Disliking 2Ha is really a minority opinion here. Personally I don't dislike the novel as a whole, but I don't think it's nearly as good as the majority thinks. Agree that the repetitive writing gets annoying - it's like the author doesn't trust the reader to read between the lines (which some people can't - I've seen comments from people who did not pick up on the MC's opinion about his shizun being super ignorant and prejudiced, even though that was so obvious from the beginning). I actually like a lot of the writing, but I feel that Meatbun overexplains things in a way that makes me feel talked down to.
