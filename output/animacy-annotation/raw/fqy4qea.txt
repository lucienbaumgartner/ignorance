Marie Antoinette was a Pluto in Sag person. She exemplifies the shadow side of Sagittarius in her excessive tendencies and an inability to empathize. Sag is all about seeking the truth, but it can also be hot headed, self-righteous, and unaware that perceived truth to one person does necessarily mean a universal truth. It's a cautionary tale to this Pluto in Sag gen who will come into power when Pluto moves into Pisces.
