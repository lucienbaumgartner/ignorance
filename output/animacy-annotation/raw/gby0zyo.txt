I was blissfully ignorant and unaware of this when I bought my first home. Much was cleared out between the open house and final walkthrough but there were still “pathways” between all the clutter and contractor bags in the attic and basement so we got them to cover $1,000 of closing costs. I thought to myself “well if they leave a little behind all I have to do is throw it out”... 4 years of twice annual ‘bulk trash’ days later and I’m just about rid of it all. Oh and those contractor bags in the attic? I removed 14 filled-to-the-brim bags of dead marijuana plants. Dead, dead: my first thought when I opened them was “why do they have so much straw or hay up here”. Come to find out there was definitely a former grow operation going on in the attic which also explained the weird PVC tubing contraptions, etc left behind. That added the extra wrinkle of me not feeling totally comfortable just putting it at the curb, haha... had to borrow a truck and take it all to a dump. Definitely a learning experience going into my next real estate purchase!
