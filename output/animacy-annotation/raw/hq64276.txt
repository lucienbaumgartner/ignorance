You seriously can't wrap your brain around the concept that your wife asking her close female family to come support her is vastly different than your selfish entitled relatives turning up, because they were whining you couldn't make it for the holiday and now want to be catered to by someone who's just given birth?

I can't believe how ignorant and selfish you're being. I feel so sorry for your wife. What exactly will you be contributing in child care after the birth? Will you be doing 50% of nappy changes? Cleaning, cooking and laundry while she recovers?
