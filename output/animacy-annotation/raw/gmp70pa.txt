I find it unconscionable to require an education with a price tag beyond the means of the salary for its position.  I also find it disturbing that people choose a career, finish their degree after taking loans etc and then realize they can’t pay their loans. I’m not mocking you because I know how it is when you’re young and unaware of how loans work but you’re an educator and this has been going on for decades. It’s the most bazaar situation I think I’ve ever heard. I helped enroll hundreds of school teachers that were in default. It’s seriously a sad state of affairs.
