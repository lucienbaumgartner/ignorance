"and should pre-existing conditions, which Obamacare brought to fruition, be removed" (pause). Maybe try saying that aloud, or try saying it to someone and see how they respond. It can clearly be interpreted as a question. My impression was that she actually was a bit rude and unaware that the combination of her delivery and her choice of words made it sound like she'd asked a question. And then after she continued and finished her statement, it was basically her question all along. So his answer is no, he's not getting rid of pre-existing conditions, which is what he was trying to say the first time. I get that most people here have an anti-Trump bias and the idea of him rudely interrupting someone and then getting put in his place would be celebrated, but this specific clip is just an example of an honest miscommunication on both their parts.
