Like everything, it works for some people, not so much for others. Intuitive eating doesn't work for most people, when you have insanely processed ingredients like sugar (look up how much sugar cane manufacturers need to make regular sugar, it's crazy) and too much focus on flours and fruits, which have been bred to be sweeter and sweeter.

I also get a lot more benefits besides the weightloss. Being able to manage my ED is 100% one of them, and even when I reach my weight goal, I will stick to keto (or at least low carb) to reap the other benefits. It's really great that you found that it helps you reverse a lot of the damage, and it's really arrogant and ignorant of people to shame you when they don't know what they're talking about.
