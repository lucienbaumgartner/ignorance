My old void boi, now my moms void boi, is 15 and a very grumpy old man but also super docile. He is one of the loudest cats I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.

It took the vet a few visits to learn he just sounds mean but wont follow through on his threats. Unless of course you try to bathe him, then you might actually get bit.

Love that fluffy long haired grumpy son of a bitch. When he was a poof ball of a kitten he was pounce your ankles from behind and the book it so when you turned around you saw this black streak running away. He made me jump a few times this way so I named him Spook (I was young and unaware of its other meaning).
