My ex-girlfriend was Italian American, maybe 3rd generation. Her family all spoke Italian. They celebrated holidays (Christmas and Easter) much differently than I did, and I was told such celebrations/food had origins in Italy, which I have no reason to disagree with. She shared these customs with many other Italian Americans outside her family as well. 

The “Italian American” culture is very real and spread across much of the Northeast US (at least) and there is strong reason to believe that this culture has its roots firmly in Italy. To say being Italian American means nothing is simply incorrect.

To say that this heritage is meaningless is very ignorant and circumstantial to your exact experience. There for sure are some people that are Italian American that have smaller ties to Italy. I have minimal ties to my own heritage, but that does not mean my ancestors didn’t descend from other countries, does it?

On a day to day, we aren’t conversing to Europeans about our heritage, we are conversing with other Americans most of the time:

A: “We eat 7 fish on Christmas”

B: “Oh interesting, why do you do that?”

A: “Our family is Italian, it’s one of our traditions” (Note: no one is the US will think that you’re family just got off the boat yesterday, they will understand you mean that your ancestors descended from Italy, unless you’re speaking with a strong Italian accent)

Whether or not this is exactly what they do in Italy is irrelevant: someone telling me they are Italian (american) gives me clues as to their unique culture and upbringing, in ways which may be difficult for a European looking in to understand.
