I agree. And? 

Are you saying that justice should be withheld until every single Saudi criminal that evades the law can be tried and convicted? And what does getting rid of corruption have to do with cursing the Prophet [](/pbuh)? 

He's not young and he's not helpless. He's a grown man with a big-mouth and many statements of contempt for Islam, several of which were statements of kufr. 

He would likely be free, living comfortably if he had with-held his evil tongue from the honor of the Prophet [](/pbuh). He crossed a line and he should be held accountable for his actions.

Perhaps he was ignorant and unaware that the penalty for insulting the Prophet [](/pbuh) is death. In that case I hope his repentance was sincere and that it is accepted by the court that tries him, and that they show him leniency.
