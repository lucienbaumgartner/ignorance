today's cpap machines are quiet, like a white noise machine on the lowest setting. what really persuaded me to change was to become aware of how much my wife was suffering. it's hard to perceive that when her suffering always takes place while i am asleep and unaware of it. i was always like, do i really snore? is it actually loud? can't you just wear earplugs? then i started waking myself up from snoring a few times. gradually my realization became undeniable.
