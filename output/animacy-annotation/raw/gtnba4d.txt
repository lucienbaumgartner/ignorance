This is good advice but to say that years 18-22 are “precious” and “the best memories you’ll ever have” is so incredibly naive and ignorant that I actually feel bad for you. It’s also misleading and can put unwanted pressure on kids, making them believe that life will be shit after they turn 25. Every year of my life has been great in different ways because I enjoy life. Age, for me so far, means nothing. 

Except I have way more money now
