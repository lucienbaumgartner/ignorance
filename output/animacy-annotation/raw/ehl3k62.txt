Change byRockets to byHarden, you are the biggest stan of his in this sub. Talking with you about basketball is pointless, so hold that L for now, keep being salty and good luck making the top 4 this year with that ball hog who shoots 32.5% from 3 in the 4th quarter and has a negative on-off playing for the 10th seed in the league and you think deserves MVP.
