Yeah, one single comment posted 5 hours after I made the observation, an exception that proves the rule in the face of the multitude of hostilities on the other end. 

And you're doing the exact same dumbass generalizing that the other comment to me did. ADAD spam is **not** the only way to beat campers, and being so fervid in your defence of it suggest a single minded platitude that belies rational discussion. Lean peaking, free looking while running, thermals, situational awareness, sound queues, pacing, map knowledge, prefiring, the list goes on. Even a single inertia laden shoulder peak would still be functional.

Additionally, suggesting that the only reason people could possibly want weightier movement is because they "lack these skills" is so mind numbingly arrogant and ignorant that I can't help but feel like I'm playing chess with a pigeon. Along with many other people that aren't in favour of strafespam, I am more than mechanically capable. I have played FPSs for decades. I consistently top the scoreboard on everything from Call of Duty to ARMA, and everything in between. This may surprise you, but I don't play CoD the same way I play ARMA, but by some miracle I perform well in both. I'll let you in on my secret . . . I adapt. 

If nerfing ADAD spam makes you impotent then I'm sorry, but it *is* a crutch, and maybe *you're* the one lacking skill.
