1984. I read it with a class of seniors. (I'm the teacher.) Some good stuff. Weird takes on sex and women. Too bad about the rats. Room 101 brought us all down. I'd asked them to make predictions, and so many had wanted a happily ever after. Ha! Best student comment: You had one question (of Charrington, before biggest reveal) Why did you make it about the damn children's rhyme?

Emanuel Goldstein's book was very hard to get through. I still don't know how much I believe was actual and how much a lie. Obviously, the entire book was propaganda. But by the same token, the plan was obviously to keep the proles ignorant and maleable. That was in the book, too.
