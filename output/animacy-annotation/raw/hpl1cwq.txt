you want the studies? sure thing my friend.  
[For decades, follow-up studies of transgender kids have shown that a substantial majority -- anywhere from 65 to 94 percent -- eventually ceased to identify as transgender.](https://www.kqed.org/futureofyou/441784/the-controversial-research-on-desistance-in-transgender-youth)  
puberty blockers do not buy time:  
"There is demonstrable evidence that children who are put on puberty blockers do not desist. London’s GIDS clinic reports that persistence is correlated with the commencement of physical interventions such as the hypothalamic blocker (t=.395, p=.007) and no patient within the sample desisted after having started on the hypothalamic blocker. [90.3% of young people who did not commence the blocker desisted.](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/07/21972/) Another 2010 [Dutch study](http://www.pinktherapy.com/Portals/0/CourseResources/de_Vries_Puberty_Suppression_in_Adolescents_with_GD.pdf) showed that 100% of the children put on puberty blockers went on to receive cross-sex hormone treatment. And while the numbers vary, there is a general consensus among the [various studies](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html) that **anywhere between 60 and 90 percent of children with gender dysphoria who receive no medical interventions desist when they reach adulthood.**

&amp;#x200B;

[This link](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html) compares more than 10 long terms studies of kids with GD, even one conducted by the person at the head of the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders group in 2008 for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, also known as the  DSM-5. So the criteria were damn near the same. 

So you can see the results yourself. 

\-----------------

The evidence that its a social contagion is in the sudden increase and the fact that most people IDing as trans do so after their friend groups, without any previous history of it. Thats literally the defining factors of a social contagion. 

People of all ages are not experiencing this boom in being trans. It is only the youth who are exploding in numbers. If it was purely about acceptance, you would see the boom in people of all ages, but you don't.

If you watched the webinar you would see the evidence and arguments presented. 

But you're not. You're arguing from ignorance and just saying "im in a bubble!??!?! no you!!!!!!!!" Like dude, just read sources of information from things outside your approved list. Just have an open mind while looking at information thats new to you. Stop being aggressively ignorant and closed minded. Stop arguing over a webinar you didn't even watch.
