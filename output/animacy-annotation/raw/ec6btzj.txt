That i stay up 2, 3, and even did 5 nights in a row, and i'm still doing fine. I'm not at all fine, i'm fucked up, destroyed, but i got used to extreme tiredness that comes with 2 or 3 unslept nights. I hate coffee, but have to drink it to force my system to keep alert. It's the healthiest method, instead of enegy drinks, aswell. 

I do stay up so much to do the things that i like and bring me happiness, like making origami. And sewing patches. Studying for university also takes a huge chunk of my time, and so far i got to be the only one in my class to have a scholarship, for 2 semesters so far. Both times when i saw the announcements board with my name there, i fell on my knees with tears in my eyes, mumbling "it finally pays off", careless of all the other students around me.

Also, my life is a huge mess i have to sort out, and lack of sleep makes me anxious, irritable, impatient, unaware, and more susceptible to pain. I'm so fed up of myself being a grumpy moron to everybody, but it just goes in a circle pattern.
