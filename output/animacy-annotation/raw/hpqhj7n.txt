Just like a lot of cases, the defense had a better team of lawyers with plausible arguments than that putz prosecutor. He will be retried with a better prosecution. Jurors are just ordinary people a lot of them are totally ignorant and many are very naive. Let justice take its course. He is going to prison for the rest of his natural life. Count on it.
