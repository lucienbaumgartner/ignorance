Read through some of the stories here on r/leaves. 
Look at the age of people and how many years they have struggled. Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years? 1 year? Take a hard look at the people around you that smokes. Can you identify any drug addict you look up to and want to be like?  

Do yourself a favor and stop now while you’re still young with potential. Otherwise you’ll wake up one day lost, confused wondering what happend. 
Time flies by man and smoking makes you unaware and stuck. It stops you from developing into an adult (Peter Pan). If you don’t stop now you might wake up one day in 10 years looking back at all the opportunities you missed.  The innocent young boy with potential is now grown up and people around you expect things from you, like, “what the hell have you been up to for the last 10 years?”

You got this!
