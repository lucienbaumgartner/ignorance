&gt;	As for your tone shifting into more insulting territory, I’m a professional archaeologist, you’re not teaching me shit about science. I happen to have a moral stance that I have defended.

Didn’t claim I was teaching you about science, nor did I question your moral stance. I called out your specific approach to criticizing this monkey research as lazy and vague. 

&gt;	You can disagree and label it feels over reals if you like, but if you don’t have a similar threshold somewhere even if it allows a bit more than mine, then I honestly feel sorry for you

Of course I have a similar position. But as a professional scientist myself, I try to make sure I have all of the relevant information before I make a conclusion. 

&gt;	You’ve thus far insinuated I’m a liar, nonsensical, and ignorant of science etc. Let me insinuate that you’re far too much of a condescending asshole for how limited your reading comprehension seems to be.

I haven’t said anything about you personally. I don’t know you. Your specific attempt to criticize this research, on the other hand, I do have a problem with and have criticized. Which makes your insult about reading comprehension pretty funny.
