I somehow highly doubt that out of all the environmental hazards happening in the world phisical videogame media is one of the more pressing one to required to alienate an entire user base just because you are privileged enough to flaunt your enviroPP to rest of the world. I'm from an island you are lucky to get stable 5 mb speed. Not everyone has fast internet access and not everyone likes digital media. I'm all for options on those who want to switch but not force those who can't or don't want because according to you it's "ethically wrong" when it probably takes more resources for you to be able to make this self-absorbed "moral" post than it take to make a video game copy. 

Not even going to get into the speculative bullshit about slapping disk drive last minute as if that's how product manufacturing works. You are so utterly wrong about physical media being an requiring digital download. They hold the entire game inside I can play and install all my games offline. If you want to help a cause spreading misinformation is not the way to go. The last important factor of your crusade is that a lot people who buy phisical media collects them like like we've collected books for centuries. Is not a one time use product that gets thrown into the bin when used. Obviously I too want to live on a better world but this post comes from a very privileged, unaware and ignorant point of view. And this honestly the problem with most environmental movements, they like to demand to "get rid of X" without offering alternative efficient solutions.

&gt;Edit: this went as badly as i expected it to, still can't have any discussions on reddit about the environment and consumerism without people getting touchy, christ.

When your entire post revolves around you aren't allowed to play games because you are not me. I wonder why people will get mad.
