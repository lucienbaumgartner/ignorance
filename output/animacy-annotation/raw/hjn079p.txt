This has been pretty much how I've felt, and still feel as I am caught up on season 2. Characters all stick to their tropes and hardly show any real development outside of Lena who started out unbelievably and stupidly idealistic. Like, nobody is that blind and ignorant of the world around them, and if they did they wouldn't be a Major in the military doing the same shit they condemn to others.

Death still only happens to characters with maybe 3 minutes of screentime, making death have 0 impact on the viewer.

Mind you, I don't think that 86 is even a bad mecha or sci-fi show, it's just very mid, held up by a good OST and visuals. Personally, I actually think the show got worse in season 2 with the introduction of a really annoying side character and having a much less interesting premise.
