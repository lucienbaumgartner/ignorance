My wife is Catholic. I'm an Atheist. I even go to church with her on occasion. It's not something I enjoy but neither is cleaning the bathroom or grocery shopping. I do them anyways because I know she appreciates me putting an effort into the relationship.

She doesn't tech but is willing to tolerate it because it's important to me.

Just because someone is religious doesn't mean they talk about it all the time or demand loyalty of the same religion of their significant others. I find your question shallow and ignorant that no matter the circumstance, no matter the person or their personal relationship with religion, you wouldn't marry them. Religion doesn't have to be their entire identity, and most religious people are respectful of your religion if you are to theirs.
