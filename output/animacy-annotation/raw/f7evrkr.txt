Sindome has zero grinding! https://sindome.org

Sindome doesn't take combat lightly. Combat means words have failed and your life is on the line. The tactics involved include stealth, disguising, joining factions, keeping your head low, betrayal, planning hits, and catching your targets at their most unaware and weakest.

You can invest in zero combat skills and still send so many people to their graves simply by spreading convincing lies. The strongest tactics are in the tongue. Play the long con. Make their lives hell.
