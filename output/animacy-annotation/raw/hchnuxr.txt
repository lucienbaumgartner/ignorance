I don’t want to see anyone die from not being vaccinated, as apparently it’s a horrible way to go.

…but is it wrong, to have a little fleeting moment of glee that this virus is now going to make the stupid and ignorant of our society extra susceptible?

I know there’s people with valid health reasons that can’t have it. Usually those people are trying to keep themselves safe - but the majority of unvaxxed people are the stupid, ignorant, and unwilling. That makes me a little happy inside to think they’re the ones who are most at risk now.
