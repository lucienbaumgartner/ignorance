Hm. Perhaps the introductions would suggest this is not a novel but a formal treatise written in a polemic style. Good point. But then again, once you begin reading the actual text, the character's narration immediately develops into a fictional story. The text starts with the character waking up on the floor, and progressing into his early morning, inwardly narrating the sequence of his basic bodily activities as though he is alone and unaware that a story is currently unfolding. Yet this is a story.
