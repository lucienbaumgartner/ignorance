I was young and unaware of going into the step parent life and my step girls were 2 at the time. 

I learned a lot from talking to my own step parents and how they felt and dealt with being the "outside adult". 
The advice they gave me was to always respect that when anything big needs to be decided for the girls its never my job to make said decisions, it's their parents job. If you are asked your opinion you can give it but you  cannot be offended if they decide otherwise. That was a big one for me and I stick by it. 

I also had a therapist who opened a door to a new perspective of the girls are lucky to have me as being me and not a strict parent figure. They have a mam and dad and now they have me who they can feel more safe with sharing things with that they wouldn't share with their parents and that is certainly true. 
I built such a good bond with the girls that they know that I will keep them safe and healthy but I am absolutely someone that they can trust who will not betray them. They come to me with things they are worried about when it comes to HCBM because they know I will talk them through their feelings and I have no hard feelings against her so they won't pick up a bias. 

One thing from myself personally is how I chose to "parent" the girls. We are a household of getting the girls to express themselves and learn new things. When someone happens we don't shout, we sit down together ask what happened and how they are feeling because of it and what we can do next time instead. 
We also are huge on having them learn their personalities and making decisions for themselves.
Our biggest rule in the house is that you can make your own decision as long as your kind to yourself, others and the things around you. (Within reason they still have a rough bedtime etc). This is a game changer for them because they make better choices because it's their choice
