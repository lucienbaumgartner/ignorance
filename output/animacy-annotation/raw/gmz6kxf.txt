If you recall, that was a popular and appealing idea, which didn't really work out and is why the government failed to deliver on it's promise of a border fence. 

After passage of the Secure Fence Act, it was changed to a "virtual fence." We gave Boeing tons of money, way over budge, to build the tiniest length of virtual wall. Technological and logistical problems made it a complete and very expensive failure. Then we just kind of gave up, until Trump came along and finished the job.

Quick google, maybe not the best source, but not terrible, and it links to some good resources:

Before this, then Senator Obama, was a loud and frequent supporter of the 2006 Secure Fence Act and the need for strict border enforcement, as were many on both sides of the isle. He campaign on being strict on illegal immigration. Pretending support for border law enforcement and border barriers is a "racist dog whistle" is just ridiculous and ignorant of history.
