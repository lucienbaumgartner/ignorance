from an article posted in Yale review:

"Kerala’s successes are the result of a long history of division and struggle. Up through the 1900s, people in that area were bound by a rigidly inflexible caste system.  Subtleties of dress and speech “ensured that a person’s place in society could be recognized at a glance” (Jeffrey 1992).  These highly visible classifications in turn determined how wealth was distributed and how different social groups interacted.  Higher-caste groups were considered pure; they owned the land or were priests, while lower castes were relegated to the most menial labor and considered contaminated or polluted.  Though this system was in place throughout India, it was both particularly elaborate and exceedingly strict in Kerala.  In the nineteenth century, Indian reformer Swami Vivekananda called the region “a madhouse of caste” (Franke and Chasin 1994).  Chief among the restrictions imposed on the lowest castes were their inability to own land, interact with higher-caste individuals, or enter Hindu temples, but other instances of structural violence against lower-caste Keralites were innumerable and utterly pervasive.  These inequalities were doubly entrenched in tradition and religion in India, making them especially intractable.  However, as described later, education for critical consciousness works to counteract the systemized violence of the caste hierarchy by teaching people to question the system rather than just adapt to it.
  

  
The caste system epitomizes traditional authority, which social theorist Max Weber described as “resting on an established belief in the sanctity of immemorial traditions and the legitimacy of the status of those exercising authority under them” (1964).  Traditional authority differs from bureaucratic, or rational-legal authority in that it is historically derived.  Because of this, policies are determined by custom, or the whims of whoever custom selects to rule.  The utter lack of meritocracy in such a static caste society meant that edicts from the ruling class could only be enforced as long as the tradition on which they were grounded continued to prevail.  As challenges to the traditional system came in the form of the caste liberation movement, they also inspired challenges against the idea of top-down authority at all.  When the caste system finally fell, those who had been most disadvantaged by it had also learned that social and governmental structures were not infallible – that they could be agitated against.
  

  
Education played an important part in Kerala’s tremendous transition from a rigidly caste-divided society into one of India’s most egalitarian states.  Though the region historically had strong literacy rates, it was the early-1900s expansion of the education system into the countryside which paved the way for the mass mobilization and active citizenry which today define Kerala.  However, this early emphasis on vernacular schools (schools which taught in the native language, Malayalam) was actually implemented with much the opposite intention.  A Maharaja of Travancore explained the pro-education policies by saying, “a government which has to deal with an educated population is by far stronger than one which has to control ignorant and disorderly masses.  Hence education is a twice-blessed thing – it benefits those who give it and those who receive it” (Jeffrey 1992).  Though advocating for education, he and other elites believed it would lead to a less barbarous, easier to control populace.  In this case, limited knowledge about the effects of literacy and education, led decision-makers to implement policies with results almost diametrically opposite of what they intended, a phenomenon Robert Merton called “the unanticipated consequences of purposive social action” (1936).  Ironically, the very education reforms structured to make the populace easier to govern would help inform the radical movements which later swept Kerala.  This gap between expectations and results shows most clearly in the selection of Booker T. Washington’s Up from Slavery as a required text.  While educational authorities applauded “Washington’s emphasis on deference and slow, peaceful change,” low-caste Hindus read it as a manual for how to go about challenging their oppressive situation.  In this case, the maharajas were simply unable to fully understand the impact that the texts they selected would make, and because of this they never anticipated the revolutionary seeds their own purportedly placating school system would sow.
  

  
**The school system in Kerala directly challenged the traditions of the past.  It mixed the castes, even as it heightened awareness of ethnic identities by using them for scholarship distribution and other such organizational purposes.**  These hardened social identities challenged traditional modes of hierarchy and deference in Kerala, giving rise to a much larger movement.  Schools became a testing ground for little acts of rebellion, and as Gandhi’s nationalist non-cooperation movement swept the country, it found many student followers.  Rebellion was literally taught in class – teachers were paid little and irregularly, and they objected, noisily.  “From the mid-1930s, vigorous teachers’ unions spread new ideas and forms of protest into distant corners” (Jeffrey 1992).  This idea of dissent, of critically examining one’s situation and working to change it, strikes at the heart of structural violence, which perpetuates its injustice by being unnoticed.  For this reason, the very first movements of the educationally engaged Kerala citizens were to combat these systemic injustices, mostly through land reforms"

(Any state/ place with a literacy% of below 50% is abysmal)

And Kerala's "head start" has been nullified by the fact the state has no resources and is mountainous. 

also Delhi NCR had 61% literacy according to the earliest census plus it is a city but kerala still has a lower poverty rate.
