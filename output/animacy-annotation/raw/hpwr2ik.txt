I think you’re jumping the gun here. 

Also, don’t judge the mother for her autistic brother’s behaviour. The way he’s behaving is congruent with autism. He has sensory issues and problems regulating emotions because he has communication impairments. Many autistic kids and adults struggle with self-care DESPITE the best efforts of their parents. THAT’S PART OF THE CONDITION. 

Yes, she will likely end up as her brother’s caretaker. Have you even bothered to ask your girlfriend where her brother will end up as an adult? Answer is probably a group home for the neurodevelopmentally delayed. Honestly that autistic kid you described DOES NOT sound high functioning to me. 

If you marry her you will have to accept that she will likely have responsibilities to take care of her brother’s affairs but there’s nothing you have to do except be morally supportive of her. 

Also, if you loved her and could afford it why wouldn’t you shell out some money so her brother could have better living conditions. You realize there’s a 100% chance of him being abused where he ends up, right? 

God, you stink. You’re so ignorant and full of yourself.
