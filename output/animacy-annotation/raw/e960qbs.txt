&gt;If you think Trump has been a good president, you're an idiot.

He has worked hard to keep the promises that he made when campaigning. The same promises that he won the election on. If doing that makes you a "bad president" then what makes you a good one? NOT keeping any promises? Doing the opposite of what you said you would do? I've always thought that in a republic politicians should do what their constituents want them to do, do you disagree?

And if you disagree with all that bc "muh Trump supporters are all racists and uneducated bigots" then what about what he's done for the economy? He got our economy back to a level our previous president as well as Trump's opponent and all of their economists told us was impossible. I believe that to be a good thing for a president to do.

To say that you are an idiot to think that Trump has been a good president is beyond biased and ignorant. That means there is literally no good argument or even halfway decent argument to be made that he has done a good job, and clearly, plenty intelligent arguments can be made that he has done a "good job."

You can disagree with the arguments, or even have a better argument about how he's really the worst president of all time. But that doesn't mean there aren't also good arguments to be made that he has been a good president. And if there are good arguments to be made, then not everyone who believes those arguments are idiots.

That seems pretty simple to understand, but why don't you point out to me where I'm wrong and show me why "anyone who thinks Trump has been a good president is an idiot." Should be easy, seeing as how much smarter you are than me.
