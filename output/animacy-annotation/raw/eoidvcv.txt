lmao. You are literally a parody of yourself.

Socialism is defined as the collective ownership of the means of production. All that means is that the workers own the full worth of the labour they produce, Wealth redistribution has nothing to do with it. You have literally learned everything you know from right-wing strawman arguments against socialism and it shows.

Never mind that i never said that the bank bailouts were capitalist, but suggesting that anything to do with handing millions of dollars extracted from the labour of workers to banks is 'socialist' is so laughable and ignorant that it's just hilarious.
