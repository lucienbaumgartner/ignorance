You're wrong, both about the law and video. You read a headline that says the video exists so you think it's true. You didn't bother watching the video or actually reading the article, because then you'd know that it's a "voice that sounds like kyle rittenhouse," not a video of kyle rittenhouse. 

&gt;This discussion isn't going anywhere

Of course not. You have already swallowed the media tales of this kid and have no room in your gullet for new ideas or information. 

&gt;If it isn't illegal it should be. 

I feel like this whole conversation is akin to talking to an afghani about why it isn't the woman's fault for being raped just because of her short skirt. Your opinion about how our society should work is ignorant and irrelevant. We have our culture and laws where being armed in public is legal in many places. Rittenhouse was in a place where it was legal to carry a rifle on the street. Saying he was attacked for his own legal actions is simple victim blaming.
