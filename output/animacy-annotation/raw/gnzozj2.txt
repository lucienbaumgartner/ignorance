I served in the United States Army for several years. I have friends, family, loved ones whom have also served in this country - some of which never made it back home alive.

1.) The military is extremely under-funded. I went on several tours where the equipment I was using to get the job done was quite a bit older than I was. Fortunately, it seems the enemy in these shitty places we get deployed to are so poorly trained and ignorant that a line of good soldiers has little trouble resolving the scenario. Sometimes the safest place to stand is directly in front of them.

2.) "Military is killing innocent people"? You spout off such a thing - so now I challenge you to back it up with proof. I cannot think of a single soldier I served with that ever took pleasure in taking a life and we damn sure don't go around willy-nilly taking out innocent lives. We simply did our jobs as we were asked. This is why most soldiers hate to be asked "did you kill anyone?" Not your business - but it is part of the job when it has to be.

3.) Here is a hypothetical that may or may not be taken from actual experience. You are in a town clearing buildings because intel suggests there may be a very dangerous person of interest that needs to be located and/or relieved from duty permanently. You turn down a back-alley and are suddenly faced with what looks to be a boy around the age of 10 - maybe 12 at the most. He has hate in his eyes, a weapon in his hands and he begins to lift it towards you.

Who pulls the trigger first? 

Until you are actually in a position that is even REMOTELY like this and have to make the call - you are in no position whatsoever to question the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces.

What they deserve is a thank you. Not some asshole questioning why.
