I am not a book reader, but I didn't like this season. It felt like it had the writing standards of a sitcom with all the creativity of a soap opera. Like 50% of the plot was motivated by miscommunication or a lack of communication. The first episode was great, but after that, it just fell into a series of predictable steps that got more and more irritating with every episode.

Was this even the same writing team as season 1? In episode 4, there were like 6 instances where Geralt almost found out Yen was alive but didn't because that wouldn't have been good for the plot, half of Ciri's motivations are just "you don't want _ so I'm doing _", altogether so much of it was contrived. Halfway through, I jokingly said to someone "this is so soapy I'm half expecting Ciri's dead parents to show up and be the enemy all Darth Vader style" and WHAT DO YOU KNOW. 

So much of the plot could have been amazing if the writing weren't so shit. When you have to rely on characters being ignorant and useless (which is essentially the plot for all three of our protagonists; Geralt doesn't know what to do, Ciri is trying to train because she's not good enough, Yen lost her powers) to have the plot, it's not good. I don't know if this is because of the source material or if it's just the show, but either way, I'm very, very disappointed. 

Can someone who's read the books give me some insight?
