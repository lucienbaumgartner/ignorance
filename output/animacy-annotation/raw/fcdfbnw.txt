He tries to defend cheap shitty turntables that sound terrible and destroy records.

Just look at any video of his where he fetishes crosley cruisers, lp60s and their respective clones. Anyone with a brain and ears knows how terrible they are but he deliberately tries to convince the new and ignorant that they're safe and acceptable turntables.

His absolute devotion to cheap turntables borders on mental illness and is very confusing for members of this sub. As far as he is concerned if you use anything better quality than an lp60 you're an elitist.

Some have suggested there is a political agenda behind this but I think he literally just doesn't have good ears.

I think the truth is he can't hear the difference between a damaged record or cheap stylus and can't hear wow and flutter. But rather than simply acknowledge to himself that he has bad ears he insists that the rest of us are delusional and intentionally pushes people towards these crap turntables.
