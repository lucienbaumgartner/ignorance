I listened to some of it and it sounded like he was repeating himself over a few times so I can give you the general gist. 

The YouTube video linked is a commentator reading out the transcript of the real tape. The video IS NOT the actual recording. 

The tape is meant to be played to a woman after they have been captured. It starts off by the killer saying that the woman is probably scared and unaware of what will happen. He explains in detail that the woman will be abused and why. 
He also explains what will happen if the woman does not cooperate. 

That’s most of what I got. You can get an idea of what was said by reading about it in the wiki. The place where the women were kept was filled with ‘tools’ and such. An extremely graphic description was made in the audio tape. The room was also soundproofed.
