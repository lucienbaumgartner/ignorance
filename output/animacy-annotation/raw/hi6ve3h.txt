No. No I wouldn’t. 100% of the calls I receive from unknown number is spam. 100%. If the number is unfamiliar I’m more inclined to answer, but if “unknown number” show up I’m not answering it ever. It’s 100% spam so why would I think it’s any different then? That stuff comes at inopportune times to begin with.

People like you are woefully optimistic and ignorant of the reality of life.
