This is barely inexcusable racism. 

1. "National IQ" isn't a fucking thing, you're not going to judge millions of people because of a source that most likely didn't do IQ tests for a representative portion of the population says that the average data they show is higher than other countries. 

2. "Russian Rape brings down IQ", you know how fucking vile and ignorant of a statement this is? Even if the Russians did commit mass sexual assault to the scale that it would significantly change the genetics of actual Kazakhs (not just the Russians who are in Kazakhstan), why would a "Russian" just fundamentally have a lower IQ than a Kazakh person?
