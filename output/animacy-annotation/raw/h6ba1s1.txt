No, you're not being sensitive at all. 

People saying shit like "oh I'm so depressed today" or "my OCD is kicking in" have absolutely no idea of how insensitive and ignorant that is.
OCD, PD's, depressions etc keep some people from functioning. It holds them back, it ruins relationships, lives, in some cases isolates them completely. 

When people throw serious mental disorders around to describe "everyday feelings" it invalidates those of us who live with this shit every single day.
We don't feel depressed or avoidant for a day and the next we're cheerful and ready to take on the world. 

There's so many other words they can use to describe their feelings, moods, emotions etc; serious mental diagnoses are not adjectives.

/Rant done.
