&gt; Yeah, people over here just don't care. That's the main issue. NI is either an oddity that's interesting to chat about or a nuisance people don't know about, that's all it is to the English at least. 

&gt;And on the other side is Britain, an island that's so apathetic and unaware of Northern Ireland that it may as well be some micro-state in the Balkans for all people know about it.

Not to defend that, since personally I think it is important that people learn about the world around them, but I think one reason for that is that it's pretty easy to tell the story of Kosovo to an interested observer in a way that's fairly neutral and makes Britain seem broadly decent. Northern Ireland though? There just seems, from the outside, to be so much disagreement about everything, and everything seems wholly alien.

Certainly if you ask some people to tell you "so what's the deal with Northern Ireland? You know, in general?", they'll end up telling you that the British Army are murderers and terrorist attacks are okay sometimes within minutes. So you go to the other side, and they tell that the Earth is six thousand years old, homosexuality is sinful and for some reason it's important to wear orange and talk about King William, and that basically uses up the time a normal person is willing to devote to learning about Northern Ireland. And they walk away more perplexed than before, more convinced than ever that the whole thing is a write-off. 

And, of course, neither side really represents the ordinary person there who's just like the ordinary pedaon *anywhere*.

Though if political team A toned down the "British army are murderers" rhetoric and team B could tone down the crazy old fashioned religion rhetoric, yeah, maybe people from outside would take more of an interest.

But for now, the learning curve is just too steep, the threshold for taking offence too low and the assumption of good faith too rare.
