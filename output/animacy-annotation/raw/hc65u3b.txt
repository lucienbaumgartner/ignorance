Judging by the consensus posts here clearly there’s no other history teachers here familiar with the nuremburg code rising from nazi camp experiments without consent? The concept of informed concept is fairly crucial to medical ethics and the implications for society if all teachers are this narrow minded and ignorant of history is that we may again suffer from fasicistic impinging on human rights…the Australian constitution prohibits conscription of medical procedures, judging by the comments noone is even aware of our basic legal human rights framework? There are currently court challenges in the NSW supreme court testing the lawfulness of NSW mandates in this regard. Might be premature to quit over this. 
Vaccinated legal studies/hsie teacher here.
