Thanks for posting those sources. I have similar ones for US Covid patients, itâ€™s the number one reference I make when I am forced into having a conversation with an anti vaxxer. 

I absolutely agree with everything you said, though I also think what the Ryanair exec said is extreme. I think that was his point though. I think we should be tougher on the unvaccinated for making an ignorant and selfish decision, but, there is a line we cannot cross and the type of action he is talking about is well past that line.
