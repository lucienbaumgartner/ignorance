Loki's power comes partly from being an ice giant, and partly from his sorcery (which he seems to have learned from Frigga). However his effectiveness as a villain is primarily from his manipulative skills. He couldn't beat Odin in a straight fight, but getting him so that he's tired, emotional and unaware and then making his move is a whole other matter.
