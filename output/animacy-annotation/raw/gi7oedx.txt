A Daring Synthesis starts out with Greg performing a show, where he caricatures Asian martial artists.  He cracks homophobic and racist jokes.  He’s an asshole.

Greg Veder vs the World is little better.

I wish people wouldn’t turn him into a caricature of unpleasant people.  He’s a geek with poor social skills.  That doesn’t make him racist or sexist, it makes him insensitive and unaware of social cues.  But for some reason ‘making racist/sexist/ableist jokes’ is shorthand for ‘poor social skills’.
