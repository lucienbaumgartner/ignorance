Ah, you must be cis and white and unaware of your privilege.  That's ok, it can be learned.  Check out r/Anarchy101,and  r/Anarchism,  for information and answers to questions on these topics, there are lots of other cools subs about issues with police too.  Not everything is a solved issue, and no I don't expect a perfect society, only a better, kinder one with less authoritarianism.
