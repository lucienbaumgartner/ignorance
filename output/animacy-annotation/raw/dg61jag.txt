THIS IS MY OPINION, and only that.

Wood and Wagner both wanted Walken.  

Walken ended up with Wagner. Wood was jealous and despondent.

Drunk, she took her own life, stumbling around and bruising her lower extremities.

Walken and Wagner were embarrassed and angry because they were getting busy with each other.

The dinghy wasn't used because she got in it and let it go, and it floated away in the dark. She could have tried to swim back to the yacht, or she let herself drown.


Drunk people, as I have seen, can be incredibly unaware and stupid.

**Edited to add: I don't get the down votes. They were doing something that they obviously were not willing to talk about, or they (one or both) murdered her. Either they were negligent for a very good reason and did not wish to tell the world while a woman they both liked ended up drowning, or they murdered/compliant in her murder.

But because I said they were mutually attracted to each other at a time where being in a tryst like this would end careers, I get down voted? 

It's my opinion. I had no idea this was a rumour.

So, fine then. Remove the homosexual tryst and cause for her to go into the dinghy.  Say they were doing mountains of blow. Or were finger painting. I don't care. I think there was an argument, they went off to play Pong, and she retired, in her drunken state, to do something she shouldn't have.

The real mystery is what they were doing, if they weren't killing her.

That's why I said opinion.

Oh well. Here's my return reeeeee.
