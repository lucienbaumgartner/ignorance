Coming a little late to the party here. My oldest brother had dick friends in highschool. He was very gullible and they were tools. So one of their buddies had recently moved away and a mew family had moved into the house. They knew this but I guess my brother did not. They told him to come over and that they were all in the basement of said friends house. He went straight over and let himself inside and started to just walk through their house like nothing. He is also pretty unaware and awkward. Gave the family a good scare. The father of the house was a built guy(I think he was a football coach?) my brother is lucky they were nice but a little shocked, and that he seemed harmless enough to talk to instead of attacking. Could have gone bad really fast.
