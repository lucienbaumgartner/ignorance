&gt;I also believe in the science of natural immunity and see higher risk in taking the vaccine after surviving covid just fine. I dont have any fear of death from catching covid and the only risk i see is getting an inflamed heart from the vaccine.

This opinion is incredibly dense and ignorant, and I literally don't know where to begin, because every bit of this statement so flagrantly misinformed. This is where I think you're a dumb hick.

&gt;When tech giants conspire to censor vaccine information and how vaccine side effects have been actively covered you loose my trust.

There's where the "conspiracy against you" bit came from, you literally buying into a conspiracy.

Fuck you're dumb. Can't even read what you wrote.
