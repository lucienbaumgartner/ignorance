It takes too long to get to nature from the big city i live in, costs too much in gas and time, sure it feels good and relaxing to be in nature, but i can get that from entertainment mediums as well.  Quests in games gives you a feeling of being needed, of helping people, learning things, exploring, and feeling accomplished at a much lower cost then driving a couple hours to go outside and walk around.

Nature is great, so are video games, nature is not a reason to get rid of video games, and video games are not a reason to ignore nature, both can exist simultaneously, both have good qualities and things to provide.  I would be more supportive of this sub and the post if it were talking about moderation, rather than banning, banning i think is ignorant and authoritative.  To me video games are like interactive books, and since i have aphantasia i can play a game and have actual visuals to go along with the stories being told.  Are you going to ban movies and books too?
