I disagree and agree with most people here. While I wouldn't say what you write makes no sense, the way you describe things makes it clear that one of three things is going on:

1. You are a normal person, but very uneducated and unaware of how the world works.

2. You have minor mental issues, excarceberated by your abusive parents. I think this is the most likely one, seeing as your parents also appear to have mental / behavioral issues. The best thing for you to do in this case is to get a lawyer, move out and get the hell away from your parents. Also, get a therapist for yourself. From your writing and comments, it's pretty hard to believe you are neurotypical. As others said, you come across as paranoid, and slightly delusional. This may not be you, but it is how you seem to us.

3. You are significantly mentally ill and delusional of what is happening. Honestly, I don't buy it. I don't think you are schizophrenic, I don't think you belong in a ward, I don't think you're that bad. If you truly were as ill as claimed, this situation would be playing out differently, and you would not have had your diagnosis undone by a court. I think, again, you have issues, but your biggest issue are your parents being manipulative and seemingly abusive. 

So yeah, get away from your parents, get a lawyer and get a therapist.
