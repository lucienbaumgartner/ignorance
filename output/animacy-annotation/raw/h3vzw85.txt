Nope, I'm not strong. I did the whole suicidal ideation when i was really young and unaware of what my life could be like. If anything, i was more scared of upsetting my parents, which is really a pretty shitty indictment of my strength of character, or my amount of pain. I wussed out, lol.

You really should watch the video i linked. It's incredibly painful, but it's definitely informative. Even if it doesn't change your mind on writing the story, it will definitely inform the way you look at the choice.
