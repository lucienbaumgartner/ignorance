Kilindi Iyi !

Did you try? How can you say it's distressing?

I believe what I've experienced, not more not less....I would recommend this to you as well!

We will understand nothing, did you ever try to bite your own teeth or to see your own eyes with a reflection on a surface?

It's not about intellectual understanding, this happens on a much more profound level.

We (all of us, humanity) has become so arrogant and ignorant that we would not see the meaning of life or what one may think is behind this whole circus even if it is presented to us on a silver plate.... I guessðŸ˜‚

And please do not take me serious, don't want to harm the identification objects/structures of anybody here....
