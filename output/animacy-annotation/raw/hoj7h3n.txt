Lol, thank you for continuing to be unaware and arrogant it's actually really funny for me. I didn't say you're entire country. There's lots of well educated people, but the odds of you being one of them are pretty slim overall. Not sure why you think GDP makes you educated or intelligent. That thinking needs to stop that's why the rich run everything and people like you just bend over and take it up the ass, so you can be proud that where you live is worth money and nothing else.
