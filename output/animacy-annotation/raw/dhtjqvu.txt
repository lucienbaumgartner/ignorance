I knew a few Bernie voters who foolishly backed Clinton saying they didn't want the Supreme Court to swing, even though they didn't like Clinton.  

Some people can't help but get swayed by the MSM.  They're banking on people to trust them, it's all about creating the "unaware and compliant citizenry."
