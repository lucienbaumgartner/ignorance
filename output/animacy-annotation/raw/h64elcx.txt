It’s not frowned upon because MCC is meant to be “for fun”, not sure why I see so many people using this argument. 

There is no problem with being sweaty by practicing more, the issue is that people are practicing on a server that went directly against Scott and Noxcrew’s wishes( they have publicly stated that they do not want public recreations of their games), and by doing so are disrespecting their wishes as well. 

As cpk mentioned in this stream, the whole point of the practice server was to stop players from practicing on other servers(again because Scott and Noxcrew did not want public recreations to gain traction). 

So yes, this is an issue that hopefully can be resolved as quickly as possible(or already has been). Perhaps some of these players were newer and unaware that it went against their wishes, and if so I don’t blame them for that, but they knowingly did so, I think it’s justified to put their morality into question.
