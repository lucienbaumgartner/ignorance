Because 'white male anger' as some disambiguated force motivating 'racism' or 'sexism' is gibberish. The anger (even if it is misdirected) is caused by the political and economic changes that have been going on for the last fifty years. By stating that 'white males' as simply pissed off that they can't rape or lynch black people anymore is so insulting and ignorant that it's actually harmful.

You're also assuming that poor or working class males have that much 'privilege' in the first place. What privilege they did have was won through collective action and an understanding of their own class position facilitated by mass industry which brought them all together. This is now gone and with it so has the political power of the working classes as a whole. This sort of reductionist nonsense that simply boils all the social and economic changes in society down to 'angry white men just want to rape and abuse black people' will ultimately lead to further fragmentation and decline within the working class whether they're black, white, male or female.
