Just wanna drop in and say, I/we really appreciate your work and ability to break it down for those of use who are oblivious and unaware of the rules of the trade and your ability to deduce and show the criminal acts taking place. Before all of this I kinda figured that crimes were apart of the business but you and many others here have really shown how much of a fraudulent system we live day in and day out with. I’ve learned more stuff that has led to more questions and more reading (something I loathe doing) up on how they’ve been blatantly stealing money from good businesses and regular everyday folk. Showing, not just telling us how to cut off the fuel to their criminal activity helps out so much for those of us who can’t visualize it. Thank you u/Criand and others who take the time out of your busy lives to help us understand the markets
