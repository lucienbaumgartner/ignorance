What makes you think their public legislative agenda was their real one?

This same scenario has happened basically every single time Democrats have had anything close to legislative power. There is *always* some blue-dog or other right-wing democrat, or group of them, there to screw it up and they're *always* rewarded for it. That doesn't happen because democratic politicians are dumb and ignorant of history. It happens because that's the plan.
