Mora bowed with mock sincerity. “And you, Robert.” 

*Well, this has been fun, but I have been reading a really fascinating book on the history of warfare in the high passes. After that I can work a bit more on my sketches of the mountain ridge line.*

Mora smiled at Lord Dayne. “Thank you for bringing me to meet Robert, my lord.  He is the sister of my brother’s new wife, so we are family in a way.  I have been learning about certain aspects of trade in the free cities, where one might intentionally take advantage of one’s own kin, in a way that will deceive a third party into believing it is getting a good deal on the price of goods.  From what I understand, it is better if the family member is actually unaware and unwilling to ascertain the plot.  It is good to know that I have the family for such a ploy if I ever need it.”

Behind her back, mora’s hand poked Clarrise in the midsection.
