I'm sure each of us are idiots and hold biases that make us look ignorant and unreasonable. Truly, we all do. I just assumed that most people's stupid would show up in things like scrabble, and Jeopardy. Maybe the other group's issues would be with not being able to make a chair or milk a cow. Instead, we got, "I won't utilize the bare minimum levels of protective measures for me and/nor my family during a deadly pandemic. I know people who have died personally while fighting for their life in the hospital. If I get it, I, too, will go to the hospital to hope for salvation. I just can't trust science or the medical community! If Jesus wants me to live, I will!"

I mean, sure. No hypocrisy or stupidity there!
