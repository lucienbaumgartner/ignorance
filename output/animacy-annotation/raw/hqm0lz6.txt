I think that you and the other person are the same individual. It's strange how you appeared when the other person stopped replying.

 Actually I didn't think Heylodom's comments were ignorant and incoherent I thought the other person sounded somewhat deranged because saying that they don't want this or that person appearing on a show is irrelevant and shows quite a high level of conceit.

I'm not sure how writing that one wants to stay away from the interpersonal drama of well known personalities is "devoid of intelligence". The individual you're replying to didn't make any claims, he or she stated an opinion and some idiot was arguing about how they want it known that they won't watch a show under certain conditions, as if anyone cares. Is the Earth going to blow up if the person does watch? Are you all going to die of heartbreak? Get real.
 
It would be really nice if people like you (and what I assume is your other account or personal friend) could comprehend that the internet isn't your family or town and everyone on it is not obliged to give a damn about your opinions let alone READ them. Also opinions and claims are not the same thing.

Please get some help for that historic personality disorder ASAP.
