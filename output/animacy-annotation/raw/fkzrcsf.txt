I think I can elaborate on the departure comment; traditionally FF games tend to develop the world first then write the characters around that. XIII though is focused on developing their characters first and they don't bother with the world very much at all. Older FF games, especially ones made in the 90s, often show what a big impact the events have on the world itself but in XIIIs case it seems the world at large is unaware and unaffected by the events of the story. The main cast definitely is affected but I'm sure the population of Cocoon barely cared until the place almost dropped. To make a long point short XIII is basically the opposite of how stories are usually told in FF games, of you want a good example of the opposite extreme XIIs cast by and large has little development but the world and its politic get waaayyy to much screentime.
