&gt; He's a dirty politician but he isn't evil.

If when you choose to behave in a way that endangers others lives just because you want to get back at someone for something legitimate they did to you isn't evil, then what is? Flaying a puppy?

Chris Christie shut down that bridge unnecessarily just as a sophisticated middle finger raise, like a child who is upset for getting called out on their misbehavior and throws a tantrum. Closing that bridge was an enourmous tantrum. Active ambulances got stuck in that traffic. Chris Christie can't be so dumb and unaware that he didn't consider that, and if he didn't, then he was so filled with hate that it distracted reasonable judgment from him. He would be just as scary as Trump being President.

I mean, are my standards for evil absurdly low or something?

edit: missed a thought
