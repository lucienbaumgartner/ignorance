I know a lot of people believe this, or sort of believe this, but this is such a stupid theory. It assumes that a) there is a higher level world, that b) it is possible to create AI so advanced that it can be self aware AND unaware that it is actually AI, c) that the “base reality” has any resemblance to the simulations, and that d) that the simulation happens to be the world we are living in. 

There is no possible way to know if any of those assumptions are true, or even assign odds to them. None of them are possible with our current technology, even theoretically. (Chess computers are just running every imaginable move min/max formula, not actually thinking creatively). 

What gets me is that certain circles look down on the idea of God, but if you reframe it as “a very intelligent computer” all of sudden the exact same idea is very scientific and advanced, even though both are equally unprovable.
