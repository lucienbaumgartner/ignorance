Far too often I’m accused of lying or suppressing the truth, and when I’m not accused of that, it’s other accusations of lies where when I say I used to be a real Christian who thought he had genuine experiences with god and a personal relationship with god, I’m lying because if that was true, I couldn’t have become atheist. Presups love to accuse atheists of lying, and even Christians who aren’t presups like to accuse atheists at best of being naive and unaware that we subconsciously suppress the truth.
