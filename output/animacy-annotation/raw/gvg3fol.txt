&gt;  I still can't comprehend why they just can't ~~use reminders and alarms to get them through their day~~ not

this is a little bit ableist my dude

for the same reason it's difficult for neurotypical people to understand depression and how it sucks the life and will to do anything out of someone, and why "just cheer up" might seem like useful advice to someone who's been sad but never actually been clinically depressed

the reasons people with ADD/ADHD struggle to be on time regularly, maintain motivation on longer tasks, or struggle to remember what seem like obvious details or important tasks to neurotypical people, will never be comprehensible to someone who hasn't actually experienced it

the important thing to know is that these are not simply bad habits that can be broken by persistence, mental health disorders are caused by abnormalities in the brain or brain chemistry - they're real, verifiable medical conditions that cause people to think and act differently from "neurotypical" people. drugs and therapy work for some people, and for others they might not

and while you might think that your friend who has ADD is just late all the time because they don't respect you or your time, and how can they be so care-free and ignorant of the disrespect and inconvenience they cause everyone around them, i assure you - they are aware and they hate it and themselves every time it happens

which means "idk, why don't you just *do* the thing you're struggling to do?" is not only not productive, it's offensive
