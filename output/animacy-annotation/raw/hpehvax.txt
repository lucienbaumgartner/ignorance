LOL at family being there one way or another for trans kids. My parents certainly have not been there for me. They cut me off financially and emotionally when I came out as trans. A decade later, they still don't use my pronouns. 

Trans youth suicidality is in large part due to lack of support from parents. Same with astronomical rates of youth homelessness in the trans community. To pretend like someone being family means they will be a safe space is ignorant and dangerous.
