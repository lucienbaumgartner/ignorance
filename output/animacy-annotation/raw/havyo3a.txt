I believe that an important thing to do, especially as a teacher, is helping your students to identify fascism. We've got plenty of examples of neo-fascism blending into democratic societies, hiding its roots, symbols and true ideology and luring unaware and uneducated people. 

Being capable of labelling these criminal tendencies and sometimes hidden intentions helps your students being aware of dangerous groups and ideologies, because such groups will do everything in their hand to hide what they really are.
