I think you're drawing some strange conclusions, primarily by insinuating that due to the lovecraft stories, that warcraft is based on them.  For starters, the names and depictions of the old gods are borrowed depictions.  C'thun != Cthulhu, Yogg-Saron != Yog-Sothoth, etc etc.  Similarly, our planet is not the father of old gods.  It is strongly hinted that old gods are all over the universe, and our old gods have simply come from elsewhere.  It is not as if Azeroth spawned the Old Gods.

So, that part out of the way - the Pantheon is not able to destroy the old gods.  Resetting Azeroth is no exception to this.  Alganon dialogue is not indicative of titan capabilities.  If they were able to kill Old Gods without consequence (example of consequence; Y'shaarj) - then that would have been done when Titans first settled the planet, instead of simply imprisoning them.

So for the idea to be "The Pantheon are a threat to all life on Azeroth" - that is simply incorrect.  That would imply that the Pantheon are ignorant and unaware that simply destroying azeroth would not actually destroy old gods.

Now, we currently assume that the Pantheon is just not aware of all the shit going on with Sargeras or the Old Gods awakening on Azeroth.  If they did, they would be on their way to resolve it.  So "something" has to call out to the Titans, and say "Hey shits going awry over here, can you come help?"

Things that would not send that beacon:

* Sargeras
* Old Gods
* Burning Legion
* Elementals

Things that WOULD ask for help if needed:

* Citzens of Azeroth

"Oh hey you guys needed help?  Okay well let's obliterate you even though it won't solve the problem and we should rightly know that" - This is probably not how that encounter would go down, because its a dumb idea.

So there you have it - the Pantheon is not a threat because they aren't mindless golems.
