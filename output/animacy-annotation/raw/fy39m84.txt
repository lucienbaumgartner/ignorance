Oh man that reminds me. 
He had veneers. 
He said growing up he had “skinny teeth” and was always embarrassed to have his photo taken. 

So he said he had them filed down and veneers put on. 
He was diligent about brushing and flossing. 

And he was always self conscious about the base of his teeth being grey.
In retrospect he probably had posts (implants) put in. 

Which means he probably lost all his (upper) teeth. Not sure how (maybe they got knocked out). 

He used both our dental plans to get his teeth replaced and hide the grey. They made them extra white so he’s a bit self conscious of it now. He never put me on his. Not important but kind of disappointing in a small way. 

He worked in construction so it wasn’t the most hospitable environment to same sex couples. That’s how he always had money to use, and gamble, and pay rent. Basically blow money on whatever. No savings. 

I helped him get clean and squared away. After we broke up he sent me a photo of the house he bought to show me what he did without my help. 

He has a mean streak. I blame the drugs. They make you unaware and forgetful, hurtful and neglectful, self centred and guarded, retaliation. 

I went to see him after 6 years and a lot of personal development, and it was really a lesson in perception. Left feeling shook and she’ll shocked.
