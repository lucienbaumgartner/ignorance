This is a bad view. First, there are no 100%s in science. Never. Even if you show how some explanation is the only solution in your model, your model can be false.

But we don’t go around qualifying every thing we state. We say “I went into the office yesterday”, not “I seem to have pretty recent memories of going into what I think was my office but it’s possible I am suffering from a mental condition that misidentifies imagination as recent memory or that I mistakenly identified one of the other buildings in that industrial complex as mine own.”

In this case, there’s likely an incident in their mind where someone later identified with Covid was maskless in their grandparent’s presence before they had symptoms. It’s possible the chances of this person being the source are only 67% and there are a hundred other possibilities with less than a percent chance each. You don’t point and go “see! This kid don’t know for sure!” Do you know why? BECAUSE THIS PERSON WITHOUT A MASK THAT HAD COVID STILL DID SOMETHING HORRIBLY WRONG, SELFISH, AND IGNORANT THAT PUT SOMEONE AT RISK WHO DIED OF COVID. 

The point isn’t wrong just because we live limited lives with no possible certainty in anything. We still can talk about what we think was the likely reality and be making accurate points of what decisions are good or bad.
