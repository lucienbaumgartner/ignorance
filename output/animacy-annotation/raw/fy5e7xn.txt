Well i’ve been proven wrong.

Some people are just so stubborn and ignorant that they will just straight up refuse to not put glass in the ice. Irresponsible not to mention against health code.

I’m assuming there is an ice scoop right there, so it’s true you are just too lazy to use it?

IMO refusing to follow simple health code should get your ass fired.
