Bad neighbours are the most frustrating thing! If you're at a movie theatre, restaurant, store or even at work, if people are being ignorant and indifferent or hostile, you know you can leave at some point. But home is where you go to get away from all that. It's your *sanctuary*. Or supposed to be your sanctuary. 

My self absorbed, full of himself, lawn-braggy neighbour has dumped tons of water on my narrow pathway near the foundation of my house not infrequently, once just before a night freeze that turned it into a ice path. Oops! It was an accident! Won't happen again! I promise. He makes me feel on edge and defensive and protective of my house. Some part of me feels like some part of him secretly enjoys this. I really lost my shit with him once which feels crappy because I feel like I'm a generally reasonable person.
