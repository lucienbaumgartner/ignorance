Because I believe things that don't make sense to us can at least be understood and heard, you know? Regardless of is she was my sister or not, or even Dolezal. I at least always try to understand why people are they way they are and do the things they do, not to make excuses but to have the right to say that I at least tried to understand them.  She's nothing like Dolezal, Dolezal was malicious, my sister was just lonely and ignorant.   


And I love you to.
