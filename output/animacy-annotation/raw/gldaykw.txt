The people actually live in Westview; Wanda took over the whole town and manipulated the minds of the surrounding area (including Eastview) to make outsiders not interfere.

"It's all Wanda" is Monica's view. She wasn't in many scenes so she hasn't seen everything. When Wanda loses focus while thinking of Pietro Monica wakes up and makes her inferences about the fantasy and the reality there. Then she sees Wanda's reaction to an injection of reality, and concludes it's all Wanda. But it's not all Wanda, if the story is meant to follow the similar plot from the comics, which the MCU never guarantees. Someone, canonically Mephisto, with Agatha's help, is inducing her to have the twins so he can take the twins from her. This will be the trauma on top of trauma that breaks Wanda apart, and she will break the universe apart in response. Whether that makes Mephisto the key villain in the next phase, or it's her, is not guessable yet, although the intel about the next Dr Strange movie does allow the latter.

Puppet master is right. If Vision is dead, he's nothing but a puppet. **She even puts him on a literal string in the magic show scene!** His actions when he's out of view of her are still controlled by her, as are the whole town's. But she acts unaware and even surprised when her puppets say things to her. Whether this is a split-personality problem or part of Mephisto's puppeting her, again is yet to be revealed.
