&gt;The elite want to establish more state control under the guise of socialism, yes.

I'm sure that is some, but that is why people need to come to the understanding that the problem is authoritarianism more than anything. Socialism is an extremely broad term and can be anything from stalinism to most forms of anarchy. 

&gt;Kind of a rough thing to say about people based solely on having that specific income. Class hatredy.

Well, considering conservatives are the ones who have traditionally openly hated LGBTQ people, pushed against women's rights, been openly racist, and have denied or simply not cared about climate change...

I don't think conservatives have any right to complain about being hated unless they are both uneducated and ignorant of the implications of the movements they associate themselves with.

Tell me, what reasons do poor people like myself have to not hate rich conservatives? "Jobs" doesn't work.
