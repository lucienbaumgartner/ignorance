I didn't say he's a race traitor  or a traitor to his sexuality but it definitely  doesn't make   much sense to support those who are actively trying to hurt us. Rightwinglgbt is a very niche group , and other conservatives won't have those pseudorightwingpositions.(assuming  rightwinglgbt is always for themselves and doesn't have bullshit  bigoted opinions about themselves which isn't always the case) Now sweety of course  you can be whatever the hell you want,and if you don't mind the homophobia, be  in  as many rightwing groups as you like, but the fact remains  that conservatives are not your nor POC's allies. And don't  get mad when gay people  look at you weirdly  if  you blurt  out some right wing talking point  about  gay/bi people, or when/if you become the next Steven Crowder/Milo Yipopudapulis. As for "do they all hate minorities?"  When we're talking about conservatives and not full on Nazis, they at the very least  have some biases and  are somewhat bigoted, but at the most are so bigoted and ignorant that they are almost fascists. Depends if we're talking about lukewarm conservatives or extreme/ish. Hilariously enough, even gay nazis existed(Ermst RÃ¶hm) and he didn't have a great time when Hitler rose to power. So you can notlikeothergirl and   try to be their friend as much  as you like or be the next  Dave Rubin  but it ain't gonna do  you any good.(Except Koch money if you're Dave). But even then, the most you can grab is for yourself, not for the group as a whole, which  might be why gays might not be fans.  Jeez,  now I totally gaybrosbookclubbed this.
