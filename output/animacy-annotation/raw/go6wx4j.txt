Fascism is idealizes a heroic (and largely fictional) past; that's why the Nazis funded a ton of archeology\* and Mussolini dusted off a Roman title (*duce* from *dux, ducis* meaning "leader, general") for himself.

\* which often turned into an excuse for weird sex stuff, but the thought counts I guess?

You're correct that the Democrats are the "do nothing" party but that's because they're *neoliberals* - a kind of centrist, free-market, technocratic, vaguely feel-good politics of not worrying too much about all the rich people in power and the seemingly unending parade of overseas warfare.

Neoliberalism *sucks,* but you really do need to think critically so you don't get suckered in to a cult of strong-man personality, and vague bullshit about "making fill-in-the-blank-istan great again" by deporting insert-minority-here.

That's what I don't get about Trumpism. It is the most obvious paint-by-numbers reboot of fascism ever - are people *really* so gullible and unaware of world history?
