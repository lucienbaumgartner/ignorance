I dunno... Highly overrated decade in my opinion. I enjoyed the explosive excess of the '80s and I enjoyed the technological frontiers of the early 2000s, but the 90s were all neon greens crappy sugary food and bad sitcoms with laugh tracks. '90s really felt like we took the excess of the '80s to an extreme but we're completely naive and unaware of what it would create, we also had a little bit of technology but not enough to make our lives easier just enough to make our lives fun. '90s cars are also pretty terrible they were bulky and heavy and ate a lot of gas, they just weren't fun to drive. 

One of the things I do remember about the '90s that I look back on fondly is that it felt like the pinnacle of film. I don't mean movies I mean physical film, what you produce photographs and movies on. The technology reached the zenith in that decade as we were slowly transitioning to digital photography and filmography. But when you look back at movies in the '90s the crisp clear perfect perception that this '90s film grain created was unimaginably nostalgic.
