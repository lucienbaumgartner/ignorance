It's definitely just my opinion but I always give MMA fighters more credit for the means to survive than boxers, because if an MMA fighter gets blindsided all the sudden he's on the ground, he would know how to finish them off with BJJ or grappling. Boxers will rely solely on their hands and footwork. It's annoying when a boxer things it's just men humping each other. Of course that happens on some occasion, but some of these boxing guys are completely unaware and ignorant of the skills these MMA guys have.
