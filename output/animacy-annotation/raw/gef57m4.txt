I'm really tired of this. WFH has gotten old and I miss talking to people at the office and the cafeteria workers. The WFH deadline got switched to April. I hate every minute and I have to drive around town every day to get out of the house. Also, my mom was injured so I'm taking care of her too.

I do not trust medical or science experts anymore. They have sold out to Big Pharma and science was hijacked by politics for some time. I should've seen the signs with one of my childhood favorites, Bill Nye, sell out with Bill Nye saves the World.

I don't come here often or the nonewnormal subreddit much because it's starting to look like Doomer responses on some of them.

I can't believe how many people don't realize they're being lied to by experts and being gaslighted. The fact the goals keep changing should be a huge red flag. I can't help but think people will realize they've been lied and snap and the karma hitting all of these technocrats and experts will come back in full force. I want these bastards to pay for what they've done.

One thing I could see happening in the near future is the revival of religious fundamentalism. The fundamentalists will convince people science can't be trusted and it will lead to another debate in the 20's like the Scopes trial, talking about history being repeated.

It's a good thing I have this week off because I've been building new skills to find better work. For once, I watched TV and played video games for the first time in March.

The sad thing too is, when you read more about what's going on, I wish sometimes I remained blue-pilled and happy and unaware of things.
