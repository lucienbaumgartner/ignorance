At this point, I think you’re right, I do not understand your argument.  However, that’s due to constantly shifting goal posts, constantly shifting importance of sources, and you desperately throwing shit at the wall hoping something sticks and agrees with you.

You said that Nuckols would agree with you.  We asked him directly to chime in because unlike you, we actually know something about this, he knows we know something about this, and he likes us.  He took the time to respond and yet, you persist.  At some point, and I mean this genuinely, realize that when all the people who are really good at something are telling you a thing about something you are not as good at, just maybe they know something you don’t.  You act like you want to learn or be smarter but dig your heels in harder than wile-e-coyote.  You weren’t banned for being a moron, you were banned for being a moron and then continuing to be a moron.  

Furthermore, You keep acting like this is some sort of debate, with rules, where the logical fallacies apply.  They don’t and an appeal to authority is fine because they actually have authority and at some point, you could be less stupid and ignorant and are purposely choosing not to.
