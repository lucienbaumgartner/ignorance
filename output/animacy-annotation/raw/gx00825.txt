Why does it matter what his friends think and do? You've clearly told him you dislike it and he should stop. It would literally take nothing away from him if you do.

It's very telling that he won't address your actual point of it being horribly offensive and instead is trying to use the excuse that if his racist friends are okay with it, then it's legitimate. Why are is ignorant, racist, frankly stupid sounding friends the benchmark?

It is also incredibly demeaning coming from an Indian, considering the level of rampant colourism and outright racism in our culture. Students in India coming from various countries in Africa are constantly attacked and harassed by the police and the public on a regular basis, it's in the news all the time. He either knows what he is saying and is pure gutterscum who enjoys dehumanising other people or he's so fucking dumb and ignorant of the things that are happening around him, but wants his ego protected from you calling him out for his disgusting behaviour. Do either of these options sound like a good partner for you?  


Edit: I just noticed the ages and it is so gross this man is nearly 30 and still thinks it's cool to talk like this. He is happy to use a derogatory word that actively harms people just because he wants to sound cool amongst his friends. What a catch.
