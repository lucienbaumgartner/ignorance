So tired of republicans. Rapacious and disdainful of the rest of the country but themselves. Bigoted and ignorant of all humans but themselves. Boldface liars as useless and corrupt legislators for hire. And now we see again as historically seditious and traitorous as ever. The ugly part of America.
