&gt;”If he has time to work he has time to marry you!”

This shows you’re an ignorant and dishonest idiot. You use quotes as if I said that. OP wants more than”casual”, and the guy wants to keep it “casual” so he can be with other women at the same time. Neither is evil, but it shows OP should move on and that guy should find another casual person to have sex with.
