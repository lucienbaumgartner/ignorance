Wow! What an idiot. That person calling us hateful and ignorant. That person clearly isn't smart enough to realize that there are words that are synonymous with other words as well there are words that are "Antonyms." Miscarriage and Abortion are NOT synonymous. I don't know how low these pro-abortionists are willing to stoop. The moral failure within these people seems bottomless.
