Even convicted criminals of violent crimes don't deserve to be raped. All that is going to do is most likely create another future sexual offender which in turn will create more. When I was younger I'd be all on board with the "Watch out for Bubba" and "Don't drop the soap" jokes, but I was immature and unaware that most people convicted are there for minor, non violent drug crimes and they usually end up in those situations due to extreme alienation from "decent" society, and said society is set up to run just that way.
