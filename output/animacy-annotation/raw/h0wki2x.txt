Dude, why are you ignoring everything I have said about enemy damage? That is so disingenuous.

And why do you say one bullet? Why are you assuming it's one bullet? I said it's possible all of those enemies behind OP shot him at once for a reason.

Do not claim you are looking at big picture and insinuating that somehow makes ignoring perfectly logical and reasonable arguments ok. That is also very disingenuous and ignorant of you.
