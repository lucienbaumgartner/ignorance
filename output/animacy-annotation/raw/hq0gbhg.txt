Ok if your not trolling.

I never said or hinted that America was the best or anything like that, that’s a stereotype, the fact that you keep spamming that is ignorant and hateful, plus calling me all those silly insults isn’t helping.

Christmas is one of the most famous, celebrated and ancient holidays in the world. I never said that everybody celebrates it, I just said people shouldn’t be so hateful. 

It’s 2am and I had too many drinks to fall asleep after I spent the entire day hanging out with my family and freinds, I’m on Reddit trying to settle myself down.

There’s three reasons why your doing this right now, either your trolling me because why not. Or your life is so empty that to fill the empty void in your soul, you spread all the hate and sadness you have onto Reddit and other platforms. Of course you won’t admit it but there’s a reason why your doing this which is most likely pretty sad. Or your just completely ignorant, spreading opinions is just so much easier for you than facts.
