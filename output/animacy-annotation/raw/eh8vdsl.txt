But as you can see there's not much strategy involved in surviving the fog phase at all. It's clearly just a gimmick to catch unaware and scared players. Performing the air plunge seems like the intended way to move the fight along into the third and final phase; it's also the only way to prevent the Monk from using the fog phase again and again. Considering that it's just a waste of time, I'd much rather use the air plunge on her second life bar and fight her final phase fairly than using it on her third diamond - which exists as a strategy for those who want to avoid her more aggressive moveset.
