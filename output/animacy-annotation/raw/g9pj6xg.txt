I don't understand. Why are most people in general so unaware and uninvolved in politics and current events for? 

By uninvolved, I don't mean participating in any political activities, but more like just being open to discuss politics or actively staying in tune in what's going on in the world, not just in Singapore. 

There's the final presidential election debate going on today, and right-wingers trying to push new conspiracy theories and fake news yet most people can't tell the difference. Others don't care. 

Politics affect ALL our lives because who ultimately governs us in Singapore, or in a huge powerhouse like the US, is ultimately going to affect you and me one way another with the kind of policies they make. 


Pretty shitty honestly, whenever I see most friends rather only ever talk about useless stuff like their personal lives, hobbies, gossips, relationships, work/studies and random complaints about life. 
Try talking anything world affairs or political with them and they'll immediately tune out or start avoiding you.

sorry for long rant. just airing my thoughts bye
