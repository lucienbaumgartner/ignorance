Damn, you have insecurity issues for sure, no need to reply to your fragile self anymore and also because science hurt you. You anti-vaxxers are so delusional and ignorant that you have to twist the truth. No wonder r/HermanCainAward is nothing but white conservative Christians in their early 40’s to mid 60’s. They all parrot the same things you are saying and shit talk when they can’t handle the truth. Glad anti-vaxxers are going to lose their jobs soon enough and not going to be able to claim unemployment since they got fired not vaxxing. Seriously please visit r/HermanCainAward and you’ll probably see someone you know in there, after all you’re all related because you all fuck your cousins and mothers and have kids with them.
