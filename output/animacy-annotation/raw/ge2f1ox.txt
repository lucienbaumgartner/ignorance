Wow I can see i've bothered you. It doesn't matter that you agree the guy is an asshole, it's good I guess, but not the point. I've seen many guys say things along the lines of 'just stop choosing/attracting assholes' as if women like op go out of their way to choose awful people. That is clearly victim blaming, your essay trying to explain it changes nothing.

Also, you say we blame men, for what exactly? Their own bad behavior? The guy we're talking about here is clearly gross, are you annoyed we're holding him accountable instead of blaming op like you? Also, what you said didn't help op in the slightest, probably just made her feel like it was her fault for being treated badly. Think about it, you said she's attracting those guys, i.e putting out a vibe of some sort that draws them in, if that's even happening (you assume that instead of the obvious answer that it was just a coincidence and op did nothing wrong), how on earth is she supposed to figure out why she's attracting them? And then, even if she thought she found out what was attracting them, would you have her change that part of her? Can you see how unhelpful and ignorant that suggestion was?
