There was no trump "propaganda" lol.

Wtf are you talking about? Everything he said about the vaccine was true. Do you mean to say "dems are so hard headed and ignorant that they wont listen to truth or reason whatsoever if it possibly gives trump a win before election day"?

He was the president. He wasnt in a basement making a fucking vaccine. The fact that im having this conversation again just goes to show how short minded this generation has become.

I was fighting with people when all this was happening saying the same thing. Like wtf are you guys saying? Or course experts are working on this. Im sorry, but your argument is completely invalid. Anyone with a half a brain could know if there was a vaccine released, it was going to be approved by health professionals. (Well just as much as it is now.)

The VALID  argument, would have been that theres too much red tape cut, and not enough time before release to do proper clinical trials. WHICH YOU CAN STILL ARGUE. But for SOME reason, its just "safe" now.
