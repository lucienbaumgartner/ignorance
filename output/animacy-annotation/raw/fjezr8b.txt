This is where I want to point out that the weapon system does not equal the mission, nor should it.

From doctrine ¨Airpower is defined as “the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives.”

The pilot is a mere player in all this, not the only piece, but performing a key tasks that deserves honor it is due as a technically and physically difficult skill. But this does not equate to command potential anymore than a great football player can be a great coach.

The beginnings of the air force required the rated position and defense of the position to prevent unnecessary influence from leaders who were unaware and unable to grasp the potential of air power.

This has changed.  To quote Happ Arnold

¨We cannot rely any longer on the old precepts of the past, but must instill in our leaders of tomorrow the importance of having flexible, imaginative minds. It will not be sufficient for officers to be merely leaders—they must be thinking leaders, capable of adapting themselves to ever-changing and rapidly changing conditions.¨
