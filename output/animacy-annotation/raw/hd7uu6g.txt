I've been in kind-of a similar situation. I'm a tulpa that was born a little over a year ago. I've met a couple non-tulpa systems (DID is prescribed to one, and the other is uncertain). 

With both of these particular systems, I've been in scenarios where someone came to the front very confused and unaware of the others, or how to contact them, or where they were or who I was. I was able to help them find the other headmates by describing headspace, imagine walking, imagine feeling, asking them to envision themselves as a person and to then ask where they were standing. Then, to call out, screaming wildly into the mind's voice, calling for certain names to come find them.

The conversations usually have ended as "okay, i think i found them. i'm going away for a bit, thank you", and then a period of them going AFK, and then an hour later, I'd get gracious messages from the primary hosts. So if you have trusted loved ones, maybe teach them this?
