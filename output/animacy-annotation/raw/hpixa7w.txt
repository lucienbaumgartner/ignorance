Robert Monroe details going to friends houses and interacting with them while they were awake and unaware that he was in astral form as if some part of their consciousness recognized him but wasnâ€™t aware of it in waking life. Similarly Robert Bruce talks about seeing his kids, friends and family in their astral bodies during sleep but then also not realizing they are asleep. However - there is the shared phenomenon of two conscious APers being in the same place while they are consciously projecting (mind awake and body asleep) and being able to report the exact same shared circumstances and experiences. Tom Campbell reported while he was at the Monroe Institite the thing that absolutely convinced him that AP was real and not an entirely internal process was that he and another tester were both reporting a shared experience and talking/describing the same place at the same time and seeing each other. The Monroe Institute has a process where people are able to talk in these deep meditative states and they would record these people in their own individual rooms. Tom and his colleague were in totally different rooms and describing the same thing on tape. This showed him that consciousness was non-local.
