"waaaaah i wasnt on estrogen at 5 years old it's over"

damn, would've thought some of you people are still 5 years old with how childish you're acting. I fully accept that some people just won't pass, but to tell everyone else they won't pass after a certain age is completely untrue, especially at such a young age. You're just feeding other people's brainworms.

As u/SouthernYoghurt9 said, stereotyping FtM transitions as easy is stupid and ignorant of the challenges they go through. They're different, neither is objectively easier than the other.
