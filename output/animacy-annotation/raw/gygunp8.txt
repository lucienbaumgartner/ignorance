Again,it’s called harm reduction not harm elimination.

I thought you just told me "no shit drugs aren’t inherently addictive" so when you say "x distributed addictive drugs" insinuating that those drugs in themselves are addictive then you can see where my concern came from and that blaming a chemical itself is a very ignorant view of addiction seeing as most users don’t have a problem.This epidemic and issue with addiction was caused by a system with complete drug prohibition with a rising economic and mental health Problem followed by a humongous black market looking to make money off of these issues,people don’t Just wake up one day and think "I want to try heroin/meth/fent" and Just become addicts

I will let you hear what you want to hear,yes harm reduction sites have spread misinformation and have given certain individuals more types of drugs to buy and abilities to get them but with any good thing in life there comes a risk,when people find something they like the common next step is to share it (especially if by sharing that info and selling the products that info yielded makes a profit) and just because it helps someone doesn’t mean it will help everyone(again going back to my point about alcohol forums as anyone with half a brain stem could ferment or distill as much alcohol as they want and sell it or find other ways to obtain it as when people want something,they generally find a way to get it)I will not submit at all that those sites have been a net negative and or cause of the current drug epidemics and to think so is horribly naive and ignorant of the Situation we Are currently in.

My main issue with what you’re saying is that it sounded like to me you were blaming Erowid and it’s Ilk for causing addiction but I think me and you both know that it is a hell of a lot more nuanced than that
