Hi Op,

That really starts with long term education about the principles of Democratic government. In the United States, this was called "civics". But the "unfortunate" bi-product of civics is that it made voters more allied to the Democratic form of government than to a particular political party. And that was a problem.

Here is John Podesta chatting in an email about the issue. And he was no small fish, as had Clinton won in 2016, he would have been Chief of Staff to the President of the United States:

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* ***conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.*** *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly*. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "\*

And this expands on the missing "civics" aspect, that they saw fit to drop in 1970.

The result is an older generation that is often outraged by government abuses, but it sails right past the younger uneducated "non-civics" educated younger generation. For example:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

You can see Eric Weinstein (age 55) pick up on that "sleight of hand" and tries to educate his younger listeners regarding *how Super Delegates have nothing to do with  Diversity and Inclusiveness*, listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast: (or start at 2:58)

So, the system that is currently in place is no accident. The philosophy is to: ***"treat voters like mushrooms; keep them well manured and in the dark."*** 

For what it is worth...
