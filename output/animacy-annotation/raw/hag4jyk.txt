I think a large part of the lack of negative emotions comes from the consumer’s distance from the suffering they’re causing. Non-vegans pay for others to do the “dirty work” of slitting the throats of innocent animals, removing their internal organs, and dismembering each and every limb of the animal. As long as people remain uneducated and ignorant of what goes on in slaughterhouses and dairy farms, the meat and dairy industry will continue to sell products that have a happy cow/pig on them because it is the norm. I’ve only been vegan for a short time and it’s been easy when I realize the suffering and pain I have personally caused for the animals I ate. It’s not the company’s fault or the entire economy’s fault, it’s mine. I paid for those animals to be killed, but now I refuse to do so.

I highly recommend you watch Dominion on YouTube. It’s a two hour documentary of what goes on in each industry, with many high-ranking actors and actresses narrating it. I must warn you that it’s incredibly graphic and depressing, but if you can’t watch something like that why would you pay for it to happen in the first place?
