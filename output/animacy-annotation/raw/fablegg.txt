FYI, and this is important, many people think fat people are stupid, and unaware that they have weight issues.  People have absolutely no embarrassment when going to a fat person and telling them to not eat that, exercise more, give up sweets, you shouldn’t have French fries and on and on.  The litany is appalling.  It’s especially hurtful when people are in the middle of working hard to make changes, have achieved some success, and are starting to feel good about themselves.  Then some “well meaning” food police starts giving unwanted advice.

I’ll tell you what someone told me:  their opinion is none of your business.  You don’t have to respond to it, you don’t have to give it validity and you don’t have to take it to heart.
