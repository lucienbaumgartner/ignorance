&gt; **The media likes to stand up for the media.** She is a reporter (even if one with an agenda) and is being imprisoned for what she said.

C'mon dude, that's completely silly and ignorant of actual facts.

The best example of this is Julian Assange.  If reporters really just like to stick up for people reporting the news, you'd hear about Assange's imprisonment and extradition to the US non-stop from these people.  Yet this is hardly covered at all, and many people in the media ignore it completely.

I can guarantee you if Julian Assange exposed Chinese war-crimes and was imprisoned in China he would receiving about 5000x more coverage and most likely be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
