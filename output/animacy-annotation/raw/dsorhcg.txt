I don't usually take my medication with other people, that would be kind of weird. 

I'm glad you enjoy recreational weed with your friends. I'm a big fan of legalization and enjoying it responsibly. I think it can be a great experience.

I didn't really have much desire to be at the casino at noon on a sunday, smoking a blunt and browsing reddit seemed enjoyable. I was right, this turned out to be a blast. This thread is fucking amazing.

I also never claimed to be a social butterfly, your new logical fallacy is ad hominem. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem

Notice the difference. My argument was that you are socially inept and unaware, and I provided my reasoning for that based on your behavior. Your response to that claim isn't to actually defend yourself, but to claim that I am also socially awkward. Okay, I'm socially awkward. Does that now somehow make you not?

I honestly expected more from you.
