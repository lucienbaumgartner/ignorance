If you have anything to add to the discussion then do so. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. 

The numbers are there. Covid is not a big deal to a majority of the population. Shutting down everything is stupid. The correct way is to keep everything open and everyone working and protect the old and the weak.

You are just stupid and ignorant of science.
