Yep, people seem really uncomfortable and unaware of MLKs actual views. There’s the few feel good quotes white moderates like, but people like to ignore the fact he was anti capitalist and explicitly said white moderates more concerned with order than justice are more dangerous than the actual white supremacists. Given how far right the Overton window is in the US, you’re right that most people here are just more moderate conservatives. Centrist itself is just a softer form of conservatism which you can see when most actually talk about issues and policy or raise their concerns.
