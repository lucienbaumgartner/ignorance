Reminds me of a friend, they had entire birthday weeks and would tend to ‘monologue’ at me as I tried to escape to go to the toilet! I ended up living with them and it drove me mad how clueless they were about reading my body language and the situation. I ended up eating in my room and avoiding any kind of conversation.I have since moved out but they still think we’re good friends and send me insanely enthusiastic messages on Facebook. 

So I would look at how much this person brings to the friendship. Is it salvageable? If you didn’t see or hear from them for a month would you miss them? That might help you decide what to do. 

Personally I never told my friend, I’m planning to let the friendship fade away. If I miss them then I’ll get in touch - it’s a pity as we were once close and leaned on each other, but it’s hard not to see them as a narcissist or just so ignorant and unaware of other people. It just annoyed me too much.
