That was quite an interesting video. Possibly he is correct, so worth considering; but I think the most important thing is to be able to think for yourself.

While I don't have any grand insight, all I can say is something is going on behind the scenes to take advantage of voters.

For example:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion (lol)**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

But the scary thing is that treating voters like unthinking dolts is not a coincidence:

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* ***conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.*** *The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly*. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "\*

And this expands on the missing "civics" aspect, that they saw fit to drop:

**Dreyfuss talks sanctuary cities ruling, importance of civics**

How that is all connected I don't know, but it is troubling to contemplate, especially since John Podesta was slated to become the Chief of Staff to the President, had Clinton won...  and that is how they "shop-talk"... WTF?
