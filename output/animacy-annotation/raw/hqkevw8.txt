I don’t know if it’s just because I’ve been a human for four decades now or what, but I don’t get angry much anymore.

Thinking about it because I see younger people getting upset about the new CDC quarantine guidelines, and I see trolls on popular threads here getting all offended by what humans in power say and do, and I’m just…tired.

I’ve done what I can to protect myself, so have all the family members and friends I care about, and for the rest - humans are gonna human. They’re going to be selfish and short-sighted and greedy and ignorant and completely destroy the systems they live in. Getting angry about things I can’t change only hurts me and makes me sicker and more vulnerable to the plague.

I am going to chill and hang out with my husband and our cats, play some Sims, watch some kdramas, be confused by all the people on social media who think that a change in a number in a calendar system created by humans means anything to a virus or to other events we have no control over, and enjoy three days off from work.

My husband is off tomorrow too so I’ve been telling him tomorrow is All Kisses Day. :)

Hugs to all the people out there still young enough to have strong emotions about how awful some of us humans are.
