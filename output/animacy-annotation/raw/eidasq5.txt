&gt; This attitude, "no, it's only because Democrats didn't adopt my policy preferences" is just solipsistic and ignorant. 

That isn't just what the article says though. It also looks at other explanations and finds them wanting. 

It's fair to criticize the conclusions reached but it's not the same as claiming that the article never considers the counter-narratives.

&gt;Politics isn't about just presenting good policies. 

And the article touches on some issues, like how many campaign offices she had or events she cancelled, which are not directly policy issues but play a role in political campaigns.
