Stupidity and ignorance.

It will be the ultimate catalyst. People are getting dumber and dumber, and it's actually kind of scary. As cliche' as it might sound, the movie Idiocracy is seriously starting to look like a prophecy, rather than a comedy film.

People just don't seem to think anymore and they choose to do dumb shit or make poor decisions. Logic and common sense are sailing right out the fucking window together in napalm-laden fury. We're unaware and asleep at the wheel. On top of it, people seem to think what they're doing is ok. They'll allow something to happen. Willful ignorance is even worse and a whole other can of worms. 

Nuclear war? An epidemic? Zombie apocalypse? Somewhere along the line, it will all trace back to stupidity and/or willful ignorance somehow - at least to the very core. Or stupidity and/or willful ignorance will make it worse.

Unless a giant rock crashes into the earth or we get cooked by a solar flare. In that case, we're fucked either way and intelligence will not save anybody.
