Correct. I didn’t say a vaccine doesn’t protect people. I said covid will never be eradicated, and the vaccines have shown to be a temporary patch which diminishes over time. The CDC has changed the definition of vaccine because of this one virus, after developing vaccines for 1,000s of other viruses. Isn’t that all alarming to anyone? I am fully vaccinated and still got Covid. 

The point I am making is this; Corona virus is here forever. The solution is personal responsibility and proactive approach to health and sanitary living, occasional “booster vaccine” if you feel that is the best solution for you, and therapy over prevention. Masks should not drive people to division and to post things claiming others are 2 decades behind in education, like you are so much more righteous than them because your choice to wear a mask, or not. 

It’s equally as ignorant and divisive as an anti-masker remarking about the bunch of stupid libtards who refuse to take off their mask. Your choice, as it should be. 

Plenty more people getting killed by fentanyl and international drug traffickers, and the ones who aren’t killed are ruined for life with a trail of tears for the family. Not a peep though about that… but oh god, you’re not wearing a mask in target. Come on….
