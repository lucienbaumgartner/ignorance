I'm not a "trumpie" you presumptuous yob. I live in sub-saharan Africa, in a country that doesn't even have "dozens of mental health offices".

And by "socialist countries" of course you never mean Venezuela or North Korea, or Angola, etc, etc, etc, you refer to exactly 3-and-a-half Scandinavian countries with high tax rates but no socialism, whose own administrators laugh at the absurdity of the idea that their countries are "socialist". 

I didn't say the mental health services in your country can't be improved (or any number of other aspects for that matter), but to say it is the country you hate most in the world because of such things just makes you look entitled and egotistical and ignorant of how things are for most of the people on this planet.
