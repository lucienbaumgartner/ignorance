It's not so much that I fear happiness not being all it's cracked up to be...I actually fear it being as good as everyone says. I was "happy" at one point in my life and waking up in the mornings felt just as good as everyone says. But it was also kind of vapid and meaningless. The way it seeped from my life made me aware of how fleeting "happiness" is and how I used to be painfully unaware and unprepared for the reality of death, sickness, racism, hatred, etc. I remember caring so much about things that only concerned me (beauty, friends/family, success) and it only opened me up to more anxiety, fear and pressure. And much of happiness is based on hoping and living in the future (as much as people say it's all about living in the present). Happiness actually hurt a lot. And I much prefer having no goals, ambitions and hopes. Maybe it's better to be numb, shut off your emotions, and do your best to get through this life.
