&gt;I think it's funny seeing as how you browsed my comment history just to prove a point.

I didn't, I was just making sure you weren't a troll, as is my job as a moderator. I regularly do that with a lot of users. 

&gt;we Muslims need to stop with this "sheep" mentality where we try to pardon and forgive everyone we meet. 

What he said had nothing to do with forgiveness or pardoning, nor is there anything wrong with doing that either.  

If you think there's something wrong with asking God to guide the disbelieving people, then I wonder what you would have said to `Umar, radi Allahu anhu, when he was on his way to kill the Prophet, sal Allahu 'alayhi wa salam. What would you have said to Wahshi ibn Harb, radi Allahu anhu, after he killed Hamza, radi Allahu anhu, and converted to Islam? Would you have condemned him while the Prophet, sal Allahu 'alayhi wa salam, forgave him? Are you saying the Prophet, sal Allahu 'alayhi wa salam, was weak and unaware that people hated Muslims? 

Obviously, I'm sure if you are a practicing Muslim, you don't think any of those things, but I hope you see the point. People hating Muslims is nothing new, and the Prophet, sal Allahu 'alayhi wa salam, dealt with much worse than we have.
