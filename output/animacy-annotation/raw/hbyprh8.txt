diaz has 28 saves, 6 blown saves. he’s gotten the job done 82% of the time. comparatively melancon has gotten the job done 88% of the time, hendriks 84% of the time

sure it might be fair to say diaz isn’t necessarily an “elite” closer but to say he’s anywhere close to bad is just reactionary and ignorant of the facts

like who the fuck would you rather? not everyone can be josh hader with 1 blown save. and that 1 blown save was against none other than our inept offense. it happens

chill the fuck out about diaz. he’s our closer and he’s good at it
