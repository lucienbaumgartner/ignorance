Maybe you didn't understand me, I don't really care about that source. I was just calling you a racist.

Because you're a racist. You're all over the thread getting *really* close to just outright saying "We shouldn't let in non-whites unless they prove they're good enough and stop acting like non-whites". But hey, maybe you're just incredibly ignorant and unaware that for the last few ~~decades~~ centuries terms like "primitive" or "inferior" or hell even the modern usage of "third world" has some *serious* racial baggage that racists use to avoid explicitly saying one race is worse that another.

Between this and your merit-based immigration thread you're really convinced that America's way forward is to include as few non-Americans as possible unless they meet our standards of absurd excellence that deems them worthy of being American (how many natural citizens could pass current immigration tests?).
