do you really really believe that a bunch of rednecks are SO STUPID AND IGNORANT of the political system 

that they thought what they were doing on January 6th would ACTUALLY give them power over the government?


*do you really believe* these folks thought they were going to storm the US Capitol and *seize control* of the United States, the government, AND the military? 

because is so--you are as unhinged as miss "i was in a different building a mile away but the CAPITOL TERRORISTS ALMOST RAPED ME!!!!!"
