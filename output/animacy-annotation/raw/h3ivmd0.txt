Fine, Markman doesn’t think I’m stupid and unaware that the history of many municipal boundaries is colored by race and class concerns. 

Then his argument that we shouldn’t consider race but should only rely on municipal boundaries that were created with race in mind is simply an argument that we should use race in a way that he favors. It’s not some high minded argument to be colorblind. 
 
My comment isn’t angry - thanks for ensuring I’m calm - it’s pointing out that his argument is bad. Sorry I’m not convinced by lazy arguments from college professors and former judges who should know better
