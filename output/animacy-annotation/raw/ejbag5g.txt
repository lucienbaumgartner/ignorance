Watching the whole thing Joe comes off like such an asshole. He dominates the interview and barely lets his bandmates speak. Making stupid little quips and references that get no laughs, and then further explaining the joke. He even tells Gene he's doing his joke wrong and re-enacts it like a bovine thespian. How a man of his years can be so self unaware and rude is simply mind boggling especially considering his "profession". He's does know he's supposed to be likeable, right?
