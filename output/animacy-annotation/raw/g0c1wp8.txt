This is bullshit

Infrastructure is improving in most major cities, with large public transportation projects being underway.

Education has always been extremely strong and is only getting stronger. Student loans are not only irrelevant because there's many ways around them, but also not a measurement of a country's development

I come disparity is nowhere near as bad as actual third world countries, and is in a large part a quirk of how stock value is calculated

What makes this opinion so obnoxious is I come from an actual 1st to 2nd world country, Argentina. That is the only country in the world to undevelop. I know what it looks like. You should visit there, it's heartbreaking. But to try to compare the status of the USA to the status of a country where there's literal shanty towns on the train tracks is so unbelievably conceited and ignorant that it's difficult to describe.
