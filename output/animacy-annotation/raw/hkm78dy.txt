You sound very intelligent and well rounded. 

Moreover, as u/cellada noted, you may be a psychopath or a sociopath. 

It can be inferred from your comments that you lack empathy, and are unable to relate to the experiences or feelings of others. 

You are so selfish and ignorant that you don’t understand how easily it could have been you getting crushed to death and crowdsurfed out of the crowd as Travis played “upper echelon.”
