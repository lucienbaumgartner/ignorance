Perhaps they’re trying to convey that “well adjusted”, “normal” people rarely work to make the world a better place, but are often rather complacent, ignorant and content with perpetuating the world that is, the status quo. “Well adjusted” , “normal” people are the conformists, conditioned to ostracize and “other” people who don’t fit in. Creating and perpetuating assumptions to justify their otherness. 

Who wore the label of “well adjusted” and “normal” in Nazi controlled Germany? What about Apartheid South Africa or during Slavery and Jim Crow in the US? 

Foucault also had thoughts on the notion of “normal”: An average standard created by the human sciences against which people are measured: the sane man, the law-abiding citizen, and the obedient child are all "normal" people. But an idea of the "normal" also implies the existence of the abnormal: the madman, the criminal and the deviant are the reverse side of this coin. An idea of deviance is possible only where norms exist. For Foucault, norms are concepts that are constantly used to evaluate and control us

Perhaps the girl isn’t traumatized but merely a postmodernist? 

She doesn’t look(conform) like you or the others in the photo. But because you’ve concluded (assume) that you’re normal and nothing is wrong with you, that must mean she isn’t normal and something is wrong with her. You’ve made assumptions about her and her family based on one picture without any evidence to back them up.
