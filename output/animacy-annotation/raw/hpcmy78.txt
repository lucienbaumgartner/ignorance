I’m mostly pointing to this and not saying it is good or bad, but you’ve reminded me of how in the Lord of the Rings, the um… higher ups? The wise and powerful and good? 

Idk. 

It is treated with such an assumed and obvious importance that I don’t think Tolkien even realized that the power users of his world were handing down decisions that effected the fates of others… but how they treat the Shire Hobbits by allowing them to continue in happy ignorance rather than expose them to the brutal reality of unstoppable evil, impossible odds of survival, and a world facing certain doom.

I mean I think most people would have seen the Hobbits as being really irresponsible and selfish to be so ignorant and happy… but then their power to change anything basically didn’t exist (except for those very few, rare ones that made all the difference) so…. Yeah. What?

I have no conclusion. Do I still pass?
