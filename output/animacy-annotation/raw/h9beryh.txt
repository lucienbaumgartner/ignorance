&gt; we should have negotiated

We did negotiate with them. It helps if you are not incredibly ignorant. 

&gt; I'm anti war but obviously if a country is hiding someone that killed 3000 people war is justified.

Well ignoring the stupidity of this statement given the US refused to provide any evidence of his guilt. And that you are simply wrong. How is it even relevant? A moronic justified war doesn’t make it less moronic. 

&gt; No because at that point we would have agreed to the trial.

So? The US regularly agrees to things to then ignore them. Second, the agreement would be predicated on a fair trial. Unless your point is that the US couldn’t prove Osama guilt, I fail to see how any of this is relevant. 

&gt; Again, anti war, but people that disgusting deserve to be hunted down and annihilated.

You are no better and probably helping worse people than the Taliban ever did. 

&gt; Edit: My point with libertarians is that they are incapable of applying common sense to their principles. 

Your point is that you are moronically dogmatic and ignorant of the actual history.
