I think it's also largely because she seems to be forgiven by many of the other BN folks. She shows up on other peoples instagrams a lot and I guess it helps people forget her shit if they see her just in small doses being validated by BN people.  Also CH came off as really *believing* the hateful shit he was saying.  I'm no Rachael fan at all, but her hurtful actions sort of came across (to a canadian that doesn't really know how well known antebellum stuff is in your country) like an extremely privileged, ignorant, and naive white woman.  It's not an excuse whatsoever for her behaviour, and in no way do I want to minimize the hurt she's caused, I'm remarking more on the conscious *intent.* CH has ***really problematic*** ***opinions***, and the way he delivered them against Rachel was just disgusting and so misogynistic.  I also think it'd be easier to forget rachael if she wasn't actively dating a past lead.
