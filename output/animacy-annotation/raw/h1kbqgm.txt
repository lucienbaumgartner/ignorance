Ppl on their phone in public either talking about very personal things or being rachet. Nobody wants to hear you cuss out your bf/gf kids other parent etc. Or talking to your friends about some guy and completely inappropriate and unaware of their surroundings. Its usually women, grown women doing this and its irks me.
