Lol what? Truth is shit now?? So let's just lie and say India is great at handling covid? 

Impress? Does that look like an impressive wall of text to you? It's alarming. I feel for my parents and grandparents who have to be so damn careful to just come outside and take a breath of fresh air. 
I feel for my community members who helped me through my childhood coz I cannot do anything for them in these troubling times and some fucking weirdos decided to eschew simple guidelines coz its convenient to peddle lies on innocent unaware and unsuspecting members through group chats. This is the least I can do, expose the truth and perhaps instill some much needed fear of the reality, and take on the responsibility to protect their respective communities. 

What are you doing meanwhile speaking of supportive?
