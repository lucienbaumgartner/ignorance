That such an ignorant train of thought though. The dogs are owned significantly more by people who use them as fighting animals and never train them, the reason to ignore that is to continue the idea that the breed is more aggressive than others [which has been proven wrong](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/03/elaine-boyer/are-pit-bulls-more-aggressive-other-dogs/). 

I’ve seen mistreated labs in poor neighborhoods mauling other dogs simply because they got in their vicinity, hell [there’s been a recent were a woman was killed by a pack of dachshunds and a border collie](https://nypost.com/2018/05/16/pack-of-wiener-dogs-mauls-woman-to-death/) but you don’t hear people talking about how those dogs are evil. 

The idea that pitbulls are somehow more problematic than other breeds is both an ignorant and outdated belief that first went around with the racist idea that Mexicans and their dogs are inherently more dangerous.
