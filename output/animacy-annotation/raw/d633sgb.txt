I guess you could say I'm tired of the "we don't vote because it's not accessible to us or the our issues aren't being addressed bs. At my small liberal arts school, do you know what plays on every TV in our Cafeteria. ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN U. Not a single news channel. At least where I'm at, kids aren't voting because they are unaware and uninterested.
