NTA - and it’s also not true that you “won’t find that anywhere and you’re being too picky” 
I drive a 2020 camaro that I bought straight from the dealership. I pay $324 a month and about $210 monthly on insurance. I waited a long time to get my car because I was looking for something nice that I could also comfortably afford. 
Don’t give in… if it takes you longer to find exactly what you’re comfortable with, then so be it. Don’t make yourself uncomfortable to please someone who is clearly privileged and unaware of what it’s like to have to financially support themselves.
