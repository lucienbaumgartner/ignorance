My advice is to share your campaign notes and let them read them outside of the game. Then they can make a character that compliments the setting.

Otherwise I suggest revealing the world organically a little at a time while they characters adventure.

Start them off in a small out of the way town where the people are simple and ignorant of the wider world, then introduce NPC's who are more aware of the outside world to explain it to the PC's.

That said, I found the players rarely care about the campaign setting at all. They're more concerned with their characters and what's right in front of them.

A legendary super god about to destroy the planet has nothing on a unnamed stable boy who did a great job taking care of one of the PC's horses that one time.
