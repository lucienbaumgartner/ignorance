Same. Moved here a couple years ago from California and the segregation and racism is staggering. Minnesotans are unfriendly and unneighborly. Worse than New Yorkers and Massholes. I thought i was imagining things but I took a recent trip to Seattle and was reminded of what it meant to be around people that would look you in the eye and say "hello." Store employees who can say, "hi what can I help you find?"

Minneapolis is a beautiful city, great food, beautiful parks, really cool activities in the winter. But people are so nasty and unaware of their behavior. I thought with such a large Hmong and Somali population there'd be some progress but Somalis are treated like they're invisible. I went to my friend's kids' kindergarten pagent and they kept the few adorable Somali kids waaayyy over there isolated and the white kids didn't acknowledge their presence, nor did the parents. What kind of place teaches 5 year olds to not play with each other? 

The cops are only one part of the problem. I've never seen such a multicultural city so disinterested in multiculturalism.
