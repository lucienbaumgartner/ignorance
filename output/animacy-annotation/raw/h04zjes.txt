Personally, I didn't think much of the show when I first watched it a few years ago. When the second season aired I had barely any interest in it, but I still watched it. After finishing season 2 part 2 I had the urge to rewatch it, and I started liking it more and more. There are many videos on youtube way more convincing than anything I could ever write, that might be able to convince you to rethink your opinions on some aspects of the show. That said, I disagree with you.

In my opinion, Subaru is a pretty realistic character. Unlike most bland protagonists, he doesn't always make the right decision. In the beginning, he's selfish and unaware of his mistakes. I think showing us the ugly side of this character in the Royal Selection thingie was a pretty ballsy move by the author, as it could turn away many potential viewers. I like how that particular event was never overwritten, as it forces Subaru to change. Character development is one of the strong suits of Re zero, in my opinion.

As for Emilia, I would say that her selflessness is her strong suit (most people would give up knowing that they have pretty much no chance of winning based on their appearance alone), but that alone wouldn't set her apart from other heroines. In spite of her willingness to help others, she's not strong enough to do so. We are shown how much she consciously depends on Subaru, even when it comes to obstacles that she must clear herself (ie the trial). Eventually she manages to face her past and clear the trial, and I liked that. She's selfless, but not perfect. I wouldn't call her bland. 

I hope you will give the show another chance. It's fine if you disagree though.
