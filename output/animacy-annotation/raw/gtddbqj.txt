Forums are not a source. What is rude is you claiming to *know* how cycles are printed and distributed, and arguing with someone that *does know* who is informing you that you are wrong and ignorant of the process.  I told you your information was incorrect and your response was to insist it was not, because the internet said so. I then tried to explain *why* you were wrong, but you won't have any of it.

Thank your LGS profusely for getting your packs to you at all, let alone on time.
