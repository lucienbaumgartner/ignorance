&gt; Did Vivec erase his father from existence?

There are a few subtle referrences to Vivec's "real" father (i.e not Sotha Sil) :

&gt; He was born in the ash among the Velothi, anon Chimer, before the war with the northern men. Ayem came first to the village of the netchimen, and her shadow was that of Boethiah, who was the Prince of Plots, and things unknown and known would fold themselves around her until they were like stars or the messages of stars. Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:
&gt;
&gt; 'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. In you is an image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'
&gt;
&gt; Then Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where dreughs took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might give birth to the image as an egg. There she stayed for seven or eight months.

Vivec's father was a [netchiman](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Netchiman%27s_Lament) (he bred or hunted netches).

&gt; The light bent, and somewhere a history was finally undone. Of it, Vivec remembered the laughing of the netchimen of his village when the hunts were good. He marched with his father in the ash, growing strong in the hooks and sail, able to run a junk through silt. At eleven, he sung to an ashkhan. He became sick after Red Mountain, with the nix-blood and fever, and was infirm a hundred years. His mother survived him and laid his body at the altar of Padhome. She gave him her skin to wear into the underworld.

&gt; &gt; **How do we deal with others?**
&gt;
&gt; For you, I would shave this head. It would not do that your new friend shook an inconstant kwam-lice from it. I'd take the sigil of Vel, the V, and wear it twice. And I would be new, and believe in the one moon and star as your banner does. I’d make a legend of this netch longhook. Make no frown that this will be my weapon in your guard, however low its station. **We all drink from the milk of our fathers.** I’d learn to read and then write so that I could see right your name forever. And I would clean your feet so that the next time you made treaty it would be with an assured step.

&gt; — [***What My Beloved Taught Me***](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/what-my-beloved-taught-me) : *An interview between Nerevar and Vivec, in a universe prior to the latter's apotheosis.*

Vivec might have been sexually abused by his father, or anything really, because this quote is extremely obscure and filled with metaphors, so who knows what it actually means?

&gt; If Vivec has CHIM, is this not impossible to "drain" from him?

That's not how CHIM works. What was drained was his powersource, his link to the Divine Energy of the Heart of Lorkhan.

&gt; Vivec relies more on CHIM and can exist without the power from the heart right?

Vivec is extremely reliant on the Heart, without it, he is simply a mortal, albeit an enlightened one. He tells us so in TES3:Morrowind :

&gt; "That is very sad. I presume Almalexia killed Sotha Sil. I thought she might harm me. And I presume she tried to kill you, Nerevarine. It is all very sad. But death comes to all mortals -- and we are all mortal now. In time, death will come to me, Nerevarine -- perhaps even at your hands. It is futile to deny one's fate. But, nonetheless, I'm afraid I find it all very, very sad that it should end this way, something that began in such glory and noble promise."

&gt; How would Vivec be blind to Barbas as his head priest?
&gt;
&gt; Does CHIM grant omniscience?

It grants obscure knowledge, not omniscience. Vivec was unaware and ignorant of many things, the first quest of ESO involves Vivec sending one of his priests to ask questions to an ancestor spirit :

&gt; "Ask the Warrior-Poet's questions, Outlander."
&gt;
&gt; &gt; **Lord Vivec asks, "The heart of the world, key to ascension, should I be filled with apprehension?"**
&gt;
&gt; "Ah, Lord Vivec always had a way with words!  
&gt; Tell him to rest assured. The Heart remains safe. I wonder why that concerns him? Ask the remaining questions, as my time here is short."
&gt;
&gt; &gt; **Lord Vivec asks, "Has the enemy of old returned, so devious and bold?"**
&gt;
&gt; "An enemy of old, yes, but not the one that Vivec presumes."
&gt;
&gt; &gt; **Lord Vivec asks, "Did Sotha Sil in his unending crusade know our divinity would shrivel and fade?"**
&gt;
&gt; "Sotha Sil imagined multiple scenarios and contemplated endless solutions. He even experimented with his divinity, drawing energy to study before returning it. Loss will come, he foresaw, but not until the collapse of the Temple.  
&gt; Now, back to sleep."
