Lol. What? No. You shaved your head because you wanted to. People shave their heads all the time without having cancer. You were going for a new look. It's not that girl's fault that she assumed you have cancer, but she shouldn't have just acted like the only reason someone would shave their head is because of cancer (that's ignorant and ridiculous). You corrected her immediately, so you weren't "cancer fishing" at all; you were living your life with a shaved head. What the hell is wrong with your friends?
