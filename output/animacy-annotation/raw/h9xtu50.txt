Even if that's correct. (Wich you haven't provided any proof for) Guess what? Less people die if everyone gets vaccinated. That's literally what vaccines do!

You're stupid and ignorant of you refuse a vaccine because someone on Facebook told you to do so.

This is not about freedom, this is about your ego. Taking the vaccine would mean you're wrong but you can't accept that you're wrong.

You are fine with people dying so your ego doesn't get hurt.
