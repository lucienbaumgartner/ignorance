I feel like a piece of shit for thinking it, but I’ve been like “Welcome to the club, motherfuckers!” for half a year now seeing everybody panicked as hell all the time. My dissociated ass is sitting back, business as usual, questioning reality and what not. Life has honestly become significantly more entertaining/engaging to the point that I feel like the pandemic has improved my quality of life to some degree, and I know how horrible and ignorant that sounds, but it’s the truth.
