Lmao.  You’re dumb.   The environmentalist want it fixed appropriately so the river is actually able to sustain the natural populations.  You’re angry because this took 2 years?  It took us 2 years to appropriately return a river to its natural state and you think it’s a bad thing?    


Quick fixes don’t work.  That’s why we are in the messes we are in now.    This damn probably took a decade to build and it was restored to its natural, habitat state in 2 years and you’re so short sighted and ignorant that you think the people responsible for doing it right are the evil ones.    


You are the reason our entire civilization is fucked.  Your willful ignorance and willingness to share your stupid ass point of view is why we are failing.
