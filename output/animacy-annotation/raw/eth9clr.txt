I probably would stay with someone who was *asymptomatic and unaware* that they had an STD, because it's not the same as **maliciously lying to me** about being clean. She said she was clean cause she thought she WAS clean, nothing came up on her last test and she had no symptoms. Most people think no symptoms = I'm fine. Why did you just dive right in bare without seeing confirmed test results if you're this 'responsible' about staying STD free? You really don't have any right to be this angry at her. 

You can get STDs from ONE instance of sexual contact and they can lie dormant for a long time. She could have gotten a false positive. You could have gotten a false negative on your last test and given it to her. Even if she had gotten tested right after her last relationship it may not have shown up yet. I can't believe all these idiots in here calling her a slut and saying she's only upset cause she got caught cheating. She's upset because during a routine fucking checkup she came up positive for two STDs, and her boyfriend is all pissed off and blaming her for it. 

She needs a second test to confirm and you need to be nicer to your girlfriend.
