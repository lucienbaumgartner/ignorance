That's not OP's problem, that's an issue for the children's parents to work out. Leaving kids of that age in their own home would be preferable to dumping them in an unfamiliar home while the homeowner is asleep and unaware that the kids are there. They were trusting that OP was willing and available to watch the kids for an indefinite time without even asking her. If the parents don't want the children left alone, they need to plan ahead for better babysitting resources - eg send each kid to a friend's house for the day.
