“Thank God my mother recognises my brother is trash”
What they’re saying is not just incorrect and ignorant, that sentence alone should get a mother put in jail. I’m not sure if what was described is a crime but it should be, whether it happens to boys or girls. No child deserves to be treated that way because of something they can’t control.
