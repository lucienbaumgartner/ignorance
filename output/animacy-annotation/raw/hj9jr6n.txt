&gt;Are you dim? Now I’m absolutely convinced you’ve never actually watched game of thrones …you just looked at it.

yea. ppl only watch the show

&gt;Pyp did NOT come to the Nights Watch for that, Tyrion was wrong , it was a lie that Pyp made up and he admits the truth to Jon and Samwell Tarley  
&gt;  
&gt;Have you actually watched this show ?  
&gt;  
&gt;https://youtu.be/cLhv7q3NST4&amp;t=2m36s - Pyp was sent to the Wall for refusing to grant sexual favors to a lord at Acorn Hall while working as a singer  
&gt;  
&gt;jog your own memory buddy\^  
&gt;  
&gt;And now you know why Pyp actually got sent to the Nights Watch, you’re welcome.

yea. i forgot this part. i admit but the result is the same. lose your hand or join the night's watch.

&gt;Thanks for the laughs smh wow you kids just look at the pictures but you missed the entire show

i forgot this one scene doesnt mean i missed the entire show

&gt;Every convo you have with people on here…you’re wrong , misinformed and ignorant of the actual narrative dude , it’s embarrassing

you are looking at all my comments. just paints a good picture of you buddy.
