That's very different than claiming Europeans do less travel.   


It's fine and acceptable to say there's more biodiversity in the U.S. I agree with you in that account and only in terms of size, but **it's ignorant and downright stupid to say that's somehow affected by how much people travel in a said continent.**   


Even then, the fact you didn't do the same amount of traveling while in Europe is also a very ignorant comparison.   


You can visit the Carpathian Wilderness, the deserts of Bledow, or Tabernas in Poland or Spain, Malta, Palermo, etc for something reminiscent of caribbean waters.   


Maybe you just didn't know about those places and are biased because you're TexMex. Time to do some reading on other parts of the world.
