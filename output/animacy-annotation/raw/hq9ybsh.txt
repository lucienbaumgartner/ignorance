This! I live in Rural SW Pennsylvania its beautiful but...the amount of idiots here is absolutely overwhelming. They take great pride in being white trash, ignorant, and uneducated. There is never a day I pull into the local gas station to get gas or something and there is another car or truck with the typical bumper stickers.  F Pelosi (Like the guy or girl has a clue what Pelosis function is), or God's, Guns, and Liberty or something stupid.  One lady in the local Pizza shop said her Grandson is not some experiment wouldn't shut up about it for 5 minutes.  "He has a future!" I said " On a venalator with an idiot like you for a grandmother. "  She had no comeback they hate people who won't stand for their idiot rants and agree with them, they want to spout shit in a public place I can too.  At least mine has truth behind it.  They are the weaks ones.  No one with true strength and self esteem needs to act like that.
