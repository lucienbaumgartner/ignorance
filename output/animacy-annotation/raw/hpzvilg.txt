Not really my problem at all, just your problem of incredibly over prioritizing art that you think a multi million dollar company flounders to approach artists in any way and entire ignorance of that  pieces generic aspects being the whole point in the first place. 

I didn't say "anyone could do it" I said anybody could commission it. But again, it's my fault for expecting so much of you, like actually reading what I wrote.

"uh... cAn YOu dRaW?" doesn't actually invalidate the fact that increasing their count of nearly 500 skins by 2 instead of 1 isn't the big deal you imagine it to be. Do enjoy that incredibly ignorant and tired fallacy to adamantly deny any perceived slight at art ever.
