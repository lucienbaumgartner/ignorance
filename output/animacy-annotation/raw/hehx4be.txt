Is the reason we are more likely to believe nonsense precisely because we are so much more advanced? Specifically because we hold a world brain in our hands most the time, we know that people are not only prone to lying, but fallible and ignorant of most things.  
  
We know we don't know, perhaps more excruciatingly then at any other point in history.
