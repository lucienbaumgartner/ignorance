geez, you have a massive anger problem and are completely irrational as well. You genuinely have no idea what you're talking about. You are just so incredibly stupid. BLM wasn't started by random dedicated unpaid people calling representatives. It was started by a group of full-time activists and in a year, BLM went from its creation (2013) to becoming a national force (2014). It wasn't a hard fought road fraught with obstacles. It basically did grow overnight after Ferguson/Michael Brown happened. You are so fucking stupid and ignorant that I feel dumber just knowing you exist. You're blocked.
