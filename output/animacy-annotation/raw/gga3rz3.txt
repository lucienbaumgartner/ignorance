I went against these guys once with a friend. It was awesome considering we had completely uncoordinated team that rushed in constantly all alone and dying. It was very strange that galactic ace ranks be put up against newer players. It was unfortunate to see this. I see all too often that newer players become over confident and unaware of skill limitations but I guess thats why they are called new players.
