Literally this. I'll refrain from straight up touching in the future because I was unaware and uneducated about the fact that petting is uncomfortable for themâ€”I usually associate all animals with petting. The most I'll do it feed with my hand but that's about as far as I go from now on.

As for bonding, I've been studying and hanging around in the same room as her to build trust and sometimes I'll even catch myself chirping back! It got to a point that I felt like I understood what the bird was saying. 

Every day I take her cage out and put it near a balcony for her to get some sun when its warm (Wild Gouldians live in high temperature savannahs) and she used to get scared every single time my hand touches the cage but she has slowly adapted. It's funny because I've recently been around pidgeons and my God they're so much easier.

I wish gouldians weren't so sensitive but that's the way nature intended it I guess. I feel like an asshole because I would do little/unconscious things and I wouldnt even realize that I probably had the poor thing half scared to death. For example just walling near the cage without alerting her, I heard that scares them. And they just look so damn adorable that I thought they'd welcome petting and touching like a lot of animals but I guess they have a Prey mentality. Luckily for me they live very long lives so it seems I have plenty time to patch things up and maybe even get her a mate or friendly finch.
