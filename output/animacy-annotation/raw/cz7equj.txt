It's really interesting hearing more from someone who didn't have a great run on the show, who's open about how brutal it is to get on and fail. Some really cool stories throughout, and he does a great job really painting a picture of the first few weeks especially. He (accidentally I'm pretty sure, which makes the whole thing kind of hilarious) comes off pretty unaware and unsympathetic throughout which wasn't a surprise or a problem for me, but I could see some of the bitter/whiney undertones turning people off.
