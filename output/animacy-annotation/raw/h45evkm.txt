This was in secondary school. I ended up being invited to this group of girls by my best friend. They were generally good people. I still think they are, I just think they were young and unaware of their actions. Once, one of my other good friends in the group said to me 'why do you follow the group around. They don't want you there.' I said that they're my friends too and the person was like 'no they're my friends.' 

That really stung and even does now. Anyway, eventually me and my best friend gravitated towards another group of friends who I genuinely felt a part of and we sat on top of some steps in the school playground. At some point the old friend group would come and sit with us sometimes which was ironic.
