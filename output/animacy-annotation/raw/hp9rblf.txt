Okok I understand that the dudes post is ignorant and uneducated on the matter, that being said he is genuinely asking a question and based on how it seems she reacted to the question it would personally raise suspicion in myself to have had that conversation. I understand what he's asking and he just wants a factual calmly explained answer and appears willing to learn what info is given to him. Yes that's the right post for this sub however we should also show compassion for his genuine concern should we not?
