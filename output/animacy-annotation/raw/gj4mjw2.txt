No they aren't lol. That's the consequence of politicizing a pandemic; the people who support the wrong side don't fully understand the consequences, or their leaders don't understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether it is the 'wearing mask to reduce transmission' or 'COVID kills and can be lethal' or whatever, there are people with crucial misunderstanding of the situation. Haven't kept up with  the rest of the world, but iirc Sweden didn't do anything to prevent the spread, and of course the USA has a significant minority that believes the virus isn't an issue; wearing masks is a violation of freedom, etc.

(Whatever you guys might hear, the majority of Americans DO take this pandemic seriously. It's just the nontrivial minority that are vocally stupid and ignorant that often gets scooped up by the media)
