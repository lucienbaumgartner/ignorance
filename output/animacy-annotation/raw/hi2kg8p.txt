You are shallow and unaware of what brings most people together; it is damn sure not who is "hot" which is a bullshit, unmeasureable, subjective quality. The fact that you insulted him and then blocked him without even attempting to justify what he could have done to deserve your callousness shows that you're most likely an immature child. 

What's most clear here is that good relationships will be out of your league until you grow up.
