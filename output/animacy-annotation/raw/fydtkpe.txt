OK, here's a conversation. The idea that 'faboi's are doing themselves a disservice by "just not losing fat", as if top world elite caliber athletes would have god damn discipline problems is so ridiculous and ignorant that it made me make that petty dickhead comment, for which I apologize for.

The whole point of DC's success, like Roy Nelson, Andy Ruiz, Gastelum, hell Fedor, and many other 'heavy'/'fat' bois, is his low center of gravity, when heavy muscular fighters like Anthony Joshua or N'Gannou throw power shots it takes a lot more energy for them not only to throw but to reset (get back in their neutral stance after a big overhand for example) than people like DC. Notice their styles: short fast punches. They throw with speed similar to weight classes below, while packing power. Do you see how Gastelum, Fedor, DC, Ruiz, they have KO power as well as speed superior to their opponents 90% of the time.

My whole point, while disrespectful, which I apologize again for, was that it's not just "bruh just lose weight". There's more to it and there's a reason why not every single fighter is not ripped and no, it's not because they lack discipline or motivation.
