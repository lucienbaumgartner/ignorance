If your husband can’t get on the same page, you should divorce him. Full stop. If your family isn’t accepting, you should be his greatest defender and lawyer, and show no tolerance for snarky/demeaning comments. If you guys eventually do decide to tell the rest of the family (if your son wishes to) and you find yourself in a situation where they refuse to accept him, never show your son that you’re willing to indulge in the idea of them not accepting his sexuality, but him «as a person». That’s bullshit. If other people are so uneducated and ignorant that they can’t accept a gay person in 2019 (almost 2020), that’s entirely their fault. 

Your son is gay, that’s it. It’s not a lifestyle, it’s a sexuality he’s born with and can’t change; a lifestyle is something somebody actively *chooses* to structure their life around. Also, just because he’s gay doesn’t mean he’s dating yet or anything; the most common way for gay people to meet other gay people are through apps and online sites, though.
