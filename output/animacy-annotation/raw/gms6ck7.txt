I can't emphasize enough how stupid and ignorant of a statement this is.  Just because you don't hear about them doesn't mean regular people and small business owners don't get targeted attacks by twitter mobs ALL THE TIME.  There are literally countless examples, so I'll just list one that happened TODAY:

Like [this person](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFllq_AzsS/) who  has been the target of a harassment campaign for the last year or  so for being pro-life, has had contracts canceled and TODAY, had her website hacked and redirected to pornography.  

Seriously, "only happens to rich people."  This is not a rich person, it's a mom of 3 trying to sell some art for extra cash. Get the fuck out of here with that shit.
