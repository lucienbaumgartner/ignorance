This is the main thing. I feel like GenZ seems very strong, independent, self made, look out for eachother.

Republicans are now propping up failing business, trying to rig votes, rig opportunity for whites only, and just spending like crazy.

I remember a lot of kids in my highschool bitching about Bush's spending during the Iraq war. We weren't blissfully unaware and blindly republican because of it.

I think these kids will just be amplified versions of that.
