Yes, This is why "genital herpes" statistics typically only include HSV2, because blood testing doesn't reveal the location of HSV1 infections. 

I would also guess many people diagnosed with GHSV1 who go on to contract HSV2 are unaware and less motivated to test for HSV 1/2 as they already have a diagnosis of genital herpes due to HSV1. Just a guess.
