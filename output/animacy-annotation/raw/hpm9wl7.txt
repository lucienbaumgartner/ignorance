Straight up, i dont care if I know what the dish is I’ll usually ask about it or whats in it. If your deathly allergic to *anything* this should be the first thing you think to ask before eating *anything*. 

No fucking way it’s OP’s fault at all, they just want to blame him so that they themselves don’t have to take *any* responsibility for their ignorance. All they had to do was ask whats in the food. 

Also, the boyfriend was eating lobster ravioli with his girlfriend BUT never went “Hey babe, this taste like lobster we need to go to an ER”? 

Its 100% their fault for being ignorant and careless. She even told her boyfriend about it and didn’t tell anyone else so yeah its their fault.!
