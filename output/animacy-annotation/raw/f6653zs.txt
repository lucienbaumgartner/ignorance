Battlefield 5. There were so many disappointments and fuck-ups and general misconceptions at launch but their outstanding move was describing the playerbase as uneducated and ignorant. That was a step too far for some loyal veterans and a significant number decided to boycott 5, enough of them so that it really did affect the sales of the game. Dice are under pressure now to come up with something really good for Bf6 to attract those players back.
