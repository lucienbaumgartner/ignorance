Ok, you’re right about that. To me the Proclamation makes it seem like gender is more cut and dry than it is in actuality. But maybe that’s just me. I was pretty young and unaware of a lot of things when it first came out so I always thought “yeah, of course, our gender is our gender, that’s an easy one”. Then I learned more about how often it isn’t so simple for people. It’s a hard thing to figure out how to believe in the proclamation doctrine, which makes it seem so simple when it is actually pretty complex when dealing with issues of non-obvious gender or non-cis-gendered people.

Again, this is just my opinion, but to me the wording of the proclamation implies that each person will know whether they are a son or daughter and that won’t change which makes it really hard for transgender or intersex people to know if they are going against God or not as they try to live in the Church. And the numbers I quoted mean that around 160,000 members of the church have physical intersex characteristics and that doesn’t even include the many transgender members. Yet there isn’t consideration given for that in the proclamation.
