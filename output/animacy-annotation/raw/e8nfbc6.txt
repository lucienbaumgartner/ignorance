If you have the time, have a look at what the **self-serving bias** is. It pretty much happens in all areas, not only in Rocket League. We all make mistakes, but some are just too afraid of admitting that they caused a loss. On the other hand, they think they carried if it was a win. Somehow I get the feeling that these people are kids because they're pretty immature and ignorant.

That aside, good point you made. I haven't actually saved any replays, let alone watch them. I probably should.
