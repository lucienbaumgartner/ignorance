&gt;It’s fairly pathetic and ignorant of you to really believe it was still being god worshipped there when it’s clear proof that the civilizations all over the area were idol worshippers and worshipping more than one god.

That is the quote I was responding to. It goes against the established historical consensus to say that "god" (by which I assume you mean Yahweh/Allah/God of Abraham) wasn't worshipped there.
