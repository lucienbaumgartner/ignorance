While nobody wants to be spoken down to, there's not really any other way to make it clear to popcorn apes how absolutely mind bogglingly stupidly ignorant and gullible they are being, without them feeling like you are talking down to them. The information has been shared over and over. It's not some mystery. It's been right here in plain sight for a year, and nobody in popcorn subs hasn't heard about and had the opportunity to access this info. 

Popcorn apes are sitting there under a big massive sign that says "push the red button to be a millionaire", there's news broadcasts about it, whole websites full of information about how great the red button is. But some randomer comes along and hands them all a leaflet where every time it says "red button" they scribble it out and write "blue button". And you popcorn apes lap it up saying "nah I think I like the blue button better, some internet celeb told me about it". And no matter how many times people try to convince you that this info is copy and pasted, half of it is not even applicable or relevant or even true, nothing seems to really register in those tiny brains. 

I'm sorry, but these people at this stage deserve to be spoken down to.
