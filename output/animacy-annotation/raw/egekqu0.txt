I visited some friends in Ecuador, and they actually brought up how it’s rude for U.S. citizens to call themselves Americans when referring to U.S. It signals that we think of ourselves more important than other countries in America. It’s dismissive and ignorant. That stuck with me. I now refer to myself as “from the U.S.”
