I kinda just think Gems and Leo’s are a natural attraction at first but it ends up being toxic in my experience. I think Leo’s have very high expectations that can be unrealistic  and Gems are just known to be flaky and flighty. Tip: Leo’s like to be appreciated (they can’t help it they’re just egocentric like that), and maybe your friends perspective is they’re not getting back what they put in. I obviously don’t know your dynamics just trying to help preserve the friendship. I just know in my experiences I’ve had a lot of Gem friends who’ve been very unaware and opportunistic. Something that drives a generous Leo who wants recognition for their warmth. I also know typically Gem and Leo personalities can clash because Gems can drive Leo’s crazy with how much they talk about themselves! (Not fair since it’s a Leo but hey they probably want a little more of the spotlight because they’re often the most extra friend). Also, Leo’s are known for their sensitivity and I think Gems are often very not self  aware or in tune of the emotions and people around them (just in my experience). They’re just flighty and fun people. Meaning there’s a lot of room to hurt someone and not realize it. 
It’s so strange because my long term partner who I live with is an Aquarius and I hold bonds with Aquarius people. They’re super ride or die and honest in my experience. But they can detach VERY quickly if you’re not a soulmate connection. Whereas, I’ve had nothing but bad experiences with Gems and haven’t seen a lot of similarities between the signs except very vague superficial ones. Pretty strange since I’m a Gemini rising and I see a lot of Gemini in my appearance/ personality.
