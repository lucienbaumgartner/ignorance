I agree the wording is ambiguous - it doesn't explicitly state that they try to take over a PC, but many people have read it that way. I disagree with that interpretation because it doesn't make sense thematically: intellect devourers come from the illithid, who are masters of subterfuge. They aren't going to try and engage adventurers so brazenly in their true form. With only 12 AC and 21 hp, one good round of attacks and they're reduced to pulp, which is exactly what happened in my games - my party had an immediate revulsion to the intellect devourers and their first impulse was to make them go splat.

I think an intellect devourer involuntarily dislodged from its host is more likely to flee and hide. It can use its Detect Sentience trait to avoid creatures that might pose a threat to it. If it wants to assume control of another body, it's likely to wait until the creature is vulnerable - for instance, when it is asleep and unaware of its presence. They may not even opt for a PC - they may simply assume control of another goblinoid on the level. Since these particular intellect devourers are in league with Xanathar's Guild, they might even do none of the above and just hide and await instructions from their illithid handlers.

I personally did not proactively try to replace any PCs with an intellect devourer. I didn't want to tip my hand too early and make them paranoid because I had larger plans for them. Some of their friends and acquaintances have slowly been taken over by intellect devourers, and I am working towards a big reveal that we are incredibly close to. One of them may get replaced before then, but I'm trying to be very subtle about it. It won't be a direct confrontation - again, masters of subterfuge and manipulation, the point is to strike when they're most vulnerable, and least suspecting.
