Not only that; without getting as many people vaccinated as possible, variants will keep mutating, and eventually one is going to escape current vaccination or cause worse illness in those who are not or are unable to be vaccinated. 

And yet in most threads, even on this subreddit, it is filled with 'vaccine hesitant' people who will shout to the moon their problems with the vaccine, and then when data is presented, they will just come up with the next excuse. 

When did so many American's become selfish and ignorant? That seems so un-American to me.
