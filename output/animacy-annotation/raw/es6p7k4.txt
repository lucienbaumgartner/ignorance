Thank you for commenting that. Geez, these people have no common sense, just a hatred for anything good. Then, they argue we can't afford it. Well, that argument is bullshit, because if we have plenty of money for neverending warfare, we can properly educate our people like every other first world country. Republicans want to keep the populace uneducated and ignorant; that way, they will believe that everything good is bad for them.
