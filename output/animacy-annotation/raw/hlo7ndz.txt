My advice would be to keep doing what you're doing. It takes resilience, perserverance, and reflection. You have a wonderful way with words, indicating a level of emotional intelligence and self awareness that can and will carry you through the hardest of lessons in this life.  

Love is all around you, all the time. We are both aware and unaware of this fact. We pull our observations, our behaviours and our beliefs from our experiences of it. Our fear can govern our thoughts and actions if we allow it too, and thus we never break free from the constant circling of poor choices.

Forgive yourself for the choices you made, endaevor to make better choices in the future, start making those plans now. Write it down somewhere. What do you want from your next relationship? What don't you want? Secure these thoughts and values in a place you can always find them whenever or if ever you feel yourself turning back. 

This way you know they are there, and you can be free to open your heart and your mind to the next woman that comes into your life.
