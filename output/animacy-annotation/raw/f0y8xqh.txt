They really really want this narrative. They don't think that logical people can consider subsequent actions and accept apologies for past wrongdoing. The fact is that even a lot of right leaning people I know don't think JT is racist. They take issue With it because of they feel he has acted 'holier than thou' on issues of race. It's only the truly tribalized and ignorant that want to say 'hes a racist' and scream it to the hilltops. If , for example, Scheer came on an interview and apologized to gay people for comparing them to dogs in Parliament and said he has grown and no longer feels Threatened by gay marriage.... People would be willing to let it go. That's the difference that people who are simply playing sides won't see. This is a HUGE blunder by Trudeau , and he owned it. He didn't try to call it harmless fun, he didn't say times were different ... He said it was wrong I should not have done it, I am ashamed, should have known better, etc.
