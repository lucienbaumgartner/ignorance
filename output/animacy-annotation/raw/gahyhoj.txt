I disagree, to a point. The effort to ignore politics and resent the obligation to follow it is a spell Trump broke that **must stay broken**. Many of the people who resent their inability to get away from politics under Trump want to go back to a time before him where they could be blissfully ignorant and unaware of politics, and this cannot be allowed. It must rent space in your head whether you like it or not - hopefully it continues to do so once it gets boring again.

Otherwise, that's a lesson America will have to learn the hard way all over again. However exhausting it gets to think about and follow your politics, there is *always* a stiff cost to ignoring it.
