Calling people biased isn’t positivity, my guy. And I’m not even religious lmao, I’m an atheist. Jesus Christ is a term used to describe disbelief in somebody else’s stupidity. But I wouldn’t expect you to understand anything, considering you’re obviously just so hateful and ignorant that you can’t even for a second see that and grasp onto any tiny thing just to make yourself feel superior
