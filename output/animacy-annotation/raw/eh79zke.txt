What's crazy to me is just how unaware and uninterested in this situation most people I know are. I'm not really connected to politics in my community right now so that's part of it, but I've been talking to my coworkers about it (or trying to) and they all seem totally unconcerned with and unaware of what's going on in Venezuela or the history of US intervention in Latin America historically. I mean the conversations usually end with them acknowledging it doesn't sound good, but it's clearly just them kindly agreeing with the insane leftist guy jabbering at them.
