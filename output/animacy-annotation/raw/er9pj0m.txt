&gt;I promise you if I'm elected president, you're going to see the single most important thing that changes America, we're gonna cure cancer.

How is this not lying? It's just as much as a lie as the bullshit that Trump gets constantly gets called out on, you can't hold a different standard for people depending on what side of the political aisle they're on. 

"If I'm elected, we cure cancer," is either 1) making blatant false promises or 2) being so egotistical and ignorant that you actually believe this. It's not being literalist and reducing his words, it's just applying the same standard for promises that we should hold *everyone* to, Democratic or Republican.
