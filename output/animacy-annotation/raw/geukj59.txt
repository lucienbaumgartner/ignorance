Gavin being Gavin does count otherwise they need to go back and delete every video of Gavin being an smarmy ass hole who thinks what he is doing is funny.  So far I don't see them doing that.

If they are removing videos because of ryan they need to surgically remove the videos based on what ryan says not what others say.  Because the entire stance is that the rest of AH was unaware and oblivious to ryan's behavior. Going back and censoring shit that the ignorant and oblivious people said as jokes only pushes the argument that they knew and now they are covering their own ass.
