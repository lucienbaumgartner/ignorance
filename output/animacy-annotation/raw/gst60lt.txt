What a poor victim of medical provider abuse! Poor thing. 
Jess wouldn’t last the day just following a medical provider!  This is silly, immature and ignorant of Jess. Medical professionals tell Jess the truth so then Jess calls it abuse? They should risk losing their job, license and everything else for Jess?! HA! Not a chance. Jess will never change the system that treats Jess with honesty because the honest medical providers are being REAL. 
Abuse is what Jess does to everyone around her. Everyone she touches gets held hostage. They are the ones with Stockholm Syndrome. All of jess’s family, friends and even just people she meets on social media. They are the ones who are continually being abused by her and they keeping coming back for more. It’s really sad that they are “addicted” to her and suffer under her tyranny.  So so so sad.
