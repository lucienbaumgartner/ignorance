I read this article, and when it links to an explanation of how he has a "troubling history" of sexism, one of the links is to an [APOLOGY](https://gist.github.com/unclebob/2508746) he made, lol. That's a weird way to be unrepentant. Meanwhile another link is broken and leads to nowhere.

Oh wait, he said "Craftsmanship" instead of "Craftsthemship"? You should have told me that earlier, I'll get the pitchforks. I can't promise they'll be 6L.

The more I read this the more ridiculous it is. It says he got "especially really mad" at the craftsmanship thing, but what his tweet said was: "Complaining about “craftsman” as a word is petty and ignorant of the English language."

Sorry, but that's not "especially really mad" unless you truly don't know English. That is, at best, mild irritation. Framing your opponent as being foaming-at-the-mouth angry is a really good way to poison the well, though, because there is nothing they can do to defend themselves that won't prove you right. All they can do is prostrate at your feet, or they're playing into your assertions at how angry they are.
