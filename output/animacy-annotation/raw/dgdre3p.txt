I think the only thing I ever downvote is white feminism, like you said, or basically any type of speaking over the minority, kind of like some people did on those posts about Kaitlyn Dobrow (disabled bg) and the one about autism speaks. If you're honestly unaware and willing to listen, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but if you're a total dick about it or refuse to listen to the minority voice and remain ignorant, I have no problem downvoting you to hell. And I may downvote you if you're being overly bitchy. But that depends on my mood.

Otherwise, I don't typically downvote. I'll roll my eyes at a lot of it, but I'll leave it be.
