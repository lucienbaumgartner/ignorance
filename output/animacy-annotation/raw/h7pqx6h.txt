Also, how shallow and ignorant of her. Like, her equating this to rape is BEYOND disrespectful to the real brutality and agony that rape really is. What a way to prove to the world how sheltered and stupid someone is.

Makes me so furious when people think it's somehow okay to undermine serious issues like this and the victims whose lives are now a living hell from all the trauma. Both men and women. Rape is not a fucking joke and she's acting like it is. Disgusting.
