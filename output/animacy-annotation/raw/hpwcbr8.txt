Historical fact, *dude*. From the Holy Roman Empire till the modern day, total conversion of other cultures has always been a key element of Christianity. And with that came the erasure of the religions and cultures that came before. This certainly isn't unique to Christianity or Catholicism, but denying that it didn't take place is ignorant and absurd.

Be mad at me all you want for calling it out, but traditional cultures in Scotland, Ireland, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and others didn't just disappear on their own. Some converted willingly, others less so. Even Christians today don't gloss over it: https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/interview-converting-by-the-sword

Hell, look up how Native American children were taken from their families and put into schools meant to strip their roots from them- language, history, beliefs, religious practices, all of it - and turn them Christian instead. Entire cultures almost completely erased in barely a generation or two. Pretending it didn't happen won't change the fact that it very much did.
