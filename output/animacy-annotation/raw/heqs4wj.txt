There are *plenty* of lower earning folks on this sub. Please do NOT listen to that other user. You are saving well. You're on a good course for increasing your income and with some planning can increase it more aggressively. The incredibly shortsighted and ignorant of other industries POV of the other user is NOT going to be helpful to you but there are plenty of people who are in *very similar positions to you* on this subreddit.

You can achieve financial independence, it will just be more work for you right now. You also may consider things like /r/leanfire to get a better grasp of non-super-high-earning version of FIRE can look like.

Please, ignore that other user. They are not giving you a "reality check" or an honest answer. They are giving you are very narrow view of this sub, it's worth/purpose and what potential your earning has.
