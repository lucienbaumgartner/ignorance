I think that like anything, some people also like to keep up some pretense that their life is perfect. Probably the same type. I also know a lot of women who have had menopause symptoms, but didn't put two and two together that it was related to menopause and thought it was other health problems. There has been so much stigma for so long that I feel like most people are still very unaware and ignorant about the reality of menopause. Women have suffered in silence for so long that it is just treated as if the norm is to keep continuing to not talk about it.
