Im not upset with the imagery. Im upset you find that imagery acceptable but another similar image is not. Take gender out of this, what's the issue? None. You just dismissed it because of what the image will be printed on, again not really valid. The point is the image will be seen and shared, correct? You keep saying poster, fox is not selling mystique strangled posters, it's a billboard. Time warner IS selling superman choking batman materials. You equate one to being sexist because that imagery does not happen to men. I showed you, IT DOES. There's instances of batman choking superman, there's terminators choking each other (men and women), this stuff is out there. You can look yourself. 

You are creating sexism by being unaware and dismissive of violence against men. There is NO sexism here. Even still, suppose this was the first use of someone being choked in an ad ever. Why can't women be pioneers of this form of violence? Hitchcock showed the first toilet in a movie, it has to start some where, right? You're saying women cannot be pioneers then. Someone had to be the first one shot on film, the first one shot in TV, chocked, punched ect. ect. It's usually men, because its a male dominated industry. 


You're either saying women aren't good enough to be pioneers in stories, or you're about putting men first. Either way, that's not progress, that is discrimination against women, you are making it a thing of the present.
