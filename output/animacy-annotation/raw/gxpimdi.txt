&gt;The mods need to be the ones fact checking the posts and amending them

Okay, lemme break down for you why this is BS.  I mod a history related subreddit.  I have a degree in history.  Let's say someone posts a picture of an obscure point in history.  Hey, that's what this sub is all about!  But it's not an area of history I'm super-familiar with.  I reverse google image search the submission, but all the pages I find are in languages I don't know.  I "fact check" as best I can, but at the end of the day that's not very well at all, because all can really do is either trust the same Google you all have access to, or hope that it is something I've previously learned about.

So this guy posting pictures of Ustase murderers, and teaching folks in the sub all about the Ustase, what do you want me to do?  I can either remove the post when it's reported for "Misleading or Factually Incorrect", or I can keep it, either with or without a call for whoever reported it to explain themselves.  Generally speaking I choose the latter.

Mods aren't somehow any more educated or enlightened about anything in the world than any other average joes.  Expecting us to fact check every submission on your behalf is pretty silly and ignorant of the realities at hand.  I can't imagine doing that on the sub that gets like four submissions a day, much less something like this sub that gets hundreds.

If it's that important to the reporter to report the post, they can explain the misinfo.
