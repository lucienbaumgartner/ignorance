ESH -

You're weirdly and unhealthily over involved in their relationship; you told them their relationship was toxic and to break up (and it sounds like they just kind of did because you told them to), you decided to mediate these fights. You decided Daniel was an ass because he prioritized his mental health, which just isn't the case. It is normal to prioritize ones own health (so long as you aren't completely unaware and insensitive to other people's struggles, which he wasn't from how you describe). 

As for Lisa, she doesn't want you involved in their relationship. And the reason she's saying you favor Daniel is because you are so entangled in their relationship that she isn't just breaking up with him; she's breaking up with you too. And, ultimately, I don't blame her for not wanting to be in a relationship with an uninvited third party. That being said, she isn't being honest about her feeling; she can't blame you for never reaching out when you did, in fact, reach out. 

And Daniel seems oblivious to all of this. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
