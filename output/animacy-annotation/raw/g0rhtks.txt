police who unjustifiably kill innocent people should automatically be sentenced to death

My reasoning is that police are trusted to protect the citizens  from crime as well as uphold the law. When police kill someone because they (the police) are too jumpy and scared because they think the suspect poses a threat, they end up eroding away the trust that the community has in them. If those police are still allowed to live free lives and most likely still work in law enforcement, they will surely kill again (which is weird, because most humans feel remorse for taking another humans life) 

Now I'd like to emphasize that I support police most of the time, because most police officers are sane, mentally stable people who mean well for their community (though I find it odd that police officers rarely think negatively about fellow officers who get away with murder and misconduct, meanwhile school teachers despise fellow teachers charged with pedophilia and child abuse)

I also recognize that most police officers will never fire their weapons in their careers (apart from training), so hating on police offers just for their career choice is beyond silly and ignorant. That being said, I still believe cops have too many priveleges just because of their job title, they on average receive less punishment for misconduct/murder, therefore they are held to lower standards. I believe in order to balance out the scales of justice, upholders of the law (police) should  AUTOMATICALLY be sentenced to death when they kill someone, and there is massive social outrage  (not if the jury determines, as jurys are often biased)

Example: Derek Chauvin not only murdered a man who was having a panic attack, but ALSO SPARKED MASS OUTRAGE ACROSS THE WORLD RESULTING IN MILLIONS (IF NOT BILLIONS) OF DOLLARS WORTH IN DAMAGE. Not to mention  driving the wedge further into the political/social divide, which just makes tensions high, which can spark civil wars (as if that hasn't effectively happened already)
