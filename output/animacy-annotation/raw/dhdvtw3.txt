LMayD blew up the passage/door leading to the hangar.  LMD Coulson was standing right in front of her.  Her intent was just to stop fake Coulson.

Talbot mentioned how many agents were injured and hurt in the explosion, so there had to have been survivors.

Plus, I think it would be overly dark to assume that the explosion that Daisy and Jemma allowed/encouraged to happen, would kill all of the good, unaware, and unconscious human agents left in the base.

I assume that the only LMDs to die in that explosion were May and Coulson.  LMD Fitz was down in one of the white holding rooms programming the LMDaisy's for search and destroy, or something like that.  We can see in this episode that at least one of the white rooms survived the explosion.  And it's my assumption that those rooms are directly below the hangar.  He and the army could have survived.
