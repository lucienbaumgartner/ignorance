What’s more infuriating to me is that a lot of these “keto” products well aren’t “keto”. I’m diabetic (type 1). So if something has carbs my sugar will spike regardless of what the labels says. A lot of these products where they add fiber to their recipe to lower their “net carb” count still spike my sugar closer to their total carb value. This means it’ll have an insulin response in regular people. It’s one thing if they made something that was actually low on carbs and charged extra for the convenience  but when it’s actively working against the diet their claiming to be supporting it’s a little maddening. A lot of people who’ll buy these are beginners who are already unaware and learning and these products will lead to plateaus and confusion smh
