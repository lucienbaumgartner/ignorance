The problem is the number of below average to outright bad profs. I'd say during my undergrad it was a coinflip, half of my profs were great, even if I did poorly insome of their classes. The other half of my profs were horrible, even in classes where I did good. 

I had profs who were literally reading textbook passages in class.  Of course i won't attend lectures after 2-3 weeks of boring readings, I can do that myself lol. Other profs simply had such thick accents that they were incomprehensible, and some others so intelligent and unaware that they would literally skip material because its "too easy'. I even had a prof stated in the first class that he did not like the material he wad teaching lol.

But of course, on the other hand you got all the profs who are passionate and who take the time to craft and design courses in such a manner that they can demondtrate the underlying concepts to students who have never come across them before. 

And liking a prof is often subjective. Some people like the robotic delivery and textbook reading sessions. I personally preferred relatable example and real life examples, even if they were simplistic or "easy". Because after that, i was able to scale the example to more difficult applications by understanding how the theory worked
