Oof, so instead of engaging you just shut down and leave? Ok then let’s discuss the concept of your experience being different from mine. Let’s think, some people find themselves in social circles where “antifa” is an adjective and not a group. Others, though, have never seen anyone identify with it other than those in some sort of cohesive group that they see online, in the streets, or on TV. 

It’s pretty short-sighted and ignorant of people like you to assume your semantics apply to everyone. You shouldn’t just say “hurr durr if you don’t support antifa you’re a fascist”. Instead try and understand what those people really mean. They really mean “I don’t support burning cars in the name of being anti fascist” and for that, their opinions are 100% valid. 

I just can’t believe how unwilling people like you are to really discuss things with even the smallest amount of nuance.
