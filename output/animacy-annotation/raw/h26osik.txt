Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist, in short, a feminist, but one that is so myopic and ignorant that they exclude transwomen from their fight for equal rights. They often get confused about gender and sex not being the same thing and the fact that there aren't just two genders or just two sexes. 

TERFs basically think transwomen are still men trying to encroach on their space and fight for equality. Where they could have an ally who has also been marginalized, they instead demean the eexperiences of transwomen and push them away.
