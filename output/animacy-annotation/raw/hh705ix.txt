You're assuming I'm a teacher, by profession, which I'm not. Second, you're extrapolating that I'm a poor teacher- from what, I don't know. Third, you're strawmanning this argument that the children of this state are uneducated because I, as a *not* teacher, am responsible for their education. And you say you work at the labs? Jesus, I'd hate to read any of the papers you've written- assuming you're not just a janitor there and actually have the qualifications to be writing *anything* other than crude limericks on the bathroom-stall doors.  

Context *is* important, but so is the specificity of language. You specifically said...  

&gt;You're forgetting that one of the foremost leaders of scientific research in the world and responsible for the birth of the atomic age is commuting distance to SF.  

Hence why I asked for this specific person's name, because, to my knowledge, every person that was integral to the birth of the Atomic Age is long since dead. So, you're *factually* wrong and ignorant of the actually context that you brought up. Congrats, once again proving that people educated here lack reading comprehension.  

And speaking of reading comprehension- New Mexico ranks [49th in the nation](https://www.koat.com/article/new-mexico-ranks-49th-in-literacy-in-the-nation/36453934) in literacy. Oh, and just overall, New Mexico ranks [51st](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/when-it-comes-to-nurturing-student-success-n-m-ranks-last-can-it-turn-things-around/2020/01) on the Chance-for-Success Index which measures, "...the importance of education in a person's lifetime from cradle to career." So, **factually** New Mexico residents that are educated here are fucking ignorant pieces of shit, which clearly you've proven. Congrats, you suck. You can blame it on racism, but this state has white people too. So, suck a bag of dicks, supposedly educated person who works at LANL.  

I'm sorry your education has been terrible, but if you want to come for me? Best come correct- and you're not. Bye.
