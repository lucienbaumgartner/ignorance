Every gun owner I know knows that "assault weapons" is a bullshit term to mean semiautomatics that we all use every day for perfectly normal things and which are essential to defend our homes, etc.

I have never ever heard of any gun owner who supports a ban on semi-automatics. I don't believe these gun owners exists. I am going to say that Klobuchar is a bald faced liar here. She has no evidence or proof of her claims and furthermore her claims are so insane and ignorant that no informed rational person would ever agree with her. She's pandering to the ignorant and the fearful and the haters.
