&gt;I am upset because it seems like everything we're seeing in the news nowadays states that if you don't get the vaccine (and yes, I have had mine), that you are a bad person.

Unless you have a specific medical condition, there is literally no good reason to not get vaccinated.
 
Choosing to not be vaccinated means you're malevontly careless, selfish, and ignorant.  That doesn't make you a bad person, per se,but those aren't exactly admirable traits.

So what, you want misinformed anti vax people can play the victim card and say they're being persecuted for their beliefs?

I'm not rooting for covid, but the world would be a far better place if trump had died from it back in September, for a myriad of reasons.
