Vaccines are like lifting your truck, it's not going to guarantee you are annoying in traffic but will definitely help out!

They are like the Gadsden flag window decal, it's not going to let *everyone* know you're insufferable and ignorant of history, but will let *a lot* of people know.

It's like a thing blue line bumper sticker....etc.
