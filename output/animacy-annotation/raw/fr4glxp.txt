I am American. And I am ashamed that you are so prideful and ignorant that you cant be bothered to multiply two numbers in order to help someone because 'murica. Instead of putting in the slightest bit of effort, you take this "dur hurr I'm not metric" position which is mocking the persons plea. Pathetic. It makes us decent Americans look like ignorant morons.
