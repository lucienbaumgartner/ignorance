I’ve tried to be respectful but you seem to be intent on misunderstanding me. I don’t give a shit about Trisha. What I do give a shit about is the fact that in the process of criticising Trisha, many people have made comments that I find to be offensive and ignorant, that reflect their general beliefs about use of hands and cutlery. It’s not about this specific scenario, it’s the idea that only certain foods are acceptable to be eaten with hands and that using cutlery is inherently more respectable. That is simply not the case for everyone. I’m not dictating what anyone says, I’m not holding a gun to anyone’s head. What I’m doing is expressing my opinion.
