I want to add something that I don’t know if its been brought up: even if you gave an under negotiated “blanket consent” you can only consent for as long as you can take that consent back.
With that I refer to the fact that you tried to safeword a couple of times but couldn’t because he had his hand over your mouth, and therefore unable to. That situation alone, even if you had originally consented to it, sets grounds for rape, because in that moment (as well as the moments you were unconscious and unaware of what was going on bc he didn’t walk through the scene with you) you were unable to say no.
And consent can only happen if you can safely say no to it.
