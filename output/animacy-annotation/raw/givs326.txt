Switched from iPhone &gt; Samsung &gt; Mi &gt; Oneplus. Oneplus 8 pro is an amazing device (hardware) but he developers seems to be totally lazy and ignorant of the bug reports. Submitted over 30 bug reports (mostly in camera department) and only one was resolved till now. And the resolved issue was a minor one. The major issues are still there. The devs didn't even retrieve the log files shared to them via gdrive(you get a copy paste reply after submitting a bug to upload the logs to gdrive)! So final verdict : If you are a power user wanting quick resolution of bugs and addition of features, Oneplus is not the phone brand for you. What I'm buying next? I'll go back to Mi even if means paying a hefty import fee
