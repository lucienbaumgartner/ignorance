How tf am I out of touch when I literally said I was working those jobs at lower than $13 an hour until 2016, mostly at $10? 

Who cares about your “two friends”. Like, do you want a cookie or something? 40k is still shit. Top accounts generally only make 100k too. Dude, you aren’t making more than the average account with this insecurity. You’d ABSOLUTELY get frustrated and stop based on gauging your personality and reaction to the truth. 

You are incredibly ignorant and insecure. It’s hilarious that you say “nobody is hiring full time”, yet I’m seeing new people working account receivable clerk starting at 35k a year, no degree required. Keep telling me how out of touch I am and making excuse after excuse about all the facts I gave you you didn’t even know before I told you. You know what that’s called? A piss poor attempt at gaslighting me telling me “you don’t know anything about the job market”. I’m 32. Worked in retail, grocery store, military, grocery store again, now accountant working my way up from entry level to 74k. 

I’ve never said the job market was great. You’re just again gaslighting me because you’re too insecure to admit you’re just lazy asf. Shit, I’m lazy and I managed to progress to a modest salary and banking on being at 80k+ because I know the market trend and how to negotiate. Oh, but please tell me again how out of touch I am. It’s crazy to me how much excuse fueled people stay at the bottom and just bitch and bitch and bitch. Im out of touch, yet make nearly triple the amount as you where I started with less than you and way passed you now. 

All that said SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH YOUR EXCUSES AND FUCKING WORK HARD. you’d have to work way harder for that 40k your friends make anyway, so why not start with the entry level and progress up? It’s a shitty market because you insist it is and do nothing but complain.
