The fact that so many atheists are interpreting this as an attempt to shift to BoP just makes me laugh. To me it seems clear that the OP is that 'if you are ignorant on a topic you should not debate it or dispute it'.

  
You are unconvinced and haven't looked into the topic? That's fine, but then why would you try to debate the topic of dispute it? The moment you try to dispute/debate the topic then you being unconvinced and ignorant of arguments becomes, imo, reason enough to think you are a joke.
