Hey there, this is a really interesting question and I’m going to do my best to answer it from what I’ve picked up here.

You will find what I’ll refer to as “clumsy stupid racism”, something which outside of a few communities is rare where I’m from (and I’d hope most of the US). So for example you might have a student say *“why are you black?”* or *“Are you from Africa?”* which you might just find absurd- although I’m not going to second guess your experience.

 I have a friend here of mixed heritage who comes from a similar part of London that I do, students are permanently perplexed at what they see as an irreconcilable blend of posh English and their own perceptions of skin colour. Although, they are unaware that what they say is inappropriate and its definitely our job to put them right.

Another factor is that these are students using English out of context, often only in school and never within a society. So it’s not un-common for them to pick up language from entertainment and throw it around without real thought as to its implication. Often it’s pretty vanilla like using “Shit” or “Fuck” where not appropriate, but I have heard racial slurs used. When confronted however they seem totally unaware and often ashamed that they would be considered racist, which due to their history, is a big deal here.

Hiring wise, don’t forget that a lot of people doing the hiring here are Westerners so it should be fine.  I’ve seen people from all backgrounds teaching here and it’s easy to meet people. The heinous racists I’ve had the mis-fortune of meeting are ridiculously shallow and only spouted their filth to me because of how I look (shaved head, white dude).

I say just apply, Vietnam is a great country, get over here and have fun!

Edit changed a word to better explain myself
