People like you are lucky that the developers ever communicate with the community at all. Why in the hell would they want to say anything to people who are so obviously ignorant and needlessly hostile? The fuck do you know about developing games? The fuck do you know about working at a large company? 

The only thing that's disgraceful is the amount of dumbass sycophants who make these streamers feel like they are immune to being wrong. If ranked is so shitty then go play something better. But you can't because it doesn't exist.
