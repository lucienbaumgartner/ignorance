&gt; I never said I didn't think they knew it was going to be rough. A few were clearly crying at the end and didn't know the level of degradation they would face. 

Yes you did: "These people didn't know they were getting into this kind of shit" and "The people responding to these ads are clearly not aware of the type of director he is. He's preying on people who are desperate and unaware.".

And I'm telling you you're pulling that claim straight out of your ass. Show me the job advert for this studio that doesn't mention they are into rough sex, humiliation and their studio name (by which the actresses can easily research the sort of scene they are being employed to do).

&gt; Any decent kink company shows a bit of the girls' acknowledging that they've been given safe words

What's your point? Editing in this part into the final distributed video has no effect on the actress. I don't think they're given a safeword like in BDSM... except "Stop"... that's a pretty good safeword, eh?

&gt; The one girl said she didn't want to do porn anymore, as if this is the only kind of porn available. It honestly seems like she was roped into this without knowing how intense they were going to be.

There's no excuse for not doing research on the kind of scene you're going to perform, and I think she most likely did do the research. With the factors of low barrier of entry, being a novice in the field, and really needing the money, she thought that she could handle it. Or she really needed the money and decided doing this porn was worth it.
