Hello,

I know exactly what you mean. It’s like someone comes and takes over your body and speech and talks incessantly or has no control or filter. 

In fact this happened to me last weekend. I was having a nice peaceful day and doing a great job of being as centered as I could. We then met some people for lunch - and I immediately started this behavior. 

It was like I was trying to stop and couldn’t and later on my husband was confused too. Why all of a sudden the gabbing and inability to stop and interrupting and on and on. 

I didn’t get it. 

Reading this today makes me get it. We are triggered subconsciously so so often, and subconscious by definition is out of my awareness. In my story, I was not acting this way and then I was. Sometimes I act like this the whole day. It all depends. I’m sure for you too. 

But I realize in that example one thing- this is a very sensitive time. I must protect my energy and who I interact with. There were 2 people at lunch that I don’t know very well but are friends with someone who was a trigger to me over 10 years ago. 

Perhaps I didn’t realize that their presence did not feel safe. Conversation was easy and fun and centered around the city we were in. But our subconscious knows better. Being there in the presence of those people probably brought me back to a time in which I was much more emotionally labile, unaware, and vulnerable. Thus now I manifest this fear and anxiety as dysregulation of speech and emotion. 
Others may shut down completely. We all have our ways. Given that I am an extrovert my anxiety manifests this way often- outwardly. Inability to stop over speaking. 

Maybe this can help you? See above response as well. I believe this aspect is like all else with healing. Awareness first and then practice.
