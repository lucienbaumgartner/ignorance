Yeah imgur has it own little fan base of mostly unaware and ignorant users. I find it funny when they complain about people stealing stuff from imgur to post on Reddit. They refuse to believe that imgur was created for Reddit as a way to host content. There's a sub for it, but I forget the name of it.
