YTA.

Are you serious? You threw away an entire collection of inherited coins with huge family sentimental value over procrastinated cleaning?

You could have taken it away from your son for better storage of he's that messy, but this way you just proved yourself to be extremely vindicative and unaware of the value of things. Just... Wow.

You should go digging in the dumpsters with your bare hands and bring the collection back with plenty of apologizes. 
What an asshole.
