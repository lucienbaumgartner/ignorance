&gt;Where I live the people are politically divided - half are Republicans and half are Democrats.  But the Baha'is in my community mostly align themselves with the Democratic party.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not like this in all Baha'i communities though. In the town I grew up in which has a similar political distribution as my current city, most of the Baha'is I know there are very much against this vaccine, so at least the Baha'is there do not automatically agree with everything the Democrats say.

This is entirely inappropriate.  Baha'is should not side with any political party, nor should we view issues in left-right or partisan terms.  The vaccine issue is simply one of logic and common sense, not one of political beliefs.  Only people who are ill-informed and ignorant of the facts are against the Covid vaccines and do not take them seriously.
