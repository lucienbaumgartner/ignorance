Today on /r/UrbanSurvival we will be hunting the wary "local contractor". This is prime hunting grounds for these large mammals. Nesting materials are in vast abundance here. They will return  thru out the day seeking more materials to complete their nests.  Early morning produces the best results. They seem unaware and oblivious. 

Design notes: The best traps make use of locally available materials. 

Notice the evenly spaced chunks of wood on top. This will give you the best chance of a clean head shot. 

Trap setting: Location, location, location. Note this long narrow corridor allows no chance of escape. Increasing the odds of catching a small herd unawares.

Stay safe and check your traps often.
