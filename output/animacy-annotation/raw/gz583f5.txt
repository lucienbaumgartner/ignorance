Yea not liking tlou2 is totally legit because we're all entitled to opinions and to like what we want, but the people trying to pass it off as some 3/10 game are essentially outing themselves as completely naive and ignorant of what a "bad game" actually looks like. At absolute worst it is still a 20+ hour third person shooter with great art direction and more advanced gameplay than the first one and good quality VA/graphics. 

It sucks that people can't just have more interesting conversations about the specific elements they liked and didn't like about games rather than just copy pasting some extreme take from a YouTuber with too much free time, because it results in a world where everything is reduced to either amazing or terrible and we can't even properly communicate to developers what is good and what we'd like to see improve.
