Yes, the burning of black Wall Street was heinous, but it was also 100 years ago — the world was an *entirely* different place. And Waco was indeed fucked, but it was absolutely not “literally just driving tanks through masses of protestors and deliberately pulverized hundreds/thousand of people” fucked.

Yes, I agree that the US has major issues. I also wish to hold the US to a higher standard than I would hold any other country, so “better than China” is nowhere near good enough. But to pretend that there is no difference between modern America and the PRC is a *disgusting* display of ignorance and unacknowledged privilege. It is disrespectful to the suffering of the Chinese people in a way that borders on racist.

I am sick to fucking death of this all or nothing, black and white type of thinking — it does literally *nothing* except serve the propaganda wing of the CCP and other totalitarian regimes across the planet. 

Worse, it almost lowers the urgency of preventing it from happening here — if we are *already* a totalitarian state, why do we need to fight Trump so hard? How much worse could it get? The answer is *a whole fucking lot*, but we have gotten so fat, comfortable, and ignorant that we can’t see it. Yeah, Trump has federal troops black bagging protesters. That is bad, *but they were also released*. *That doesn’t fucking happen in totalitarian countries* — people just... disappear. We are clearly moving in the wrong direction, but we also need to recognize that we aren’t past the point of no return either.
