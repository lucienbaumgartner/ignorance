Or you could make the incredibly straightforward deduction that a locked thread about LGBT-anything was locked because of hatred spam...

I sympathize with moderators having to deal with this kind of shit, and a bunch of comments about how they don't know how to do their "job" (unpaid, even in exposure), or that the sub is better with zero moderation (immature and ignorant of reddit's failure points) don't add anything.
