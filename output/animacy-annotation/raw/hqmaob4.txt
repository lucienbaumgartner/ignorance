I don’t think she’s being ‘racist’ as such, but extremely blindly ignorant and arrogant in purporting to be a fan of ‘Asian’ culture (whatever that means) yet also has no idea of the nuances between Japanese and Chinese cultural history.
Appropriation of what she perceives is Asian in a way to escape her world and live out some bizarre fantasy is really strange and the way she’s now attaching herself to johnny on account of his looks and ‘perfect eyes’ (why - because they’re stereotypically Asian?) is just good old racial fetishisation.
