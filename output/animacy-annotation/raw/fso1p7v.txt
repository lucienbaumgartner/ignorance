I agree that systemic racism and systemic inequality exists. Still doesn’t change the fact that you are incredibly ignorant and hypocritical when you talk about things emotionally instead of rationally. Become your master? What are you trying to slide the conversation towards? Your disruptive rhetoric is obvious and noted. Hope others see it as well, because I just want a peaceful world and am being confronted by someone who apparently wants to spread negativity.

Edit: I just want to make it clear that by saying “white people are bullies” is so racist and ignorant that I don’t know what to say. 
Is Bernie Sanders a bully, a white man who has stood up to systemic corruption and racism for his entire life? Again, I understand that systemic issues exist but you are spreading hate. Feel free to disagree, but others see it too I promise you.
