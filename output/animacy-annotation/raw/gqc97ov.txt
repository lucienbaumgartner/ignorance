i am aspie (34f) and recently had sexual engagement with another aspie (42m) and in some ways he was amazing. like the way he licked me, whew. but in other ways he was rough and unaware of me even as i vocalized what was off. some aspies just don't process the same way as you said, but also still, anyone can still be a narcissistic asshole, aspie or not. in fact, autism has lots and lots of overlap with narcissism and some personality disorders like ASPD. for me, my aspie did later admit he was both narcissistic and also ASPD. which explained the duality of certain good parts of sex but then other really off parts. some of the "off" parts included degrading things, just as an example. and we discussed them but his brain literally can't understand my view of it. could be the aspie, could be the narcissism, could be the ASPD... could also just be a hard-headed jerk with no incentive to learn another. hard to say! but being aspie isn't a full pass to cross boundaries. which i am sure you know. a kind aspie should in theory LOVE hearing boundaries, because its helpful for them to have ultra-clear rules. an aspie that can't or won't understand your specific intimate needs, may have some overlap in other areas of emotional callousness (narcissism, ASPD). just some thoughts!
