Someone is going to see this, try it with a dog as overprotective but maybe not as discerning and the moron with the belt will end up in hospital and anyone who tries to intervene. And then when it is investigated, no one will want to admit they were pretending to beat a child for views, so the dog attack will be listed as unprovoked.

I have a badly trained guard dog, (I didn't do the original training, just tried to fix what I could), and he would absolutely hurt someone who did this. And yes he is a good dog. But he just huge and unaware of his own strength and hates human aggression.
