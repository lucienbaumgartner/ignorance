Regardless of who or what posted it . If the product or service being sold is good for people and the “upline” has integrity and morals. Meaning they actually care about people (clients and recruits) Then the MLM May have many benefits. Everyone’s just so freaking fearful, prideful, and ignorant that they blanket all MLMs the same. It’s just not true. There is good and bad at everything and saying all MLMs are bad is just plain STUPID. Get a life
