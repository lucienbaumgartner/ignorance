I mean, people under the age of 18 are sometimes not even held accountable for murder because their brains are biologically not done forming yet. Children’s decision making abilities are necessarily flawed. I agree these posts are highly ignorant and offensive and that SUCKS, but instead of being mad at Camilla I’m more disappointed in our school systems for not teaching kids stuff like critical race theory. We can’t really expect children to know better unless we teach them better.
