Don't worry about it, if you're concerned about it enough to post on Reddit then I'd say you're at least aware and will get back into it quickly... Better than being completely unaware and therefore dangerous.

I've never used a full sized forklift but used to use one of those stand up ones all the time, I'd get really really nervous at first, but you just have to go at a safe pace until you're comfortable again.
