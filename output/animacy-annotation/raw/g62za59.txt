I let alcohol replace, my feelings and emotions, I let it take over me. Blacking out every night and not remembering anything. I always hated being alone, probably something about my father never being apart of my life and neglecting my sister and I, slowly starting to see the damages it caused. I always “liked” to go out, but the people I went out with, they just had one end goal and I see it now. Alcohol made me blind and unaware of the judgement passed on, or the pity, but I see it all now. Last night I went out with my coworker and his girlfriend, she had ordered a margarita, and I just kept hearing, in my head, ‘just get a corona, it’s only one’. It kept going on for about 10 minutes, I started to feel the anxiety of my body slowly starting to cave but somehow I fought the urges for the first time ever and got some juice instead. IWNDWYT
