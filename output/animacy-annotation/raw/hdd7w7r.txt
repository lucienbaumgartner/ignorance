I personally had people questioning if I was just a lesbian and unaware of it. I’ve had people tel me it’s just because of the various times I was sexually assaulted, and that I would “get over it”. 

Asides from people questioning my sexuality, ive also felt excluded from the LGBTQ+ community due to its hyper-sexualisation on occasion, and because majority of the commonality are allosexuals and can’t comprehend not experiencing sexual attraction. 

Most people have been extremely supportive of me being asexual however, and so I do want to reassure you that the asexual discrimination I have faced is very minor in comparison to a lot of stories I’ve heard from homosexuals, transsexuals, etc.
