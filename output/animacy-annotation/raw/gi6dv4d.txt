That’s fuckin’ insane. All I could wonder is, how does one not realize they’re traveling on the wrong side of the highway when they’ve already passed cars, they don’t immediately get over to the fuckin’ grass, take a deep breath, and reevaluate some shit?

This person just keeps driving, absolutely oblivious and unaware of all the blatant telltale signs around them. Can’t help but to think something this absurd is intentional, and they were looking to take someone out with them. That, or this person was that drunk, where they didn’t even realize they were behind the wheel of an automobile, let alone the wrong side of the highway.

It’s literally hard to process. I just hope no one lost their life. Glad you’re okay...
