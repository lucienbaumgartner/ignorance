Wow who would have thought that the political orientation that owns the lion's share of:

Creationists, QAnons, devoutly religious, climate change deniers, COVID hoaxers, supply siders, Obama birthers, abstinence only advocates, gun nuts,

Would be so bad at understanding the value of evidence and reality?!

They really are just every single bad fucking idea in one package. It's kind of incredible. Like fundamentally I'd expect a less one sided breakdown of bad ideas among liberals and conservatives but it just isn't the case. You name a major issue of the day from healthcare to climate change to the pandemic to the economy and conservatives are on the clear wrong side of it. Absolutely astounding.

Imagine being a conservative. Imagine being *that* dumb and unaware of it. I mean my god.
