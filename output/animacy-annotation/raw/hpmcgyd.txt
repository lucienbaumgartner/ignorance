Don't make the mistake of assuming that they have any depth. 

They like meat, they feel judged, they are ignorant and intellectually dishonest =&gt; they lash out. 

It is extremely easy to never question your own believes. Likewise it is very hard to constantly question and reflect deeply on things. They are just dumb and willing to continue being so. Even if they listened to vegans and agreed with their points, they would not stop eating meat, cause the cognitive dissonance is too strong. 

Most people are too dumb to care about the truth. And the ones willing to listen to the truth are too inmoral to do something about it.
