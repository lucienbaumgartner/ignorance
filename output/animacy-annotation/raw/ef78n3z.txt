Does aoc? 

Trump doesn’t? He seems to say our country needs a wall despite the facts? He seems to say that the tax cuts would help the middle class despite the facts, that businesses receiving tax breaks would pass those on despite the facts, on and on.

Are you saying that the difference is that aoc is aware of her ignorance yet marches on while trump is unaware and blissfully ignorant and so it’s ok? If not can you dumb your argument down a little bit?
