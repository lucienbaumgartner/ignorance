I cannot wait to drag you kicking and screaming by the hair into a better world for you and for everyone. Simply because you’re so utterly repugnant and ignorant that to foist you out into the light of day will not only be a mercy and a kindness, it will be a delight to watch; you, writhing, desperate to find a place in this country where your brand of idiotic hatred still has a foothold, hopelessly and impotently watching as the country changes for the better around you. 

Enjoy the coming times, if you can. If you can’t, well—maybe imagine Trump won a third time and is killing all those damned perverts. 

Pee pee poo poo, my friend.
