When I re-read the comment I realize how generic and ignorant that portion seems. I have looked at guides online but they quickly get pedantic and overwhelming when all I want is a decent 2 channel (possible 2.1). These guides often mention integrated amps, DAC, and other details that muddy the water. 

When I asked “what to buy” I guess I meant that as a classification of a unit and not necessarily a brand/model. For instance, “you need to buy a class d amp with at least 20 wpc.”  Knowing what I know now, that’s what it seems.  

For the record, I was not certain how audio OUT of a pc was properly configured so I thought this would help my understanding. Other posts on this thread shed light and now I have a fundamental understanding. 

Thanks for your reply.
