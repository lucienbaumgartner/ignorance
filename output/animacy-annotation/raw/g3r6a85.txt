That’s just sick! Who the hell tells someone that (or does that at work)? Yup and once he mentioned the cheating. That’s when I thought “Oh look, here we go! Poor me. I was cheated on.” Like we’ve all been cheated on or had someone break up with us for a stupid reason, ya moron!* So unaware and narcissistic. 

I wonder why his gf cheated on him. Because he sucks.

Oh and guess what I woke up today to a text that said “Morning, sorry for talking too much about my past ex last night. Have a good day.” I am not responding to that.
