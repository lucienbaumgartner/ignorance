So it’s not that slavery alone gave white people a head start. It’s more so what came after American chattel slavery. Black people really did try to pull themselves up by boot straps and build a society that they could prosper in. But unlike the ending of other slave trades throughout history black people were terrorized and anything they built was destroyed and several laws and ordinances were put in place by local and federal govts to make prosperity virtually impossible. For instance look up Red Lining which is still legal today in 2020 and how banks have statistically supplied sub prime loans to black and minority groups way more often in spite of their good credit history. Also there were many more “black wall streets” across the US than just the one in Tulsa, Oklahoma that people are just now becoming aware of. It’s hard to ignore that any time black people put alot of effort in trying to succeed and not complain like white people say they do it all ended in massacres and total destruction (and in modern times gentrification)

It’s unfortunate that black history is not seen as American history, therefore not taken into account in the us history curriculum leaving so many people unaware and ignorant of what an entire group of people have been trying to make everyone aware of. 

There’s a really cool episode on Netflix explained about the racial wealth gap that breaks it down pretty well. You should check it out!
