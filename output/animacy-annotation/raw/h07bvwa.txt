Hold on a second these people Doo seem a little off but specifically Indian food wasn't the issue. It was spicy food. 

They were afraid that if their kid ate spicy food that it would make their kid sick. The fact that you said "Indian food" Instead of spicy food shows exactly what these people were afraid of.

They were even trying to be careful around the issue because they didn't care about race and they didn't want it to be a racial issue. And yet here you are saying indian food and making it about that. They probably had no problem with it being Indian food knowing that their sons best friend was of Indian heritage, only after the curry was talked about did they have complaints. 

These people seem weird and over protective and ignorant of what spicy foods will do to a kid. But racist I cannot see from this post.

Now feel free to downvote knowing that its I said this isn't about race.
