That is actually quite interesting - but isn’t your way of seeing meaning ignorant and egotistical? If you are so caught in your own idea of meaning, then it becomes more of a ego thing than a existential matter? If it is about the human ego, than nothing can ever be concluded since it is based upon human ideals which can differ from person to person. Isn’t your idea of meaning the same as a religious idea? A human ideology rather than a factual or truthful ideology?
