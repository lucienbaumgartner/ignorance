See. And that's the issue. You are dealing in extremes and I'm here to say not all of us deal in that. 

I dont want closed borders. My fucking parents were immigrants. No one is advocating for that. 

You cant say the only free market is the one you define. That's just equal parts ignorant and arrogant. 

The point I'm making is you can define whatever you want as whatever you want, but you won't get people like me to vote for it. 

And as long as people like you remain ignorant, condescending and arrogant you'll remain "numbering in the hundreds" because at the end of the day:

 *I can vote for whoever and however I want and there isn't shit you or anyone can do about it.*

THAT I's what a libertarian is. You'll never convince me of any other stupid definition. Because I am a libertarian and you can't tell me what to do.
