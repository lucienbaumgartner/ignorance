Idk honestly. Like ffxiv has been the only mmo I’ve actually enjoyed. There are some selfish players out there (which I why msq is scene locked now) but they’re fare and few in between.

That and SE has very little tolerance for toxic behavior. The only notable instances of players being toxic is when two people called me slurs in game. But these people were new and unaware that this behavior wouldn’t be tolerated
