First off, consciences definitely have loopholes. People are capable of all kinds of justifications, and even flimsy ones do the trick. I don’t take stains for eating meat or buying iPhones. (Or do I? Shit have I been losing Humanity this whole time?)

Second, I do kinda love the stains system in V5. Fail the roll, you feel justified (and lose humanity). Pass, and you feel guilty (and keep it). It’s such a fun, counter-intuitive and melodramatic system, and I encourage my players to role play accordingly.

All that said - by normal murder for hire standards, yes, if you give the order to off that pesky reporter, then sure, maybe it’s a stain on you. I would then think the minigame in Vampire is to be oblique enough in your murder wishes so that when bad things happen to good people, your character is legitimately unaware and unaffected… maybe.

Basically, I want a mechanism to reward vampires for acting with subtlety rather than fangs out all the time. Reducing or eliminating stains seems like a way to do that (assuming your Chronicle Tenants are calibrated that way).
