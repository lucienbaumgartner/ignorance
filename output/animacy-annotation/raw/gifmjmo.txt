Yea seriously I’d be looking around thinking is this guy in the back seat of my car, is he surveillance me somehow? That is the creepiest opener ever. He either knows he’s being creepy and doesn’t care or is so entitled and unaware of his privilege that he has no idea how uncomfortable that would make someone. Either way it’s not acceptable.
