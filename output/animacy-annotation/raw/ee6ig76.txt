I do staircases for houses. Had a customer reach out to me, she wanted something special as a staircase in her house. After a long talk, we ended with a complete Oak design, with lots of intricate details, expensive wood finish and rimless glass fences. All in all, I made a price for roughly 20k. 

Day later, she called me and basically called me a scamming retard who is incompetent and I should be fired for being so rude and ignorant. That rant went on for half an hour.

The day after, I received an email from a partner, she droppedy design to him asking for a reasonable price. He wanted to offer almost double my price, and he complimented my ideas.

And ofcourse, that lady offered her apology for her phone call and wanted my offer. I kindly replied "Im sorry, the basic staircase has been produced and I cant offer the original design."
