There is a difference between being stable in life and healthy mentally and emotionally. You got red flags all over this post that indicate that if a good man met you he would walk away. Especially at 30. Healthy people don't have time or energy for that shit.

&gt;  I dated someone seriously for 6 months but he was too needy and he hated me for not being as needy. Being a late bloomer didn't help as I didn't know how to express my feelings except through sex (and to me it was fun and a totally exciting new thing). But he saw that as me just being a nympho and non relationship-material.

There are several red flags there.

1. Not taking personal responsibility for your failure in past relationships.
2. Sexually/emotionally unaware and unhealthy practices that scream issues
3. Blaming things outside of your control for your issues instead of taking agency over ones of personal responsibility to make oneself happy

After that it's red flag after red flag.

I'd see a therapist and learn a sense of personal responsibility.
