I usually never respond to these people but you're just fucking ignorant and immature.

If I didn't care about safety and prioritized cosmetics, I would have kept the grenade on my wheel and never have brought the car in to take care of the recall. The leather, pretty looking airbag cover with the R badge was just one of the small, cosmetic, attention to detail items that made the R an R and differentiate from other trims.

Also I'm sure the majority of car enthusiasts don't buy cars just for safety. People like they way a car looks, the way it drives, the way it sounds, and that it's rare or unique.

I don't get why you think one isn't allowed to complain or at minimum bring up a question why a unique feature of a car has to be taken away for an objectively and subjectively inferior looking and feeling clump of plastic, albeit for a good reason in the end which is a safe airbag. 

If it's acceptable for people to beg for money on Reddit, it should be acceptable to complain about an ugly steering wheel that takes something away from the driving experience
