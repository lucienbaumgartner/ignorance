&gt;Entrapment is the act of tricking someone into committing a crime

Specifically the act of tricking someone into committing a crime that *they normally would not do* unless they were heavily encouraged to do so. Entrapment is very difficult to prove, when it is proven they are landmark famous cases.

Most often entrapment is done by informants, people with a sentence hoping to lighten their sentence by snitching on people they know. They befriend someone and encourage them to do something illegal like procure them drugs. Their target may resist their requests and if they persist over a long period of time until they cave in, it's entrapment. The informant is untrained and unaware that it won't hold up in court. A famous case of this happening is Sherman v. United States.
