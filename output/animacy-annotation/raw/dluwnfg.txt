&gt; Perhaps I could be more sympathetic if Antifa didn't bill itself as such a borderline militant group. 

Yeah, but the thing is it sounds like your talking about the Berkley black bloc and again missing the point that that is a tactic and antifa is a philosophical stance and/or a temp affinity group. 

Also potentially thinking of "liberals get the bullet too" tag that's been pushed around so much and unaware that is most commonly used by tankies and leftpol who do not speak for antifa.

All that other shit gets miss attributed and spun to make antifa look like something other than community defense, but that is all that is, and pushing all these fucking lines only helps the sympathizers and the apologists do their work.
