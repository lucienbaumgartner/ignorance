For all intents and purposes, scheme-wise they had them. Williams whiffing on the tackle and subsequently taking out the only other Saint in the area that "could've" chased Diggs down was just heinous in how situationally unaware and fundamentally unsound it was. Saints coaches should've been screaming to their players prior to the play to make sure to wrap them up, but then again, I guess this is the part where their lack of time-outs due to those two blown challenges certainly came back to bite them in the ass.
