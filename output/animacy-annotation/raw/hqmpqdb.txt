Those aren't mutually exclusive. This is getting tedious because I think you're being willfully ignorant and obtuse.  The government decides who is a protected class.  Private businesses decide who to serve, but can't decide to reject protected people.  "Anti-mandate" assholes aren't protected by the government, so businesses can choose to reject their patronage.  Do I need to explain this further for you, or do you finally understand it?  If you have a problem with this, call your congresspeople and ask them to add antivaxxers to the list of protected people.
