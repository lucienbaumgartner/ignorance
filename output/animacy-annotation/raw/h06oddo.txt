Ok if saying "what I really meant was" *one time* qualifies as clarifying my point over the course of several comments you're the one whose delusional. It's like you want me to believe things I don't actually believe.

I know what "enough, all, most" mean. Comparing the three is an extremely basic rhetorical device you're somehow still too simple to understand. God, you sound like Ben Shapiro.

I didn't say skinny mannequins are hate. People hating fat mannequins is hate.

You *should* give it more thought. That's the thing with you people. You immediately disregard the opinions you view as over-sensitive or SJW or whatever while still admitting not to have thought about it.

I'm glad you weren't bullied as much as other fat people. Good for you. But your experiences aren't universal. I don't know your gender, and I apologize if I'm incorrect in thinking you're a man, but yours is a distinctly male experience. Men can get away with being seen as unattractive and still have success with dating and their careers. There have been actual studies on this shit. Ugly women are treated worse than ugly men. Bullying sucks and stems from larger societal issues, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But as you say, those who inhabit any perceived unattractive body will be bullied or mocked at some point. That isn't marginalization though. It's prejudiced and cruel, but it isn't the experience of being turned down for a job because your employer thinks your body will scare customers away, or not being believed when you say you've been assaulted because it's assumed no one would "want you," or to have your entire career as an activist/artist rejected by society because of your body. It's not just bullying. There doesn't need to be a "no fat people allowed" sign for fat people to be excluded. There doesn't need to be a "no black people allowed" sign for black people to be oppressed. Both of those things are literally illegal in the US. If they weren't, I guarantee you some stores would totally have them. (Again, it isn't appropriate to equate fatphobia with racism, but bigotry is bigotry no matter who it's targeting.) It's worth mentioning that poor people, particularly poor people of color, statistically experience higher rates of obesity than wealthy white people. It throws another form of discrimination at already oppressed individuals. Obesity is in many cases not the result of laziness or gluttony, but instead of the intentional restrictions placed on your community such as food deserts. I've actually taken the time to read about this and listen to those who have. At first I felt the same as you. I thought fatphobia was some bullshit excuse invented by fat people so they could participate in the dreaded Oppression Olympics. But then I slowed down. I took the time to listen, to look into the issue myself, and to come to a conclusion not based in bigotry but instead in fact. 

Obesity causes health problems, but that doesn't mean the obese should be treated cruelly. Fat-shaming doesn't work. 

The "there are bigger problems" argument is the worst argument I've ever heard. Should the issue of racist depictions in the media be ignored because of the racism that operates at a systemic level? Should the issue of sexual harassment be ignored because sexual assault happens? Should the trauma some experience from bullying be ignored because others have trauma from more extreme events? Of course not. It's not one or the other. My focus extends beyond just plastic mannequins in stores, but you assume it doesn't because of some strawman of me you've obviously created. Representation, even something as seemingly insignificant as mannequins, is part of a larger structure attempting to redefine beauty standards, not just to benefit overweight women, but to benefit anyone with what some call marginalized bodies.

But you're not going to believe me no matter what I say. You don't want me to be right. Honestly, neither do I. I wish things were better than I'm telling you they are. So I must be delusional and ignorant of the "definition of words."

Anyway, I'm done with this. Spend more time thinking about it before you dismiss the opinions of those who actually have.

**The Unequal Weight of Discrimination:** https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2012.59.3.411?seq=1
Discrimination against fat people, and how it effects men and women differently.

**Gender differences in the relationship of weight-based stigmatization with motivation to exercise and physical activity in overweight individuals:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5846936/
Beyond supporting my point about gender disparity with fatphobia, this one goes into how fat-shaming when exercising makes it more difficult for people to lose weight. It also cites some other important studies you can look at if you're curious.

**Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Adult Obesity in the United States:** https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/18_0579.htm
This looked at the relationship between financial status and race, but also how childhood obesity from the age of 2 increases the likelihood of remaining obese into adulthood.

**'Fat Shaming' Doesn't Motivate Weight Loss:** https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20140911/fat-shaming-doesnt-motivate-obese-people-to-lose-weight-study
Fat-shaming causes weight gain. If you care about fat people's health, you should also care about fatphobia.
