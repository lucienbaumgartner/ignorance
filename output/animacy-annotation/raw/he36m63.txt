Did you just deny someone their own custom sexual preferences? How dare you! This is 2021 and people can be whatever they want! If someone says Semibisexual is different from Straight, who are you to deny that! How dare you be so bigoted and ignorant of other people's feelings, you Semiphobic jerk.


(Doesn't feel so good now, does it? That's what yall sound like these days)
