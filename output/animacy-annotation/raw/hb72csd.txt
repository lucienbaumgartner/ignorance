Because when an idiot dies, it costs a lot of money for everyone who is left.   


Your NHS has to pay a lot of money for that ventilator that is going to try and fail to keep you from drowning in your own fluids, and for the drugs that will keep you semi-conscious and unaware of your impending death, as well as the protective equipment that keeps you from infecting and killing the healthcare workers that will ultimately fail to keep your dumb ass alive who could be performing other task that you have spent most of your adult life complaining you have to wait sooooo long for. 

It costs a lot more to keep the dumb-fucks alive, but that ends up being most of the job most days.
