Necessary for a developed western nation? No. Mutually assured destruction is a thing of the past, we can intercept weapons with defence systems now. Also even if we didn't have any, nations like the USA with their defence budget still have "defence" forces that should be feared. Even if a major city was nuked, I don't know if commonwealth nations or the USA would respond to nukes with nukes, aside from an executive order. There would be many people advocating not to use them so they didn't start further conflict from their retaliation, or inflict untold collateral damage to innocents.

Necessary for dictatorships like North Korea? Yeah I guess. The threat of them using nuclear weapons on a less developed nation plays a huge part in where they sit on the geopolitical hierarchy. Plus I'm sure countries like Pakistan and India are fully aware of nuclear stockpiles from each nation, so having the power to reply in-kind in a nation like India, where the press has lesser powers and a much larger proportion of people are uneducated and unaware, and the wealthy tend to be conservative due to a caste system, is a much more real possibility.
