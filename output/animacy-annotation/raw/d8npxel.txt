I can't answer top-level, so I'll put this here. By way of OP's links, the email says:

&gt;I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I'm running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion.

The email string is a series of comments on a speech. This particular comment is saying that HRC dislikes the phrase "everyday Americans", but this guy writing the email thinks she should still use the phrase. He offers an example phrase "...you and everyday Americans."

The other email isn't even from or to HRC and is obviously taken out of context. Here's what it says:

&gt; I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

You're definitely right that r\t_d misrepresented the email.
