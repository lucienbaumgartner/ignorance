I loved Serena in season 1. My intial rankings were:

1. Serena

2. Jenny

3. Blair 

After season 1 and maybe towards the end of season 2, I stopped liking Serena. I think they made her blissfully unaware and annoying towards later seasons. 

Agreed about the poorer characters. Vanessa, to me, always got the short end of the stick. Dan seeked validation from the elites. As did Jenny, but I also think Jenny owned being a b**** more so than Dan and Vanessa.
