Quite the judgement put nicely. 

Most men are not as social as women are. We don't call or text each other unless its to hang out. After a certain age, we don't even like hanging out that much because its mostly drinking. Work friends, neighbors and partner is more than enough most times.

No therapy is needed for what you state. Women and men differ in ways but at the end of the day we are equal.

That includes equally flawed. Only the narcissistic and supremely ignorant and think otherwise.
