Was it tested, could it have been an rc? 

Its possible you got lucky. I have once or twice in my years, but doesnt happen often, and when it did, it kicked my ass. 33yo man freaking out in his buddies back yard on 3 tabs. Had a wonderful experience once i calmed down, but was way more intense than any 3 or 4 tab trip ive had prior. 

From what you described it doesnt sound like any 2-300 trip ive had, sounds more intense. Ive become lost and unaware of my surroundings on 200 before, but never full Kaleidescape effects. 

Also blotter art doesnt make much difference. What you described is called white on white or WOW. They are quite common. First acid i took 17 years ago was wow, and it was shit. The wow i have now is about 100ug if i gad to guess. 

Only way anyone can know for sure is a lab test.

Or maybe your lucky as fuck and got some of them killer swiss tabs i saw in the drugsdata page. 

I'll also recommend buying half or full sheets at a time. Test it with Ehrlich before you buy it. It its good grab a whole or half sheet.

Take just one when you test it. Jugde effects based on personal preference, then you can either take more or less next time you trip and have a general idea on what to expect.

That way if you get lucky and get some legit 200+ tabs, you dont blow your mind by taking two right off the bat. 

Either way im jealous of that experience.
