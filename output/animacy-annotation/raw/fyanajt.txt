If you are ideologically blinded and ignorant that you don't see the widely documented and antisemitism under Corbyn, there is nothing we can talk about. 

&gt;Jews being bad in Israel gets you labelled an anti Semite.

If you say Jews that's true. I as a German Jew have no control over what other people who share the same faith as me do on other parts of the world. 

If you say Israeli or Zionist you don't get canceled, xit get applauded and tons of gold on Reddit. Come on man, this comment section alone shows that your self victimisation is bullshit. Visit any popular sub, politics, worldnews, worldpolitcs, look for posts about Israel and look at the comments. You get upvotes for saying the most vile shit about Israel.
Your victim complex is really pathetic. 

&gt;They even call Jews anti SemitesðŸ˜‚

Again, who the fuck is they?? Snap out of your self victimisation mania and show some examples. 

And there are racist blacks, Xenophobic immigrants and homophobic gays so antisemitic Jews is not impossible.
