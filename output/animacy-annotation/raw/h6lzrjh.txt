Look you aren’t really an asshole but maybe a bit naive and unaware that not everyone’s parents can or do save money for their kids’ education. I’m in Canada too and when I went to university I had to get OSAP loans for all four years, my parents didn’t have anything saved for me or either of my siblings. So you aren’t an asshole for having money that your parents put aside but it sounds like you unintentionally made your friend feel bad (and yes, jealous) because she doesn’t have what you have. Perhaps you could apologize for seeming insensitive and let her know you didn’t mean to flaunt it you just didn’t realize not everyone had these kinds of savings plans set up for their kids?
