That’s my “work” head, though without the accent.  At work I know what I’m doing, basically, and the reason for me to be around people and talk to them is there.  And I’m friendly, approachable, helpful, have a laugh….

Socially it’s all a blank…. being around people then means making some sort of more emotional bond and that’s where things fall apart….. as well as not really having any sense of why I’d want to do it in the first place.  

The “work” brain did take a while to establish itself, though… I used to be totally disconnected and unaware of what other people were and what to do with them.
