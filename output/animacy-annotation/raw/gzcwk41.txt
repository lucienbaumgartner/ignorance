You came in here guns a blazing trying to spear anyone down who had anything even slightly negative to say about that woman, instead of being a respectable person and taking the time to educate someone who might’ve needed some perspective. I couldn’t care less who this was about, Mother Teresa or George Bush, it doesn’t matter, you don’t attack people and hurl personal insults like some idiotic fourth grader. 

And who laughed at me genius? You with the dozens of downvotes? Are you that delusional? I rightfully called you a sack of shit because only a sack of shit would do what you did so maybe you can understand the magnitude of your stupidity. 

You want to be so blinded and ignorant of other facts and opinions as if you’re in a cult; that’s on you. But knock off this holier than thou boomer horse shit.
