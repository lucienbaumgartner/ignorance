&gt;Shut up before you sound more stupid than you are. 

I'm not the 1 who doesn't know about moisture content and relative humidity, only 1 sounding stupid here is you buddy.

And you've resorted to just ignorant insults now, that's even more telling.

&gt;Get a couple years experience too.

I have 33+ years of experience growing cannabis. In that time I've harvested about 4x the amount of grows you have.

Your ignorant and arrogant presumptious attitude has been duly noted bud.

Smoke a bowl and go learn about relative humidity and moisture content for drying, curing and storing cannabis.
