I'm sorry but that is hilarious. It is so tragic and ignorant that I had to laugh out loud. ðŸ˜‚ Sorry that happened to you. Keep enjoying the light, the sun friend. ðŸŒž Also, it helps me now to see the comedy in those situations. I will straight up chuckle out loud in their face sometimes if similar things happen. It helps. ðŸŒ¸
