I never thought twice about this until I went to a USGA meeting at ybu where this kid got up and said something along the lines of: "struggling with same sex attraction... I'm not struggling with anything. I'm gay- there's no struggle in how I feel."

I was like aww shiiiit... I didn't even realize how erasing and ignorant that phrase was until that very moment. 

Side note: USGA is awesome. I only went three times in my entire ybu career, but I learned something new and profound each time.
