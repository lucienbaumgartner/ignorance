So the bubonic plague and small pox are symptomless? That's crazy. If a person is sick back in the day, they were bedridden and they burned their sheets afterwards. You have it in your head where people from the 16th to 19th century were stupid and ignorant of sickness. Sure, hygenie probably wasn't a popular thing, but to burn and bury the dead with their contaminated clothing was a thing and to cover their face was a thing too even for the poor and ignorant.
