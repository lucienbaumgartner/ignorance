Look. IW sent this message out as a PR stunt to look good given the situation. I don't disagree with what's being said but it just seems like corporate look good bullshit on their part.

If someone is annoyed by a message like this, it doesn't make them "Unaware and totally selfish". I'd even say it's selfish of you to call everyone ignorant that doesn't like this pushed and very non-genuine message from IW. Maybe they just want their game to focus on being the best game possible and not push bs totally-not-from-the-bottom-of-their-hearts messages that just pander to what's "the safest and best looking thing to say".
