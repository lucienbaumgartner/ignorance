Theres pieces of shit of all races...im not racistb i hate ignorance equally, especially WITHIN my own race.  I dont hate entire races, just sub cultures within those races.  Im sorry but my 7 year old shouldnt have to stare at some dudes ass hanging out his pants while in line at the store while hes on his phone, trying to ring things up and holding his pants up the entire time with 1 hand...and this is within every race.  Ill tell you now, i did prison time for basically having a drug problem, and not only did i deserve it, it cleaned me up and saved my life, but the sagging of ones pants is a trend started in prison to let other male prisoners know youre sexually available and swing that way....and now its a fashion statement by people so stupid and ignorant that they feel its ok to walk around showing their entire ass to the world.

Honestly, it should be a CSC crime to sag your pants.  Why is that cool?  Also, why is it cool for certain people to be as loud as they can no matter where they go?  Ignorance is in every race.  I dont care what color someone is but when their stupidity, ignorance, and disrespect for others affects me or those i care about, im gonna say something regardless of color but 9 out of 10 times, any time you critique a black person, they claim its cus you hate blacks and are racist.

You know whats racist?  Saying a word over and over in front of other races and then telling said races they arent allowed to say it.  You want others to stop using it? Then speak like a fully grown educated person, and stop referring to everyone as the N word.  If you dont want people saying it, stop making it a thing.
