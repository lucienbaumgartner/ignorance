That's like Taking Someone's Wheelchair from Them. She Doesn't know WHEN an Alert will Come, Hence the SD Needing to Be With Her at All Times, Everywhere. 
You and Many Other's Responding,  sound Uninformed and Ignorant of what A SD Does and Legal Access Afforded Them. IF OP is In America, I would suggest looking up the ADA.
I Have a PsySDIT &amp; In My State, SDIT are Seen as SD and Afforded the Same Access to Anywhere I Go. Doctor's Offices, Stores, Restaurants, etc.
Technically,  because He's Under My Control, Housebroken,  and Performs  Tasks for Me,  He's a SD, but because He's less than a year old, I say He's a SDIT. 
There is No Legal Registration or Registry for Service Animals IN THE USA.

SD/SDIT Do Not have to have ANY Identifying Equipment to Be in Service.

There are Only 2 Legal Questions a Business is Allowed to Ask when Dealing with a SD Team;  'Is this Animal In Service?', 'IF YES, What Task Do They Perform for You?' 
I saw OP Response of the Accommodations, like put the chickens away, an Alternate Bathroom for The Team, not Expecting Help with Cooking...
Those Were Helpful IMO.
