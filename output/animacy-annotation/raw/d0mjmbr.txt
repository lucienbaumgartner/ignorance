Thank you so much for the love and support. I need that as much as anything.

I did give him a deposit through his management company, who are being contacted. Since he is totally going against his contract we should be fine with getting our money back even if we have to take it to some kind of court. I hope it doesn't come to that. I know he didn't do this to be mean. I think he just is young and unaware that this can't be done in a month.
