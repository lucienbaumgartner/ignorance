What should you do? Seriously evaluate whether you want to be in a relationship with a man child. And if you do, how long are you willing to put in the time to try and welcome him into adulthood. It may come off as harsh, and I know he hasn't done anything massively *wrong*, ie cheating, gambling etc. But those things are instant relationship breakers. Dealing with someone immature, selfish, and unaware of standing on his own two feet..that's a slow burner. Death by a thousand cuts.
