It’s not as tied to American culture as other genres like rock and even R&amp;B.  There’s people alive right now who existed in a time before rap music even existed.  

I used to be a person that wrote off all of rap music as “not for me” growing up in a white suburban household where I was never exposed to it.  As soon as I discovered Kanye by accident I became obsessed in a matter of months.  

The lesson I learned is that writing off an entire genre of music as “garbage” is ignorant and close-minded.  People will trot out the worst examples of uncreative hiphop as if that’s all there is to it.  

Hiphop has been a voice for the black community since it’s inception and you simply cannot tell me that just because they’re not singing that it’s not rife with extremely talented individuals making amazing art.  

To all the writing off rap because you were never exposed to it, try listening to Kanye’s and Kendrick’s discography with an open mind and THEN you can have a real opinion.
