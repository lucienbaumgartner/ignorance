You should think about things like this. Hopefully this thread helps you see clearly that your husband is being sexually harassed.

And you may choose to be blind to genders, but the world is inherently sexist. And when the friend decides to throw a false case of harassment in your husband's name, it'll not be easy to clear it up. 

Your SIL has to be incredibly immature and juvenile to be subjecting her own her own brother to this. She's probably in on it with the friend. There's no way anyone would not notice this kind of behaviour. 

If she were actually unaware and unobservant, she'd be surprised or shocked, but when she calls you the a-hole here, it seemd like she's being defensive when caught trying to replace you with said friend.
