It was pretty great when I was still using it. I only wish I could say the same about their moderation policies, though. 

Apparently they have a (vaguely worded) rule against watching videos from their site via anime apps. Me, being totally clueless and unaware of that, tried to use them as a source in the Taiyaki app. I got banned because of this, though at time I was given neither a reason nor the duration. It was only after writing to the mods asking for more information that I finally found out why. I also explained to them at the time that what I did was a complete accident, that I was very sorry for it, and that would never do it again. For context, I should add that I've never gotten in trouble with them or the site before; this was my first and only infraction. Despite my pleas, though, I was told my ban was "permanent and irrevocable". Not temporary. *Permanent*. The worst part of it all was that I never even got past the Aniwatch log in screen in the few minutes I was fiddling around with the app, let alone watch anything. In other words, I wasn't even banned for breaking the rule, but just for having the intention to. An intent which I already clearly explained to them I didn't have.

I'm not trying to discourage people from using Aniwatch, but I do think it's important to take into consideration every now &amp; then how sites like these treat their members. For the record, I would have been totally fine with a one or even two month ban. But apparently what I did was so "bad" I couldn't even be trusted with that.
