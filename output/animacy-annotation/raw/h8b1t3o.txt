Do you think it’s worth the risk to not take aggressive action, Even if they are predictions are off or slightly off?

While I generally support skepticism, when it comes to climate change we are playing with fire, literally. There may be impacts we are aware and unaware of that can create a chain reaction that kills us all (such as killing something vital to the organisms that create our oxygen, or something along their food chain). The risk is just not worth it. Even if we have more time, green energy is an inevitability, why wouldn’t we mitigate the risk now?
