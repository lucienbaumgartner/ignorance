&gt;Sure punishe Trump to the full extent of the law. He won't be punished of course because there's no proof of him breaking it at least not on a treasonous level



Nothing that’s been released yet. 

There are 31 indictments and 6 guilty pleas. 

Not including the newest one

&gt;A large media outlet really making it seem like he's guilty doesn't make him guilty.


Be real with me here. Are you aware of the 31 indictments and 6 guilty pleas? Are you aware that he can’t legally borrow money in the US and can only borrow money from Russian banks directly linked to Putin? Are you aware that Every step of the way he has been involved with Russian Connections. Are you aware that Russia is the ONLY country Trump has not played “hardball” with. The only one he has not criticized for their trade deficits with the US. He’s picked a fight with every nation but Russia. Are you aware that the first time Trump switched to a Zero Sum game strategy for foreign policy was when he met with a Russian Ambassador in 87. In fact after that meeting he made a huge political campaign to dismantle the UN and other alliances opposed to Russia. 

Given all of this information, do you truly believe in your heart that Trump was unaware and ignorant to all of this happening during his campaign and is in no way compromised?
