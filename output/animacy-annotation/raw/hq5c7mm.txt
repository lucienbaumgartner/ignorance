Everywhere is flawed. Countries love to deny their own issues in favor of shitting on America but most places aren't all that different. I live in Canada and the people here are almost completely indistinguishable from Americans. I've had plenty of coworkers spouting hateful ignorant and racist bullshit. I live in an area with a lot of South Asian people and if I had a nickel for every racist comment a white person made about them I could quit my job.

Everywhere is similar. The difference is everyone else is in denial about their own flaws. At least lots of Americans are aware of their issues. Canadians will defend Canada to the death without ever considering the possibility that they have similar problems.
