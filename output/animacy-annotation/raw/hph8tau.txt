NTA.

I’m kind of conflicted, though. How old is she? If you trust her to communicate to you if anything makes her feel uncomfortable, it might be okay to test it out? Has she gone to their house before? If so, when she talked to you about the experience (I’m assuming she’d have done this), did she mention anything that gave you pause? Or mention how much interaction she had with the parents? Maybe the dad sucks but the mom is okay? This may sound silly, but have you 

Sorry about all of the questions, but they’re ones I’d ask myself if I were in this situation. &gt;.&lt;

He seems to be ignorant and afraid of and/or feels threatened by people who he thinks live differently from him. I grew up in the south eastern US, and this was/is a big thing there. My concerns would be: that she might hear something shitty in casual conversation or that they end up trying to push Jesus on her. Just based on my own experiences growing up (note: I’m not a POC, but did date outside my race and had a pretty diverse group of friends throughout K-12), I highly doubt anything bad would happen to her by you letting her spend time there on a trial basis. If either of the above happen, they could be an opportunity for meaningful teachable moments between you, your hubs, and your daughter. 

Then again, maybe some public outings that include her friend’s parents would be a good way to ease into house hangs? Then you could kind of get a feel for them. At this point, I think it’d be a bad call to write it/them off all together, you know? Racism is garbage, and it’s certainly not your job to prove something to him or change his mind, but it’d be a bummer if the girls’ friendship had to suffer because of their parents.
