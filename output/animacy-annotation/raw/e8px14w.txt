You're hilarious.  You suggest that the people of China are so simple and ignorant that they would believe (because it is Traditional Chinese Medicine) that the rhino should be hunted to extinction because powdered rhino horn can treat:

&gt; fever, rheumatism, gout, ...snakebites, hallucinations, typhoid, headaches, carbuncles, vomiting, food poisoning, and â€œdevil possession".

I think you are downselling the "sex part".  I have no idea why.
