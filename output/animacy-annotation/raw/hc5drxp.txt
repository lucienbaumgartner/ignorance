Like, yeah. It sounds like your experience at the restaurant sucked. But, as *I'm sure you're well aware*, you were probably the 12th person that night to approach the podium claiming to have "called ahead." The manager was probably exhausted and frustrated and assumed you were like the other 11 parties and just making up bullshit to try and get a table faster.

For all you know, they *don't* take call-ins and the person you spoke to on the phone was just new and unaware of that fact. Are you comfortable with the very real possibility that you sabotaged this person's career advancement over a simple mistake that wasn't even their fault?

You sound like the sort of person who could benefit from spending less time talking about how much they respect other people and more time actually fucking doing it. What a horrible post.
