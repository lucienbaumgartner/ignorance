I think you just put into words exactly what bothers me so much about their channel and Girl Defined. Their channels pretty much revolve around admonishing others and pushing a very holier-than-thou agenda that is exceptionally closed minded and ignorant of true biblical scholarship and critical thinking. It’s like they grew up listening to their old misogynistic preacher but not comprehending any of the heart behind what Jesus says. While I love God is Grey, even she went down the path of making videos about YouTube drama with other creators for a while. I’m really glad she doesn’t do that anymore. I go to Christian YouTube to learn how to deepen my faith and improve my spirituality. I prefer to get my drama content from the beauty community lol.
