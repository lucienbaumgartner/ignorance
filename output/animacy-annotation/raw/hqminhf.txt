&gt;If you're put into a situation where you have to sign a contract or your family starves you really think the courts are the proper place to decide if that's valid?

If you take the stance that poor people can renege on contracts because they were poor and had to take some job just to survive, then fewer people are going to invest in starting and expanding companies that hire people. It's as simple as that.

The 1870-1900 era, with its strong contract rights, saw real wages double for workers. That is the best to improve working conditions for workers. Not by being emotional and giving in whenever a relatively poorer person makes a demand against a relatively wealthier person.

Good intentions and idealistic notions do not feed people. Economic growth does, and we know what sort of legal system maximizes economic growth.

Moreover, the workers of that era had labor mobility and choice. They were not signing contracts that gave them poor conditions, by the standards of that era, due to lack of resources making them feeble-minded and ignorant of better jobs, or immobile and unable to migrate where better jobs existed.
