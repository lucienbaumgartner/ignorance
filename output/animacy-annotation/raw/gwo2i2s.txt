Again, the conversations was about the current state of current government actors currently murdering black Americans, not a historical discussion about wrongs done around the world.

You are playing misery Olympics with past atrocities to say that the current situation Black Americans are facing is nothing compared to past issues faced by others. 

American racists repeatedly use the concept of Irish "slavery" to diminish Black African chattel slavery, in order to say that Black Americans are not actually experiencing oppression, racism, state-sancrioned murder and unjust imprisonment. 

You're whole "but achtually" shtick is offensive and ignorant of issues currently happening in the United States.
