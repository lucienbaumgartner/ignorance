That kind of glib take on Orwell seems to totally miss the point of the book. 

In the book, most people were not under surveillance -- they were just kept so poor and ignorant that their ideas did not matter.  

They can't protest anything because they would lose their jobs and become homeless and starve.   Only the "outer party" or the media employees had the strict surveillance and control.   

The comic doesn't even mention doublespeak, which is one of the main points of the book -- how language itself is turned into a weapon.
