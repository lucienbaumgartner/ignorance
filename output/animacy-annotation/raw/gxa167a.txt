NTA!   
HI, I'm an Autistic adult. what S did cannot be Excused as \*He's autistic and unaware of what he's doing\* That's not how Autism works. 

Awkward? Yes, Maybe a little blunt and missing social queues? Most certainly. 

Refusing to leave when asked? NO. Going through the mail that obviously doesn't have his name on it? NO. Trying to lie to cops about the house being Empty? Really? You were right there. that's certainly proof it's not empty. 

Being Autistic doesn't give Anyone a free pass to act like S did. You didn't know if he was really G's brother or not, it was 7am, and you'd just gotten home. I would have called the cops too, and I don't even like the cops
