You're projecting really hard. If a private bus company operated with a male-only clientele, it'll be labeled sexist/misogynist. Turn the genders around and all of a sudden, people turn a blind eye to the sexism because it's *only* against men. It's pathetic and ignorant that you don't see how backwards and against equality your opinion has been.
