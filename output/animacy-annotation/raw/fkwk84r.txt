I am not trying to downplay the importance of testing and recognize that I may be missing a very important piece of the picture here -- but I am a bit confused at the moment. 

It seems that the amount of testing we are conducting has essentially been framed as directly equivalent to our handling of this and our potential success in confronting the virus's spread. 

My confusion is in squaring that with the measures that have been taken and the instruction being given to the public - particularly bearing in mind that where we are now, is so well beyond the phase of trying to isolate the virus and prevent it from spreading state to state, etc...

It would seem, and again -- I could be totally missing something huge here -- that the crucial part of testing is to not only have a clear picture of where we're at but also so that anyone, particularly those who are asymptomatic and unaware that they are potentially virulent and contagious, can be ID'd and appropriately isolated and "social distanced". 

But -- it seems that we are already essentially applying that level of instruction to EVERYONE. If everyone is being told (or at this point - mandated) to isolate and essentially behave as if they were already infected -- how is it that testing remains such a crucial part of the process? 

And would having isolation and quarantine be more based on testing not run the risk of actually having MORE people remain active until or unless they got a positive test - as opposed to simply going all in and having EVERYONE behave as-if, test or not, as we're doing now?

Just trying to connect the dots. But it would seem that even if we had tests for everyone immediately - the action to be taken would be the same as what's being done now, would it not?
