Off the top of my head: accounting,networking,social media management,photography and lighting skills. Once again, someone bitching about how sex work is the grunt work of society and yet you benefit from it while scorning it if you consume any kind of porn. You sound like a boomer that talks down about people working fast food or the cashier or collecting garbage. Sounding very ignorant and small-minded bud.
