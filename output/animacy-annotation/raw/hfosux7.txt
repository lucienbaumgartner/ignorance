Being blind and ignorant of who your opponents are and what they believe is very common among Otherizers and totalitarians.    

I don’t blame you, it’s just your material conditions made manifest. No one chooses to be born handicapped or born as a Marxist. There was nothing you could do. You couldn’t help but believe Marx and Lenin, because your material conditions led you to believe whatever they said.
