The only thing I agree with is the economic concern. I think the "for the kids" and "they're going to die soon anyways" arguments are naive and ignorant of reality - stawmans that people hide behind. Kids will be fine, and hospitalizations for younger age groups have been steadily increasing, hence why our hospitals are filling up (because they take longer to treat).

&gt;There seems to be no middle ground only irrational decisions.

What are you talking about? I'd argue that the government's done nothing but try to find the middle ground. As much as I hate Legault, he has to act based on the numbers. I'm sorry, but every person who committed civil disobedience and went out to see family this holiday is part of the problem. I'm sick of people being irresponsible and then pinning it on others. To me, THAT's irrational. I keep things simple: I listen to healthcare workers. If they say they're drowning in hospitalizations, then something must be done.
