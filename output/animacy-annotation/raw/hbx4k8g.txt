&gt;There's not a chance in hell of Irish reunification by the way.

In the past number of years, polls have consistently been fairly evenly split on the issue.

Northern Ireland's unionist politicians have faced crisis after crisis since the Brexit referendum. They need to adapt and evolve in order to continue their defence of the union. So far this process has been slow, but we'll see how Doug Beattie and the UUP fare in the next while, and the next election. 

And finally, Sinn FÃ©in are on track to become the biggest party in both the North and the south in the next few year. 

A united Ireland has fast become a very realistic possibility since Brexit. Claiming otherwise is absolutely clueless and ignorant of Northern Ireland politics lol
