&gt; "Korea/Asia is uneducated" 

I think it's disrespectful to bring up a whole country being uneducated just because a kpop idol acts stupid. A rant on here from a Korean cleared up the myth people like to spread about that. You don't have to bring the whole country into it to defend your idol.  It only backfires. Instead of other people seeing that one idol as unlikable and ignorant, that opinion may  spread to an entire country. But kpop fans are excellent at digging an even deeper hole with their arm flailing, so that's expected.
