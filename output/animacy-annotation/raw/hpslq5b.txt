I absolutely am interested in learning to cook more traditional Chinese food so I really appreciate the resource I'll check it out. 

I ate so many things as a ignorant and illiterate backpacker during the month I was in China. I litterally would look at the menu and sometimes if there was photos I'd just point to something that looked good or other times I'd just point to a random thing not knowing what I was getting (which was the case for this dish I posted) or other times I'd see what someone else was eating and either ask them to point to it on a menu or signal the waiter with a bit of a "I'll have what she's having" kind of gesture.

And NOT ONCE was I disappointed by what landed on my table.

I don't know when I'll get to get back to that kind adventure traveling so that's why I'm interested in living those experiences again via the food I ate. 

Likewise I see you're from Germany and I had similar experiences during my time there and loved everything I ate. I think 2022 will be my year of touring the globe via my stomach hahaha
