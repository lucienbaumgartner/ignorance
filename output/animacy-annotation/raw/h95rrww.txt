it is inherently bad when it stems from ancient civilizations that were far more barbaric and ignorant of reality. Religion, including spirituality, really needs to go, it is a pipe dream and fueled by ignorance of the understanding of the world around us. It gives us false hope that keeps us from striving for a much better world, as relalising that there is absolutely no rhyme or reason we are here and that we are a bunch of moronic apes can be a great motivator for good action.
