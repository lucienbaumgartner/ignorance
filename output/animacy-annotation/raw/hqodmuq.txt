It;s not substance addition smh. Right now the priority is medications as I can't leave them abruptly, because that will cause severe withdrawal symptoms. Therapy comes wayyyyyyyyyy after this issue is solved. And if you can get me an appointment for a therapy session that doesn't have a waiting time for several months, sure I'm up for it. But right now, the priority is something else.. You are very very ignorant and deluded.
