No I am from Seattle I am saying Vashon isn't rural and living in the city doesn't mean you are isolated and unaware and need a freeway to get to the beach puget sound isn't just accessible from Vashon. I didn't even know about Shauna until blogsnark definitely don't know her.

But I did used to live on a Washington Island that was so rural we didn't have a grocery store so I am like super special.
