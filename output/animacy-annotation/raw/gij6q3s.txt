I just think this is a bad take in my opinion because non-poc are going to read posts like this and stop taking the movement seriously. As a non-poc myself I have never suffered the injustice that goes against poc’s literal existence. I have never felt sick from anger that another person in my community was killed for no reason. I have never felt sick from fear that I could die from going outside, going to the grocery store, etc. I have however felt extreme distress, anger, and have days when I cry at the state of this country. I wouldn’t take those days away, and I think it would be selfish and ignorant of myself to wish to not feel that way. Especially when some people live their life and have their life shaped by this anger. This is fucking serious. Watching alt-right white people be able to break into the capitol with a small amount of resistance should make you feel angry. It is good to feel that anger because what happened is seriously fucked up and proves the racial injustice in our country. These people get labeled as protestors when they are terrorists attempting to seriously harm and bomb our senators. These alt right white people did not see tear gas immediately as peaceful protestors did at BLM movements. They did not see rubber bullets or get violent police officers coming at them immediately even when they stormed the building. There is no grey area, no way to see the good or a complexity in these racist peoples actions. It is time to be an ally and stand up for what is right. No more excuses. If you think that telling people not being angry about this stuff because it is an inconvenience to your life, or that finding a grey area is right, then im honestly scared of people like you.
