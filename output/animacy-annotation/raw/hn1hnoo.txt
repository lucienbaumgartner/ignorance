Their body, their choice when it's regarding a vaccine.  With abortions... it's "Her body, our choice."

People... why TF are we tolerating this anymore?  Aren't you fucking sick and tired of these fucks trying to drag us backwards while the rest of the developed world moves on and on?  Why are these intolerant, hateful assholes holding the rest of the country hostage while they shove their big fat government hands down our throats and up our assholes to try and control us.  But when we try and offer something different they scream that their freedoms are being destroyed.  Do they not understand how incredibly transparent and ignorant that is?  The political party who's main talking point is "less government in people's lives" is literally trying to pass a law that will allow "more government into people's lives."  They can't have it both ways.

I am so very sick and tired of being sick and tired of this government here in america. It's broken.  It's dividing us.  It's running as fast as it can to be first in line at "fascist land leisure camp."  We gotta do something about it.  Life ain't going to be the same soon if we don't change something.
