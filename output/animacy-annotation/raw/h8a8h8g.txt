I used to spend a lot of my time thinking about how customers "got to me". I would replay our conversation over in my head and imagine using different ways to tell them the bad news that made them flip. Turns out after spending all that energy on that customer in my head, that's all for nothing - Because that person wouldn't be happy no matter what I said. Some people just want to be angry. Some people lack the coping mechanisms to be able to talk to someone in Customer Service without getting to the level they got to with me. Most of these people are older and unaware of their lurking mental illness and take it out on others thinking its normal. It's not, and I'm sorry you have to deal with abusive customers. I just hope that you can find it in yourself to let these people go out of mind once they're off your phone.
