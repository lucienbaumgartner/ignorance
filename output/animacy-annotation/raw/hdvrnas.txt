You are so wrong, it’s actually sad. You are a functioning alcoholic, and it is extremely naive and ignorant of you to label people with alcohol problems as “the ones throwing up and blacking out after a Saturday at the frats.” I actually feel sorry for you, because you don’t realize the impact this will have on your life. Maybe not now, but someday it will, and hopefully it won’t be too late for you to seek help.
