Normal people unaware of these things don't share this opinion. In fact, when I was normal and unaware of gangstalking I didn't *have* an opinion about it, def wouldn't make statements this polarizing and sure of myself. Nor would I even think to spend time in such a sub only to spout off comments that sound identical to the supposed perpetrators of the thing in question...you see where I'm going? You stand out like a sore thumb. Be more obvious! These same tired old shill lines can't seem believable in your head, can they? I guess you count on someone buying it and that's all that matters right? 

Boo this guy. Just,
booooo
