I think the best you can do in these situations (ie highly triggered Avoidant pushing you away with cruelty) is give space for 2-3 weeks, then just be real with them. Tell him straight you think he's triggered because X, that you understand, and that you believe some space and lessening of relationship intensity for a little while could help. Tell him you don't want to date other people, you want to be with him.

If he is still adamant about the grass being greener, at that point let him go permanently. You won't get a healthy relationship out of a man that unaware and emotionally immature. But you will have done everything reasonable within your power to accommodate his triggers (which are kind of understandable, given the scariness of possibly losing a parent).
