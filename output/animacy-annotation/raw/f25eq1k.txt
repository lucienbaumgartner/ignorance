People in this thread are ignoring the **real** point of contention, which is the guy was honest, and unaware that he would need a [B-1 Visa](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/getting-us-visa-b-1-do-volunteer-work.html) for volunteer work, and border patrol held him for over 4 hours then banned him from the country for 5 years.

They could have turned him away at the border without a 5 year ban.
