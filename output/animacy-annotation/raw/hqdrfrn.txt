I didn't call you any names, like doodoo head. Only described you, accurately, with adjectives. I wrote a lot there... Don't know why you don't respond to what I'm saying instead of saying i don't have any real arguments.

Not that it matters, but I'm not a green day fan, and have never had a Sony play station of any kind.

The insinuation that even if i did, that it would somehow impugne my character is, once again, very ignorant and small minded of you.
