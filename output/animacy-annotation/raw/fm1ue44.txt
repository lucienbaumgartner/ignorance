Intelligence comes in many forms you know.

You can be book smart but street dumb. Financially smart but thinking out of the box dumb.   
You can be dumb as a rock but still very successful. 

Those people are extremely unaware about anything that doesn't occur within their close bubble. Best to avoid them since their kind of stupidity is contagious. They are not IQ stupid but unaware and ignorant of everything that doesn't directly affect them at this moment in time. It's like somebody sitting on the railroad track and seeing the incoming train but not caring because their brain computes that at that moment in time, everything is safe. So they don't care. By the time their brain computes the danger, it's already too late.  
Being purposely unaware and ignorant is far worse than being IQ stupid.
