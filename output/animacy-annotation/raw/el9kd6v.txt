This is such a stupid argument. Americans should at the very least be protesting EVERYWHERE if not rioting.


There is clear evidence of Russia meddling in your elections and your solution is wait until the next election? Guess what? They're going to meddle even more and the illegitimate president is going to get re-elected.


France has protests over much less corruption and even third world Lebanon had most of the government shutdown due to government employees walking off the job when they were threatened with pay cuts by corrupt politicians. Sure Americans have less rights than the French but far more than Lebanese. Yet Americans are so apathetic and ignorant that nothing matters.
