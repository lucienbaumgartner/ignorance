To be fair its arguably a one-sided crush at the moment, with Midoriya being unaware and Uraraka still in denial over it (more Aoyama trolling necessary).

Iida and Uraraka are definitely his best friends at this point. Bakugou's his childhood friend, but they've gotten a lot more hostile and distant over time.
