You really don't have to be the one to do it - nobody does

The handwringing and purity testing over roguelikes is absurd and ignorant of language conventions, prescriptivist and nature, and even at the best of times it serves only as a novel interpretation.

Most often it's just captious. 

And yes, I've played enough Nethack to know the difference - Rodney's a pushover, Cthulu less so. 

I can still acknowledge that lethality, permadeath, proc gen, and intended repetition &amp; replaying are defining characteristics of all these games and the roguelike genre. These elements make the genre, from a descriptive perspective, more than turn or tile based.
