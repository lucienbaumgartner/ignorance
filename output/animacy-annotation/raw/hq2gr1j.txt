Dang, the projection is strong with this one. 

I feel duped by the willfully unvaccinated for dashing my idea of a general faith in humanity. But I am fully secure in my decision that I made to protect myself, and everyone I come into contact with, by getting vaccinated. Nothing will change the fact that I am part of the solution, while theyâ€™re part of the problem. Whether they are simply ignorant and misguided, or vindictive in their actions, the outcome is the same of fucking us all.
