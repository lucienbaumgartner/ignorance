Yay!! Thank you for sharing this! I was diagnosed late and I can tell you it helped me tremendously to get the diagnoses (even though I had to seek a second opinion because the first psychologist was dismissive and ignorant of current research on ADHD in adults and women). I understand myself much  better now and I hope you experience the same. Good luck!
