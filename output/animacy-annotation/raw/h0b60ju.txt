I love the visibly racialised misogyny here where the white girl who's so over the top stupid and ignorant that she doesn't know who bob marley is and hasn't heard of the hegemony's favourite buzzword for like the past ten years and because she doesn't get why she's being denied a service after a ten second non-explanation that the token black character exists solely to give her she's... I don't even know who I'm supposed to sympathise with here, but to be perfectly blunt, it's the white girl who I like better here.
