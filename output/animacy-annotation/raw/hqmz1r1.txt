The upside down cross always takes me out of any enjoyment/ belief I may have been building around the narrative.
It’s a symbol of Catholic reverence; Saint Peter felt unworthy to be crucified in the same way as Christ and was thus crucified upside down. 
In a way I guess that if a malevolent being is trying to freak out someone that is ignorant and religious that would be a good way to do it, but I’ve never seen that called out in any paranormal stuff.
