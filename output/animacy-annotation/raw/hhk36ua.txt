I am. And that probably was selfish and ignorant of me but when I got out I still felt the anxiety and I was having trouble sleeping. I can honestly say I didn't sleep at all that month. My body would exhaust for 15 to 20 minutes at a time but I never once hit rem I don't even know how that's possible. 

So I got Xanax off the street and then my counselor called me and begged me to go back because she said fentanyl was out in the street so bad and literally in everything even pressed Xanax so my family told me to go back. My dad hired an attorney and got me out but he spent a lot of money so basically to be respectful I wanted to listen to what they're asking to me and one of the things they were asking was that I don't get back on methadone. But once I got the Xanax off the street and told them what the counselor told me I guess they were convinced. 

I'm on 20 mg's right now and I don't know if I'll go any much higher
