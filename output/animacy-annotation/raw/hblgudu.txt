Sure, i agree that we can't force people to medicate. Removing choice is a slippery slope and not one we want to go down, however I am seeing a likeness of these antivaxers to 3 year olds. Why do we as adults have child proof locks on the cleaning and medicine cabinets? Because children are too dumb and unaware that that it can harm them. What is happening now is people are having to pull livestock dewormer from the shelves because adults are too willfully ignorant to realize they shouldn't be taking it. Like children.

I think we should let them take it. If they're poisoned, they have to pay their healthcare bills if they choose to endanger themselves. If they're willfully unvaccinated, and need hospitalization, foot their own bill. We have to stop coddling people who are contrarian for the sake of being contrarian.
