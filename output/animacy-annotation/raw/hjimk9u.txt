Most people  into sissification aren't into race play and most people into race play aren't uncritical and unaware of themselves. 

I really wish y'all would stop generalizing so stupidly much. 

I don't disagree that there are people who need to address their biases and, but saying people into this a particular kink have problems they need to address is straight up kink shaming.
