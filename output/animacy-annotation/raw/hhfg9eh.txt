I thought the joke of Saitama was that he’s incredibly oblivious and unaware of a lot of the shit that goes on around him. Which would tie into why he thinks she looks like a child. Essentially, he’s too small brain to comprehend that a small person is an adult. I feel like if she genuinely looked like a little girl more people would comment on it
