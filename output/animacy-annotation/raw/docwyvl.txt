After reading through some of the responses I really want to commend you for this apology. 

Shocking that there are posters that are so ignorant and unaware that they think people can't be offended by anything. We don't all share the same brain. We don't all share the same past experiences. People need to stop being offended that someone else might find something offensive.

And mocking someone because they are young? I guess the person who did that was born 30? Never experienced youth?
