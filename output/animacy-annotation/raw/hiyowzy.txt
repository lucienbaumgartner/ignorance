Stealing the food in this particular case since as I just mentioned and as I will further clarify if you have food allergies and are cognizant of these allergies why would you purposely sample or outright eat something unaware of what’s in it thereby placing your health and life in danger.

Like on one hand what the OP did was dangerous but at the same time their co worker was suitably at fault for what happened since she knowingly ingested something (that was not hers) unaware and unconcerned of whether it contained something she was allergic to.

But why respect someone’s property even after they’ve had to call you out on this when you can take it for your own without permission?

If OP did this with clear intent to be cruel and malicious than yeah it would be worse. But again Co-worker should’ve used her common sense.
