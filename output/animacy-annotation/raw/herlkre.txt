You keep forgetting about the security aspect of the whole "secure biometric unlock". It's pretty important. 

&gt; Your definition of bloat is priceless and literal wrong.

What's yours? 

&gt; Adding a fingerprint scanner is just ReDuNdAnCy. Why add the fingerprint scanner when you have a perfectly secure pin? That's just BlOaT. 

It's not redundant because it's a great middle ground between security and convenience. There isn't enough use cases apart from some edge cases where having both face unlock and FP sensor are justified. 

&gt; Just listen to how silly and ignorant that sounds.

Sounds okay to me lol. Try to avoid redundancy. Anyways, you seem to be getting super worked up about this my guy. This ain't healthy. If you want to have a productive conversation I'll continue otherwise I recommend getting off the site for a little and taking a breather.
