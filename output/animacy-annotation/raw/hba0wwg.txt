You're only wrong if he wasn't trying to suggest you're denying him a baby and he gets no benefit from you preventing a pregnancy. It's really hard to tell what the context of his statement was. 

Truly, you are the only one taking it out of you two and you are taking it for your reasons, whether it because you don't want a pregnancy or many other reasons. But if he was complaining about it, then yes that would be sexist and ignorant of him.
