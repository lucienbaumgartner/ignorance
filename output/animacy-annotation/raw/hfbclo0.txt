I read about this encounter in the news, and I 100% believe that the hiker *thought* he saw BL. It obviously could have been someone else - just a random guy on drugs or maybe someone playing a prank or someone trying to throw off authorities (for whatever reason). I don't doubt that the encounter happened though.

Reasons why it *could* be BL?

\-He might be out of it due to a mental health crisis, lack of sleep, lack of food/water, etc.

\-BL may not be aware of how large the search for him is, or that there is a huge manhunt out there at this point

\-BL has gone out of his way in the past after he committed the crime to reach out to people and create a storyline for himself. He did that while hitchhiking. He made sure to tell people about his fiance and how she was waiting for him in the van, making sure that he had an alibi and people believed that he thought she was alive when he left. 

This time, he *could* be trying to convince people that he never knew she died, and that she told him she was going to CA and he needs to meet her there. He could be desperate, and knowing that he will get caught soon is starting to tell people things to support some sort of storyline. Or he could be trying to portray an image of himself being mentally ill and unaware of what is going on.

I still think that it would be a dumb move on the part of BL because he was putting himself at risk of someone dialing 911 and him being caught pretty quickly. And I think it is possible, but far-fetched to believe he was able to get his hands on a car.
