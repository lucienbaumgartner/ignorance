Hate is a strong word. Loathe, contemptuous, mega mega sucks!! Those would be better words. I hate myself and wish I wasn’t this way. I want to be normal. I look at people and I’m jealous if they are women because they are what I want to be. If I look at Jen I wonder how they can feel so normal in their body. 

I am deep in the closet to everyone except my wife and my therapist. I listen to people talk and when transgender comes up for whatever reason I cringe. I know that I’ll feel like shit and that they all MUST see through me. They must know I’m trans. They think I’m a freak. I’m a perv. Or even worse they don’t understand at all. 

How do you describe a sunset to a blind person that’s never seen color? How do you describe gender dysphoria to someone who’s never experienced it. I’d rather stay blind and ignorant that know what I can’t have. 

I hate myself for being how I am. I hate my mom for making me this way. I hate the works that I can’t be who I feel inside. I hate my life. 

The only bright spot I have is my wife. She is my single point of light. My hope. My support. My everything. If you hate yourself as bad as I do then I hope you can find someone who loves you more than you hate yourself.
