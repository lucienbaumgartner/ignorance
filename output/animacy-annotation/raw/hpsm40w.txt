What Madeline did was not wrong. She was right that Antoine should be paying Savoir more and that the books should reflect Savoir's success. The problem was her conduct.

She thought everyone at Savoir was an amateur even though those people had been running successful luxury campaigns for a long time. She was good with numbers but lacked soft skills which are equally important in business.
