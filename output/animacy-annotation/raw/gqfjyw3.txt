No, it's not.  You trying to win an argument to miss my point is your problem.

No change is valid to you because you think I was trying to pull a fast one about Silkbinds.  I'd defend how the weapon is designed and the general incompetence of a lot of "IG Mains", and that would extend to you.  You're not engaging the game but the position you're defending is that "Well Capcom doesn't know what they're doing" because that is the logical extension of mopey IG takes.

Saying I did a false equivalent is like saying I tried to offer a Silkbind, no my criticism is way worse than that.  I'm saying the people you're defending, and you by extension, are incredibly shallow and ignorant of why the weapon works and how ironic it is that if you play the weapon the way people claim it is "Like World basically", it's actually worse.  

So all the weapons bad qualities are largely imagined right now.

Where were you coming to me from?  About a trailer.  Being incredulous about useful things that imply some logic behind why the moves work the way they do, WITH OTHER PROMOTIONAL INFORMATION WE NOW KNOW isn't about Silkbinds or me saying "This is DEEPS."  My praise of the weapon is it feels better, the moves synergize, AND it gets more damage and people who play it like World are actively the source of their own misery.  So get out of here with that shit.
