Washington native here that relocated to Asheville at 22, couldn’t have said it better, the class gap is insane there and only growing wider, multi million dollar homes in Washington Park and two miles down River Road are mobile home parks that look like scenes from a third world country, great place to grow up while you’re young and ignorant of how the real world works and probably a great place to retire if you have a ton of money but after high school if you’re not from a family with old money you gotta get out of there or things can start to get very dark very fast, learned that the hard way, with all that said I do still have a ton of love for the place and there are lots of amazing people that are trying to do lots of good for the community as a whole and I have a lot of faith in those people to turn things around
