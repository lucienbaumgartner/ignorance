This is true, but he should be held to the same standard as his peers (not the rest of us that had a more typical upbringing). And compared to his peers, he's still immature, completely out of touch, seemingly extremely socially unaware, and downright dangerous with his vaccination stances given his large platform. There's other players that also grew up successful and outside of the normal schooling system that also turned out to have whacky and immature behaviours/personalities as young adults, but there's also many that didn't. 

It's perhaps more complex than simply stating 'he's an adult', yes, but it's a lot more accurate than stating the go-to cop-out 'he's just a kid' that's quite literally completely false yet convinient.
