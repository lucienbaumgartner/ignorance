&gt;Same as the PLO/Fatah.  
&gt;  
&gt;Except that the PLO didn't try to steal land.

&gt;The reactions of the occupied people's aren't what's being examined here.

&gt;Instigators are more at fault than self-protective victims.

Great to see that you're running out of excuses and resorting to disrespect by rating my legitimate explanations with sources.

&gt;I didn't say or imply that, I just stated that those that are the instigators are the foundation for all the problems. That's how that works. Instigators always take the blame.

While you're at it, Just say "It's all because of the Jews" and be done with it if you're too shy to admit the other faults that lie in the conflict here, better yet learn how to be unbiased.

&gt;You mean when Israel tried to illegally import weapons of war after threating Jordan and Syria, and after genociding Palestinians (the Palestinian Exodus)?  
&gt;  
&gt;The only thing Egypt did was block illegal weapons trafficking, and as a result Israel tried killing everyone, then occupied their land.  
&gt;  
&gt;How is blocking illegal weapons trafficking an act of war? It wasn't even near Israeli land. What a load of absolute rubbish.

**Where did my totally legitimate sources ever say anything about illegal weapons?** stop making stuff up and back up your claims with evidence before you start praising Egypt as some caped hero. Egypt is a fine example of a failed country that boasted so much about destroying Israel and in the end got its teeth kicked in in a matter of six days.

&gt;Because Israel had already threatened war with the Arab league after massacring Palestinians without any justification, and threatening to steal land from Egypt, Syria and Jordan.

Still, no evidence about said threats to the glorious Arab league so i'll just assume whoever taught you these facts is biased and ignorant of history.

You better come up with better excuses or at least back up your claims, because you're not looking good here.
