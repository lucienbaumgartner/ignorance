I'm afraid your arguments are anything but coherent, and their repetitiveness and lack of applicability to the context you're inserting them into makes you seem unaware and unbalanced. 

I don't think your personal struggles are due to your moral philosophy or your search for one, it's the fact that your writing (and, probably speech) are incoherent and unrelated to what's going on. It makes you seem off or out of touch.

You might want to broaden your horizons in terms of the topics you're reading about, and perhaps read some writings from other philosophical perspectives. It's no surprise that reading one perspective on one topic has solidified your worldview. Sounds like you haven't been challenging yourself, just regurgitating what you've read.
