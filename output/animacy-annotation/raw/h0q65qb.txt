My ex thought the mediation I was trying to get us into was a 'trick' to get all of his money.  He refused to even talk on the phone with a mediator I'd met, or find one of his own liking.  That paranoia cost us both $40,000 in the end.  He figuratively burned $80,000 of the marital estate just because he was overly emotional and ignorant of things like ....facts....law.  You should consider mediation seriously, and don't think of it as her "pressuring" you.  It could be for the best, but if you never attempt it, you won't know.  The worse that can happen is that you've spent a few hours with a professional and you've each learned what the other wants.  This is done at a mediator's rate, rather than at a lawyer's rate.
