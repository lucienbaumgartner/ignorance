You’re calling the wrong person “lazy.” I work out, which I’ve already told you, and I work well over 60 hours a week. But I also understand that just because my life is one way, doesn’t mean that everybody else’s is. It’s super cool that your parents have the time and energy to work out. That’s awesome. But it’s still ignorant as fuck, and honestly just kind of weird, that you think your circumstances apply to everyone else. That’s extremely ignorant and short sighted. But hey, honestly, good for your mom. She sounds like a bad ass. Good for her!
