Just a bit of personal info on the permarital counseling - for me anyway, in the catholic church, that process was an absolute JOKE.  The couple 'counseling' us saw some red flags, I know they did, because they were at a loss at how my soon to be husband could not put into words why he loved me.  Because they asked each of us why we loved the other.  All he could say was 'I just do, I just love her.'  They prompted with "buy why?" and he was silent.  Big red flag.  They gave us their rubber stamp anyway, we gave them a check,  and we continued with the wedding.  At 25, I was too relationship-immature to know what all that meant.  I knew I was hurt, but had no clue that living with someone who was so self-unaware and non-communicative would be so difficult.  I only wish the counseling had been 'real' and not just another money making avenue for the church.  

I think that non-secular counseling, if done right, can help out many couples.  Too often couples only get relationship counseling as a last ditch effort to maintain the marriage, and it's usually too late.
