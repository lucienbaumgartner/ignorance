You are mistaken. He went from 12 to 13 or 14 or so last year. Cabin fever was introduced way back. 

The "just pass time" is one of the most ignorant and disrespectful comments that could be made in that regard, If you ask me, and it was such disrespectful comments that actually played a big part in him quitting playing, iirc. A shame, since he knows more about the game that all the show off lopers I've seen around here combined. Actually, he didn't pass time at all for many of those total 14 years, like, at all. It makes no difference though, he explains very well why. Only a try hard noob would state such thing.
