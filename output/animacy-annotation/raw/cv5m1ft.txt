&gt; Show me where they were told they were not able to have kids.

It's implied by the fact that they didn't know they were naked (Gen. 3:7) and the Lord told Eve after they partook of for fruit that "in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." (Gen 3:16). They didn't know they were naked and wouldn't have any sexual attraction to each other because they were like little children, innocent and unaware. That all changed with the fall when their eyes were opened.
