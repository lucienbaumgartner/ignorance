i would trade. 100%. 

not because i think it would be better to be more likable or better looking or more confident. 

i would give anything to be fucking dumb. 

intellect makes being truly happy a lot harder. i just know too much about all the terrible things happening in the world at any given time. all the injustice. 

what's worse i feel a responsibility to do something about it. 

if i was dumb and unaware that would just be infinitely easier.
