I actually had the opposite. I really loved the graphical improvements and such that came with the enhanced edition, but I actually found myself enjoying the game more with the 'voice' slider turned to zero in the audio options.  
  
There was something jarring about having certain characters being *given* a voice, whereas during my first few playthroughs in the classic edition, I was able to imagine what they were like based on their lines. The voice acting often conflicted with how I felt the characters were actually being constructed, and it took away from the experience.  
  
For example, Madora's voice acting completely changed how her character felt. From just reading her lines in the classic edition, I got the impression that she was a character who put on a proud, boisterous facade in order to disguise a lot of internal conflict and resentment. Listening to her lines being voice acted with that ridiculous accent just makes her sound shallow, unaware and unintelligent - even in seemingly 'serious' moments.  
  
Jahan is another example. Based on his lines he came across as arrogant and resentful, although he was definitely a deep thinker and someone with a very rigid and long-developed philosophy on life. His voice acted lines make him sound as though he has some repressed anger issues, because he just sounds like he is perpetually angry and only ever a step away from exploding with rage. He goes from sounding pompous yet mystical, to volatile and impulsive.
