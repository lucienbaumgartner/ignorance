Thank you OP for your thoughtful response! I bring up surplus from lack of regulation because as many people and legislators realize now it will for lack of a better phrase totally fuck the market and system beyond recovery, where only the already wealthy will prosper and disproportionately affect small businesses. I am also in my late 20s and already really started advocating publicly towards the end of high school, our effort and voice is not in vain I assure you. 

I think we actually for the most part agree that eventually we should have sound and reasonable legislation that will further open tge market up to the general public, but that is a ways away till the federal government first starts legalizing and regulating. Even then I think most of the public will abuse and be even more immature and ignorant of cannabis culture since it has been publicly shamed and prohibited for so long. The fact that it would take over 50 years after alcohol prohibition to come up with sound law that punished alcohol related crimes and address treatment(drunk driving and general alcoholism) is very telling as to what will happen during national legalization in our lifetime and our future.
