Oh my God. My co-worker literally said this to me a couple of weeks ago. Talking about flying to Florida and getting a vacation in before Biden locks us all down yadda yadda conspiracy shit. I can't believe people like these exist. I don't understand how people can be so selfish and unaware that a a quarantine isn't forever.
