I disagree, disclosing shows [self]respect, honesty, and kindness. When you disclose after the fact, you have already taken the choice from someone, and that in itself can be a hard issue to grapple with. 

Disclosing doesn't always make people more informed, but in most cases it does. While most people may have an exaggerated perception of risk, most people who care about you are willing to listen and learn. Are you saying that you're some sort of outlier who would refuse to listen to and learn from someone you care about? Perhaps you are, but i'd wager that you're not so different from anyone else, and even without your diagnosis, you wouldn't consider yourself so hard-headed and ignorant that you couldn't grasp new knowledge, or love someone despite a small factor, out of their control. 

I've disclosed 6 times, and I've had 6 positive responses - it doesn't mean that is a rule, *but* I don't think that "most" people will run away, in fact, I think that most of the people who care about you, or anyone with hsv, will be willing to grow and to love with understanding.
