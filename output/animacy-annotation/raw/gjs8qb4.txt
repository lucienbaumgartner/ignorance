yeah depop apparently passed a ban on dropshippers but thereâ€™s still many shops that seam to leak through and have their business up and running. A lot of their buyers are young and unaware of shein resellers so unfortunately they end up being the market for those. The only thing we can do is report them I guess and hope depop will take them down ðŸ™„
