Looking at this as a citizen of another country ... feeling just as pissed off ... feeling thoroughly bulldozed and ignored ... feeling nothing but contempt and pure hatred for a Conservative leadership that I did not vote for ... nor has my country in over 66 years ... I still believe that this was deserved! There’s no way in hell I’d act like this ... and if I did I certainly wouldn’t expect to be celebrated for it! She wasn’t a martyr ... she was a domestic terrorist! 

You don’t go storming official buildings under the threat of violence and discord to get all your own way! She was shot by law enforcement! WTF did she think would happen? 

So what if she was a military vet ... that’s about as declarative as being an ex dealer. I never wanted to serve in my country’s military because I believe the act of bombing and threatening other or lesser nations in order to get what’s wanted is a moral shit stain on a country’s character. 

Then you have the mindset of these kinds of MAGA people ... so egotistical, spoiled, selfish and ignorant. That sociopathic behaviour eventually leads to a horrific situation in regards to mental health and personal perceptions of right and wrong ...
