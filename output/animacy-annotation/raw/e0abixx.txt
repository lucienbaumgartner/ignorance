I see a lot of "good riddance" "glad these poachers got killed" and I agree, poaching is bad and can (and likely will) lead to extinctions. But why do you think the poachers do what they do? When it comes down to it, it's the best way these individuals have found to earn money and provide for themselves, and perhaps their families. That's the problem here, these people have to turn to such a horrific practice to survive. Imagine you were so poor, and unaware, that you turn to killing protected animals as your best means of survival... and then people celebrate the news of your death, when all you wanted was a way to continue living. I think the bigger tragedy of poaching is the fact that so many people are so desperate to earn a living in these areas, that the practice continues.
