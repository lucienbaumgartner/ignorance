I kind of disagree. I commented below that the Del Ray neighborhood is extremely family oriented and there is no shortage of family friendly restaurants within easy walking distance of The Sushi Bar. It's easier and more effective for this restaurant to enforce a blanket rule in an impartial manner rather than leaving it up to someone's subjective interpretation as to what well-behaved means. I really think that most parents believe their kids are well-behaved.

For example, friends of mine have a 3 year old who almost makes me like kids...he's sweet and friendly but also quiet and extremely well-mannered. My friend apologized to me for her son's "meltdown" when he continued eating food off the table after she told him it was time for bed. It was such a non-event that I was initially confused as to why she was apologizing. My friend is always very gentle but firm with him, so he understand rules and boundaries. 

Conversely, my sister in law has a 1-year old and a 4-year-old who is absolutely wild. He is generally an okay kid but a little spoiled, no manners, few boundaries and completely undisciplined. She actually said to me that she doesn't think he ever needs time-outs or discipline because, in her opinion, he's such a good kid. I could not disagree more but I kept my mouth shut. We went out to dinner with them recently and I was mortified because he was out of his chair wandering around the table, getting in the way of other diners and waitstaff and generally being noisy and disruptive. SIL and husband were completely unphased and unaware that his behavior was super-rude and I guarantee they would not have understood why if they were arbitrarily asked to leave.

Our culture is, unfortunately, very child-and family-centric and continues to become more so. To find a refuge from children is rare and I applaud the owner's policy.
