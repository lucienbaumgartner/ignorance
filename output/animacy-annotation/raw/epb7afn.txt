You might be young, and unaware that our perception of a Kid doesnt change, Im 40 I never thought id see the day Id be uninterested in a 22 yr old, but it happens a 22 yr old when you are 40 looks like a 12 yr old with breasts, the people my own age despite wrinkles and grey hair setting in, continue to look young, its just something that happens as you age.
