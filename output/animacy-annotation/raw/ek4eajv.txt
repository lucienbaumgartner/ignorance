I think people, like anywhere, live in their own word. So they can not see what impact their way has on others.
Some may be aggressive, true. So far I did not encounter this myself but it happens I am sure.
Cars make people unaware and sometimes ignorant of their surroundings as well.
It is also true that some bicyclist are the same. 
I think it would be nice if we had a polite society.
Probably will never happen. 
I try to make myself as visible as possible and think for them.
