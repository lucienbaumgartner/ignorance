&gt;I am a mercenary and I go where my fiscal and ethical requirements are met.

Bingo. I put in notice Wednesday, my manager called me yesterday (when I was on PTO) to briefly ask about it. I like them, so took the call and was blunt that it was nothing they did and I loved the team/coworkers. Buttttttt

* My raise for "stellar" performance above and beyond was 3.5% in the face of 7% YoY inflation
* My work-life balance was non-existent because we haven't opted to build out 24x7 professional services coverage (cloud security, so emergencies can happen anytime that we should be prepared to help with once notified) so I was chained to my laptop
* Not once in the last year was I ever asked about what I wanted for career development in 2022. I have nothing professionally to look forward to next year except business as usual
* I had no real control over my (large fortune 500) accounts, the large behemoth that acquired us a couple years ago is pushed our tech savvy sales guys out and giving the accounts to completely ignorant and clueless managers from their side to soak up the vast renewal commissions on contracts worth millions a year each
* I've pretty much worked myself to death for the last 5 months and our reward for it, including working for 2 weeks straight due to a massive security breach (google log4shell/log4j CVEs) was a fucking Amazon gift card
