&gt;Not to sound like an ass, but sitting here and trying to cater to the 8 children out of 100,000 that end up hospitalized is just unrealistic and admittedly unfair for the rest of us.

I mean you are crying about having to wear a cloth just because some children die.  

One thing I have yet to learn is how to teach empathy and self-awareness to the unaware and unempathetic.  Learn these things my friend and your life and those around you will be better.
