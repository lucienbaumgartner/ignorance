I go on there occasionally just to see if there's anyone who will surprise me  and offer insight to trump as a candidate or that has any sense of understanding about anything but every comment is void of substance and full of paranoia or hate. Nothing but bratty ignorance. Everything against them is rigged, everything racist is not, everything hateful is justified, everything stupid he says is ignored, everything Muslim is Isis, everything contradictory is redirected to Hillary being a fuck up. And to top it off, they brag about being people who say what they want when in reality their a bunch of trump chode sucking betas who call each other centipedes and who consistently have nothing of value to offer to their own sub, and who look up to a privileged orange peel because they lack any balls of their own and think he's what testosterone embodies. Somehow, this man will make America great again. This man, who's subs top post have nothing to do with policies and everything to do with shit posting  is going to make America great again. To be this self unaware and delusional is mind boggling. But nothing will ever change their stupid minds and they will forever be the real cucks who idolize a bigot and who are easily baited and triggered.
