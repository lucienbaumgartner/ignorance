Yes, I understand how the market operates, and the logic behind the production/consumption of convenient products. I just happen to value diy and understanding how things are made, and I also like to apply those values to other people. In this case, I feel comfortable stepping out of the descriptive "this is just how things are" understanding and into the "this is how things ought to be" prescriptive judging circlejerk because soylent is *really* fucking easy and cheap to produce, and because I am human, I get annoyed at the product and people who, for whatever reason,  are unaware and unexcited about how silly (in my experience) the product is. Yes, I am the hypocritical center of the universe and I don't care about the perfectly reasonable, technically correct explanation for why shitty products like soylent exist because life is fucking BORING when you live according to such a zoomed out, unexciting perspective. Not to mention when you live that way you basically enable the ever-expanding vortex of worthless marketing and vapid, hypnotized consumerism, thus decreasing quality of life for yourself and those around you by encouraging terrible, readymade solutions to life's problems, but that is for another discussion entirely. Have a good day.
