Controversial, but this pandemic has proven that there are people just too stupid to operate in our democracy. Our democracy has turned into an idiocracy because of the failures of our education system to teach people how our government actually works and how to choose a responsible president. We are at a point were letting trump supporters vote is almost like letting an rebellious insurgency vote. They are so dumb and ignorant that they don't even reside in the same realm as everyone else. If you are going to be in a democracy, you should have to learn some damn history and be familiar with how our government works. We are proving that democracy does not work right now. Why should the American people run this country if they don't want to take the time to be educated? Why shoulf Americans get that right if they don't take it serious. 

If your still a Trump supporter, fuck you. Your a cancer in this country.
