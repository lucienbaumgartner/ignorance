&gt;Why would I not know what CRT is? I have internet access and can read the ideas from the source. It's funny the left has decided to die on this hill - oh how the tables turn.

Nothing about CRT is racist. That’s why I assumed you didn’t know. It’s a legal theory that originated in the 1970s but for some reason Republicans have decided they passionately hate it all of a sudden. 

&gt;Also funny how your idea of a conservative is someone dribbling over fox news - what a silly generalisation to make.

It’s really not that silly given your comments. It’s the most watched news channel in the country and it’s basically exclusively conservative viewers. 

&gt;And why should people not be able to sue teachers? It's a very important job with a lot of responsibility. 

Sure, they should be accountable to the department of education.

&gt;Are teachers above the law? 

Huh? No, they should follow the law like everyone else. What’s this have to do with suing teachers over what they teach?

&gt;They should be able to indoctrinate your kids without any consequence?

They should be able to educate kids without fear of delusional parents suing them for daring to teach their kids about historical facts. If that’s “indoctrination” than yeah, they should be allowed. It’s their fucking job.

Government censored education is what communist countries do. Are you a communist?

&gt;Edit: actually I don't want an internet argument, I'm past that and we both have better things to attend to, if we can't agree CRT is racist by definition then we are on two different planets anyway - let's hope they never collide.

Oh you have absolutely no basis to claim CRT is racist. It’s not a matter of a difference of opinion, you’re just objectively ignorant and wrong. You like to think you’re above the influence of propaganda but it’s clear you don’t have the ability to think on your own. 

Be better.
