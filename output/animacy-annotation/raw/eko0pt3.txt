I fucking find the notion hilarious that a congressman can suggest a person is a Hitler sympathizer by intentionally taking her out of context, but we people cannot call a congressman stupid. What the actual fuck, someone really ought to remind them they aren't lords and kings, and that a person has every right to call them stupid to their face, "decorum" be damned. They serve us, not the other way around. It's made even worse from the fact threat she didn't even call him stupid, That shit was made up, and he just shrugs like it's no big deal after she calls him out. They want to treat her like dirt, but demand that she respects them at all? Hah!

They absolutely proved Candace correct about how democrats feel about the people they supposedly represent in that moment alone. They truly do believe folks are that fucking stupid and ignorant that they can get away with such blatant disrespect, and what's even sadder is that they're most likely correct to feel that way. How many folks that voted for these assholes were even aware such a hearing was held?
