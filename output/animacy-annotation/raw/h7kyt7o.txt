That's also doubly stupid and ignorant of Taiwanese politics.

The KMT are not in power anymore, and even so, they are the party which is more pro-unification. 

A lot of support for formal Taiwanese independence is actually anti-KMT. The pro-independence people hate Chiang Kai-Shek and see him and the KMT as basically invaders from the mainland who unleashed a reign of terror, and in many respects turned out to be worse than the Japanese who ruled Taiwan for 50 odd years prior.

Meh, tankies in infantile 2 dimensional understanding of Asian politics shocker, what else is new?
