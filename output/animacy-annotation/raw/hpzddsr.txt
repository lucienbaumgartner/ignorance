... There's a huge difference between someone so tired of poverty, abuse, and whatever else that they see suicide (often justifiably) as the only option and people who are actively ignorant and bigoted. The comparison is insulting.

Most shitty people are just ignorant, or acting on past traumas, or whatever else when you get down to it. Nobody chooses to be a villain, and few are villains in their own books. With that said, it makes no difference to the amount of harm they cause.

That being said the 'all conservatives are dumb or  mentally handicapped / ill' rhetoric is bullshit as well. Right wing ideology can be a survival mechanism for those who grow up in families (or communities) of bigots, to say nothing of the constant fearmongering that helps solidify an ideology as a justified response to an external threat.

Plus, most of the pompous liberals who can't shut up about how stupid the right is aren't exactly paragons of leftist virtue themselves.
