I agree our criminal justice system is fucked but  it wasn’t a protest. It was a riot with looting and fires and breaking into local businesses. One of the “protesters” also had an assault weapon that he aimed in KR’s face. You people are so ignorant and blind that you won’t even read the facts before you go spewing your bullshit emotion driven statements on the internet. Educate yourself.
