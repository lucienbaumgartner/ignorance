I mean that’s kinda what I said just a waaay longer version lol.

I live in Orlando, sugar babies are everywhere. I have a few friends that call themselves sugar babies. And I did say it’s not always sexual, it can be companionship.

That’s not the issue tho, the issue is that OP seems completely unaware and uncomfortable with it.
