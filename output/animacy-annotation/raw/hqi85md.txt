Some poor bastard's mom on r/insaneparents claimed that Rand Paul had "...proved Fauci lied! In front of congress." AND that Fauci funded the Wuhan lab where covid was "created." If you watched that testimony, anyone with half a functioning brain cell can see that it's just Paul grandstanding and saying random medical jargon that doesn't have any real relation to covid and trying to catch Fauci in a "gotcha!" moment. 

Yet to these people this counts as definitive proof that Fauci is "in on it." The guy who studied his whole life to try to prevent this situation is guilty in their eyes because they're too ignorant and stupid to think critically.
