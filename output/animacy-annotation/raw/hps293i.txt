OP, how old are you? And how old is he?

I honestly can't believe what I'm seeing in this post. How can you be so painfully ignorant and naive to believe that he truly loves you and wants to be with you when he is making it obvious that he doesn't with his cheating? 

This guy literally told another woman that he loved her, didn't want to live without her and that he wanted to marry her at the courthouse. 

WHY IS THIS NOT ENOUGH? WHY DO YOU SO STUPIDLY CLING TO THE IDEA THAT HE WILL STOP CHEATING ON YOU?

Do you really hate yourself so much that you are willing to tolerate being cheated on, being manipulated and gaslit? 

Why do you believe he will change? What makes you think that you deserve this? Why in the hell do you still believe this guy when his actions unequivocally prove otherwise? 

I will tell you. 

He will not change because he knows he can jut say he's sorry and continue on with his cheating, that you will always believe him when he says he loves you despite the fact that he doesn't show you he loves you.

You DON'T deserve this. You deserve a guy who truly loves you, who would never even dream of cheating on you.

This guy has shown you, time and time again, that he does not love you. That he doesn't care about you. 

This guy is marrying you because you are naive and gullible, ignorantly and stupidly continuing to trust him and believe that he loves you. 

I seriously can't believe anyone can be as dumb, naive and ignorant as you are being, OP.
