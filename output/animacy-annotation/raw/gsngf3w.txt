Because peace is a two-sided coin. For you to have peace, the other side has to want peace. If people hate and are afraid of you then I'm going to assume peace is never an option. To me, it's naive and ignorant of Armin to constantly want peace at the possible destruction of his people. Like the only solution I see is that the threat of world destruction by the hands of the rumbling but that seems like a negative thing to hold over the world.
