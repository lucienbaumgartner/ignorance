I though you were exaggerating but holy shit that thread is actually disgusting. 

It’s like they forget Joey bosa’s celebration to end the game last week or the fact that Herbert had an EXTREMELY similar celebration right after their go ahead TD late in the fourth. He just directs it at the defense instead of the sideline. 

Like that thread was gross and you even had ravens/ raider fans crawling out of the woodwork saying the same shit. 

His greatness has officially reached peak levels if we’re going after him personally/ his family when we throws a game winning pass. 

Just it’s remarkable how hypocritical and ignorant that entire thread is 

Previously I thought chargers fans were mostly cool but this has seriously changed my opinion a lot. There are hundreds of people commenting in there and maybe two had the nerve to point out how wrong it was.
