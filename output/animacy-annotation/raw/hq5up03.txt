Side note: These doctors need to stop lying  saying we can’t get pregnant. Just the other day someone on this sub was newly diagnosed and her doctor said she would get diabetes and be infertile. This is really really annoying and inaccurate and also sloppy of doctors. It’s borderline malpractice to me for them to be this ignorant and telling us this. Patients are basing their life decisions on what these people are telling us.

You’re not the only person I know that thought they would never get pregnant or have a nearly impossible chance of it happening and then wound up getting pregnant. My friend kept her daughter, btw, tried to make a go of it with her child’s father but it didn’t work out for them so no now they coparent and she’s happy. She’s a very driven woman and make it work for her.

It’s criminal how lazy, ignorant and sloppy some doctors are about this (very common at this point, it’s not rare) condition.
