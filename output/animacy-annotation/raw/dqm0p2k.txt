The erosion of family values, the declination of the middle class resulting in both spouses needing to work in order to live resulting in less family time, vacation time, etc. and the constant effort to create dumbed down, culturally unaware citizens has been intentional, and it has done irreparable damage to the American people.

Let's all have a friendly reminder from the Podesta emails:

#"we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."

These sacks of shit have done actual, lasting, psychological, physical, and economic harm to the American people.  To consider them enemies of the state would be an understatement.
