Please, everyone gets a license. The test is a joke and we don't enforce the rules. This is why I have a 9000lb truck and great insurance. I stopped riding a motorcycle 3 years ago because of all the idiots on the road who tried to kill me every day. Drifting lanes is nothing. I have dashcam video of people running red lights on a regular basis. Stop signs? Laughable. Pedestrians? More points to rack up. It's a joke.

Drivers are angry, selfish and ignorant of the rules of the road. Cops don't bother anymore so good luck out there.
