Economic systems are not black and white. History of countries have not always been socialism or capitalism. Deducing that because a Social Democracy isn't a socialist economy, that it MUST be capitalism is incorrect and ignorant of the history. Social Democracy is just another economic structure.. if they were the same there would be no difference from the USA and Sweden in terms of economic structure. But yet there is a huge one, that is, one is a social democracy and one is capitalist.
