Definitely strange. Sort of like that cliche of when your favourite local band goes mainstream. I was happy to see him get the exposure I felt he had deserved for a long time and I was happy to have him put out more content and be doing podcasts with Joe Rogan and Sam Harris and other "big league" media people. It was also very weird to see him be labelled as alt-right and what-not, because I knew how wrong and ignorant that was. However, he had always talked about gender differences over the years, and even back in the day it rubbed some students the wrong way.

Eventually, maybe after 2 years of his fame, I felt like he had over-saturated the media environment, and I was tuning out because of how repetitive it was getting (keeping in mind that I was largely already familiar with his ideas prior to his fame).

I hope he recovers, releases the next book, and bounces back with some new ideas to talk about. I hope we can all move past the SJW stuff (as a culture, I guess) and get back to more interesting psychology/philosophy content.
