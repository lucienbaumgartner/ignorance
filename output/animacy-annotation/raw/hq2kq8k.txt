Dude, slow down dude. I didn’t claim to be a biology or evolution expert. Secondly, I’m open to the proof and have no problem of accepting it provided it is well established and doesn’t have any methodological flaws, as data interpretations can be reached through inductive reasoning. 

Thirdly, now you have switched it to my favorite people vs. your people. It doesn’t work like that. There are scientists who disagree with Darwinism and Darwinian evolution, just like what you get from different fields of knowedge. That’s why I brought that clip. Saying all of those 1000 scientists (and more actually) are just a scam is just ignorant and short-sighted.

Besides, I’m not making a case against science. I love science and the more you study, the more you get closer to recognizing God. I absolutely have no problem with science. So stop making it look like atheism = science. It doesn’t. My original argument was that of atheism and moral values and judgements.
