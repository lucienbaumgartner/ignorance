I actually really love that scene early on where she's like "Why would killing Alice be bad? We should just kill her". I like how she's not all "uwu innocent I would never do anything wrong", but it's more like she's *so* innocent and unaware of human emotion that she circles back around to being dark and outright callous sometimes.
