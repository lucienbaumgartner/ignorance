The first line in your post is "I cannot listen to or watch the most privileged black people in the **history** of human existence" but now you're saying history isn't an issue?  You literally started off with that.

Also, saying 1 person out of millions aren't allowed to talk about it because of their money....I mean c'mon, you're taking  a few examples of people making it through the challenges and trying to invalidate everything because of it.  You're not allowed to talk about unarmed whites being killed because a white guy is our president so it doesn't count.  Oh yeah, and alot of the richest people in the world controlling everything are white, so you're not allowed to talk about those statistics.

The fact I have to explain that to you means you're either trolling or so completely racist and ignorant that it's not even worth replying to you after this - there will be no changing your mind with reason.
