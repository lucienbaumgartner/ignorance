This is probably gonna be lost at this point but here goes. I’ll preface this by saying I’m not “anti gun” - I own a family .38 that I wanted since I was like 7. I don’t carry outside the house but that’s for personal reasons. 

I think this is mostly bunk. A gun is good for hunting and home/self defense against a limited number of assailants. 

What did the neighbors of Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans do when those good, innocent people were being rounded up? Not a goddamned fucking thing, and then they looted their belongings and destroyed their homes. 

Having a gun might have prevented some of the murders of LGBTQ+ folks but the law isn’t kind to people they consider “others” defending themselves. 

Ryan Whittaker answered his own front door with a gun in his hand at his side and got killed for it. Look at the protests last year - weapons would not have made the cops more pleasant to deal with. 

What you’re calling for is unrealistic and ignorant of history, and that is why it gets brushed off. You will never shoot a cop, domestic soldier, or government official and get away with it, no matter how flagrantly they were violating the law or constitution.
