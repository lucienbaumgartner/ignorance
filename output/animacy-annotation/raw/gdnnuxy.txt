It’s the absolute worst!!!! I (25F) can attest to it not being a gender issue. It is so incredibly frustrating, what makes it worse is that a big majority of these guys start the conversations and don’t even try to keep them going. I’ve reached the point where I don’t even bother to try to carry it anymore. If I see zero interest in making an effort I just stop replying. I always try to make questions and give people ways to keep the conversation going but they just don’t even try. 
I’ve started wondering if maybe people are just so obtuse and unaware that they don’t even realize it and are left wondering why I didn’t reply to their two word answer.
