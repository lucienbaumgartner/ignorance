Much like the Simic, the Izzet would try to invent weirds to do exactly what the slivers can. I imagine it would be like Iron Man's nano suit in Endgame. The Azorius would use protective wards around their precinct to keep the citizens both safe and unaware of the dangers outside of the bubble. They have to keep the slow churn of bureaucracy going no matter what the cost, and if less more chaotic guilds are finally taken care of, so be it.

I think the Rakdos would see this as the end times and they would become doomsday prophets. Why fight when you can party and join Rakdos? The Gruul would be expert sliver hunters as this is what they have spent their whole life training for, but they would incur massive collateral damage to, well, everything. Similarly, the Boros would do massive damage to the city as they wage their massive holy crusade against the tides of slivers.

The Dimir would probably be the "good guys" in this scenario as they would keep a level head and try to stop the problem at the source. Maybe they would try to recruit a team to fight the Sliver Queen, then mind wipe them so the Dimir can harness the power of the slivers for themselves at a later time.
