Every time you accomplish something or do something productive, he does not want to talk about his partners successes. You said he is smart so he’s pretty much aware of what he’s doing, on some level.

When you leave the room he comes looking for you but refuses to talk about the same subject matter that originally took place (the topic of you, his partner) bc you mentioned he is frustrated and the topic changes. I thought he was unaware and unstimulating? Could it be that he’s actually aware that he is ignoring you and using anger to control you so we don’t bring up the topic of your successes? 


You might feel intellectually unstimulated by him because he’s not producing any form of stimulation at all. 

He could be inappropriately competitive. 

There are a handful of people you do not compete with. We do not compete with siblings. We do not compete with other family members. We do not compete with coworkers that are working on the same project as us and we absolutely do not compete with our partners. 

Some people compete by shutting others down around themselves.

Reread your own post and see if this might fit into what might be going on.
