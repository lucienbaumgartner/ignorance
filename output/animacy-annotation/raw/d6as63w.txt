&gt; Marijuana gets you high, it's quite a step ahead of potato chips.

Getting high isn't addictive.

&gt; It's addictive that's just the truth and saying otherwise is quite harmful for those who are unaware and prone to habit forming.

Marijuana is as addictive as videogames or potato chips or exercise.  If you have an addictive personality, that's a personal problem, not a consequence of marijuana use.

&gt; Like this isn't my opinion this is a fact

I agree.  You're factually incorrect.  Not an opinion at all.
