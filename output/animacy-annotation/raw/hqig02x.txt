People aren’t criticising Peterson the individual, he’s simply a conceptual framework that captures a pile of bad ideas and mistakes. When people make fun of Peterson it’s for all the outlandish things he says, and it’s easy to connect every laughably option he has with multitudes of others. I could make a Jordan Peterson out of others, I know where all his ideas were taken from and all the ideologies that influence him. It’s like putting a puzzle together, then when you see the picture coming together… you look at it and laugh as you admire how ridiculous it is.  

All the positive things you say about Peterson in that last paragraph. I agree with you if you’re saying the opposite of the truth. He’s remarkably ignorant and uneducated in the things he talks about, and his big takeaway from Nietsche’s philosophy is the downside of being compassionate. He literally tells people to be a monster, under his Jungian integration nonsense. Bitter and bullying? That is Peterson precisely. A nasty person? Peterson is the epitome of that. The partisan politics game is ridiculous I agree, however, Peterson is a leading figure in encouraging it and building that division. He has his disclaimers, but try listening to what he actually says (dogwhistling/implicature). Language is use, look at how he is using his words. Read c-16 and look at him proclaiming himself to be a neuroscientist is you want to see how dishonest he is. If you want to see him fail at simple logic/argumentation then look at him against Dillahunty. If you want to see his complete ignorance of Marxism see the Zizek debate. 

I don’t really want to turn it into this, but as an ‘intellectual’ Peterson is embarrassingly inept.
