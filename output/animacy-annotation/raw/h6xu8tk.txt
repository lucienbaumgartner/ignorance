It's okay. I understand context was needed and from what it seems, you are trying very hard to not only be aware of others but yourself as well

I applaud you and am proud of that mindset and behavior

Yes, you are wrong for calling your dad an asshole and, as you said, not having the self-restraint or emotional control

**However you're NTA; your father is**

You seem to be doing your best at understanding and being a positive and helpful influence without being completely submissive and ignorant of your own needs and boundaries. That is AMAZING, especially for a 14 y/o 

Just watch out on burning yourself out for your friend. As much of an AH your dad is being, I can see where he's coming from as well albeit not.. as much. He may just be worried about the mental and emotional exhaustion that comes with trying to save someone that doesn't want to be saved yet or the possible toxic emotional manipulation that some people do to keep a pity party going for themselves (unalive baiting is unfortunately quite common). He's not expressing himself correctly at all, but I hope by providing possible perspectives that it helps you navigate in future interactions

Best of luck OP
