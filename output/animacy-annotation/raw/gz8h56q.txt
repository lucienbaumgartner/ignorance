I was recently called as the assistant ward clerk.  It was a little interesting because the bishop was new and unaware that my temple recommend expired 6 years ago.  Long story short....I took the calling because I like the guys in the Bishopric and I thought it might make my wife happy who is TBM. I told my bishop I lost my testimony several years ago and he has been very understanding and supportive.  Sometimes the meetings are excessive but I really don't mind the calling.
