Just because I mentioned my experience doesn’t mean I think my anxious partner is bad. If you read on I say we all have the same wound just presents differently.  

My view point is limited because I’m speaking about my personal experience. I did not generalize and say all anxious types are like this. I spoke about my partner who was extremely aloof and unaware of the damage his actions caused. But his attempts at connection were respected.
