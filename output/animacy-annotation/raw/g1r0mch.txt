Why do you keep saying that? Why do you think these are just a bunch of kids with no political power? 

Are you saying that these protests are just the pointless tantrums of children? Or are you trying to downplay the seriousness of this? 

ANYONE can have political power if they have the numbers to take it. Insurrections and rebellions happen all the time around the world. Can you really be so naive and ignorant that you think it could never happen in America?

And honestly it’s too late. Trump Will most likely win and there will be blood in the streets because these “kids with no political power” are going to rage. What then? Is it just all bullshit to you?
