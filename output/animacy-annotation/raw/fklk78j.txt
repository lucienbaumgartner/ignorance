Its actually a really good video, exploring both sides of who Gandhi was. I'd recommend watching all of it and not just the timestamped part

A Gandhi quote from this really stands out.

&amp;#x200B;

" Ours is one continued struggle against degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the European, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw [Kaffir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_(racial_term)), whose occupation is hunting and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with, and then pass his life in indolence and nakedness."

&amp;#x200B;

" The British rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that, like the Kaffirs who can be pleased with toys and pins, we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.‚Äù
