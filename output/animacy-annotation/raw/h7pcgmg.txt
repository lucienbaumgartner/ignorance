It's not at "popular level", it's still a governmental issue, some politicians in Japan deny it and try to influence the population by baning mentions of it in school books and such, kinda like the US and the recent bullshit with denying slavery in their schools. This in turn makes their own citizens ignorant and unaware of the shit they pulled during WW2 with beheadings, rapes and the like.
