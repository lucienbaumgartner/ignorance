If this was a one-off, then by definition it won't happen again. But if I'm right, and given the sub you're in, the statistics skew toward a problem existing rather than not--the worst thing you can be is unaware and unprepared. Also, in what world is it rude to say OK? I think you're the one playing games here and maybe you could find a more appropriate place than a support sub to do it.
