I see you're getting downvotes but I completely agree with your challenges to NIO's bull thesis. Alot of people here see words and phrases like "in house code" and "autonomous" and think NIO is somehow an industry leader in these technologies, failing to understand what exactly are industry practices and already-known knowledge within these companies; these companies aren't dumb and unaware of EV growth AT ALL. A fair advantage I'd give to NIO and smaller EV startups is they won't need to pay the overhead cost of pivoting from gas to battery technology inside already established supply chains, but of course the initial cost of starting a car company isn't something that's negligable either (but this is where the government funding is a big deal). Anyways, as an EV investor I just wanted to say I respect you and the legitimate concerns you've brought up here about NIO, it's nice to see someone with good points and questions that I can use to research more.
