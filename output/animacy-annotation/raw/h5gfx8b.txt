It could of been a dream and not astral projection since it was a nearby park you knew of. Day dreaming is real, but what do you mean by disoriented and unaware of “time or even the concept of life”? That doesn’t make sense to me, why are you thinking about the time or concept of life if this strange feeling/thing happened to you?
