You do realize public school is not free... no government service is free... someone is footing the bill by paying taxes. Which last time I checked was paid for by the citizens of any given city, county, state or nation. Therefore the lady is paying for the service you claim she is getting for free... stupid is thinking that a government service is free. 

Where as I agree her argument is stupid, your argument that she is stupid for arguing with the service she is getting for free is completely wrong and ignorant of what really happens in real life once you move out of your parents house.
