As a girl I find it horrible and ignorant of your wife to not teach her son about periods. He may find himself in a situation one day where he can be a lifesaver. If your daughter isn't properly folding her pad or something related to that, she should take this as a time to give some motherly advice. Rather than building any relationship, she's making things tense.
