This article and most of the comments are simply wrong and unaware of Colorado politics this time of year.  The bill was tabled (as even agreed by the bill’s sponsors) until next session.  Very common.  This will come up again.  Colorado did not “deny” anyone anything.

This is what happens taking news out of context.
