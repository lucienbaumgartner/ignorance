Should they be tho. Dont you think school would be alot more educational if people where actually given the option  to have a fucking opinion. Don't you think that would start dialougue and could potentially lead to a further understanding of what it is like to walk the shoes of another person. Don't you think that it is time that we stopped pretending that 16 year olds are clueless and unaware of the current political climate when they have pocket computers feeding them data 24/7. Why shoul the constitution not apply in schools. Teenagers are not stupid and they are most certainly people. It is almost as if America wants its population to be stupid or something.
