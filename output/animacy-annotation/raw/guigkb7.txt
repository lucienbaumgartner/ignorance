This issue also comes up every few weeks or so. It's dumb and ignorant of people.

The issue with miles will be here as far as anyone can see because it's too costly to change all the signs. And it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things whether I'm going 60mph or 96.5kph.

Metric is used where it matters. Like, I can get an all metric tool set because I drive an import that uses the metric system. EZ. And if I drove a vehicle that uses imperial, I can get a toolset that is all standard.
