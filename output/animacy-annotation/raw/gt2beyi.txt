Obviously, that is impossible unless they all commit suicide.  

Luckily, this isn't an "either or" situation, it's a gradient with complete ecological collapse at the bottom and ecological stability at the top, even if we were **all** doing as best we could, we'd still be nowhere near the top because life creates damage no matter what. So the only sane answer is for everyone who can, to do as best as they can, so we can get as far up the gradient as we can so that maybe climate change, which is already hitting us hard, doesn't keep ramping up until it kills us all. The reason we all need to do everything we can, is because we don't know what "Sustainable" looks like, what we need right now is to stop the escalating damage we are creating so we can then step back and see just how much damage we can sustainably do without destroying our children's future. 

If every person in the world was going to act together to help stop the problem, we may be able to do it without everyone doing everything they can, but as a very large portion of the world is denying reality and continuing to consume like climate change doesn't exist, it does need us who care to do as much as we can so we create less damage and so that governments take more notice and start to force the selfish and ignorant to follow suit. Demanding the right to do less because "I don't wanna!!" just makes you one of the selfish and ignorant that will need to be forced to do more later. 

The worst part is going to be when the government does get involved and everyone who has been doing little to nothing freaks out that they're being oppressed and how no one should ever be allowed to tell them what to do... Every single time people try to improve society, most of society acts like spoiled children without a concept of personal responsibility for their actions. It's pretty disappointing.
