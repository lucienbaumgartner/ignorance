I'm actually disappointed that you're a fellow Monogatari and steins gate fan, with how shallow and ignorant of peoples differing perspectives you seem to be. Which is ironic because one of the first monogatari plot topics is about understanding just that and how two truths can be both equally right. Can you not understand that maybe something you hate can be something someone else loves? I genuinely hope you're just having a bad day, I get days like those sometimes and I believe in you to get out of it as well.
