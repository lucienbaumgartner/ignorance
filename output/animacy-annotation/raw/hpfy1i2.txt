Well then also be ready for 15 more years of dragged out arcs cuz if we give every fight 10+ chapters as some of u seem to be asking for then we aint getting done with this any time soon. Yes Oda made some pacing mistakes here and there with off screening many fights imo but asking more than few chapters for all of these fights is just ignorant and stupid. 

One Piece never had more than few chapters or even more than a chapter in many cases for fights so suddenly bringing up this criticism now is also inconsistent on the fans' part
