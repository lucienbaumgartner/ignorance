Lmao please tell me more about how people don’t go hungry and die of other horrible things in capitalist countries, and keep pointing at places that imperialists have messed up plenty already as some kind of.. what I don’t even know. Capitalism literally forces everyone to participate or die so no shit the places trying not to participate are struggling, they are literally attacked non stop by the capitalists around the globe. You are beyond delusional and ignorant that you think all of these pieces exist away from one another in sterile vacuums. We can continue this conversation when you pull the boot from your throat.
