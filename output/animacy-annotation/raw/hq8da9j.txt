&gt;So in other words democracy is bad, because majority might disagree with your values

In a democracy, the majority will\* always trample on the minority.

&gt;It's not like we have laws to make sure scenarios like that dont just happen on a whim.

That's called a republic. I'm not surprised that you're conflating a republic with democracy because you've made it very obvious that you're very illiterate.

I was going to say that it's funny that you live in a country that is a constitutional republic (USA) but never knew what it was, but it's not your fault that you're ignorant and illiterate, that is the fault of the poor US education.
