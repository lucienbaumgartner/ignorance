Why *can't* gender be gender roles or identities? I'm not trying to be snarky, I'm genuinely unaware and curious same as you. 

If the gender binary is the social and cultural delineation between masculinity and femininity, and the gender spectrum is all the identities between those two extremes, why can't you define the whole concept in terms of its components?
