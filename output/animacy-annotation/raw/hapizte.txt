When I was a teenager I often felt society placed too much value on “life experience” that it was rather pretentious and ignorant of people to claim to know better than someone just because of something arbitrary like age. Now that I’m in my 30’s with life experience of my own, I am rather certain of that. I’ve worked with people in my career who have been at it much longer than I have who are much older than I am and are absolutely fucking shite. Their age of experience counts for exactly dick, experience in the right circumstances may have some value but it certainly never trumps common sense, knowledge or talent. When it comes to life most people are clueless and hopeless at it whether they’re 16 or 65. I wouldn’t trust your opinion a strangers any more than I’d trust a 16 year olds, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get the right to have a say. I think the requirement for voting for government should be based on if you’re old enough to be able to work and therefore pay taxes. If you are you should get a say in how your society is governed
