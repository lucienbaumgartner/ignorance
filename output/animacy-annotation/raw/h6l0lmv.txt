It is true I think, I'm definitely a lot more boring now than I was in my twenties. But I was also a lot dumber and unaware of how my actions hurt people around me and what a dick I was. Some people will tell you to live hard when you're young so you don't regret not doing anything in your old age, but don't forget that you could regret the things you did as well.
