Lmfao no, he feels the slightest bit of contact and all of his bodily functions stops and he throws himself over.  Soccer is a contact sport.  Not a single clip above showed contact that warranted what he did afterwards.  He's fucking embarrassing because I agree with what you said before, he has the skill and ability to stay on his feet and score beautiful goals.  So diving time and time again to deceive the ref and to wins penalties or free kicks right outside the box is a shame.  You're the only one being a child here because you can't see what's happening right in front of your face and are too ignorant and stubborn to admit it.  Maybe you'll grow up at some point in life.
