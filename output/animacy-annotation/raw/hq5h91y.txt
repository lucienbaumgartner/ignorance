He's introduced as an ignorant and intolerant person and nothing is done to really rectify that. Outside of one episode he never showed any awareness for how privileged his upbringing was no matter how oppressive he found all of it. Even him bouncing from one fancy boarding school to the next smacks of privilege and he treats it like a joke. I am not trying to say there's nothing potentially sympathetic about his story, but I personally have no sympathy for him. Also every time he called Rory " Ace" I wanted to climb into the TV and strangle him.
