I've rarely see wokies talk about Christianity save for certain events, the cancellation of Chris Pratt for him being a member of the Hillsong Church is the closest to something like it that I've seen recently, if an MCU capeshit saint wasn't a member of it, Twitter would never know that Hillsong exists.

Hillsong are a bunch of prosperity gospel scammers and goons, but this doesn't justifies cancelling him because many members of these Evangelical churches are native and unaware of what occurs behind the scenes, almost all of my family members still attend these churches and they're still very chill.

Christianity has been so forgotten that they barely even talk about it except when the topic of atheism or Islam comes up, or when it comes to banning things like same-sex marriage and abortion, and they'll only mention Southern Baptists and Catholics and their social and political positions, never actual theology and beliefs that influence the latter, that's about it.
