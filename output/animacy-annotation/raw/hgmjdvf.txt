It is what it is. 

Is the popular thing to do, it does kind of alienate people from eachother, causes people to become prideful without actual substance, and become exclusive and excluding, ultimately it breeds a kind of isolated elitism, clueless and ignorant of anything outside of the scope it own social bubble. 

But hey, you do you.
