I've got a troll boss planned for my party. Not a troll monster, but a joke. Basically its a 44AC, 800HP, Immune to crits, health regen boss. Thing is, it has no reason to fight them. It will actually love them. The problem will be that its very large, very silly, and very unaware, and the place it resides will be filled with natural dangers. Its attacks will actually heal the party but good luck making it mad enough to hit ya. Its based off of SCP-999 kinda. It won't try to save them or anything. But they will need to kill it to proceed. Its easy to kill... just dunk it in the water... thats a long fall down. This is all for an optional side-quest that makes things easier for them. So I really don't care if they complete it, as it doesn't stop the campaign.
