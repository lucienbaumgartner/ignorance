"Oh, yeah he used to be a homicidal maniac. Crazy! But you must be tired.  Yeah,  go ahead and take a bunch of sleeping pills bc those things will SURELY keep you safe. It's better to be unaware and unconscious when a murderous psycho is stalking you and breaking into your house. "
Are you kidding me? 
No one calls the cops, everyone has waaay too much of a relaxed attitude about some lunatic attempting to kill you.
