It sounds like you may not be fully aware of the effect your words can have on a person. I say this as somebody who has been accused of being arrogant and done a lot of soul-searching as a result: you come off a bit arrogant. As unintelligent as you may find this woman, she’s probably smart enough to know what that “seriously?” means. It means “Seriously? You’re so ignorant and unaware that you don’t know what a subsidy is?”

My problem was that I assumed that because someone didn’t have the same level of knowledge as me on a subject, they would also be too dull to realize that I was looking down on them. But it turned out this was often not the case. The people I spoke with had enough emotional intelligence to know that I was looking down on them, and it hurt their feelings. Since this was pointed out to me, I have tried to change my attitude. I am more careful about the words I use, and I try to remember that everybody has their strengths and weaknesses, and that I’m not better than others just because I may know more about certain things. When it’s appropriate, I try to make a genuine effort to educate without appearing arrogant. People are much more receptive the the points I try to make.
