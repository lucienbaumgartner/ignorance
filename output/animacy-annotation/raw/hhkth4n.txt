I mean honestly any changes you would make after contracting an Sti should be made anyway to protect yourself and your partner from an undiagnosed sti (just because you are asymptomatic and unaware of your status doesn’t mean you aren’t contagious). So getting an sti isn’t causing any change at all in your life, being a more responsible partner is. Also, while sex is an important part of our lives, it isn’t our whole life. So some people have a short conversation before being intimate with a new partner, literally every other part of their life stays the same.
