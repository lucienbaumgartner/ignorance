High af lel

I was just wondering if there is any move Gamestop could make to create even more value for an investor than selling during the squeeze. Like for example, if they drastically split the stock at the height of the squeeze, could their increasing value as a company potentially make 10,000,000(n) stock shares more valuable than $10,000,000 per share during the squeeze.

I may also be financially retarded and ignorant of how a dollar works
