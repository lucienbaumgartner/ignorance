This is why the system works in some places, sure. Currently, over 40 percent of households in the US don't pay any net federal taxes. This is unlikely to change, as Democrats will not vote to raise taxes on their base. A universal healthcare scheme in the United States would ultimately lead to the majority paying for the minority, who, in the US, tend to be in the worst health. This would not be a very good think for social cohesion, to say the least.

And because increasing taxes on the wealthy is also unlikely due to the nature of politics in the US, universal healthcare would ultimately end up burdening the lower-upper through lower-middle classes and increasing the debt to even more catastrophic levels.

The entire system is rotten. There are reasons the US doesn't have something that every other developed nation has beyond just political differences. The US is not wealthy, not in any way that matters. It's like an old aristocratic family, riding in the family name, cash poor and unaware  that the foundation of their mansion is about to break and they won't have the money or credit to avoid becoming homeless.
