Oh man, it really makes me mad too. If a parenting book or other resource doesn't present its material to parents in general, but instead directs it solely to Mums, I stop reading/listening/watching. Oh, and including a section in your book 'just for Dads' is insulting and ignorant of the fact that Father's are often equal or sole carers.
