You are almost correct, but you give them too much credit. They know EXACTLY what to omit and what to deny. It is the lies of omission and the attempts to conceal truth that reveal their characted. If they were innocent and unaware that their behavior was "bad", then how could they know to omit or conceal such details. It is only because they know that these activities cause them to be percieved in a negative light that they then choose to either lie by omission or to try to conceal truth.
