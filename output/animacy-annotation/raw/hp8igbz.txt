I’m reminded of those who reap what they sow. Anti vax dying is just that. Ignorant people losing their lives due to their ignorance. Most people now who have tried to help these people are so burnt out now from beating their heads against the wall it now comes to, “good, I’m glad there is one less of them destroying what’s left of society.”

They are simply ignorant and hard headed. Nothing will change this as has been proven. Even when they make it through a bout of COVID. Even when their loved ones die of COVID and they deny it still. These people are now, in my opinion, a lost cause and worth no one’s time to even ridicule much less garner any sort of empathy.
