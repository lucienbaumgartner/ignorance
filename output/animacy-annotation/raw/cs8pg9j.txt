There's really no end to human stupidity. When i lived in the city i noticed that every time i was walking close to the walls of a building, people approaching would walk right at me. I would bend sideways or whatever to avoid hitting them, but really i had nowhere else to go...


One day i said fuck it I'm sick of dodging people and just held my ground. They would literally walk right into me time and time again.

The really scary part is when you realise they're not doing it out of maliciousness, they're just so incredibly retarded and unaware that they have no clue there's a solid object in their path. I assume i could have been an oddly placed tree or something and they would have slammed into me anyways..

So yes, a large portion of our society is so stupid they lack the cognitive ability to not walk into shit. Let that sink in.

Now go out and select your mates and peers from this seething ball of idiocy...oh and enjoy your drive home!
