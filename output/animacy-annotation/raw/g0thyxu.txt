When someone from the queer community tells you that something is homophobic you sit down and listen. When someone from the trans community tells you something is transphobic, you sit down a listen. When people of colour tell you something is racist, you sit down and listen. You don’t get to make excuses and say oh I didn’t mean that it’s up to interpretation blah blah blah. This is not for you to decide. It’s for the members of that community. But do however realise that even trans people can be transphobic, queer people homophobic and people of colour racist. So when someone tells you a statement is problematic you close your mouth, sit your ass down and consider why that statement is problematic. 

Interpretation does not matter if a statement is so tone deaf and ignorant that it could be perceived as transphobic. And I guarantee you that at least half of the people who upvoted that comment in their heads look at trans people who have transitioned and trans people who haven’t transitioned differently. There is no distinction. Trans people are trans. End of. 

I understand that you may be feeling guilt but this is not how we progress as a society. When someone tells you something is ignorant OR could be perceived at that you can’t let your own guilt make you respond to that person aggressively. Look around you! There’s so many people on the lgbt community that make statements like that and it’s problematic.
