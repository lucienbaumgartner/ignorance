Considering it is people from the East and West Coast who keep calling the rest of us the “flyover states,” obviously their view of themselves is fairly skewed. And it’s very common for movies and tv shows they create to portray people from the Midwest as naive and unaware of what the outside world has to offer (also an annoying stereotype).

So perhaps meet someone from NOT NYC or LA before you paint all of us with the same brush.
