Scientifically, of course, we cannot say that "nothing of consequence" was found on Luna.

I'm wondering, though, when you mention that... what were people expecting to find? The 1960s boom in space was almost a historical accident, more the result of a group of German enthusiasts, Soviet policy and technology, and geopolitics than a linear outgrowth of human effort at the time. We didn't develop cislunar flight to support the enthusiasts and scientists, but rather the geopolitical types. We already knew Luna was a wilderness (well, definitely after the Surveyor landings in the late '60s). Why should people have been surprised by that, and why would they consider it significant when the nature of Luna itself was never relevant to them?

I'm in Canada, and the history of this country seems equally improbable to me; in fact, it sometimes reminds me of humanity's current understanding of space. How many early European states considered Canada useless? No less a man than Voltaire referred to it as «quelques arpents de neige» (a few acres of snow), and Louis XIV traded it in part for a single Caribbean island, albeit a lucrative one. That was an evident mistake even in the 1700s, even if I understand the short-term economic gain that motivated it.

The majority of humankind is still innocent and ignorant of space. I wonder if people will one day wish for these good old times, when we were motivated by the desire to learn and appreciate what is around us and where we are, rather than the obvious economic motivations that space will offer...
