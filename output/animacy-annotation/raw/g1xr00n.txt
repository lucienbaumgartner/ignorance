There are people that say to never talk to the police for any reason, even if you are the victim or you witness a heinous crime. They are so paranoid and ignorant that they believe we want to charge everyone for as many crimes as possible instead of what we really do which is solve crimes and charge the right person(s).

That mentality means we solve less crimes because the only way we can properly do our jobs is with the general publicâ€™s assistance. Those same people come back and call us incompetent for not instantly solving the crimes and arresting the criminals.
