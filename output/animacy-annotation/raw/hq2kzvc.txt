&gt;&gt; Which they fully admitted they were ignorant and wrong about and made an episode in opposition to the first as an apology.
&gt;
&gt;First off I do not believe they ever said they were ignorant or wrong. They made an episode about manbearpig being real **12 years later**, but Stone and Parker did not personally say anything.

Did they themselves ever say global warming wasn't real or did they just make an episode about it? If they only made an episode about it then by your logic why are you so upset about an episode over 14 years old?

&gt;&gt; I think it's an incredibly nuanced point and you shouldn't base your stance on it off a comedy movie made entirely of puppets.

&gt;Which is it? Is it incredibly nuanced or should I go easy on it because it has puppets? You're arguing out of both sides of your mouth.

What...? I'm saying you shouldn't base your geopolitical stance off what a comedic puppet show tells you to think. This really isn't that hard of a concept. *You're* the one taking the movie so seriously, not anybody else lol.

&gt;At the same time they were denying global warming (well two years before that), they made a movie about the War on Terror. Do you think the guys who deny global warming are going to have a nuanced take on foreign policy?

Not at all lol. Which is why I said you shouldn't use them as a source for your stance. You're getting awfully upset about a comedic puppet movie, bud. There's definitely more going on here.
