My father taught me a saying about making assumptions, you must not have heard that one because here you are, making assumptions in public and making an a** of yourself. 

I am fully vaccinated. But as a scientist, I understand the limitations of vaccines and masks, nothing is 100%. 4 weeks before the pandemic I got a devastating diagnosis and have been fighting for my life since.  Catching covid would be truely awful for me, and would prevent me from getting the treatments that are saving my life. Plus, the last thing I need to covid on top of what I'm already dealing with.  So I have to be very careful, my life is on the line. 

I am of the opinion that the same kind of people who refuse to wear masks and refuse vaccinations are selfish  enough to put my life at risk by still refusing to mask and lie about it, denying me the option to decide my own risk level.  I know people who went crazy and became anti-vax, and they see nothing wrong with lieing about their kid's vaccination status to people with cancer. They are just so selfish and ignorant that they can't care about anyone around them.
