Racism is just racism. There is no such thing as "Reverse racism". Just because historically a group of people may have held more power over another does not mean every member of that group currently or did participate in the oppression of others. We shouldnt be using slurs to combat other slurs either, it turns into an eye for an eye situation. You also say "White people werent doing the work and protesting to even denote racial slurs as socially improper". Go look at pictures of Martin Luther King's march on Washington and you will see just how silly and ignorant that comment is. Bernie Sanders, for example, was actually arrested around that time for protesting to give black people and other minorities the right to vote. Plenty of white people throughout the Civil Rights era encouraged the equal treatment and status as citizens to all minorities.
