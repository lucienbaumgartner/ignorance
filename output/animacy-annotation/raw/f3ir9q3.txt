Sorry but your friend is an idiot.  Epilepsy has a known neurological basis.  How does she explain that straight guys have epilepsy as well?????   Her thinking is so dumb and ignorant that it wont matter what you say to her. Forget it, don't be upset.  Focus on being the man you are, and managing your condition .
