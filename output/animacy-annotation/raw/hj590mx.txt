I'm not really sure what you're looking for here. You made a post about why you hate TTRPGs and ended it with saying it's not for you. 

Okay then don't do it. Problem solved have a good day.

If you were looking for reasons *to* get into it and had genuine questions then you probably should rethink how you wrote up your post. Your approach to the subject as well as your specific 1-3 discussion make you seem very arrogant and ignorant of what D&amp;D even is. 

1) I've seen groups that are full on nerdy. I've seen groups that are heavy into RP. I've seen groups that dress up. I've seen groups that don't do any voices, dressing up, or excessively "nerdy" things. The latter IMO are the far more common. 

2) I've literally never been a part of or seen games like this. Immature people will be immature. Mature people will be mature. That isn't exclusive to D&amp;D. Anything from online video games to playing sports to just hanging out with friends can be the way you described if the people you're with are all immature. 

3) Alignments are really an afterthought in 5e. The only caveat is that your general alignment (in terms of what your goals are and why) should fit with your group as a whole. You saying "your creativity sabotages you" just makes you seem like you're so full of yourself. You're not creative to make an LE character. People do it. It's fine. But it should be done in a campaign and group that makes sense for it.
