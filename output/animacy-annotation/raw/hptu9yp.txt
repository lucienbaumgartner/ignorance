Ignoring the fact that this is 100% off topic, no, you're wrong. 

1st off you actually don't know the height situation. That angle rule is determinant off of seating distance and overall height. Not only is everything within specifications, but the installation has been measured out by SnapAV and validated. You guys are so wrong it's absurd and ignorant and honestly makes you guys look like trolls with nothing better to do. It's quite infuriating how flat out wrong people can be without context or overall picture it's disgusting. Stay on topic. This post isn't meant for this or I would have provided other context, I don't want to nor do I need to so stfu and get out. This is a hue reddit, fuck off. I'm not showing off my setup, I've been asked to post my implementation of gradient light strips by many others to show what's possible and I'm doing that. Now seriously kindly fuck off. I don't give 2 shits for bullshit off topic unvalued thoughts.
