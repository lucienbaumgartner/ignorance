Stack ranking does this: https://www.perdoo.com/resources/stack-ranking/ - Its a really toxic management style.

Also in a previous company I was in there was cultural pressure to fire people occasionally to show you were a hard nosed manager pushing people hard type thing. Again quite toxic and ignorant of the manager than builds solid teams and cultivates genuine loyalty for when you need to push hard for projects etc. Its very US management style.
