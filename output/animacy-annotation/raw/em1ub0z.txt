Kasey was smart enough to keep the receipts and he delivered them when she doubled down and insisted her version was the truth.  From memory, it was only when he produced the receipts that AL walked the allegations back.  

Even now, she goes nuts if someone mentions the allegations.  And she continually misgenders Kasey, even though she's been told how awful and ignorant that behavior is.

But, you know, gorl lost some weight so... we're all bitter and confused apparently.
