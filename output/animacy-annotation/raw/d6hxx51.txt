Kinda not true, most mountain lions when they are nearby kinda screech like children. They are pretty noticeable and you avoid their areas. And if you have a weapon on you and are in a group you should be pretty safe. If you are by yourself wandering completely unaware and unarmed then ya you're gonna die. But most of them don't attack humans especially groups of humans
