Or.. you know.. a gay Hispanic son of legal immigrants raised in poverty who thinks identity politics are bullshit. Who's fought tooth and nail to get everything I've achieved. Who sees through the absurd and blatant bias the entire mainstream media tries to paint. Who sees Trump is not a sexist misogynistic xenophobic racist. Who read the Clinton camp Wikileaks emails and was disgusted to see them say, verbatim, "we want an unaware and compliant citizenry" talking about their voter base. To see how fascist the left is being by silencing free speech.. I could go on, but I'm sure my poverty-raised gay brown skin would still be considered straight white privileged to most of you. You never think to consider someone's own experiences and beliefs and challenges could shape their political beliefs, not every republican is a racist White male.
