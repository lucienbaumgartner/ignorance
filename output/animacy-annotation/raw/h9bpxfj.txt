&gt; No. You're incredibly biased and ignorant of military reality.

But I'm still right... Bias or not, you have admitted this. It's advisable that you just accept your idiocy by now.

&gt; Not at all. You're the only one acting that way. You're the only one who kept drawing out tangents to circle around the main point that Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia. But no matter how hard you try and twist it or how far you shove your head up your ass, Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia.

As you have admitted, they can. They just dont want to.

Why do you insist on being wrong? You know this is the correct statement, your arrogance is hilarious though.

&gt; You are severely underestimating what it would take to stop a Russian tank brigade which would be supported by Air Cover and infantry.

That wasn't the argument. I know Kremlin bots like to move the goal posts, but you literally said:

* **Ukraine doesn't have the capability to produce advanced weapons, they've always depended on imports.**

Which is provably wrong, as I have shown you.

* **Financial aid won't stop tanks**

Also provably wrong.

So wrong on all counts, yet you continue to kill your credibility by insisting you weren't. It's bizarre how dim kremlin bots have become.

&gt; I think Russia is much more capable than Saddam's army, Al Qaeda, or ISIS. Really not sure what you're missing there

So you compared Ukraine to Afghanistan and Iraq, but then insist that Russia is more powerful than the Iraqi army and Al Qaeda.

Are you having a stroke? Can you make up your mind? Who are Ukraine in this scenario lmao

&gt; Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia

As you've said already. They can, they just dont want to.
