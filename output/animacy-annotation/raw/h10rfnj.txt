I think it was because they were trying to make Mrs. Kim seem absolutely clueless and unaware that she looked naked, adding to the racist assumption that Asian Women in particular are less intelligent than the general western population. Only someone “cognitively impaired” or “STUPID” would not realize that they seem naked while wearing skin coloured clothing. It may be dehumanizing as well to add a “naked joke” in there for no reason as the show isn’t raunchy.
