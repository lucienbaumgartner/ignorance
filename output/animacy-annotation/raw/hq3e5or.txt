You are making him out to be a monster or a bad parent for being pissed. And you’re throwing words in my mouth. I never said he was right for what he did, I simply said he’s pissed off and had a right to be. 

By assuming this man reacts in this way on a normal basis, is an ignorant and unrealistic thought to fact. Assuming my views are nasty when you don’t know them, is also a nasty and ignorant assumption about me. 

This girl is having problems because she doesn’t face any real consequences….. not because he smashed her phone.
