I realized the pope said something utterly wrong and ignorant that will harm countless children. (It wasn't just the pope's musings, it was a stance that the church stands behind.) I realized that god (through the pope) couldn't say something this ignorant.

Which lead to the realization that I can't take what the church teaches at face value. It didn't invalidate Catholicism in my eyes. After all, the pope and cardinals and everyone else are human and could theoretically (maybe even unknowingly) reject god out of arrogance and push their own views as his.

But I now needed to know where I could find a reliable way to know the "god's truth".

Which lead me down a path of trying to figure out who I can trust. Can I trust the cardinals? Can I trust the Catechism? Can I trust the bible?

Turns out that after looking into it all of those things are unreliable.

I also learned that while I was always taught that Jews reject Jesus for bad reasons after listening to their arguments it seems clear to me that they have very valid reasons to reject him. Jesus couldn't have been the messiah. Christians twist the OT in extreme ways to try and make him fit that description, at times even changing it. Also the Christian obsession with painting Jews as incapable of understanding their own scripture is (quite honestly) disgusting.

Eventually I came to the conclusion that abrahamic religions just aren't true. (or at best have some truth that has been twisted beyond recognition)
