I mostly have words for people in the comments using ableist terms like moron and idiot to describe traits that aren't neurotypical. The chick doesn't seem especially ableist just unaware and misogynistic. I actually like that she seems to have found a way to be supportive of her husband's emotional needs whether he's actually autistic or not

I support that theory lol. I think the rigid rules and black and white morality are very appealing to a lot of neurodivergent people

I understand that. I have an immense amount of empathy I just don't display it like neurotypicals and sometimes I need to take a moment to myself to fully understand before I reengage with my nt loved ones because my emltions can be hard dor me to process. They understand. I'm definitely apologetic to people who don't understand though. Thing is I never learned to mask properly so if I try to display my emotions like an nt it seems fake even if I am genuinely feeling the emotion
