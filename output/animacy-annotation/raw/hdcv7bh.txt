I guess theyâ€™re desperate. Iâ€™m not as suspicious b/c they have a ton of reviews and theyâ€™re all 5 star, my guess is theyâ€™re just young and unaware that this isnâ€™t exactly professional. I was considering asking to maybe pay for a $100 listing on depop and transfer the other half to them directly thru paypal, but if yâ€™all think thatâ€™s still too risky then I suppose Iâ€™ll just have to keep waitingâ€¦ itâ€™s too bad this item is so rare ðŸ¥²
