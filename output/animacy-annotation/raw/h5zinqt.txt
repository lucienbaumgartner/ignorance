Intervention just leads to way more death in those countries than if we did nothing. I am in my mid 30s and I used to support intervention for humanitarian purposes but Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya proved me to be naive and ignorant of the reasons that the military and political establishment actually want to intervene. It just results in a massive amount of death and suffering in the targeted countries and makes people want to kill us here. Sanctions? Cool. Anything more than that? Fuck that. Also, if we are gonna use economic and diplomatic means to persuade countries to stop mistreating their own population than we can't be hypocrites and have to apply the same standards to countries like Saudi Arabia, China and Israel.
