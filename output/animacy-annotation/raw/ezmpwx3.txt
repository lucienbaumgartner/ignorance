Yes, I dislike it. A lot. I feel that the part I hate most about it is that it’s a never ending battle. I got blocker shots to stop puberty before it started, I’m now taking hormones, and I’m probably happier with my self right now than I have ever been. But I know that I will have to take hormones my entire life, I know I will never have the body I want. It’s very discouraging and really brings me down a lot. 

And also yes. My mom and father are from Missouri. My moms side has been very accepting. Coming from a conservative background, they have handled it very well. My father side, on the other hand, are close minded and ignorant. That whole side of the family actually refuses to call me by my new name or use correct pronouns, which is exhausting. And I’m not allowed to see half of them... which is probably a good thing, lmao.
