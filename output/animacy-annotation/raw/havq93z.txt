“Emergency service’s have not reported any serious injuries.”

Losing eyes and fingers are serious injuries, your think of the children argument is irrational and ignorant of the facts, and the only property damage reported was from a suspicious bin fire, not a known cracker incident.

Every year it trends less damages and less injuries as people become more responsible.
