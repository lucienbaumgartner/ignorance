No one here uses the “heritage” argument.  I grew up in rural northern Ontario and while we didn’t have a lot of these guys, there were a handful who did fly that flag in front of their house, use it as a curtain, have stickers on their truck, etc.  This was not a racist thing, it’s a very uneducated thing.  If you ask any of them—and I have asked many—they use it as a symbol of redneck life.  These people associate it with country music, ATVs, hunting, getting drunk, and any other number of activities you’d assume comes with being country folk.  **This isn’t a defence, it’s still exceptionally stupid and ignorant.**

A few people I have known managed to get their head around it and ditched the rebel flag as it is just gross.  Others...well, the kind of stupid and ignorant that takes offence to being educated or corrected is very strong in many parts of this country, and it has only gotten worse with the rhetoric coming in from the US via primarily Facebook.  The number of people I’ve had to snooze on FB/LinkedIn is unbelievable, particularly people from Alberta.
