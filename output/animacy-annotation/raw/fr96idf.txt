So I think the argument here is that wearing a mask for a prolonged period of time (the article references healthcare workers, who I assume would be wearing a mask for their entire shift) can cause headaches or in some cases cause issues because of the limitations it puts on breathing (specific to the N95 mask).

Counterpoint: wearing a mask isn't simply to protect you from becoming infected, it is also to protect unaware and asymptomatic virus carriers (a non-insignificant percentage of the infected population) from spreading the virus.

I am not an essential worker and so my visits out into the world are infrequent and brief. Personally, I don't believe it is too much of an inconvenience or hardship to wear a mask in public. "Detrimental to health" sounds like a stretch to me.
