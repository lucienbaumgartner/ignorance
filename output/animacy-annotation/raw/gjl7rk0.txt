1. i meant your statement that we should have meat in our diet and that vegan was unhealthy.
2. Why shouldn't I mix up other animals with humans? both are sentient and able to feel pain. it's only logical to give them basic rights like not killing or abusing them. Is that to much to ask for?

&gt;to do either of those you have to have some loose screws in your brain, as a normal human being doesn't even think about it.

I could say the same to you for supporting animal abuse.
3. Illegal fishing is still a big thing. Also, humans shouldn't fish at all. We don't need it and only do harm to the environment by fishing.
4. I'm glad you agree that that's sad and evil, but let me tell you it's not necessary by any means. You also don't need milk replacements, if you don't like the taste. Not to mention, that that's a matter of habit, if I would taste milk today, I would probably react similar to you with soy milk. Don't be a slave to our society and your habits by thinking you would need meat, milk, cheese, eggs or any other result of abuse. Many animal products are sadly financially supported by governments, one of the reasons why vegan "meat" is way more expensive than they should be.

I think it's extremely selfish and ignorant, that we value the taste of animal products over their lives. Humanity (at least in some parts of the world) abandoned slavery, racism and sexism, even though it was more comfortable for the ones, who ruled over the oppressed. We consider equal rights as an improvement. But just because other animals have a lesser developed brain (or whatever the excuses are) non-vegans treat them like trash and hate the ones who speak up. I understand that people are sometimes misinformed, still think a vegan diet couldn't provide enough nutritions or believe the lies of the diary industry. I did that too a few years ago. I hope you and everyone else realizes this madness like we did with slavery, racism, etc.
