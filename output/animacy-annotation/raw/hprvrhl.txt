There’s a viral video about a 16 year old who fell off a cruise ship. Don’t know much info about it other than it’s MSC, but the comments are terrible. First of all, it’s a minor we are talking about. Second of all, I still stand by the fact that falling off a cruise ship is incredibly difficult. But comments people are leaving are just ignorant and also disrespectful
