The problem with Crypto has been free-riders.

There have been instances of college students, government employees, and others all mining bit-coins where they can plug in and use electricity and internet without having to pay for the amount they are actually using. 

They get the benefit of bit-coins while others have to pay for the insane amount of energy they are using.  The others that have to pay for it are largely unaware and unable to locate the source of their skyrocketing energy costs.
