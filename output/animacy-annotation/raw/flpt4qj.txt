Would you have sent Abram back to Mesopotamia, telling him that if God wanted him to live in Canaan he would have been born there?

But let's back off and ask a more important question.  Are you asking this for yourself, or about other people?  Because most other people understand their own situations, and particularly the insides of their own heads, better than you will.  Appointing yourself their spiritual coach, and especially telling them things about themselves that contradict what they themselves know, will just make you look silly.  And if you say it's Jesus making you act that way, the message is that Jesus makes people arrogant and ignorant.  That has a cost to the Gospel.
