I used to be really into it, but I’m pretty sure it’s too late. It’s a very high entropy state to be ignorant and angry at whatever the elitists pay a celeb to tell you to be angry at. I can’t compete. I do what I can but it’s not my cause anymore. Drove me nuts trying to get people to open their eyes. You can only roll that boulder so far before it comes crashing back down on you and then the unfair mods ban you on top of that lol
