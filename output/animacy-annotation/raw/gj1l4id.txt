While this is true to an extent, the staff member that [supported](https://imgur.com/TXon0ge) her is a Partnerships Account Manager and she's new to twitch; she was a mixer (a streaming platform that failed and shut down) employee before this. She simply saw a twitch partner visibly upset and expressed empathy towards her not knowing the context of the situation. She later tweeted that she was new and unaware of the situation (her twitter is now locked and all tweets are hidden so I can't link it). It seems she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time..
