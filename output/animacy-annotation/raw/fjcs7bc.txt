Now that is the worst. I'm so sorry. My dad passed through being scared and confused and is now largely unaware and happy (anosognosia) but it does not go that way for everyone. I can see you'd sometimes hope for a swift end. I hang out on some dementia forums off Reddit and it's taught me a lot about the different stages.
