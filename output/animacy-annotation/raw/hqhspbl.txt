Two things, Western superiority complex, and the fact that they conflate Arab with Islam. Most Westerners are too daft to realize that majority of Muslims on the planet aren't even Arabs. The West has always needed a boogeyman to keep their population in fear and give them a false superiority complex. This is a direct result of Western imperialist and white saviour mentality. It's pretty evident from reddit. Most of the people here, especially Americans, are too ignorant and hateful about Islam, that it's not even worth interacting with them.
