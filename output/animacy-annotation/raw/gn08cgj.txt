Unequivocally false and ignorant of NBA history. LeBron went to the Heat (eastern conference team), because he could form a super team in a nice place that was obviously a consequence of the cap. Otherwise that talent would have been prohibitively expensive. When LeBron was done he went back to Cleveland who by that time had great talent, again something that would not have been possible if teams would have been able to bid his actual value, and proceeded to go to a championship every year. When he was done he signed with your team, the Lakers, a horrible train wreck with an outspoken, strange dad, but which also had cap space knowing someone would sign where he failed to reach playoffs for the first time proving the vitality of supporting talent in his success. Next year, signed big free agent like everyone knew they would, and then went back to the finals. You think he moved to LA for Kuzma? He moved to LA because he wanted to sit under a palm tree sipping Mai Tais and the most anyone else could offer was the same amount.

And if the teams weren’t good because the east was bad at building that still has nothing to do with the argument. I didn’t say he did so *because* of the cap. I’m sure he’d rather have another couple hundred million in his pocket. He did so as a natural consequence of the cap.
