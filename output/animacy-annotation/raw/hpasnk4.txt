GME ape here, I have very very limited knowledge of crypto. That being said I’m obviously ignorant and clueless, yet still don’t plan to sell any of my LRC. I’d rather lose a little bit of money being wrong for the chance to make a shit ton if I’m right. Plus, this is how we support the revolution.
