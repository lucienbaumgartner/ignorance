You don’t read to comprehend, right ? I gave an example on how Asians that sound like you are the ones in USA supporting Trump. You haven’t disappointed me at all. You are just proving my points with your comments. Also, American policies with EU has major impact and what happens there also impacts EU. How do you think AFD after so many years got votes and their supporters inspiration from Trump winning USA election ? Are you this unaware and ignorant or this is your special day ?
