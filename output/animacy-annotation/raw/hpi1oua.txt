You are the guy who is ignorant and rude for no reason huh?   

I already said how I buy the secret lair for the drop itself not the bonus card.  If we got a card or not I would still buy them.   

I do my homework and spend money how I see fit and understand all marketing ploys just fine buddy.

I have yet to buy a secret lair in hopes for a certain secret card and will never.  If people fall for that fomo nonsense lol at them!

But any post of someone upset or joking about a lackluster card they got in the secret slot is comical!
