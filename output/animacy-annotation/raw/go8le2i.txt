I heard she put it in Daddys name when Jilly Juice sued her. So unless she got all "Im not getting sued, NO Im literally not going to get sued" attitude and put it back in her name Zillow would be sending ads to dad. ðŸ˜† KJ please get an education or help for not knowing normal things and always bragging about stuff that shows how childish and ignorant of adult normal worldly things you are. Sure hope Saltzy keeps this post for when he wins for Tati and Tatis cleaning her a$$ out that KJ admitted its HER house and putting assets in others names in middle of a lawsuit should be imo fraud. Dont know laws around that.

KJ said she has been doxxed so many times (mainly by her own self) that it doesn't matter everyone has her address. I dont and have never looked or had desired to know her address. If I had it im sure a quick 1 minute Google search would tell whose name is on the property. Im going to bet not KJs because she wouldn't be so reckless asking for more lawsuits with her daily defaming of the victim of the day. KJ acts like she has nothing to lose but she is wrong. Courts don't care about her sob stories if Tati wins they can take anything and everything they want right down to her nasty dog studio couch. Her son only was started to be used as a deflecting sad fishing object (Imo how KJ sees him) after the lawsuit was served. KJ still is not thinking about him while running her mouth but wants others to feel bad for her because of her son who she ignores all the time.
