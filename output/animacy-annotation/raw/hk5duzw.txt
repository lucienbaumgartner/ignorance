My girlfriend has never had healthcare, and we are both financially caught up to the point where we can afford healthcare soon (we both currently have no healthcare). We live in a city with plenty of medical professionals (TX, USA), but pricing when I have checked is high, especially without healthcare. I am trying to convince her lately that we should take our physical and mental health more seriously, and taking a test was our first real attempt. But honestly I just didn't know where to start.

I agree, seeing a licensed professional was probably a much better choice, issue besides with pricing, is that she has borderline trauma when it comes to the topic of mental health (due to her family being very unaware and toxic towards the existence of many mental health issues)

This seemed like an easy foot into the water kinda solution, but is currently not what I thought it was.
