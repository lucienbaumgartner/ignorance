I haven't used a single bad word but if I had to pick one for you, it'd be either delusional or stupid. The fact that you want people banned from ''everything'' Valve for feeding in your game says you're very immature or just young in general. 

\&gt;**but they really don't deserve the air/food to live.**

This line really speaks for itself. You seem really toxic and unaware that it's just a video game, at the end of the day. I hope you don't return to Dota 2, we don't need trash like you in the game.
