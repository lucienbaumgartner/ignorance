&gt;The perpetrator doesn't need to pull a gun on someone who isn't being violent.

The thief is the perpetrator here, by law. You're clearly very confused, and ignorant of Texas law.

&gt;Restraint would be not threatening to shoot someone unless they were trying to cause you physical harm.  

That's a neat opinion, but again not law.

&gt;It's basic gun safety that you shouldn't point a gun at someone unless you're willing to pull the trigger, and accidents can AND DO happen. This man's life was in danger.

Because he chose to put it in danger, by law.
