The tone of the whole post is deeply dehumanizing and ignorant of the struggle of transgenders in india.

Most kinnars in this country are either literal slaves or so far ostracised that they have no diginified way of making a livelihood.

This sub is in general super disappointing in its ignorance and persecution complex.
