So you think he knowingly repeated a false statement/lie over and over again all while knowing everything he says is recorded and gets dissected by the media? That makes no sense. The guy fucked up and said something stupid like every politician before him and every politician that will follow him. He made himself look unaware and ignorant, thatâ€™s all this is. No need to make this any bigger than that especially when there are actual problems that need attention.
