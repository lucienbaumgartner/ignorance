I think that's mostly the Media's role, or giving the benefit of the doubt, the politicians purposefully leak and play the media cycle to get people riled up or distracted by certain issues when it suits them.

Point is that I think the media (not just Murdoch) work hand in glove with the politicians to keep the population stupid and ignorant of what's really going in.
