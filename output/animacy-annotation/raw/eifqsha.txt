Except what you are saying is easily disproven by using those slow mo videos and images so we don't need to guess at this.

&gt;He has the right to the ground below him.

Sure. I agree. He stomped backwards. If he stomped straight down, he wouldn't've landed on the player. He had every right to the ground below him. He chose to kick backwards. We have video proof of that. The fact that you can't see the stomp backward live doesn't mean it didn't happen. That's the entire point of slow motion.

This was not a "hard play". He sees the guy coming to the ball low. He jumps. He goes knees up. He knows there's a guy sliding beneath him. And instead of continuing his forward momentum, he twists, stops his forward momentum, and stomps down hard and back. In real time, it looks like he intentionally stomps down. In slow mo, it looks like he intentionally stomps down. It's a fucking dirty play that could have been completely avoided.

As I said, at absolute best, you can argue that despite seeing the guy come in low and knowing he was going to have to avoid him, he simply lost track of the ground and the player and made a really awkward motion for no apparent reason. If he is so uncoordinated and unaware that this just kinda spontaneously happened, just cut him, because he doesn't belong at the professional level.
