&gt; develop something on the spot

Are you that lacking in imagination that you can't envision something better than tasers existing in the future? You know tasers didn't exist until the 70s, right? 

But then again, I'm sure someone was sitting around in the 60s like "WELL IF THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER HOW COME IT DOESNT EXIST YET LOL"

I feel like you're trying to get me on some technicality here but you're just revealing how narrow-minded and ignorant of like, basic capitalism you are.
