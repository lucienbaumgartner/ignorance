Depict me any way you like, but there’s nothing so pathetic as being so socially unaware and emotionally unintelligent so as to need Internet randos to pretend to be moral philosophers for you.

Kate thinks that the fact that I posted this was hilarious, and she and I joked over different comments here. For example, someone essentially called me Helen Lovejoy “won’t anyone please think of the children”?

Kate has referenced that so many times as a friendly jab, lol. I love the content. Thanks!
