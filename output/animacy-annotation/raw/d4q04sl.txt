Massively advanced interstellar civilization sets up an observation and research outpost on the moon of a planet to study a number of young developing intelligent species (classic fantasy species). Before beginning mass planet wide genetic and atmospheric experimentation they build a 1000 mile wide disk space station to house and resettle a control group to repopulate the world if the experiments fail. Experiments go horribly wrong, and the planet is corrupted just as a civil war breaks out among the interstellar species leaving those on the station isolated and unaware that the planet in the sky is their old home. 8 thousand years later the culture and technology of the civilizations on the station have completely adapted to life on an artificial flat world where magic is remnant technology, nano bots, and mutations from leaking radiation. 

I use it as my setting for DND campaigns and only 1 player has ever caught on to the hidden sci-fi twist.
