Hey mate do you mind me asking how much you think you took of MDMA, I have basically been in this same boat for about 1.5 years. I wouldn’t say my memory is anywhere near the same as it once was. I also hope for full recovery. Although it does appear stressing out about this fact may well impede recovery, but on the flip side I realise being in denial of the research and the impact that can occur from taking such a large amount is also naive and ignorant of reality. In my case I took MDMA two days in a row and consumed about 800mg, I don’t know the exact amount since I didn’t dish it out. I also trusted in those who have taken it before thinking they knew what they were doing as I had zero experience. Outside of this moment I had never taken any hardcore drugs, and to be honest I didn’t have any real intention of taking it prior to this event. I kind of gave in to life stress and the peer pressure of the moment.
