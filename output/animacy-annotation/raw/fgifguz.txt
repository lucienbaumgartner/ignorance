It's already been banned, they just forgot in a decade and stopped caring. The Chinese urge to eat or use anything that moves has advanced beyond making animals extinct to creating human plagues and threatening humanity. 

Even if all the cities are care of permanently(which they won't be), this is a country that has people so poor and ignorant that some of them throw coins into the engines of jets for good luck. Bats are everywhere, and free. All they have to do is find a cave(some of them live in caves which is actually decent and possibly better than a house in some cases), not sure if some of them share it with bats). You can literally nail a wooden box to the side of your house and bats will show up. We should probably just accept generational bat plagues as a part of life.
