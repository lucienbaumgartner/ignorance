What you just said is misguided and ignorant. That statement makes you just as horrible as the ones who caused the problems.   I have friends and family in uniform, fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters.  Wishing harm on them makes you part of the problem. Shame on you.
