&gt; Anyway, these people are public officials who spent quite a bit of money to fuck tweens. At the very least that shows they have terrible judgement. But thanks to the high level people involved, no heads rolled. And none will, obviously because their constituents are very politically unaware and uncultured.

Sounds like you give a shit about stuff. Either I am ignorant about the nature of humans, or you are less interesting than I thought previously.

&gt; It's true (some) people have the internet to go to. But what exactly would they search for if they feel things are fine? 'which billionaires are the most sexually perverse.'

They would need to start with a gut feel or intuition that they are being fucked and lied to. From there the search queries can vary.

&gt; Those sheep make up most of modern society and the choices are either to take moments to educate them, either kindly or forcefully, or in end up living in their idea of an ideal society.

&gt; to educate them

I am not that optimistic. Nature explains more things to me than nurture does, with the exception of maybe first 4-5 critical years of a child's life.

&gt; educate them forcefully

OMG, that woke me up. Something hell something good intentions. What do you have in mind? The potential for dystopia is vast. Ok, you are more interesting now.

&gt; or in end up living in their idea of an ideal society.

Or take up a spot at the very top of the food chain ... a sucker is born every minute.

I used to be an idealist before I became a cynic.
