To you it's *empty headed baloney*. 




And no. You did not point it out. What you did was take my very last statement and twist it to a narrative that fits your negative view points of whatever it is you **think** I do with salt and cleansing. 




Just because **slavery** and **salt** were in the same post does not mean they were put together in such a false manner.




Clearly you are misinformed and ignorant of my practice which is ok. You don't need to believe in such concepts - concepts that you somehow believe that I am scamming you into believing?




"Please purchase my books in salting the earth for 200$" sounds like a great line btw. Would be a funny read lol. 





I don't have to prove **nothing** to you 1st about my practices since you're not involved in my hypothetical wedding. Secondly... you have yet to point out where I say salting removes slavery? Lmao. 




Salting and cleansing for personal reasons don't need to be explained... or is that hard to grasp? I don't need to do it for a wedding on a plantation ðŸ¤£. 




Your last line tho... classy. The weird one is you. Sorry hun. I'll answer a question but if you want science refer to a flat earth guide for your answers ;)





Ps: a Google search for "salting doors and windows" will help you roll your eyes and mutter about 'it's not scientific evidence. Google search "cleansing house and home with sage" will have your eyes rolling harder so please be careful you don't hurt yourself. ðŸ’–
