Biden keeps saying that trump knew the virus was "very dangerous" and hid it.....

Covid19 isn't very dangerous at all, if you go by statistics. It's sad that people are so brainwashed and unaware, and think covid is ebola. Why is it so hard to understand that trump didn't want to start a panic?  The media and democrats already do that.
