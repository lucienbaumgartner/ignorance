This might be really stupid and ignorant of me, but don't the parents usually name the kid? I am aware that a lot of parrents are not suportive of theit trans kids, but if in a given case they are, wouldn't the ideal scenario for getting a new name just be: inform your parents that they messed up and have them give you a new one?

Once again, I'm not trying to offend anyone, I would just like to know how the funni trans ppl in my screen think about that
