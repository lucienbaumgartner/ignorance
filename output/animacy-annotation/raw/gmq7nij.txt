Keep people desperate and unaware of the worth of their labor. This all ties into keeping workers from discussing their salaries. The idea that should be taboo is ridiculous, there's no other way to figure out if the company is screwing you or your coworkers. 


being an employee in america is basically: keep your head down, don't rock the boat, and distance yourself from anyone who doesn't play the same game. Nobody wants to get fired and everyone has to make a paycheck.
