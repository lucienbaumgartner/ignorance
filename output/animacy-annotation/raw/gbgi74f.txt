I was in Middle school I believe and was really into MUDs at the time. You ever try and think up a fifth unique character to play as just to try out other classes? Man I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and slapped a bunch of keys and got close to my current name with a few oddities, I tweaked it a bit and ended up with Murazama, I've ran with it ever since. Whether gaming or not. Ended up losing my OG xbox account that was Murazama because someone managed to hack it; probably when I was young dumb and unaware of cyber security and being smort. So out of all my systems that's the only one that is different and that one's a name based on a play of words around a certain twat from Fable 2.

That twat being Lord Lucian, buddy said, "More like Lord Douchian" and since I needed a new GT that became it.
