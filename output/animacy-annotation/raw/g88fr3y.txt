&gt;  think one of the biggest problems is that people with education often "talk down" to people who don't. And, often times, that talking down is bred from ego or arrogance.

Oh, I could not possibly agree more. I can be a completely arrogant sob myself (though I often tend to more to people who I think honestly should know better).

But... while this is completely true, and we need to figure out how to address it, it's not a valid dismissal of education, or just the fact that 'shit's complex yo'.

Those 2 solutions have to go hand in hand, I'm 100% behind that.

Again, all this being said, this isn't new. I'm a nerd who grew up in the South, and I was considered 1 step up from being gay, and it wasn't a big step. They hated nerds down there, it was sport, and I left like many lgbt people did for a gentler atmosphere.

The anger against the intolerant and ignorant that leads to 'talking down', partly comes from this, it's a very vicious circle.
