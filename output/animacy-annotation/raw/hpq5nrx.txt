I'm not scared, and I'm not halting my life because my family has problems. They're all vaccinated and boosted as well, and I specifically quarantine myself after shows, just to be safe. 

That's not fear, that's just being smart and taking precautions. The fact that you're so offended over this shows how ignorant and stupid you really are, but that was obvious when you decided to use, "retarded" and "sheep" as an insult, you faux-woke shit head.
