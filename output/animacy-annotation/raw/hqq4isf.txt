Gotta agree with Cygni on this one. Now don't get me wrong it makes sense Atlus would say that anyone can enjoy Strikers because it'd be ignorant and stupid of them not to. However given how this franchise tends to treat the most updated version of Golden and the fact Royal is the game they have marketed in both merchandise releases as well as crossover material with SAO and Another Eden there's not really a doubt in my mind that Atlus considers Persona 5 Royal the "main" entry.

Even Smash Bros Ultimate made a point of using Joker's grappling hook which of course is exclusive to P5 Royal. IMO the statements regarding how Strikers was written was due to the timing of it's development, not the circumstances of it's release. Although I will admit Vanilla's ending is way more fitting for how Strikers picks things up.
