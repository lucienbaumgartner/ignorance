Quite a few sketchy proposals *have* been recognized as such and have not passed. Just look at Space Pussy... I don't think you can reasonably draw the conclusion that because 70% of proposals pass, the community must be too ignorant and optimistic to prevent a hostile takeover, it just means that &lt;30% proposals have been sketchy or potentially malicious. If that number goes up, then I imagine the acceptance rate will go down.
