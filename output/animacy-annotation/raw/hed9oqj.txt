A lot of people have no idea what they are doing and are just cruising along making it work. I have a feeling managers are one of those people.

Fast food and grocery job were both like this and it made no sense. They were just lazy and ignorant of the fact their inconveniencing and causing unnecessary stress for almost 50 people so their 1 job would be easier.

God forbid taking a day off either glad I got out of that haha
