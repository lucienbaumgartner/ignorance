It makes me cringe. I can understand context (ie- we are discussing an old medical text when that was the common term for any sort of learning disability or developmental delay) but in popular usage it seems only to be a way to insult someone and insinuate that those with some sort of neurological/developmental differences or conditions are unaware and therefore less than humans who cannot or should not be given autonomy over themselves.
