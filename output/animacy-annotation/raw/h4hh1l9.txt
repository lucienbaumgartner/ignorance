Race to the bottom - the rationale of 'Let's do as poorly by public healthcare as other provinces are - or worse.' is indeed ridiculous, and ignorant of the costs of replacement turnover, relocation and training, staffing shortages and OT, poorer health outcomes burdening an inexperienced system further, duplicate administration of private models costing money, the chance that replacement workers may just as well organize and demand better as well.  It won't save any money long-term, it will pull money and skilled, gainfully employed labour (doctors, nurses and support staff) out of the system and our economy, and will compromise public health - all so businesses/contractors can get their fingers deeper into the public pot.
