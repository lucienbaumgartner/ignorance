Everyone is correctly identifying the obvious satire and implications of ignorant people not listening to science but seems to ignore a major event in the film and it’s implications/allegories.

Everyone was ready to stop the comment and a mission was launched. The Jobs/Zuck/Musk/Bezos guy had full control over the President and got that shit stopped immediately. It was sustained by dumbasses but the power and decision was always organized through ungodly powerful capitalists. It wasn’t these droves of ignorant fucks driving the planets destruction but the billionaire at the top. 

Ik that’s a pretty trite take but it’s weird how most of folks take away is “we’re ignorant and stupid”. Like yes that’s true and a major issue but somehow everyone when discussing this movie seems to gloss over the situation where the planet was going to be saved but the greed of a select few made the decision for us.
