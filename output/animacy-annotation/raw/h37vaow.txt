I can't imagine being this politically naive and ignorant of history. The tea party was an astroturf campaign propped up by billionaires. They spent millions of dollars on their campaign and had up to 60 members join the caucus in the first year. The Squad is literally 6 members and relies entirely on the people to raise money.

Also, the tea party was fine killing everything they didn't like, but progressives want to deliver something to improve people's lives. I get that people like you are living a comfortable life and most of this stuff wouldn't affect you, but even modest improvements can benefit the poorest among us. So that's the predicament they are in. They don't the numbers alone to leverage what they want and they aren't just going to kill every bill that doesn't perfectly meet what they want, that's just political suicide and you gain nothing out of it.

So grow up, read some history, and stop listening to brain-dead podcasters who want to destroy the left for their own financial gain.
