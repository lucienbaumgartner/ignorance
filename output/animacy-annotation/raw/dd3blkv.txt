This episode really made me think. The twist at the end was so unexpected, when the to-be-dead guys asks Kenny how old the people in his porn were. 

Pedophiles have always been a grey area for me. On one hand they're helpless to their nature, you can't change how your body naturally responds to stimuli, but on the other hand ... they're kids. Kids that are helpless and weak and unaware and could one day fall prey to the consequences of this same natural response that's taken too far by some poor bastard. 

Brilliant show.
