Same. I have a million alarms and it helps but I still struggle to be on time with my adhd. If it was as easy as setting alarms it wouldn't be a problem. We have a neurological issue, we're not stupid and ignorant of things called clocks and alarms. 

I'll hear my alarm and that's great to remind me and pull me from distraction but it doesn't fix my impulsivity. It doesn't change the little voice inside me saying "just 5 more minutes and I'll get started...."

That all being said NTA. I gave a friend who started doing the same to me and I just thought she was a genius and was seriously impressed.
