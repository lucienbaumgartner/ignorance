 &gt;I will have dropped at least two of you on a good run

I've killed 6 with sleeper on a single invade, they were unaware and uncoordinated (had to retire sleeper and wash my hands cause i felt that dirty). 

My group and I stop what we're doing altogether until we spot the invader. It may cost us a kill, but sometimes we can kill them faster.
