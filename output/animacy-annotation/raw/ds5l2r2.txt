We despise it because he is giving any form of publicity to a game designed to cause real-world harm by exploiting flaws in human behavior to exploit the unaware and vulnerable into spending themselves into debt on a game. He has given attention of any kind to something that can cause real-world harm, and only hasn't because people stood up and said no. This game needs to be shunned because it can hurt people. Games aren't supposed to hurt people. The attention he gives allows predatory game companies to normalize this, and that is never okay.
