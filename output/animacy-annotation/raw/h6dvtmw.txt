They’re not trying to rewrite history at all, everyone in this sub is fucking stupid and ignorant of history. FranklinD Roosevelt introduced the minimum wage for this reason: “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.”

“By ‘business’ I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level — I mean the wages of decent living,” 
The fact big corporations have convinced idiots like you that full time workers should live below the minimum wage and essentially be modern slaves, is un-American and frankly stupid on you part. Anyone working a full time job should have a living wage and that’s a fact.
