You break up with your boyfriend so he can find someone that won’t go to such extraordinary lengths to gaslight him about cheating. Then you never enter into a monogamous relationship again until you grow up, and can communicate your expectations of a relationship maturely and honestly. Also, don’t enter into an open relationship until you are willing to be honest with your partner, communicate, and respect their boundaries and expectations of the relationship either. Your dumbass role playing of DID goes from ignorant and toxic to straight up deceitful and harmful if you can’t be honest and mature with your partners about what’s going on.
