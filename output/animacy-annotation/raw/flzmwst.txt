Notice the verbal cues the guy recording uses — just like real cops do. That’s why this cop was not only on his toes throughout the entire interaction but knocked off balance, rhetorically, a couple times. Taking advantage of those little gaps, with “Are you drunk?” “Do you have any drugs on you?” was genius on that guy’s part. Definitely blindsided the cop. 

Some important non-verbal cues to notice from the cop. When he wants to know who the guy is, he gestures his finger towards himself, sorts demanding some form of ID but without explicitly saying it. Had this person been an inexperienced, unaware, and nervous wreck of a person stopped on this street, this gesture might lead to the person handing the cop the ID. Clearly didn’t even work on this guy, so cop quickly puts his hands back in a defensive position. Then when he sees a cop buddy, quickly calls him over — a lonely cop is a scared and exposed cop and they know it.

Lots of interesting (and useful) tidbits to dissect from this interaction. Kudos to that guy.
