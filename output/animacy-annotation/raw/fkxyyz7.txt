I'm 67. My MIL and mother say that whenever confronted with an inconvenient to their world view.

Not all Boomers are unaware and delusional. I was in a doctoral program during RR administration. Had gotten my bachelors degree 10 years earlier.

The plan was made then to make education unaffordable. No one listened to me saying it was a plan to make an uneducated population. If I had gone straight through in my education, I may have thought like the oldsters in the post. But I saw it at its inception.

They just expected no one to actually go through with the drive to be educated. I think they expected the nonwealthy to just not go to college.

In the 60s, state education was free to residents of California. Dont tell me that at least community college should not be able to be free to a state's citizens.
