no - racism is a system where one race (whites) benefit from societal advantages based on the color of their skin. since black people cannot benefit from that system and in thousands of ways are subjugated at the hands of that system, racism against whites doesn’t make sense. 

black people can be prejudiced against white people. people aren’t necessarily taught the nuance, but it’s the same reason when a black comic tells jokes about white people it’s considered punching up as compared to the later comic off as racist. 

twitch putting the two words on even planes is ignorant and ahistorical.  never has a white person been lynched after being called the c word.
