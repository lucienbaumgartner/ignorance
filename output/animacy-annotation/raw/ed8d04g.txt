That assumes he was completely ignorant of and uninvolved with everything that happened with the transition team, any meetings of a questionable nature, any requests by Trump to cover his ass and/or obstruct/deflect, and clean of who knows what else is happening behind closed doors.

Given his position, I don't think there is any way to still be involved with this administration, at that level, for this amount of time, and be consider clean.  He is either a willing accomplice turning a blind eye, or so completely incompetent, inept, and ignorant that he shouldn't be allowed to hold any elected position. Or both.  Both is a possibility too.
