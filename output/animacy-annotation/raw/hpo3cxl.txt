No, I'd say you can be misinformed/confused and still transphobic. Like a lot of bigotry comes from ignorance. His statement was transphobic and ignorant and I think because of his confusion on the topic he probably has a lot of transphobic ideas that won't change until he educates himself on the subject. Is he a terrible person? I mean idk. And yeah there's a difference between him and the most hateful transphobic people out there. But hes still kinda transphobic
