You see my friend the Almighty had created us. Without him, creatures would not be existed on the face of the earth. So why must we be so ignorant and arrogant to admit our mistakes and ask forgiveness/repentance from him as we commit sins in our daily basis. 

And yes my friend he did not feel any suffering/pain/sins because he is God Almighty. Humans are incomparable with god as we have tons of limitations.
