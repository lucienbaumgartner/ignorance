You are telling me, in the same limited logic that you just demonstrated: Israeli and their sympathizers shouldn’t be complaining and be acting like victims when they started displacing people from their homes (for decades),treating them like second class citizens, or even preventing them from moving from own settlement to another to find a better life. They shouldn’t be surprised that they are getting international backlash for leveling schools, media organizations, hospitals etc. Israel’s genocidal behavior is ironic to say the least. I don’t know if you are a troll or just too stupid and unaware of the asymmetrical destruction that is happening. I don’t think most people who sympathize for Palestinian human rights are condoning what Hamas is doing. Violence will not solve this as history has shown us.
