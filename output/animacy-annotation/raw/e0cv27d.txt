I did not ow that about Bobbi Brown. I didn’t even know Kate Spade had sold Kate Spade™️ (which then resold for like $2.5 billion.) In case anyone was unaware and interested, Jo Malone started a NEW company after having sold Jo Malone™️, so now she’s doing Jo Loves™️, which is also carried at Sephora.

I like the scent White Rose &amp; Lemon Leaves, but the “fragrance gel” with a paintbrush is too gimmicky. And while the EDT is ok, it’s all more expensive than Jo Malone™️, which I thought was pricey already. Still, just last weekend I had to follow a woman back into a restaurant I was leaving because her perfume smelled so beautiful and it turned out to be JM Red Roses. (Which, as a rose-scent fanatic, I hadn’t actually liked all that much before.)
