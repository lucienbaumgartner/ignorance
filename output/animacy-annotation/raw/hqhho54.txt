That was what Slane Theocracy doing actually. It's not about conquering, it's about saving the humanity. They wanted to make Re Estize kingdom the savior of humanity, since they have very safe lands. Other human nations are fighting with non-human nations non-stop. Yes, including Slane Theocracy due to elf king.

Peace that should have helped the kingdom produce many great human savior, made it much worse. People became ignorant, higher ups became corrupted, ignorant and also arrogant. They even started to think magic is for cowards.

In the end, Slane Theocracy changed plans. They further weakened the kingdom by working with traitor nobles. The goal was making the Empire conquer Re Estize swiftly, and after that they would kinda rule the Empire from shadows. Jircniv followed a slower action, they could conquer the re estize twice by now. They cornered the kingdom from every direction while they was keep getting stronger. But then, Ainz came and you know the rest. 

The reason was simple, my man over there explained it perfectly. PDL didn't allow off-country operations with Zesshi. And the council state he is controlling would have borders with Slane Theocracy. Humans would want war and PDL would whoop their ass. A vassal state is same as this. Not to mention directly ruling shit would bother Slane Theocracy to no end while fighting Elven Kingdom.

Just like he said, there are many powerful beings. World domination is the job of players and true dragon lords. It's far too risky even for players lol.
