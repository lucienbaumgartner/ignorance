I think the worst ones are pictures of disabled people with caption “my name is xyz, today it is my birthday and no one has said happy birthday to me yet, would you please comment”. How can people not understand it is just a click bait, it’s beyond me. It infuriates me because somewhere that person is real and unaware of how their picture is being used for such a petty reason
