I think its disgusting and ignorant that the POTUS stated meat factories must remain open so Americans can have access to protein.

So so so dumb, backwards, and out of touch with reality.  Is he unaware of the growing vegan movement and/or the fact that you shouldn't risk workers lives only so they can take part in ending animals lives?  Get with the times POS.
