So you, a parent, are so immature and ignorant, that because you think it's ok for a nine-year-old to play call of duty, you think that people shouldn't swear because it's bad for your kid.

Hmm, well first off it's not necessarily a bad thing to have such a young person play a game like this(hell I started when I was 5), but if you're seriously gonna sit here and demand that no one cusses, because you're the one that's being a shitty parent and not making sure your kid knows not to cuss, is hilarious. So you think that it's everyone else's job to watch what they say, simply because you don't want to actually be a parent and would rather your kids sit in front of a TV and play video games all day? Wow man, great jobüëç. Grow a fucking pair, and parent your god damn kid. Don't raise a pussy like your parents did.
