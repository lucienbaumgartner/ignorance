I don’t follow him closely but know he’s been back for some time. He released an ‘apology’ before doing so that didn’t land well.

I think that he’s a comedian makes his work always feel a little off now. Comedy typically requires confidently calling out cultural taboos, but when he does that now, he just comes across smug, unrepentant and unaware of the serious harm he’s recently perpetrated. There’s a disconnect between the humbling we’d hope such a scandal would produce and his style of comedy.
