Most Republicans really aren't Nazis. It goes the other way too. Most Democrats aren't extreme either. The media just profits off turning people against each other in the worst ways and it seems like you're really falling for it. 

You're choosing to attack whole groups of people most of whom you haven't even met, which is an ignorant and rude action. But, despite you being rude, there must be something good about you. Because no one is really all good or bad.
