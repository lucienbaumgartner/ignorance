You argue because you want to get your point across. 

If you don't argue with someone, then most likely you didnt care about them. Same mentality as "Bahala ka diyan mag tatanga tanga sa sarili mo"

Of course you won't argue with strangers because you don't care for them. Parents? You don't want them in the dark SINCE you're fucked if they are ignorant and stupid.

Tldr; Arguing is not bad. It means you have a strong connection to them and whatever happens in the arguement the relation stays the same.
