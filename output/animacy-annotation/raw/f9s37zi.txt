&gt;but Trump is actually actively causing damage. Hillary hatred was largely manufactured.

There is plenty of reason to hate her, and none of it needs to be manufactured...

I will just put this here...

## 2016 Presidential election campaign

ðŸ“· Black  faces were conspicuously absent from Clinton rallies; among other  shocking revelations, the Pedosta emails flatly stated the Clinton  machine "conspires to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."[\[296\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-296) *Main article:* [*2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign*](https://www.conservapedia.com/2016_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign) *See also:* [*Presidential Election 2016*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Presidential_Election_2016)*,* [*Clinton donors in the Panama Papers*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Clinton_donors_in_the_Panama_Papers)*,* [*Hillary Clinton email scandal*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Clinton_email_scandal)*,* [*Spygate*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Spygate)*,* [*Ukrainian collusion*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Ukrainian_collusion)*,Â and* [*Bill and Hillary Clinton and racism*](https://www.conservapedia.com/Bill_and_Hillary_Clinton_and_racism), [*Clinton attacks on women*](https://www.conservapedia.com/United_States_presidential_election,_2016#Clinton_attacks_on_women) 

Clinton has held several public offices, and also ran for president in 2008 and 2016. In 2008 she lost to [Barack Obama](https://www.conservapedia.com/Barack_Obama), but she won the democratic nomination in a controversial and contested primary fight over [populist](https://www.conservapedia.com/Populist) [Bernie Sanders](https://www.conservapedia.com/Bernie_Sanders) during the [2016 Presidential Election](https://www.conservapedia.com/2016_Presidential_Election). Although Clinton won the popular vote 65,853,516 (46.1%) to 62,984,825 (48.2%), Trump won the [electoral college](https://www.conservapedia.com/Electoral_college) vote, 306 to 232, with the incomplete vote count reported.[\[297\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-297) Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology testified before Congress that [Google](https://www.conservapedia.com/Google) bias and meddling had shifted "between 2.6 million and up to 10.4 million votes" to Hillary Clinton.[\[298\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-298) 

### Rigged nomination

The Democrat Iowa Caucus was very chaotic, poorly run, and whose results were very questionable.[\[299\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-299)[\[300\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-300)[\[301\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-301) It was reported that the results of 90 precincts, about 5 percent of the vote, went missing.[\[302\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-302) 

The Democrat primary was rigged against Bernie Sanders and in  favor of Hillary Clinton, and the party was shown to be helping Clinton  behind the scenes.[\[303\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-303)[\[304\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-304)  In addition, the Democrat primary has "superdelegates", who are made up  of party leaders and can vote for whomever they want regardless of what  the primary voters want.[\[305\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-305) Even the leftist website [Salon Media Group](https://www.conservapedia.com/Salon_Media_Group) believed the primary was rigged.[\[306\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-306) 

Donna Brazile, the interim DNC Chair, shared Democrat primary  town hall questions to the Clinton campaign in order to help her win the  primary.[\[307\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-307)[\[308\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-308) She continued to deny this fact through February 2017[\[309\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-309) and blamed [Russia](https://www.conservapedia.com/Russia) for the ordeal.[\[310\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-310)

Also lets not forget how she straight up lied to congress and got caught MULTIPLE times, and never once was punished for it...
