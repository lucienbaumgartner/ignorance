&gt;Nah, I just understand how malleable children’s minds are.

Then you understand that this does nothing to the kid long-term. So why are you acting like this is going to damage the kid long term? 

&gt;Does this kid look happy in the video?

No. Do you always ask stupid questions?

The reason that the video is amusing is because the kid's experiencing **short-lived, non-harmful** distress over a silly prank. *If* the parents continued this for long periods or upped this to something more extreme my opinion would change, but what we are seeing doesn't hurt the kid in any meaningful way. I really wish school systems had some form of critical thinking courses required in their curriculum so we didn't have to deal with dipshits like you whose thought process goes toe-deep into a topic.

&gt;Just because you’re blissfully unaware and completely uneducated on the topic doesn’t mean everyone that is, is overreacting.

Bud choosing to be outraged about harmless shit doesn't make you special. It makes you a twat. Go apply all those pent up emotions to a productive cause. You'll feel better and have actually accomplished something worth mentioning
