Guy never mentioned Gaza specifically so you can take that strawman away immediately for starters.

Secondly, any occupation by a colonising force should rightfully be seen as a negative thing that belongs in the history books of Western colonisation. Why is 45% of the West Bank occupied? Settlements only currently happen in Area C, at least supposedly, but throughout recent enough history were far more widespread.

Thirdly, the absolute irony of a Jewish state (if Israel wants to use the fact its a Jewish state to decry any criticism as Anti-Semitic, then we shall call it a Jewish state) treating a minority as second class citizens (because Palestinians absolutely are treated as such) should be seen as incredibly sad and ignorant of their own history.

Walk in their shoes a little and see why they mightn't be so fond of Israel.
