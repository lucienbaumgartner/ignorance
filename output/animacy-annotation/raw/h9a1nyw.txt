See this is a tricky thing to talk about, race/religion in general I mean. You're bound to get negative comments from people that are intolerant and ignorant of other people's cultures despite them also being humans. Then you're going to get comments from people who are accepting of all humans regardless of their beliefs or cultures. Personally I don't have anything negative to say about Muslims because they have their own beliefs and they live their own lives how they want to, even though it's not what I believe in. I think every religion is valid and certain elements from every religion is worth doing research on and learning more about them. Muslims have a bad reputation because of intolerant people and it's wrong to treat them or think of them differently just because they don't believe in the same thing you do, it's ruining the coexistence we need to keep the human race alive and it's ruining the idea that every person is free to be themselves
