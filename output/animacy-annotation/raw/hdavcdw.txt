This is unacceptable.
It’s bad, it’s inefficient and counterproductive, it has been for decades and will continue to be shit indefinitely until we change it.

Make some fucking sacrifices. If we have to shut the entire system down for a few years then so be it. What, we’re just gonna stay on this mentality until there’s some catalyst? A war? Is that what it will take to fix the goddamn system? Thousands of bodies? Is that what is necessary? No.


I will no longer accept this mediocrity. And to think no one fucking bat an eye when that dumbass decided to add k-12 to our school system like it will change shit. All he did was add two more years of the same goddamn thing.

Everybody wants change but everyone’s too lazy and ignorant that they just dismiss it as “it’s too much of a hassle to change” so shit never gets fixed.

I’m sick of it. I’m sick of THIS. We could’ve been a thriving culture but nooooo everyone had to be fucking spineless. I’m out.

/end rant.
