When it comes to how "difficult" a particular AT-style is, I think a persons awareness/unawareness of their issues plays a major role in how "toxic" they become. 

I have dated and have friends who I suspect to be AP/leaning secure, and they are self-aware and don't tend to personalize things. If they do, I think I have encountered plenty AP's who have good communication skills, so that it is easier to understand what they need from me at such a moment to reassure them or clarify something. So long someone practices awareness, there is really little problem. 

But I have also dated people who exhibit all the AP-traits, but who are wildly ignorant and unaware of their own issues, and *those* people are the most entitled, petty, dramatic and violent people I met in my life. The AP-traits then turn oppressive, micro-managing, entitled, mean, critical, never satisfied, childish tantrums. I have been punched and hit by AP's, cant say I ever had to worry about my physical wellbeing with an avoidant.
