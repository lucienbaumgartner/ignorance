No. Those theories came from people who were bullied and implementing it is the bullied people's way of becoming bullies. 

I think what happened was a horrible thing,  but becoming a bully to own the bullies (who are now mostly gone) is counterproductive and ignorant of the true cause of suffering. 

We should be lifting each other up,  not looking to put others down. All CRT and wokeness are doing its perpetuating the evils of the past and making new monsters.
