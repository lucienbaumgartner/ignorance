That's fine but that statement makes no sense when that's exactly what the ending was with white only cast. Nobody complained about race so whatever he said logically made no sense. He implied we're not happy with the ending because white people didn't ride into the sunset, but that's kinda what Arya and Jon did. 



I'm not even white and that statement pissed me off because he jammed race into something that wasn't even a problem to begin with. It's not like colored people had the fucking happy ending, they were all white already so what the fuck is he talking about?


From my point of view he just said random nonsense that he thought made him sound woke, but he came off as ignorant and stupid.
