Nothing would happen. Usually the people struggling in America or at least competent struggling people understand hospitals are mandated to treat you no matter what then they send you a bill to whatever address you have on file if you even have one. 

The people crying and complaining about Healthcare today are ignorant and stupid people with all the advanced options available to them.
