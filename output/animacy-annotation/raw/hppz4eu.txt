A lot of people think it’s just about the deaths and infections. But it’s more than that. Due to it’s highly contagious nature, COVID is crippling healthcare. ‘Standard’ intensive care has to make space for COVID patients. This means people who need heart surgery and other intense operations might risk dying because they’re not getting the help they need. And besides that people do die from COVID. Now imagine someone not getting vaccinated, not wearing a mask, and not giving a frick about COVID or any of the regulations. And they end up in the ICU taking the place of a heart patient, for about three weeks. Whereas a heart patient might need less. And that could be prevented by simply following regulations. But “oH nOeS mY fReEdoMs!” If you think COVID regulations are an assault on your freedom you have no idea what freedom really is. And you’re insulting the ones that actually fought for freedom.
Do you think people in WW2 fought for freedom just so some assholes could be like “Nah fuck the rest I have the freedom to not give a fuck about the other people I engage in a society with.”

I understand the fear of taking a vaccine, the doubts, and some people aren’t able to take vaccinations due to health issues or what not. But some people are just plain ignorant and oblivious to what is happening. 

If no one cared about the COVID regulations, we’d be in a lot of trouble. So yes for the people who do their best to help their society as best it can, good job. It’s not easy, just like a lot of things in life.
