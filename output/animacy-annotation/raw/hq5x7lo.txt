There are almost 7 billion people on this planet, and most of them shouldn’t have been born to begin with. We live in a society that only works through cooperation and empathy. Whoever wants to be a selfish, ignorant, and anti-social prick can get bent in my opinion. This is not a selfish or evil thought. This is how progress works. You don’t change shit. You shovel it away.
