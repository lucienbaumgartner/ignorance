I responded to this before reading the other.

Did I make an assumption? Sure did.

Was it wrong? Depends, Jews can be super white and I didn't claim Christian. Further, having Mexican heritage doesn't preclude being white any more than 'I'm 1/64th Cherokee'.

Is it possible a super dark skin Hispanic Jew would be completely oblivious why women would be off put by self identifying on the right? Yeah, it completely strains credulity but would really only support being ignorant and oblivious. However, I would sooner put money on op being "functionally white" or lying than being that dense... But who knows, 202X been fucking crazy so far.
