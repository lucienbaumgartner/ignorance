Typically any place that calls itself a "Spa. Here's why

Ok, you don't want to get a massage where handjobs are going on, totally get that. So let's scratch those off the list.

But, that doesn't mean the other places are good either. Often times the other places that charge say 200 baht (6 dollars) for a 1 hour foot massage and 400 baht for oil are just really low quality. 90% of the time the masseuses (if it's a woman) will practically rip you off and waste your time by just using the lowest/laziest form of massage. They basically just swirl their hands around you for an hour, exerting no pressure. In Thailand, working hard = only if you *have* to and these people are low paid anyway so why would they want to end up with sore hands from giving a real massage all day? 

Most of the legit shops are bad and staffed with just lazy people who will swirl their hands on you for an hour. And they're usually very noisy (the workers often yelling inside), loud tourists walking in (had an Indian snoring, after his massage he just slams his butt right next to the foot massage chair I'm in and proceeds to loudly chat with his friends for 20 minutes, right next to me). Plus more than 50% of the time, the masseuse will chat with the girl next to her the whole time, completely distracted and unaware that she is giving a massage. **Go to a Spa instead,** it's a massage shop but without the bullshit. Quiet, clean rooms, no loud/cheap tourists, no masseuses yelling, and most important, they actually put a normal amount of attention and effort. Prices are 2x as much though, but you get what you pay for.
