If you both enjoy it, then who cares? My husband is the gentlest soul in the world. I am a confident, assertive woman. We have an egalitarian marriage.

And because we have talked at length about our desires and feelings and boundaries, he knows that if he catches me unaware and bent over and smacks the CRAP out of my ass that I LOVEEEE it and turn into a giggling crush who wants to jump his bones.

If I asked "Is it an okay relationship if my husband sometimes hits me" people would be like "Jesus fuck no!"

Context and consent. If everything is done with fleshed out boundaries and consent that can be revoked, then fuckin go wild. Hate sex as a "we hate each other" is a no. Hate sex where "hate" is a role you play and you both love it? Full yes.

Context and consent.
