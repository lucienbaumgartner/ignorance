Oh, don’t worry, these people are going to pay.  While it may seem like most people are behind this animalistic behavior here on Reddit, the overwhelming majority of the country is fucking sick and tired of watching this pieces of shit try to destroy everything that they had no part in building.  

You’d think it was Christmas Day with how excited and giddy all these fucking Reddit retards are.  This is what they have wanted for years, but they are so delusional and ignorant that they believe they will “win”.  They are in for a rude awakening.  People (actual people , not the riot promoting animal type) aren’t going to have any problems with the impending response that is about to start going down any day now.  They did this to themselves, and will have no one to blame when repercussions start landing.
