Hahaha, right.. That's what I figured. 

I can be trollish, sure. There are much worse trolls out there you may encounter when putting this stuff on the internet.  

This sub says we "trolls" are just stupid, and unaware and you guys just love seeing us stumble over here. That we walk into the lions den wearing meat. 

Lol well, I've walked in and engaged and not one lion has stopped me.

You're just the second person to get too butt hurt to continue to have a real conversation. The first being the mod of this sub when he also just couldn't handle having it shoved back at him. 

You'll probably see me around, sporting my meat vest around.
