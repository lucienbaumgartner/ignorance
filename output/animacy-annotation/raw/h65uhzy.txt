&gt; I don't think that someone in a different area of the world eating a   
dog is necessarily more unethical than someone eating what I would   
consider livestock

This is similar to the view that vegans might have, that killing a dog is the same as killing a cow; as vegans would see both acts as immoral as they violate the animal's right to life, like how murdering a human violates their right to life. 

If I slit you while walking down the street during the early morning, would you consider that to be a good death? You'd still be sleepy and unaware, and the death itself would be pretty quick. Or would you find it to be a disrespectful thing to do as I've violated your right to life. If you don't think that's respectful and a good death, then why would you think it's a "good death" for an animal? 

For a more accurate analogy to these chickens, let's say you were dying and sick in the hospital and unaware of your surroundings. Would you rather be stabbed in the throat, or put down through medicine similar to how pet animals are?

You do seem to have a similar mindset to vegans, like with the above example and with how you can see animals as beings who suffer; but you also have some cognitive dissonance, as you do still support the suffering of animals by consuming animal products. So if you really do care about the suffering of these animals, then at the very least don't financially support breading more of them into the world.
