NTA. Have you ever heard of a psychological ploy for narcissists of a scapegoat and a golden child? It seems like a textbook case for you, and I would suggest you read everything you can about being the child of narcissists. You, sadly, seem to be the scapegoat. That was my role, too.

You need to get used to the idea that no one in your family will ever take your side. That doesn't mean you aren't behaving appropriately. You need to stop thinking your family as an excellent gauge of appropriate behavior. That is abundantly clear. 

The things you describe, especially the birthday stuff, about how you were always told that you and your needs were less than your sister are textbook narcissist manipulation. Don't get mad. It isn't personal. Just, your parents are broken and unaware of how bizarre their thinking is. Normal people would never consider half the crap you brought up here, let alone the stuff you're too scared to say.

The answer to your parents is, "no." That's all. You don't owe them an explanation because you are an adult and it is your money. The fact that they will make an effort to make their "child" feel bad to get what they want just says a great deal about their crazy, but nothing about you.

I would suggest you really take some time to read about others like you. I think it will be an eye opening experience to hear stories from others that sound so eerily like your own.

You are a good person. You deserve to be happy and to focus on your own needs. I felt the need to say that because I'm not so sure you believe it.

Good luck and safe journey. I hope you find the certainty that you need.
