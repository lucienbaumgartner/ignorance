Lol what? This post has nothing to do with doctors and nurses - it’s paramedics and FF workers. 

Also, explain why you consider “doctors and nurses” (I’m assuming that you mean healthcare workers as a whole) leeches. How much money do you think these people take home? 

It’s not the providers you should be angry with, it’s the healthcare system. The providers chose their careers based on what they wanted to do - help people. I’m a 911 EMT, you think I wanted to do this job for the benefits? Please. I want to help people and make them feel better. Unfortunately my attitude gets taken advantage of and my employer uses my compassion as a tool to overwork me.

Honestly, you seem quite ignorant and divisive for no reason.
