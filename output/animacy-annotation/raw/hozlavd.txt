If people start trying to whitewash the history and claiming the Nazi’s were just trying to secure rights for their country, and start to plaster nazi flags over everything, and send their kids to school in swastikas, and just call it “pride”, then maybe.  The confederate battle flag has ZERO place outside of history books and museums, but it’s littered upon the shoulders, cars, houses and everywhere else imaginable in the south.  It’s gross, racist and ignorant of them.  The confederacy doesn’t deserve to be remembered in any sort of good light, but plenty of “Americans” revere them, and cry that the south will rise again.
