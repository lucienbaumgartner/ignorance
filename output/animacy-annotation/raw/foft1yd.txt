Do we need God to determine the worth of a Man? Do we need God to determine the worth of an animal? Did the pagans need God to determine the worth of their fathers and mothers, their sisters and brothers, their wives and children over the deer they hunt and the wolves they fear? Were the ancient Israelites so blind and ignorant that they begged God to step down from His Throne to help them understand the worth of a Man? No, they did not. We need God to help determine what is ultimately right and what is ultimately wrong, but for determining the worth of a Man and an animal, then all we need is our God-given reason and our God-given brain to come to conclusions, not a God-given Revelation.
