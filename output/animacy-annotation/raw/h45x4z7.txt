This analogy starts to break down after so much speculation, but to go on with it:


&gt;the person didn't consent to 'donating the kidney'


Provided rape isn't involved, they very much consented to the possibility of 'donating their kidney.'



And, even if they did not consent, does that mean that they can kill the person who their kidney was given to, even if the said recipient was innocent and unaware of its origin?
