Yeah if you were in the same position you’d see yourself surrounded by masses of confused unfocused people who need to eat, can do work but have no plan and direction. You can try to educate them about how the world works, and even offer suggestions, but then guess what - you take the risk for failure. Helping is a stupid liability. 
You’re damned if you do for compassion and you’re damned if you don’t for exploitation. 
Personal agency is unfortunately something you can’t outsource. Doesn’t stop the ignorant and envious from hating.
