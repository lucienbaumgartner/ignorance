If you want to redeem a society in which something horrific is happening, you have to show that the society is actively fighting against it. You don't say "But they don't do that horrific thing often!" you say "Look heres a protest and court case etc". If the prevailing culture is unaware and inactive in fighting against a horrific practice then the culture can be assumed to be complicit and condemmed until they become aware and active in fighting against the horrific practice.

You are just as complicit in passing poor judgement on entire societys when you make hand-wavey excuses over numbers and prevalence of practices.
