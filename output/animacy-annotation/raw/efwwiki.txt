Rachel Maddow had a copy of notes on the speech. The speech writer actually had to write out chemotherapy with a k so that he wouldn’t mispronounce it! They were fearful that he’d pronounce the ch digraph the way you would the word cheese or church. How can someone be so stupid and ignorant that they don’t recognize the word? Every time I think he can’t be any dumber, he goes and proves me wrong.
