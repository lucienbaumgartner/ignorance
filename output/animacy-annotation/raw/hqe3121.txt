Here here. School was a nightmare. My family was ignorant and regularly homophobic. Not a fun childhood. Started taking medicine and going to therapy. It made a huge difference in helping my self esteem. Surrounding myself with supportive friends made a difference for me also. Hope you can find a good path to wellness. It may not seem easy but it is doable.
