Doomers haven't been paying attention to QLD's Premier painting a grim picture for North Queensland.  Tbh, most of them probably have office jobs and with that, are urban and unaware of the country beyond their city.  Australia's economy has a long tradition of being propped up by a few highly lucrative industries.  So we have times of glut and then it all falls apart the moment something has a big, negative impact on that industry. Case in point being wool. One bad drought,, and suddenly there's no money to be made in wool. Tourism is another.  Usually it's a cyclone that puts resorts out of business, but other regions offer attraction to tourists.  Covid has taken that off the table and I think a lot of operators thought fed money would tide them over until the international borders opened again.  Not much encouragement to pivot to domestic tourism. For one they'd need to rethink prices, given holidaying domestically was as expensive holidaying abroad.
