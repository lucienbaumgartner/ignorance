I feel somewhat conflicted. Prior to the Happy Fun Ball expedition everyone was ranting about how the M9 need a win. This is because of their failure to prevent Obann from succeeding again. With the reveal of Tharizidun, I feel this just amplified all those previous failures. By having Allura reveal Tharizidun, the M9 are even more pressured to continue blindly pursuing Obann. Also I am curious if Obann himself is even aware that it’s Tharizidun he is worshipping. I think he is probably unaware and honesty believes in the Angel of Irons. Possibly it’s the same with Vence.
