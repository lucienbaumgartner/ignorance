Oh you want me to believe in Sharia now? No thanks. I'm not going to change MY and MY ancestor's culture (which is better btw) in MY land to accommodate for Sharia. And you seem to think brown people are stupid and ignorant. That is very racist of you actually. I don't think they're stupid. I just don't like Sharia. 

So it's very simple. If you want to migrate, learn to appreciate the host country and SHOW RESPECT. Leave your backward ideas where you came. Because clearly, if your culture was superior, you wouldn't need to migrate in the first place.
