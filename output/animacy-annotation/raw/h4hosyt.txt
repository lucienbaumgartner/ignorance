I suppose a 'kinder' way to convey the same thing would be asking in return 'are you my mother?' / 'since when did you become my mother?' Or the less-gendered "since when are you my doctor?"

I think with closer people to you, you have to give them a bit of leeway in that they may truly be caring and unaware of how infantilizing the question is, especially if they are doing it jokingly once a week, but so is everyone else so it's a daily thing for you and any humour in it has been drained. For less closer people, it's simply not their business. 

Oh, another good option: "thanks I did remember. Did you remember to change your underwear this morning?" Not too crude but gets the invasiveness of the question across
