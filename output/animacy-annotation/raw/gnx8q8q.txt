Talking about the insignificance of the person being banned but self aggrandizing by believing that r/Sino is going cross that persons mind and "eat at them" everyday. Golden example of delusions of grandeur. How is it even possible to be this deranged and unaware of your own craving to assert any amount of power over other people, however infinitesimal, and to be so heinous while doing it. 

The sad thing is all these reddit mods that are like this have their own political beliefs and probably with total dissonance think that if they were politicians and in positions of power in the world and could implement their political ideology, whatever it may be, left or right, that everything would be great and that they wouldn't become corrupted by power. When in reality giving them as little power as being able to ban people from a forum on the interwebs and all the sudden they become some of the most malignant and vicious embodiments of human beings. Quite easy it is to see how easily ordinary people could be turned into monsters during the second world war and during the great famines of Ukraine and China.
