&gt;Israeli population has the highest vaccination rate

They actually don't. They only have a vax rate of 62% of the population. Nowhere near the threshold for herd immunity. 

To put that into perspective, Canada is at 71% fully vaccinated. 

Israel's 4th wave is being fueled but unvaccinated people. Roughly 70% of all current and serious cases of Covid are those who are unvaxxed. 

This is the same straight across the board IN EVERY FUCKING COUNTRY, STATE, REGION, PROVINCE in the world. 

&gt;Management is telling people at my workplace they will be fined and held accountable, because they don't want to do their jobs and check them. Many people working in the restaurant industry are young people, who are naive and unaware of their rights. Restaurants are getting away with intimidating the staff, by telling them they will be held responsible. 

I mean...to be fair, the restaurant gets fined/closed if the employees don't do their jobs. Do you think an employee should be fired/fined for selling booze to underage people? Its kind of the same thing. 

&gt;The vaccine passport is only hurting the economy and increasing homelessness.

Pretty sure that is not accurate. 

&gt;The government and their idea of a vaccine passport are like parents trying to punish rebellious teenagers, but in turn, itâ€™s causing them to rebel even more because they are being ostracized from society now.

Good. 

If you don't want to be a server, lots of other places are hiring. Safeway, Ikea, Michaels, Winners, Staples, etc...don't act like its serving food or homelessness for you.
