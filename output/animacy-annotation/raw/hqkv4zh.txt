&gt;Everyone completely ignores China

We must walk in different circles... All I hear is China being brought up.

I guess you are saying what JP meant was 'we don't know what to do \[when it comes to China\]. 

That seems like a stretch but even in that case, I think we do know what to do with China (and with the international community generally): We should stand up straight and lead by example. Get our house in order and then criticize the world.

&gt;The technology is also not there to replace fossil fuels

This kind of binary thinking (100% replace or 0% replace) is ignorant and super old at this point. Nobody serious is arguing for 100% replacement of fossil fuels in all sectors.

So you are right, the technology is not there to replace fossil fuels completely, but nobody is saying otherwise. The technology is obviously there to replace fossil fuels somewhat, which is what people are actually advocating for.

&gt;The answer to climate issues is new clean power 

That's a big part of it. Of course it isn't the whole solution.

&gt;but that isn't feasible with what we have now.

What isn't feasible? I was in Palm Springs last week and saw shitloads more wind power built in the last few years had just gone up. What's not feasible about that?

&gt;such a small dent its almost meaningless.

If you have a small tax (right now the US has a carbon price of zero) you will see a small reduction, obviously. Nobody disagrees with that.
