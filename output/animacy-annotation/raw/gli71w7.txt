So, my response comes from a place of having been through all the games, a few times (ergo, ample spoilers!!!)...

I believe that when Solas says “our people,” whether or not he actually IS a hypocrite, he does not see his usage of the phrase as hypocritical. This is because, when elves refer to “our people,” they are referencing the Dalish, whereas, when Solas refers to “our people,” he speaks of the Elvhen (spelling?)- the race of elves as they once used to be, whose differences to modern elves are so vast that he considers them to be another race entirely. In his mind, the modern Dalish are but a tainted shadow of what they once were, utterly broken and ignorant of what they used to be. Thus he refuses to be allied with modern elves, but has no problem collectively referring to himself as part of the Elvhen. Why he does not simply work to help them rediscover who they once were is another matter open for debate (and frustrates the crap outta me), but I suspect it has to do with his wounded pride at being hurt by so many elves in the past (recall the ugliness of the past war and “old gods” that led to the formation of the Fade in the first place). So- “they hurt me, screw them” is his present elvish mantra. 

As for the uses of Da’Len/Hahren, regardless of what the elves believe or think they know- Solas really is REALLY OLD. LOL So, yes, technically the terms fit, even if he isn’t much ‘respectable,’ imo, his age still earns him the right to the respectful title. (It’s linguistics- you see it in other languages as well.)

Ultimately, believe it or not, some people are just prideful and haughty by nature, prizing themselves above all others. Solas, in my mind, is one such person. Such individuals will always believe their perspective to be justified in some way or another, and they never are.
