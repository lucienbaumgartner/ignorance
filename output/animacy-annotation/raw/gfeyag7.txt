Being called a bitch by men with guns is a threat. Just because you are unaware and oblivious of your white, cis, male privilege doesn't mean other people share the rarefied air you inhabit. 

You think delis don't get robbed? You think deli owners aren't themselves threatened? You think they aren't \*sometimes\* forced to compromise in order to keep the peace? I've seen dudes posted up, chilling, and having a good time. I've seen dudes on a corner dealing. It feels different. Now, I don't know which corner she is talking about. It's possible this is an exaggeration. At the same time, people like you dismissing the words of women is extremely common and usually leads to violence against women.   
Women get harassed, assaulted, and raped. The Kavanaughs of the world think this is 'boys being boys.' Miss me with that bullshit.
