Haiti's GDP per capita has increased from $70 in the 60s to $1200 in 2020.  The US buys  81% of Haiti's exports and only 39% of it's imports.  We also give them half a billion per year now, and $13 billion after the last earthquake.  Their GDP is $14b.    
The argument that the Haiti is worse off because of the US is laughable and ignorant of history.
