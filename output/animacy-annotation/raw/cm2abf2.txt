Imagine a guy that goes around telling everyone that they are the best, maybe he is, maybe he isn't - that isn't all that important socially speaking. In any case he's outwardly arrogant and unaware that normal reactions to this behaviour are not willing friendship and admiration of his professed accomplishments but pity in that he must belittle or ignore the value of all others accomplishments to keep his sense of authority. 

Since his personality is not based on mutual respect his reputation becomes tainted and the target for much disrespect.
