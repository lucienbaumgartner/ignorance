So yes I came across the term online - I recognised others with hair similar to mine which was extremely damaged by relaxing and bleach who took the extreme step of all but shaving their head. Many of the women who share my hair type are black or Latina - but my main focus has always been the fact that I recognise my hair. It’s hard for me to accept that I’m culturally unaware and disrespectful for following in the process and using the terminology, just because it was never clear that it was an exclusive club. I also don’t know how to avoid this same issue in future unless I only ever use terms used by white influencers? Is that the answer? 

Look I’m fine with the fact you don’t want to hear it. Not entirely sure why I’m replying given how clearly you’ve stated it. I assume you’ve been through a big chop too? 

As I’ve said previously I just find it hard to know where the line is - I don’t find it as clear as you seem to. I practically shaved my head, I’ve always referred to it as the big chop, and until today I’d never even questioned the idea that the concept of the big chop being a cultural appropriation candidate.
