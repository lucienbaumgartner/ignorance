Way to Lord over me and my situation you are completely  missing the point. 

I'm just saying, in my house, if there's a pile of cash laying on the counter, it's there for whoever needs it and I am not so insecure and unaware that my gf would use it for coffee. 

I would also not ask her to ask permission to use it, as it is clearly laying out in the open. 

I trust her to be herself and do what she wants without needing my consent to use money I obviously don't care enough about to put away.
