ESH but I don’t think this is a healthy friendship.

You are a bit of an asshole for expecting your friend to know you have an ED without saying so. Not everyone knows the signs and symptoms. I understand it was emotionally difficult to share even the vague info you did, but you can’t expect him to know you have disordered eating if you don’t tell him specifically. Also YOU ASKED HIM TO HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT. Of course he felt justified commenting on your weight loss. That was a mess up on your part, and you need to take responsibility for the fact that you asked him to enable your eating disorder.

Your friend is an asshole for advocating for unhealthy weight loss options and for telling you that you don’t look like you have an eating disorder. That was rude and ignorant of him.
