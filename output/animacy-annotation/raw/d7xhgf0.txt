I have to say that saying things like:

&gt; This has led to a sort of natural selection, among our subreddit, among our community. Those who truly cared, who analyzed gameplay, who put money into the game, who had money to buy Overwatch when that point finally came as the differences were so slim, were all pushed away. And in their place, thanks to Hi-Rez Studios, new, unaware, and clearly younger and less mature people took their place.

Just makes me lose interest in the rest of the opinion. Sure you and your friends were passionate for previous versions of the game, the game changed now. That doesn't mean that there won't be new people for that.

In fact, I would argue that the community is great hands right now.

I understand the flipside point of view, but I don't feel in anyway sorry. Games change during development, people should count on that.
