Since nobody really answered you seriously:

It probably will be negatively affected AT FIRST, since people will be selling their shares. These are the people that need to go first in the sense that they're paper-handed and unaware of the MOASS. This liquidation is do to everyone needing cash. 

However, once people need cash certain entities who have loaned out GME shares might look at HFs thinking "Will this dude have enough money? No? I need him to return my share before he has no money to return it."

Or

"I need money. I need to sell my GME shares. Recall my share/return it please so I can sell it myself."
