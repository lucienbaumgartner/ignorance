Intelligence agencies and bankers/ngos project

That is all they do

They form plans to manipulate others, then they wildly accuse others of doing what they are doing

Back in 2012 CIA et all used malicious "grassroots whistleblowing" to get the Syrian files going and undermine Russia/Syria while promoting revolution

Imagine how in Lord of the rings, the villain Sauron is fooled into believing that Aragorn took the ring for his own power (because Sauron is selfish and power obsessed and assumes that his adversaries will be as well), and this is why Sauron is completely distracted and unaware that Frodo is sneaking in to Mordor to destroy the ring

Sauron never would have destroyed the ring because, being the evil villain, he's incapable of resisting the urge to power and allure to corruption, and so this controls his entire strategy of thought 

The western intelligence agencies, bankers, and ngos are much like the mythical villain Sauron in this respect (though I must add I find Sauron more likable), they are largely incapable of believing that anyone anywhere would ever act for idealistic or selfless reasons and they see such a thing as a pure anomaly 

Similarly many of the Soros linked ngos have been attacking Russia for years now, then the "dcleaks" group releases Soros org docs and that somehow gets conflated and combined with the whole "FSB sleeper agent Seth Rich" thing 

More recently, look into the reports against Huawei and their Chinese 5g

Western intelligence agencies whine that the "yellow Nazis" are going to spy on us if we use their 5g tech

But the intelligence agencies don't disclose that they ALREADY spy on all of us (see the "five eyes" group) and the real issue is that they can't put a backdoor in a foreign run infrastructure like Huawei

Obviously these groups don't want to disclose the fact that they spy on us, nor do they want to draw attention to the fact Chinese infrastructure and industry is now outcompeting us massively in tech (because of our incompetent worthless neo-commissar technocrats) so they instead create a lie about the Chinese 

There is absolutely 100% nothing that WikiLeaks could do to get these idiots to STFU anymore than they would drop the Chinese 5g propaganda 

I repeat: There is absolutely 100% nothing that WikiLeaks could do to get these idiots to STFU anymore than they would drop the Chinese 5g propaganda 

At this point I don't think anyone with half a brain can actually believe any of the trash they spew out, and so I don't see the value in continuing to engage and give oxygen to this dumb topic, I think a more productive use of time is trolling with the issue to get these MSM idiots to attack each other as Russian spies, as well az amping up the attacks on these media/culture-war groups associated with the media
