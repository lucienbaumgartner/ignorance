Imagine being so judgemental and ignorant that you have to make an entire subreddit (covidiots) to get together to talk shit and belittle others that don't share the same viewpoint as you. It's not surprising that someone has nothing better to do than come on reddit and dv posts so they feel like they're completed some major attack on 'anti-maskers' (because that definitely is something mature ppl do as well)
