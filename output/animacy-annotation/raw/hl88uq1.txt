Sounds like you can and won’t think rationally like a mature adult. 
Seems like you’re a childish low functioning person. 

A company cannot stop a stalker. 
You just said it yourself. They could call police. 
And exactly why can’t you do the same yourself? Why do you need a company to do that for you?
Better yet, go get an order of protection?
Carry a weapon and defend yourself?

And again. How does a company stop speeding in a parking lot Karen???

Do they set spikes out to blow the tires and then run up and stab the drivers to death????

I’m very interested in how you think these businesses should be protection their employees who are so helpless and ignorant that they cannot protect themselves and be aware of their surroundings…

If Karen’s like you didn’t help create this insane environment we are being held hostage in. That people could live normal rational lives and shop like mature adults. We wouldn’t have any of these issues. 

You just have to stand up and become an adult and stop wanting government and corporations to protect you. 

This is why society is failing, everywhere.
