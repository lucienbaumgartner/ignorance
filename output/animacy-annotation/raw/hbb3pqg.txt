Joe has been controlled opposition for at least a few years now, and this coming from someone who’s been listening to the podcast for almost a decade. He has backpedaled almost every one of his more controversial opinions, he softballed the CEO of Twitter like an absolute bootlicker after spending so much time decrying the censorship Twitter engages in (I know he scrambled to do another show with him to fix his cred, but it wasn’t much better), he allowed several episodes of the show (many of which were fan-favorites) featuring controversial guests to be removed entirely from the archive by his new corporate owners and hasn’t spoken a word about it, as far as I know. People notice changes in things they become extremely familiar with, and the Joe of today is a different guy than even 5 years ago. And I don’t mean natural growth and change, I mean hardline reversals on entire attitudes towards subject matter or specific ideas. This is also just the nature of media in our globalized world. He has arguably the most influential platform on the planet Earth. There is less than zero chance the people who steer society would allow him this entirely untethered. It is childish and ignorant of the way media operates to believe otherwise.
