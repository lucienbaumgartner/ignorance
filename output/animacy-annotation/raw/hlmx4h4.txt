Triggered? Nope, just humbling you. One look through your comment history shows a trend of you using the same burnt out “little guy” insults, hating on other peoples achievements, and telling everyone higher level/better than you that they “farm bots”. Seems like you spend more time on reddit than most of the people you’re jealous of spend in the game. You’re obviously young and unaware of how cringe your behavior is, so I figured I’d put you in your place.
