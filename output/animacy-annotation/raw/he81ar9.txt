&gt;To reduce a multi-faceted issue to the color of someone’s skin…? And assign a label to an entire group of people separated by nothing more than their skin color? Yeah. It’s racist and ignorant. That would be like saying, “all black people are victims”. It’s effing stupid.


This right here is a perfect example of a strawman. 

You misrepresented the other person's comment and then argued against it, declaring yourself correct. 

In reality you did not address anything that was said to you.
