He's actually not at all a standard Christian, though he won't ever say as much explicitly. He dresses up (and by "dress up" I mean "dumb down") Jungian babble and pretends as if it were orthodox Christian theology but his work has more in common with Julius Evola than any mainline theologian I'm familiar with. He gets away with it because the culture of American Christianity is so intellectually impoverished and ignorant that people can't differentiate between vaguely mystical-sounding conservative self-help platitudes and serious theology.
