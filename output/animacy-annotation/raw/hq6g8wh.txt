You are either a shill sent here to sow division, or an actual idiot. Its this kind of arrogance and hubris that will be shown as the heart of this movement and used to discredit it. I get you're probably pissed off with the housing situation. Hell, I'm pissed off with the housing situation. I'm pissed at all of it. But to say anyone who has ever rented anything deserves nothing but torture and slow death is so short sighted and ignorant that it defies reason. Since as a race we have murdered or bred out nomadic tribes that truly didn't own land, someone owns it. Someone controls it. Someone will sell, rent or I'm some form provide the means to house people. Be that selling the land itself, building and selling houses, buying and renting houses or even building a big ass long house and having everyone live communally, that person or entity is profiting in some way. 

Does it need to be fixed, yes. Is it reasonable or attainable to completely eliminate landlords, no. Should the shitty ones be delt with, absolutely. Are they all evil, absolutely not. C'mon man, be better.
