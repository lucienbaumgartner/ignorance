My advice is to do most of your research online. People that work at gun stores are often very ignorant and arrogant imo (there are always exceptions) and that's not a great combination. Your mileage may vary. Just go in after lots of research with an idea of what you want to get. Feel it in your hands before buying it. If it's not comfortable, try on other guns. If you find one that fits like a glove, go back home and do research on it. If it sounds like a good fit, go for it. Gun shops can be very intimidating, especially for minorities and women because we're often seen as outsiders in the (often) white dudebro gun culture. It'll take a long time for this to change but don't let it discourage you from pursuing this.
