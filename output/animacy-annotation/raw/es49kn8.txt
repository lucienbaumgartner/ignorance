I just cant buy into anything that you said. Who is the oppressed who is the opperssor? I dont belive that the right wants to fuck over minorities. See this is my issue with people on your side. You assume malice for the people on the other side while believing you are virtuous. You go in thinking "those people are doing for no other reason than because they are evil" which is a evil preception of reality. Just becuase they dont agree with everything you say doesnt make them evil and just because people are agreeing with you doesnt make what you belive in just. 

Im on the right and i dont think people on your side of the fence is evil or stupid. I think it is a combination of factors including where you grew up, what kind of teachers and influences you had in life, what you experience personally that shaped where your priorities lay. When someone tells me they disagree with me i dont think they are evil or stupid but because i said im on the right everyone on here is going to think that. If you baseline for your belifs are "wholly virtues" and others beliefs are "evil and ignorant" that is going to lead to problems down the road. 

You used a superhero comparison that i thoight was intersting. Now what if the hero came down and beat someone up and he had no proof he was a villain he just thought he was, who is the bad guy now?
