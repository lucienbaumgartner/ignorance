Absolutely. The Elections Clause gives state legislatures the power to make their own laws &amp; rules regarding elections. If a state’s legislature then assigns the handling of elections to another division and gives that division the power to make changes or exceptions to rules or laws, that is perfectly constitutional. I don’t know how much more plain and dumbed-down I can make this for you.

Further, if a SoS decides to extend early voting days or expand the drop box hours for an election during a pandemic, as I think happened in PA and actually went before the court, they have every right &amp; authority to do so not just because the legislature has given them that power, but because the *Federal Law* states that it’s only *not* legal when the rules or procedural changes would make it harder for people to vote.

I don’t know why some of you seem to think you’re smarter than the Supreme Court or Constitutional experts in this country, or that these kinds of issues haven’t already come up and been decided, or that the Secretaries of State that made the changes in question are so stupid and ignorant of their jobs that they would do something unconstitutional or illegal during an important election with national ramifications. You think they don’t have access to experts to advise them on these things BEFORE they do them? Are you serious?
