Right and as someone pointed out earlier the people in this painting aren’t panicking as the building burns, making it seem to me more of an allegory as to how the banks are silently burning the nation to the ground while the people remain blissfully unaware and ignorant of the damage being done. Any person could see something different though and that’s the beauty of art.
