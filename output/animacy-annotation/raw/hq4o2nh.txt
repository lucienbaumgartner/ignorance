wtf did I just read. First of all, the russian battalions pr whatever aren't even at the border of a NATO or EU country but at the border of Ukraine. If it wasn't for the fact that Ukraine wants to become part of the EU one day, the other European counties couldn't care less about this. The US is NOT promising to protect Ukraine (even tho it really isn't promising that, but just that there will be economic sanctions if Russia invades it) because they want to keep a European country safe, they are doing it to prevent one of their geopolitical rivals, Russia (another European country btw), from expanding and thinking they can do whatever they want without repercussions.
Second, I NEVER said I hate the US, I NEVER said they didn't help maintain democracy in Europe, I just said that it's time Europe becomes capable of facing threats without having to necessarily rely on the US.
But the most incredible sentence that you've written is without a doubt "it's our money, tax paying America citizens, keeping you guys safe for the last 70 years. Stop whining and get your governments to help us the fuck out"... WHAT? I don't want to sound rude, but it amazes be how ignorant and arrogant can americans be sometimes. First, European countries pay, with tax paying European citizens money, more than 2.5 billion dollar every year to keep YOUR soldiers in OUR country. We pay for you to have a global empire, do you realize that? We pay for you to keep your soldiers in our home countries drinking cappuccino all day for 70 years! 
The United States needs foreign military bases in Europe more than Europe needs them! The moment we realise it will come one day. This last sentence of your show America's true colors. You don't want allies, friends or partners. You want dogs that follow you everywhere and do whatever they're told. Europe acted like a dog for 70 years. But this will change, I'm sure one day it will
