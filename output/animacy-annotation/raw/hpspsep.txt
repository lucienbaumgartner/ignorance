Blinded to truths, ignorant to respect and one’s self righteousness idk I cannot stress enough about religion how it’s  more destructive than it is helpful. I grew up in a community that preaches Buddhism but the way they do it is all wrong and very hypocritical and very ignorant and they all don’t see this
