And here's the thing, I don't think Elliott is a racist I think she's very naive and unaware of how she comes across which is something we see a lot of from young people in our community. Having a person of colour sit down at a reunion and explain to Elliott what she was doing and how it effected her would have benefited not only Elliott but also viewers at home who aren't aware they are doing the same thing.
