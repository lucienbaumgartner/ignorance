Yeah, have to agree. And I was someone who still thoroughly enjoyed the last couple, even if certain episodes felt weak or off. Every episode from this season has felt that way so far, just kinda forced and out-of-touch feeling. 

There’s the whole big discussion about it’s recent handling of politics too. I think the recent pair of episodes have shown that the show’s current problems exist well beyond that shit, but it is a factor. 

Ofc that’s not to give any validity to the alt-right folks going “oh it’s so PC and political now”; like, no, the show’s always been political and often had a leftist slant. But it *is* handled differently now. For most of the show, it felt like the political issues being brought up were largely just props for the characters to do comedy with. You could read stuff into it, but ultimately it felt like the focus was on the characters and their reactions to it rather than the issues itself. The target of those jokes were, well, the type of people the gang satirizes in general - ignorant and apathetic straight white Americans (the Friends crowd). 

The newer shit more often feels like it’s just trying to talk about those issues directly, and as much as I love the show and the crew behind it, I don’t think they’re equipped for deep dives into such topics. Shots are thrown at everyone, from alt-right rioters to Kanye supporters to fake-woke Hollywood liberals to young politically-active people. And despite all that, nothing is really being said of any value, humorous or otherwise (imo ofc), just “boy politics sure are whacky, huh?”. In those moments, it feels like the show is adopting that apathetic centrist mindset it initially parodied - “politics are all just one big ass blasting”
