&gt;by not understanding or taking the time to even acknowledge the statistics of reality

**A leftie talking about us not acknowledging statistics hahahahahahahahah. You have no statistics. Here's one for you up to 80% of women coming to the US are raped by fellow immigrants or smugglers.** [**https://www.amnestyusa.org/most-dangerous-journey-what-central-american-migrants-face-when-they-try-to-cross-the-border/**](https://www.amnestyusa.org/most-dangerous-journey-what-central-american-migrants-face-when-they-try-to-cross-the-border/) [**https://fusion.tv/video/17212/theyre-desperate-then-theyre-raped-migrant-women-face-sexual-assault-in-mexico/**](https://fusion.tv/video/17212/theyre-desperate-then-theyre-raped-migrant-women-face-sexual-assault-in-mexico/) **Not all immigrants are rapist but... Like trump said they ARE coming over.**

that we exist in and by instead choosing to make your mind up based on one or several interactions you had with individuals is foolish and ignorant,

**That was an example of people not willing to do anything other than spout excuses or ask for guidance.**

 a brief review of the numbers 

**What numbers?**

would make it abundantly clear people do not have access to the american dream 

**The american dream isnt the guarantee of success, its the opportunity of success. There are countless success stories you hear about from people that worked hard AND smart. sometimes people dont make it after trying their hardest because its not in the cards. no one is guaranteed success because some people will work harder, smarter, longer, craftier, etc.. to reach the top. Others have FA hustle to them.**

and this is contrary to everything this nation was founded on 

**'the pursuit of happiness' not the guarantee of happiness. A man who busts his ass putting in 80 hours a week at the office, foregoing family, children, etc... to reach the top shouldnt lose out on a job because some woman who puts in 1/3rd of his effort cries 'misogyny!'**

and saying this doesn't make me "left" or "right" as if these distinctions even have value,

**Each entity exists as something in particular and has characteristics that are a part of what it is. 'leftie' is used to describe your view of 'you conservatives must not understand or care about the plight of the immigrants. Only the left have a monopoly on emotions' you may not be 'leftie' but your perspective is.**

of what they are the only "invention" that's going to save us from automation will be our capacity for empathy 

**wrong. it'll be entrepreneurship, getting people to make their own businesses- developing new industries and products to improve lives. If theyre retarded, then idk what to tell you. We should genuinely work at making an industry that they can thrive in. Wisdom is different to intelligence. You can have an IQ that makes you useless for problem solving but you can have high conscientiousness making you suited to other stuff.**   

to not just disregard those without opportunity in an era of such technological progress and ability

**EVERYONE has opportunity. If they want it or they want their children to have it- they can get educated. its as simple as reading at a library. It'll take discipline and it may be harder for some, but everyone has a choice.**

, the alternative to this is quelling every riot with force, which will essentially escalate into civil war because neither side is going to back down despite their goals being the same

**their goals arent the same. BLM is an openly marxist organisation that seeks to tear down the western world. the statues are a clear example of this. the mindless destruction is another clear example of this (and yes it was them- they didnt try to distance themselves from the destruction)**

&gt;all because what, you cling to this belief that if you work hard you'll be successful despite every single metric disagreeing with you?

**If you work smart and hard. Instead of teaching urban communities about entrepreneurship and finance, they get hand out after handout. "every single metric" you dont have a single metric that shows "if you work hard and save money you will be better off" thats capitalism 101. Thats how I saved a deposit for a house making sightly above minimum wage.  Fuck your anticapitalist university brainwashing.**
