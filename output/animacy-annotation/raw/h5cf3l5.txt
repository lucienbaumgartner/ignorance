Fuck man, this women has 8 kids too!  

She's kind of lucky this horrible situation with her daughter was the first time one of her kids truly needed medical attention. (That or it was a 100% guarantee of death!) 

As a 20+ year type 1 diabetic, undiagnosed type 1 diabetes is extremely serious and risky, and its something that can easily and quickly turn deadly! Especially tricky with babies and young kids because parents can be dumb and unaware of the dangers their kid is in. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are also pretty serious and hard to disregard too, they get progressively worst by the day until you get medical treatment.

Hope these irresponsible parents can afford the absurd costs associated with diabetic supplies and insulin (in the US at least)... that kid needlessly suffered because of her parents faith. Fuck that shit!
