Why do these people have an obsession with little kids (especially little girls) calling them girls. Let’s break this down a bit. No 4-5 year old is gonna call anyone pretty. Do they even know how young and ignorant that age is? At that age they  wanna be a unicorn or something totally unattainable (but we live in an age where anything is possible).  Not even kids twice that age would call anyone they don’t know beautiful. They don’t know the standard of beauty until they get older and have been  indoctrinated with that BS.
