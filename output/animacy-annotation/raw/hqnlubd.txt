Easy of you to say that sitting in your comfy chair watching this on your phone. That cop was watching someone being eaten alive and screaming in agony, regardless of if he's an idiot. Adrenaline kicked in and he shot the tiger because the tigers well being is not his priority in a situation like that. If you think otherwise then you're too ignorant and shallow to understand what being in a situation like this is like and what adrenaline does to you. If you think you can do better then I'm sure the force would love to have someone like you who's extraordinarily calm and collected in life threatening situations. Kindly reconsider your argument.
