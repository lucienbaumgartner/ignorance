FTM here, I have a toxic and absent mother as well. I still have no idea how I’m going to handle it. My mother was only involved in the first 3-4 years of my life and after that, my dad raised me and my brother on his own. She’s an addict who is extremely manipulative and exercises a degree of control and guilt over me that I can never properly explain, especially since my younger brother died of an overdose and I’m “the only child she has left.” My mother is willfully ignorant and unaware of the reality of her shittiness and toxicity and the damage it has on me and my brother. Personally I never plan on leaving the baby alone with her. Maybe visits on holidays and her birthday if she’s lucky. But I refuse to let her stress me out and distract me from giving my child the best possible life, and I’ll do my damndest to not end up being a terrible mother like her. Eyes on the prize, if I were you, and put yourself and your baby first ALWAYS, and don’t do anything that makes you unhappy or uncomfortable. You don’t owe her a damn thing. (I have to tell myself that A LOT.)
