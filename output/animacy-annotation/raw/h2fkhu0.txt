Spoken like a guy who doesn’t think twice about having a wank and murdering all those “potential lives”. 

Also, yes, most abortions are probably out of convenience. Still her body her choice.

Also, who the hell has abortions until “up to just after birth”? Abortions are legal until the end of the first trimester because it’s not a living creature, it’s a lump of cells. 
Abortions are only ever considered after that for disorders that will definitely kill the baby and are also likely to kill the mother. 

All abortions come with huge emotional and psychological impact to the mother, whether it was rape, disease or choice, and frankly it’s incredibly immature and ignorant of you to generalise, trivialise and oversimplify a complex and painful topic.
