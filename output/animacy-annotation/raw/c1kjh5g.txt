Also what I'm thinking, friends of my family lost their son here to organ harvesting back in the 90s. Took both of his kidneys the bastards, he died at the airport, disorientated and unaware that he was even missing them.

The scarier alternative, is that there is a cover-up of some sort of disease, we just don't hear about the deaths of locals. This really needs looking into now.
