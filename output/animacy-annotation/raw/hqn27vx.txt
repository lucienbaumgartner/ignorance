I heart Elijah and Iâ€™m an asshole - is he Russian? My only exposure to Russia is my dads second wife - I never saw an Asian Russian, he looks Asian to me. I am 100% ignorant and just curious about more diversity than I was aware of. I know in California he would be compensated as a care giver but no idea how things work there.
