Naturally, “fit to be parents,” includes raising children to know and love God, right?

Or… does it mean raising children to reject ignorant and outmoded superstition as belief in a sky diety?

Or perhaps it means scrupulous neutrality on the part of parents, who must commit to a rotating schedule of religious study to cover all major religions with their kids by age 7?

Well, this is a minor point; no doubt everyone can agree what fit parents must do here.
