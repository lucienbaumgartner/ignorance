Sure. The Fall of Atlantis was because of greed that was introduced into their leadership that caused their technology to disrupt the natural cycles of the ocean. Ever since then humanity has been enslaved by deceivers who want to keep humans from accessing their full power so that life can be used for their profits. 

Religion was always about this enslavement. The Hebrews were an enslaved people striking out into the desert to find a home, but they were still ignorant and violent because of their upbringing. The majority of the rules in the OT are about basic hygiene as well as making indentured servants rather than slaves that had a 7-year limit, made the first weekend, violent compulsion was outlawed, and masters now had punishment for beating them to death. 

Jesus was born into the era where Rome was seizing control of Israel after the church was tainted by superiority complexes within the deceiver's influence. His purpose was to heal the broken mind, body, and spirit of slaves while helping them bow down to nobody besides the Goodness in the universe. He was executed by the Church and the State as an example to his people. 

Islam freed every domestic citizen, spawned a renaissance of science and culture, and had incredibly liberal culture until the deceiver got ahold of it. 

We have to go through the darkness if we are to find what glows. The next golden age of this coming renaissance will be beautiful beyond belief as we incorporate science, art, and spirit into making systems that support life.
