To everyone pointing out and speculating that Monica might actually have feelings for OP: does it matter? Even if OP were a man and Monica was assuming he was available to her as her back-up whenever she decides she doesn't quite like her husband enough is arrogant beyond belief, at best. It is offensive and disrespectful to everyone involved.  And if is even more offensive and ignorant that Monica seems to think the fact that OP is a lesbian woman gets her around how disrespectful and arrogant this is because "me? With a woman?? Oh haha what a preposterous idea. What a silly joke."
