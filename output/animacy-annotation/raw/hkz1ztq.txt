This fanbase is incredibly biased and unaware of it. Dan is a bottom 5 winner and runner-up, but people will love to go on and on about how great he is without giving any actual reason why. He greatly benefitted from being in some of the worst seasons player-wise and being a straight white man that the show could overhype and the public could eat up. He's all smoke and mirrors, glad to see someone calling it out for once.
