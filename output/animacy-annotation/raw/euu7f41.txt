Well- that same blanket statement made me go vegan. 

I proudly used to put down ‘animal lover’ in all my social media bios- and when I came across a Joey Carbstrong video where he said ‘you can’t claim to love animals while consuming products of animal suffering’. 

My natural response was to question myself and analyse my own actions (I was vegetarian back then and completely unaware and disconnected from how dairy was produced) and I went vegan soon after. I was desperate to have that tag of ‘animal lover’ to be something that truly described me, so I went and did some research and realised that I had been a hypocrite. It didn’t take me more than 5 minutes of research to come to that conclusion. 

For what it’s worth- you can never know what kind of activism will work on someone- a lot of people sometimes just need that kick in the ass to start changing their actions.
