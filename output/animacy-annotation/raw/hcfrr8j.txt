I do. It's an idea I first had when I was 21, I'm 25 now. It's slowly grown over time, but I don't feel like it's fully fledged yet, nor do feel like I'm a good enough writer to tackle it yet. But I know it's *"the one"* because it  won't leave me alone, and I feel very deeply drawn to it. I think it's because it's the story that most broadly wrestles with the themes I find myself drawn to.  The story would best be suited for TV instead of film though, as it is rather large (3 seasons would be perfect).  The story is called Beyond the Grove. Below is a little world building from it. 

**'BEYOND THE GROVE' - WORLD**

*'In the beginning, there was one creator, a God. He created a world unfathomably large that, was at its core, perfect. And this creator existed on the highest plane of reality within this world. He possessed well over a thousand senses (I.E: sight, etc.) and could perceive reality in a way well beyond our comprehension.*   
*And in this world, he created iterations of himself to inhabit it. Each iteration, each being, was unique and had a specific purpose that brought new life to the world. Some of these beings were larger and carried more responsibility, and thus, were given more senses and a greater ability to perceive and operate in the vastness of the world. Others however, had fewer senses, but, instead, were vast in number, and thus were able to pay attention to details that others could not. Although the lowest of the beings lacked the senses to see the world for all it was, they understood the will and purpose of it all because they could feel it – because they directly connected to the creator.*     
   
        	*The creator eventually though, created another being, one that was not an iteration of himself, but instead one that was molded by him. And he created this new being with a mere five senses, and he required them to grow in order to eventually bring a new kind of life to the world. He created a separate world, which was a much smaller, physical world where the beings lived.*  
*These new beings were loved immensely by the other god-like beings. They were innocent, young, different and full of a new kind of life they had never seen before. And as the new beings grew over millions of years, the lesser god-beings were constantly around, teaching them everything within the physical realm. However, the new beings knew and felt that there was more. And after they were taught all that was within the physical realm of possibility, they desired to experience what was beyond. The god-like beings, however, knew that the new beings weren’t ready to move beyond the physical world, but the logic for why was beyond their understanding. The new beings thus became unhappy that more of existence was being kept from them and inevitably grew bitter and lustful. Eventually, they became consumed with their desire, and forcefully tried to enter the world beyond them. They waged war and tried to bring their physical selves into the spiritual world, a world much larger than the one in which they existed.  They attacked and infiltrated the world that wasn’t meant for the living, but as they attacked, they lost themselves. They became lost and stuck while chasing a shadow of what was beyond.  They were stuck in a world between reality and a spiritual existence.  They were living on the crust of a much larger existence and losing touch with what made them who they were in the physical world, but more importantly lost the feeling of love that originally led them.  And over time, they grew weaker and weaker as they became consumed with lust and hatred for what was beyond.  Eventually, they became mere shadows of their prior existence.*    
*And in their time of war, the betrayal caused the god-like beings to fall out of love with the new beings (herein called shadow beings).  And this loss of love spread to the highest echelons of the god-like beings until it finally reached the creator himself.  But the creator himself did not fall out of love for the fallen beings. There was a period of mourning, however, from the lesser god-like beings, who eventually came to forgive the new beings, hoping they would eventually see the error of their ways.  They hoped they would return to their initial purity and see the meaning, the lesson, that could not be taught or shown.*   
*But in this time of mourning, the creator made another life that was separate from the god beings and separate from the shadow beings and called them humans. However, while the god-like beings loved humankind, they were scarred from their prior experiences with the shadow beings, and thus decided, instead, that it was best to love them from a distance. And so, instead of revealing themselves to humanity, they left them blind – unaware that there was more beyond the physical world that the humans inhabited.*   
*Eventually, however, the knowledge of humanity’s existence became known to the shadow beings. And the shadow beings soon realized that there was, in fact, an opportunity for themselves within humanity. They knew the god-like beings loved humanity immensely, and moreover, they knew that they could use this love they felt against the god-like beings. They knew that if they returned to the physical world, the god-like beings would follow in order to keep humanity pure and unaware of what was beyond. So, realizing they could re-level the playing field in the physical world, and could use humanity as their pawns in their war against god, the shadow beings returned and made a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world (Earth).  This supernatural connection to the world (Earth) brought with it an energy that hadn’t be seen in the physical world in millions of years and had massive implications to the world.*        
*From humanity’s perspective, however, this change simply began as an explosion of giant tree growth. When it initially started, it began as what seemed to be just a resurgence in old growth forests across the planet, but as the speed of the growth picked up, the trees began to sprout up everywhere. They started destroying infrastructure, sprouting in cities, through concrete, destroying power grids. People tried to cut the trees as quick as they could, burn them, but as they did, they only grew back faster and stronger.  Society quickly fell as most land became essentially inhabitable.  Years later, the people that survived discovered parcels of land within the woods where that they could build and farm upon, and the remainder of humanity settled upon these scattered pieces of land with hopes of rebuilding civilization. But unbeknownst to them, the world had changed much more than they thought and more than just giant trees lurked in the woods. This is where our series would begin, with our audience and characters blissfully unaware of the world before them. '*
