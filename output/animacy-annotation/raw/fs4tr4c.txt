Opposite, you are speaking into a brick wall.

All I've said is this will be exploited and given examples of how it WILL be exploited. Inserted cheaters and DDoSers into the argument to acknowledge how rampant exploitation already is for a comparative analysis on how likely they will exploit this as well.

Your response is it won't be effective or a problem because they'll be banned. I shouldn't have to explain how naive and ignorant that idea is but; why is their a problem with cheaters and DDoSers now then, if they should just be getting banned by your words?

If leveling up to 50 would be to much of a drag by your explanation, why is their a rampant smurfing problem in ranked? People with multiple smurfs accounts?

To summarize; you are arguing this won't be a big deal or a problem at all because people will get banned. I am saying it will be a problem and will be exploited by the same people you believe are magically banned.
