Have you heard of this great thing called YouTube, it has lots of files you can view, they’re moving pictures, we call them videos. You can go to the website and find every goal and game from any time period you want. Including of Ibra. 

And I don’t care how many titles or goals Ibra has scored for us, he’s undone all of that since he left.

But the insinuation that I don’t know what I’m talking about and therefore aren’t as real of a fan as you, is what I take issue with. You don’t have some more divine right to be a fan because you’ve been one longer. And denigrating other inter fans because they’ve not been fans long enough in your mind is ignorant and antithetical to what Inter stands for as a club.
