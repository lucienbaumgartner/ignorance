&gt; There is no original sin. In Judaism such thing doesn’t exist. It was invented by early Christians.

Nay.

&gt; Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. (Ps. 51:5)

&gt; The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. (Ps. 58:3)

&gt; They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. (Ps. 14:3)

&gt; If they sin against thee, (**for there is no man that sinneth not,**). . . . (1 Kings 8:46; 2 Chron. 6:36)

&gt; And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for **the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;** neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. (Genesis 8:21)

&gt; The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? (Jeremiah 17:9)

&gt; At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after **the imagination of their evil heart.** (Jeremiah 3:17)

&gt; At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after **the imagination of their evil heart.** (Jeremiah 7:24)

&gt; Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in **the imagination of their evil heart:** therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not. (Jeremiah 11:8)

&gt; This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in **the imagination of their heart**, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. (Jeremiah 13:10)

&gt; This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in **the imagination of their heart**, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. (Jeremiah 16:12)

&gt; And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do **the imagination of his evil heart.** (Jeremiah 18:12)

&gt; And he did evil, **because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.** (2 Chronicles 12:14)

&gt; For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. (Ecclesiastes 7:20)

The notion that human nature is inherently sinful and inclined towards evil is attested all throughout the Tanakh. The notion that it was a doctrine invented by Christians simply isn’t true. Many Palestinian Jews living at the time of Jesus understood that they were born sinful and separated from God, and Christians inherited this doctrine from the Hebrew Scriptures (I might also add that Paul himself who fleshed out the doctrine in his letters was himself a Pharisee educated by Gamaliel). Just because one particular sect of Jews who went on to become the fathers of post-Temple rabbinic Judaism were blind and ignorant of this spiritual truth doesn’t it mean it’s not firmly rooted in the Jewish scriptures.
