The comment is giving grief to ScarJo over her role in Ghost in the Shell. The controversy was that she is a white actress playing an "Asian character", which has been refuted by both the creator of Ghost in the Shell and by common sense due to The Major having a synthetic cyborg body that could feasibly look like anyone; but that didn't jive with the Twitter hate boner for Johansson so the controversy rumbles on.

Some of the other stuff she's done is questionable, but this controversy is a bit manufactured and ignorant of the source material. You don't even have to go much further than the title of *Ghost in the Shell* to understand why it doesn't matter who is playing the character.
