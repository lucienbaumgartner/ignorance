[Yeah, azeztulite's bullshit, too.](https://www.mindat.org/min-27569.html) 

Here's how it is: Most people have very little knowledge of basic geology, which means little to no knowledge of where, how, and why minerals form and what they're called. That makes it reeeeally easy for unscrupulous sellers to make up something like azeztulite, anandalite, and sell it at stupid prices to people who don't know any better.

The metaphysics/crystal healing community is especially susceptible to this because they tend to be more willing to believe whatever they're told if it's couched in metaphysical terms, and there's no way to empirically disprove the claims.

The more you post in here, the more you'll see people (myself included) calling out the bullshit. I can't speak for everyone else, but part of the reason I do it is because I can't stand people taking advantage of other people.

Trust that "funny feeling" of yours. It seems to be serving you well. If you're into the woo side of things, do yourself a solid and learn the fundamentals of *actual* mineral science first so you're better protected from scams that take advantage of the ignorant and gullible. [This introductory-level geology textbook chapter on minerals is a good place to start.](https://opengeology.org/textbook/3-minerals/) And if in doubt, always, *always* check [mindat.org](https://www.mindat.org/). If Mindat says it's bullshit, it's bullshit.

Finally, you're always welcome to PM me with questions if you want.
