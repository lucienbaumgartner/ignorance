I’ve lost almost everything in my account 3 times in year 2020. I am a relatively old member who has been stalking for about a year and a half, active for a year. Listen to me when I say this guy isn’t fucking wrong. If you are new and ignorant of the risk... be aware you are ignorant of the risk. I’m not advocating staying out, but I am also advocating that due diligence is needed. I am not a financial or legal advisor. This is not advice.
