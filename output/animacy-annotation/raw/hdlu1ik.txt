you're ignoring the fact that inner sloth is 4 people first of all. Second of all you clearly have no idea how plaigerism works and how inspiration works. Among Us might be inspired by things like Werewolves but epic blatantly plaigerised Inner sloth. Because there is no precedent for the use of the word imposter in this type of game, the tasks are also a new addition to the idea. The splash screen at the start telling you which side you are on is clearly taken from that as well. If you want to call that inspiration that's fine but that's not going to hold up in court and epic would 100% lose if they were sued and had equally expensive defense teams. Sadly, epic is way more rich and therefore can easily get away with this and rip the idea from a development team of 4 people never once giving credit or reaching out for a collab. 

You defending this is beyond sad and ignorant of law concerning plaigerism.
