&gt;Are we assuming he's mentally incompetent and unaware that having sexual intercourse may result in children when he chooses to have sex?

Intercourse isn't an agreement to have children.... so that part of your argument is tossed. Let's see what's next:

&gt;In any case, your intent to have a child or not does not affect your responsibility for your child once it is born.

I don't give birth, nor do I make any choices before birth, so how can responsibility be given with no choice?

See how you really don't have an argument?
