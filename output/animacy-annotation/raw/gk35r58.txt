Oh GOD!! So this behavior has been on going and getting scarier with time. If she didn’t have access to so much money (and she will run out eventually or overdose) she would already be living on the streets doing cheap drugs. The point is that if you don’t get a attorney and report her and distance yourself from her ASAP, there is no telling how sneaky she will get right under your nose and you will go down with her since your name is on her packages. And if you are still in contact with them it’s hard to say you were innocent and unaware of the drug trafficking. God she is getting away with so much now, especially since your dad is enabling her. He doesn’t realize how much worse it is when there is someone willing to play dumb for love. He’s slowly digging her grave and financially ruining himself.
