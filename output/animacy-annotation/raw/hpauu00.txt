Lmfaooooooooooo

&gt;You call me hypocritical yet you're being racist towards me because I dont believe the stuff

Every comment was saying "you people are letting yourselves be oppressed" and claiming that no one can take responsibility for their own actions or stop "oppressing themselves" JUST BECAUSE WE ARE BLACK

You literally said some incredibly ignorant and racist shit by making baseless claims and you don't think that is hypocritical? 

&gt; I see the world with my own 2 eyes goofy

So why you parroting the same white propaganda on reddit? You sound like you're from a Tucker Carson sub. 

And yeah I have too 

&gt;If you've ever actually experienced any bad "black" stereotypes.

This shit is what I've seen. And you just made alot of your own. That's why you're ignorant and a Hypocrite you fuckin bozo

&gt;literally hating on a black man from the inner city

Now you playing the victim after everything you said about African American people

&gt;not what the internet wants me to see

Yo read a fuckin book
