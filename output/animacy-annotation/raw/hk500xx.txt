Firstly, I want to say I understand their point about the power of attitude, I really do. And secondly, I would never go into a non-academic discussion expecting the other person or myself to act like a Vulcan. 

So anyway, as others have said [abjection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjection)
is a big factor here for sure. Interestingly, we can see in this thread how cyclical abjection is (us calling them children, irrational, egotistical).   It's like we can't turn it off, lol. 

Though I think there's a broader pattern here concerning how we explain behavior.  Their ad hom isn't really defensiveness. They just don't understand. They cannot see the route you took to that conclusion, so they default to it being a you-problem and you being too arrogant to acknowledge your problem.  Which really is the worst kinda sick, sick and unaware of it. 

And it really is hard to understand people, even if they were to listen well (and I know they don't). Like it's so rare that I think anyone who has the gift of understanding anyone should really consider joining the field of mental health care because their abilities are desperately needed.
