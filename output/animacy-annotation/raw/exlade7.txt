Slaughtered them? Interesting way of putting being shot during a coup.

So me saying this issue is bigger then just "appeasement" == making a moral equivalency. I am pretty sure you EAT horseshit with this kind of logic.

Who is "you guys" what do you think I am exactly? For that matter do you think I am American? Lol. Way to make a bunch of fucking assumptions, much like all the "facts" you have been stating here. 

Communist death squads are well documented from this period of time, take your head out of the sand.

If you believe the Nazi's were defeated simply with Soviet manpower, I have bad news for you, you are the one stuck in propaganda. Just like this "appeasement" arguement, you are equating a MASSIVE subject within history down to a single argument. I cannot stress how unbelievably arrogant and ignorant that is.

And none of those leftist movements were in anyway sponsered and funded by the Soviet Union or it's allies. The entire Cold War was just America bullying little old Russia who never did anything wrong.

And IM the one whose been brainwashed in the classroom.... Right.

Btw the statement I made was grade schools "and above", see how that's different and you can't just pick and choose what you want from someones point, and then call that their point? No? Oh well. I am gonna go eat now because I am really bored of you not reading things. Maybe take that extra time to try practicing your reading comprehension.
