No honestly I haven't really wanted to do this the whole time, but I sometimes feel like I should try and educate people when they're being ignorant and insensitive online. I've seen how shit on the internet turns into out and out hate and id like that not to happen, so I tried. But, while I have empathy and kindness, I don't have unlimited patience and I just don't care about you enough to continue







It's got nothing to do with South Park. I used Matt and Trey because their humor specifically shines a light on how the thing being taboo is the thing to be laughed at, or the person being insensitive, not the thing or person themselves. That's the whole point




But again, I truly don't give a fuck about you. Go ahead and get your last word in to sleep well at night and feel like you won Reddit, but know I stopped thinking about you the moment I hit post on this comment
