I'm happy you found fluency. Truly. I'm 28 and I've done quite a bit of speech therapy. I've spend countless days on youtube, trying all the exercises. I've read every book, tried their exercises. And yes, it helped. But I am not fluent. I went from not being able to say a single word to most people not knowing I stutter.

But what bothers me most is people like you disrespecting the work of these hardworking researchers. To even get in the trial, you must have done years of speech therapy. This is not an alternative. This is a last resort. The lead researcher is a lifelong stutterer who has dedicated his life to this. For you to just use the ol "pull-up your bootstraps" argument is just incredibly insulting and ignorant of the facts.
