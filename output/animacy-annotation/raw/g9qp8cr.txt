I did TDEE Calc and it says I should be getting about 2600 cal a day. I am 52. In my mid-30s when I worked out like this my muscles grew like crazy. Now, it is just hard. I’ve had my testosterone checked and it is in the mid-530s with 60 free.  I have the testosterone of a 40-year-old. I’ve taken absolutely no enhancements. I’ve been trying to get ripped for going on three years now. In 2018 I was pretty reckless and unaware of the impact of my age and hurt both elbows both knees and my back. In 2019 I did yoga since I couldn’t do much else. I was able to start working out again in mid 2019 and blasted it to maybe maybe see a quarter inch growth on my chest. It seems that if my waist shrinks from diet my chest shrinks too which tells me that some it has some fat as well. I am starting to see some abs at the top and like I said I bench pressed the most I have in my life less than two weeks ago, but it’s the protein shakes that are getting to me. I decided to try and lose my subcutaneous belly fat and maintain or grow muscle by getting enough protein while limiting my calories. I don’t think I’ve been doing it long enough to see results But I want to get rid of the eggs and dairy products.
