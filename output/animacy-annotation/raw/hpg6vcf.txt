The way that Holly has treated you isn't the way that loved ones do, which is with empathy and care. She's wrong headed, self-centered, and hypocritical, typical of Qultists. She doesn't want others to ask about her personal (or protected) health information, but she wants to out in in the most vindictive manner possible. She says "have a good life" over your attempt to protect you and your family from a pandemic that has killed 800,000+ Americans. 

The beliefs that your dad has, that vaccines and not a deadly virus are killing people, shows the psychological damage that right-wing disinformation has inflicted on people. 

I think you have EVERY right to react angrily to the selfish and ignorant and morally reprehensible way your family members have treated you. And the fact that they talk about YOU dying shows that they are inflicting you with psychological abuse. It isn't healthy, and I would definitely spend time away from them because they do NOT have your best interests at heart.

You're right -- you shouldn't have to feel this way because your anti-vaxx family is using the same techniques that cult use to attack anyone who attempts to leave their brainwashed echo chamber. You need to physical and mentally separate yourself and your loved ones from these people because they will harm you, physically and mentally, if you don't. They least they will do is continue to browbeat you while caring little about the trauma that it's causing. They worse they can do is either punch you out of sheer hatred or even get you exposed to COVID-19, leading to someone's death (as we've seen repeatedly happen in people's experience on this forum).

Take care of YOURSELF and YOUR family. This must be emphasized. You are dealing with fire, and it is best you stay away from the flames.
