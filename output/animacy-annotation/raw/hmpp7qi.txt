It’s not about trust, it’s about doing the due diligence to make sure the code is correct. 

You also have to remember I said every single game on every single store front. This is not a unique thing to Microsoft. Steam does this, PlayStation does this, etc. None of these store fronts, including Microsoft, would want hundreds of thousands of players impacted just because of trust. That’s being complacent and ignorant of potential cyber security breaches (which they can get sued for).
