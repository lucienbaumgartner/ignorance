I voted for Trump because I didn't want a career criminal in the White House (Benghazi, Clinton foundation trafficking in Haiti, taking money from Saudi Arabia, a country where women have no rights at all, wanting an unaware and compliant citizenry, etc.), not to mention her husband, who is a rapist, would have been running around putting his member where he shouldn't again.
