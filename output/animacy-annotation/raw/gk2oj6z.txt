That's true across the spectrum, though â€” the media will print what sells, and what sells best is almost always the most inflammatory and controversial versions of all viewpoints.  Take Brexit: there are some very good reasons to dislike the EU, and possibly even to believe that there is a path for the UK outside of it, but what we got in terms of debate was on one side a showcasing the most racist and ignorant of Brexit arguments, and on the other side the worst of the doom mongerers.  Somewhere in the middle were definitely some cogent arguments, but they rarely sold as well as the extreme ones.
