I'd suggest humans are half of a reciprocal predation relationship with (almost) every other larger predator on the planet. Examples: larger bears, big cats, larger dogs, hyenas, bigger crocodilians, sharks. All of them eat us, and we eat all of them.

Human predation of other apex predators is largely culturally-mediated, because all modern humans are capable of hunting every predator that can hunt them. Example, hunter-gatherers without access to firearms are still capable of using sophisticated group/coordinated hunting tactics, long-range weaponry like spear throwers, poisons like curare, etc. Firearms of course massively tilt the scales towards people in any encounter with an animal.

But any individual human caught unaware and unprepared is prey to most larger predators. 

This is not as extensive today due to humans having driven most larger predators' populations to low numbers, cultural (including legal) prohibitions against hunting big predators, and most other larger predators learning humans are potentially highly dangerous prey. In other words, encounter rates between humans and big predators are lower today than in the past.
