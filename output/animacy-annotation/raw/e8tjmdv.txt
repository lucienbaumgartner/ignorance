Hahaha, alright, you had me going there for a minute and were able to get me for awhile - I'll give you that - but now I'm calling it. There is no way this is real and you've got to be a troll or something. There's just no way someone is this unaware and blissfully hypocritical. You - ***you*** \- literally just sourced two articles expressing that the actions done that you are angry about occurred while Obama - not Trump - was in office and, per your own sources, Republicans were the vocal figureheads attempting to correct the matter. Per the exact articles that you shared, ICE said it couldn't handle the matter as effectively because they needed more resources and you said only a few hours ago that Republicans were the ones trying to get ICE more funding. We already established that the viral cage photo was a lie and has been publicly called out numerous times - even the articles you linked have cage photos from Obama's administration (not Trump's).

So, if you were an honest and logical person that really cared about your beliefs and could step beyond party politics, you'd stay consistent with yourself and say that you think Obama is evil for his terrible handling of illegal immigrant children, right? 

Dude, we both know that you just checkmated yourself with that straight up retarded post. Come on, man. There's no way you're able to even kid yourself at this point. Either you just toe the party line and blindly side against the Republicans because that's what you've been told to do (at least have enough self respect and dignity to admit that - even if only to yourself) or you see both Obama and Trump as evil (at least you have consistency with this one) or you really are just uninformed and can't even figure out simple dates (in which case you're basically just following marching orders and doing what you've been told again). 

Which is it. 

(I'm saving this conversation, dude. Thanks, this one is definitely a keeper.)
