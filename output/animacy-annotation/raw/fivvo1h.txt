If Sanders isn't "electable" over an infamous huckster con-man trust fund baby, then I dare say we as a society *deserve* to collapse under such a con-man.

The last debate was a great example in a dozen ways, but attacking Sanders for saying a good thing about Cuba's 100% literacy rate deserves getting pummeled for it?

If my fellow citizens en masse are so willfully STUPID and IGNORANT that they can't understand anything more nuanced than "China, BOO! America, YAY! Cuba, BOO! Israel,YAY!"  Then We deserve a leader like Donald Trump to lead us into oblivion for their own profit.
