So you think the people who own the various media corporations aren't privy to any superordinate elite agenda? By that I mean: business executives, producers, directors, writers, prominent hosts. It's pretty naive to think they aren't on the inside - and by 'inside' I mean, aware of a deeper level of reality. And by deeper, I do mean a spiritual/metaphysical reality which is semiotically obscured by the way they structure the world of our day to day lives. Our brains (and minds) are association machines. Not only that, but more complex, integrated and comprehensive representations of reality create more profound feelings. 

Elites control the world. It's been this way since prehistorical times. The reason for the racket hasn't changed one iota - only the complexity of the organization and the technology and skillfulness that they can employ to augment the illusion. 

So no, its not just the hospitals. Media is very much complicit. As is government at almost all levels - from local to global (UN, world bank, IMF, BIS etc), militaries, religious institutions, and yes, most obviously, universities, health and medicine. Is every doctor aware of this higher strata of society? No. Most are ignorant and naive. But are those placed in prominent positions unaware? Of course not. They are fully 'above' the scientism they promulgate. The cheap materialism is for the philosophically unaware and uenducated. Those who know better know that you can't separate the knower from the known, the human from the world, meaning from nature. Yet - unfortunately - these same people are sociopathic/psychopathic humans committed to a way of being which is totally incompatible with normal ideas of morality. They are above it - beyond it - the only rules are the rules of 'master' and 'slave'. And those positions exist at different times. ITS THE WAY OF THE WORLD.
