Aaaayyyyyy rereading is amazing! Everything u felt at the first time is the same! That same love and adoration for this book/books is still there and is amazing to feel especially if you’re listening to the same music! Ahhh pure bliss. 

Ok right backtrack to ur questions lol

1. So many good ones. Off the top of my head is when Annabeth and Percy kiss for the first time in that mountain (I forgot the name. Is it helen) I think the comedy and the overall atmosphere was so cute and hilarious

2. The battle of the labyrinth. So much stuff happened. It was soo fast paced and everything happened with so much new quality but I could still enjoy it at this pace. 

3. Only 2 sadly. Have come back to riordanverse after 1 and a half year? Idk after a while and I came back and it blew my mind how amazing it was when I came back. I was so young and unaware that book series I’d read was pure freaking gold 

Not a long post at all mate. Is great to share our excitement here. Don’t know many ppl who like it so here’s the place!
