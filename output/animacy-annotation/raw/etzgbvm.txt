I think it should all be considered in the context. In general, killing the animal that has not done any harm to you would violate the NAP, although farming animals and slaughtering them for food is a bit of a grey area. And obviously, since animals cannot understand some of our laws, we should factor it in our behavior. For example, a stray dog trespassing on your property should not be shot, even after the "Get off my lawn!" warning, unless you have very good reasons to assume that your life is threatened. You also should not be able to fight a goose that snatched a burger out of your hands in order to get the burger back, since the goose's behavior, obviously, was not conscious.

"Aggression" is a concept that implies the existence of intent. Someone taking your money without your consent, or punching you in the face without your consent, is employing aggression against you - because they do that consciously. But the animal that does some minor damage without being aware of it is not aggressive, it is just clumsy and ignorant. That animal does not violate the NAP, and hence you cannot kill it in self-defence.

To summarise, this is not a question that can be answered easily. I think it is a question outside of the political domain, and should be resolved based on the dominating animal rights culture in the society.
