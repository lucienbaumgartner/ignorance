I don’t accept this and have yet to meet a woman who does. This is almost exclusively used by men. Transwomen specifically. And yes it’s offensive and it’s meant to be. They’re misogynists who hate women. 

Also, they’re so stupid and ignorant of women’s anatomy they don’t seem to be aware a woman’s vulva isn’t on the “front” of the body. A penis is. But that’s what these dudes know and understand and continue to think with whether it’s chopped off or not.
