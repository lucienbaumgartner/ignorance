I want to say: I'm very sorry that happened to you. You never deserved to be treated like that. I too have Aspergers, I had PTSD and Selective Mutism. I used to also hate my voice. (I actually think many people dislike their voice) but, having said that: Your voice is beautiful. It is your instrument that you can use to express all your interesting ideas and emotions. To communicate with others that are open to listen. It can take time to work through trauma like this but if you focus on building up your self-love and confidence then you will be able to speak again clearly. First understand that these people yelling at you, and the people not standing up for you, that is their own personal issues. They are unaware and afraid. You are the scapegoat for their inner demons. So understand that there is nothing wrong with you, it's THEIR issues. So try not to take it to heart.. which I know is difficult to do. But when you have a clear understanding of this, and healthy self-love you will speak clearly and not care what other people say. I know this now. I believe it is the same for you. Sending light and love.ðŸ¤—ðŸ’œ
