&gt; Nothing Trump did "*out in the open*" even remotely constitutes illegal collusion to any degree.

That's not what OP said. They said the campaign had collusion that is out in the open, which is quite obviously true. We do not know if Trump was aware and participated in the collusion, or if he was ignorant and unaware that his top campaign staff were colluding with Russia. Either case requires an investigation to find out. Neither is good for the president.
