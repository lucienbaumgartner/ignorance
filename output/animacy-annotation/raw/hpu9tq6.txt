It never fails to amaze me just how ignorant and hateful someone can be. 

It was wrong of him to be with you knowing that he wanted someone else. But I can excuse that as someone who is hurt trying to move on. 

But then TELLING someone that they never cared AND they are a rebound? That just makes them a shitty human being. And to do it on Christmas Eve makes them a straight up shithead.
