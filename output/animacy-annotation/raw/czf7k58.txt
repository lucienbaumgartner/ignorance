&gt;Vader couldn't

i disagree. vader could be killed by a gun if he was caught unaware and armorless. 


&gt;and when I see the Wizards battle, half their spells miss cause their accuracy sucks and the other half of spells are blocked.

i dont think that's necessarily because their accuracy sucks. more because they're deflecting each other spells, and blocking them.
