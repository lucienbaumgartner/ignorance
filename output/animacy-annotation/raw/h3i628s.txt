I was there. I was getting all the plugins these pros used on YouTube and whatnot.
I downloaded more trials than I could count. My mixes still sucked ass. 
You just got Logic Pro. Do newborns walk marathons? Do people who just started with their drivers license win races? Do people paint the next Mona Lisa when they just start out painting because they have expensive brushes all the pros love? No.

It is a craft that you need to learn about. 
About audioengineering, the audio part is for the creative stuff and the engineering stands for the technical and technique part. 

If it would be so easy to make professional mixes and masters, there wouldn't be any need and space left for audioengineers, beside the ones who will code the next "one knob 4 professional sound" plugin. 

I don't want to be a douche, but beside it being naive and ignorant that you think you can slam some plugins on it and call it a day for high end production, which some beginners do, it's also insulting to the craft and the ones working in this field. 

Learn your stuff. See what makes what and check out tutorials, get 1-2 books and the rest will be experience. You don't even need 10 thousands of bucks to get professional result, but you gotta know what you're doing. The stock plugins are perfectly fine. Don't spend money on fancy plugins and expect to be the new audio god instantly, thanks to them, because that ain't gonna happen. 

Happy mixing and welcome to the community. :)
