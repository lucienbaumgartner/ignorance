I think you need to get out in the real world and learn about this thing called the complexity of social interaction, instead of making assumptions. My job isn't who I am it's what I do to make money. Don't talk about rape as if you know anything about it the fact that you just made that connection is really ignorant and disrespectful to both sides. If you've gone through then obviously you are still deeply hurt by it because that was a comment made by someone who is mentally injured.

Me lying about what I do is the same as a woman putting on makeup or a weave to go on a date. So shut up dude you sound like a milk drinker.
