Something you seem to know nothing about.  Yeats is notoriously itchy.  Yours wasn’t doesn’t mean someone else’s won’t. If it gets bad, it will be.  And it is a fungus.  You’re speaking to your experience and making it a blanket statement.  Not everyone’s experience is going to be the same as yours.  Congrats yours isn’t itchy. Mine is.  You’re more the. A dick. You’re ignorant and willing to stay that way.
