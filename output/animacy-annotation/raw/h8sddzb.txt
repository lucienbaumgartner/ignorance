Part of the whole point is that a “one off racist” who shouts a slur is only intended for shock value, which gives little to no weight to the many actual racist constructs in the world. The point around how being a covert racist only applies when it applies was already addressed, and doesn’t add much. I see your point about fantasy worlds, but then the next question is: what is the point in your fantasy racism if it has no correlate in the real world? Using racism as a flat object to introduce adversity for a character is, once again, uninspired and ignorant of real issues.
