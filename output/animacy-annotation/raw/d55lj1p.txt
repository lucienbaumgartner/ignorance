No kidding right! Every time I watch gifs like this I laugh and wonder if they are playing in the same matchmaking pool as we are. I've never played against such unaware and easy opponents. I mean, the Zarya in the beginning is literally facing Tracer and stops shooting her to turn the other way and start hopping, and the Reaper just runs away in a straight line blinded by the pursuit of another person never once defending himself. Heck, looks like there was an enemy Mei in there that failed to freeze Tracer even once. Usually the teams I play against actually turn to shoot me and are generally aware of my presence. Its like watching a grown man score a touchdown against a youth league team.
