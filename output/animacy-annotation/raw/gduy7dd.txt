I can tell you are young and unaware of the history of seatbelts and automobile safety. Back in the day, when seat belts were first becoming standard in automobiles(late 40s early 50s) many people believed that seat belts were designed to kill people. This was the 2 point seatbelt, not the 3 point, safer more reliable device, that we are all used to today. When someone wearing a seat belt would get out of a crash and survive they would be horribly bruised in the shape of the seat belt. They often blamed the belt for this injury, but what they didn't know was the seat belt prevented them from breaking their neck on the windshield. Not only this but many people believed seat belts were to trap them in the car, during an accident. The funny thing is seat belts arguably didn't change fatality rates until the invention of the airbag. Which if you are unaware, air bags increaced fatality rates for those not wearing seatbelts. They deploy in a fraction of a second and can hit your face and body at speeds up to 200 mph. Making it unlikely those flying forward unsecured can survive. I wouldn't say Dale did it just for comfort, back then going out of your way to be safe made you look like a pussy. Idk if you have ever met a Nascar fan but this is probably the best reason. Either that or he believed in early seat belt myths.
