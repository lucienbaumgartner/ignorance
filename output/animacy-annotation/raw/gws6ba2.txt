I interviewed with them in DFW a couple of months ago. All they want to do is lie about the quality of their system and sell to the extra rich to justify their insane costs. Literally told the Sales Manager they were unethical and ignorant of the market- their product isn't any better than you can get from LG for half the cost.  


you literally cannot believe how many scuzzy solar companies will tell you, with a straight face, to "sell the value" of the system while offering no actual difference with comparable, cheaper systems.
