&gt;I am tired of the amount of lazy and obese people on earth that get paid for sitting at home and doing nothing

you mean the poor ones though. when the wealthy do it then it's ok.

&gt;you can get paid more sitting at home than actually giving back to the world doing an actual job.

i think this is really just one of those self serving lies republicans need to believe to stay bitter and ignorant of the real exploitation around them.

&gt;What I find the worst thing in the world is obese kids.

you'd think making ending childhood obesity wouldn't get a backlash. i guess it's easy to forget there's profit in it.

&gt;He thinks he is allowed to sit at home and do nothing and get paid 2500 or whatever it is do be a fat cow.

i love that you're committed to the idea being unemployable is like some cheat code for an easier life.

&gt;Good for him that he knows he can give back to the community and work.

do you think earning profit for an employer is "giving back to the community?" that's supremely naive.

&gt;I donâ€™t know if that made sense. I hope it did

it did. it is just built on weird conservative lies.

put a fast food restaurant on every street corner and it's no mystery why a third of americans are overweight.
