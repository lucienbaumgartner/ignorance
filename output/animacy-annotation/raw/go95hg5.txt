Your mindset it so self centered and toxic. It reeks of common people not being worth your time.

When you travel, it's not always about the place. It's specifically about the people and opening yourself up to dealing with customs and ways of existing that are different and maybe even uncomfortable to you. It makes you grow as a person in a way that eating at a foreign restaurant or looking at images on google never can. It's laughable and ignorant that you even suggest that.

You're not going to like everyone you meet or everything you do, but life isn't about everything being what you're used to. If you only stick to your comfort zone, you're weaker for it.

Just remember, when you say "I don't like people very much" that's not a fault of people. It's a fault in you.
