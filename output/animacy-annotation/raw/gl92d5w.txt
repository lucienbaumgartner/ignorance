Nobody with an IQ of 140 is a moron.

Many with an IQ of 140 are socially inept and unaware of just how far above the average person their intelligence lies.

Remember...the difference between an IQ of 140 to the average IQ of 100 is the same as the difference from the average IQ of 100 to someone with an IQ of 60.  Someone with an IQ of 60 has mental retardation.  If the average person (IQ 100) has problems relating to someone with mental retardation (IQ 60), then a person with an IQ of 140 would find it very difficult conversing with the average person (IQ 100) as they would appear to have mental retardation.

IQ is quite a comprehensive measure of intelligence as IQ can be measured in various capacities and across various tasks.

I am not quite at an IQ of 140 but I am a member of both Mensa and Intertel and it is tiring talking with average people.  In fact, this is why those with super high IQs 180+ often never make meaningful contributions to society.  If someone has an IQ of 180+ the average college professor appears to be a moron as an IQ of 130ish is 40+ IQ points away from the IQ of a historical genius.
