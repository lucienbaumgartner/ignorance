this sounds really terrible and assholeish, but i worry that i'm acting autistic. my sister is on the spectrum and i love her but she's really socially unaware and awkward, whenever i do something that reminds me of her i worry that i'm just as socially unaware as she is and nobody had the heart to tell me. maybe all my friends just hang out with me out of pity, ha ha help
