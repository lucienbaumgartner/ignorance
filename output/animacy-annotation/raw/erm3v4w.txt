That is so far beyond insensitive and ignorant that I wonder if she had some personal stuff involved.   
She could be struggling to maintain a benign interpretation for her own experience.  
She may have had a male friend or family member falsely accused.   
Religion or ideology.   Mormon women have described a culture of gaslighting raped women.  We have a sub for RedPill women.  
She might have been getting off sexually or sadistically on the details.
