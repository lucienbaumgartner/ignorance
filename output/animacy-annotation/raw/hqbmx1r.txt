I can't speak for everyone, but for me, it was the knowledge of losing my friends and family. I went that route anyway, and while I know I couldn't have done otherwise, it is still painful as an adult to know I could have just kept my mouth shut and played along and had more experience with genuinely good, if ignorant, people who are now dead, so I cannot. I viewed then as ignorant and stupid and harming the world, when in reality they were really good people who just happened to have been raised in a LARP.

For some, leaving a religious community means losing their grandparents, their parents, their neighbors, their longest friends, etc. Loneliness is a far more powerful thing than any textbook. Which I've guessing the last two years have taught a lot of people.
