I'm replaying for the first time since release and taking my time in Chapter 2, letting Micah stay his ass in the Strawberry jail while I hunt, fish, and explore. It's fucking glorious. You do have to progress past &gt;!the scene where Arthur gets infected in order to unlock fishing. However, you're still playing as a blissfully unaware and healthy Arthur, plus the trip back to camp after getting coughed on hits waaaaayyy different when you know what it means.!&lt; 

I highly recommend starting fresh, particularly if it's been a while. I didn't even mind the chapter in the Grizzlies this time.
