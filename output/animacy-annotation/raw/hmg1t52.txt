Get Tannehill out of the game. He’s not even a good game manager type of QB. He locks on 1 receiver every play and if they’re not wide open, forget about it; he rarely throws his receivers open. How many balls does he have batted down per game and how many check-down throws does he make that almost get his RB killed? He’s an athletic quarterback outside the pocket, but he’s so unaware and stiff in the pocket and looks scared to make a decisive throw. 

All of this and we’ve not ever asked him to be the driver of the offense. Just don’t screw up Ryan; yet he continues to screw up. We need to locate a replacement in the off-season, and Randy Bullock shouldn’t make it back on the plane.
