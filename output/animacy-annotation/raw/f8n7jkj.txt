I think it was posted as an irritant question, and understandably so.

OP was then surprised to see the excuses presented and thought them reasonable at his young age, not understanding that he does not have to accept peoples selfish excuses for annoying those around them.

There is no excuse to have clickyclickyclicky noises on for your phone, the developer should be shot and hanged and then buried alive for delivering a universal irritant to the unaware and selfish to annoy the masses.
