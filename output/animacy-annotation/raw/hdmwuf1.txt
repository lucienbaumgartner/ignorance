The rotating villain is a complete nonsense conspiracy theory that is just factually wrong and ignorant of what powerful politicians believe. It relies on the idea that the Democratic party is some hive mind that can control all of its members to influence the outcome legislation, an idea that is just obviously false. And its examples used for "evidence" are stupid.

The idea that the Democratic leadership selects a politician to arbitrarily block legislation is so stupid beyond belief, one has to be so cynical and ignorant of politics to believe it. Lieberman didn't want a public option. Not because Obama selected him for that role because Obama secretly didn't want it for whatever reason, but because Lieberman absolutely didn't want a public option and no amount of convincing would have mattered.

Manchin is who he is because he was elected in a red state. Biden didn't select him to be the rotating villain, it is just who Manchin is. 

Leftists need to stop coming up with garbage conspiracy theories so they can continue in their single minded quest of blaming Democrats for everything and continuing to question Democrats convictions, and keep up the myth that Democrats don't want to do anything, for who knows what reason. I have never got a good answer on why leftists believe the things they do about Democrats. Just cynical both sides bullshit.

Maybe this is a more comfortable lie than the truth that Manchin is a real obstacle, so conspiracy nonsense like this is invented. Who knows.

And I wonder what people like yourself will say when the dam finally breaks and the filibuster is reformed and Democrats start doing everything they apparently don't want to do. Conspiracy theorists always have another conspiracy theory ready, when observable reality disproves the previous one, so I'm curious as to what it is.
