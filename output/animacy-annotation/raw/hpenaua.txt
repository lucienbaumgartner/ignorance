Another great question! There aren’t many “right-wing” countries, but those who aren’t necessarily leftists are extremely naive and ignorant of science, so they believe and are susceptible to the fear tactics. 

In addition, many right-wing politicians are cowardly and terrified of being called “anti-vax”, a common slur nowadays and a potent psychological conditioning weapon. Therefore they collaborate and are complicit in the Authoritarian Left’s establishment of systems of enforcement and control.
