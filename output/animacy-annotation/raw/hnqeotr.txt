It’s fine to have your own opinion. Said opinion just tends to hold more weight and water when it’s about something you’ve read, watched or played.

You’re dismissing and reducing the book to such a simplistic form. It is not about someone who abuses animals, or just goes around killing innocent animals.

It’s a book about two men who are struggling during the depression, and roam around looking for work. One happens to be big and unaware of his size and strength, due to special needs (he’s mentally disabled). He wants love, but isn’t seen as capable or deserving.

It’s also about one man looking out for another who needs assistance to navigate the world.
