Hey folks!


For those unaware and first hearing about me or Loot Lads, we're a "Two guys on a couch" style channel. We also write skits here and there just to get the really weird level of creativity we both have out into the world. If you like weird esoteric ideas like the villain from SAW sometimes being a half ton Kodiak Bear, dumb jokes about snakes, Slenderman being a humble corn farmer, or whatever weird nonsense spills out of our heads and onto the recordings, then we'd love to have you. 


More about us: my co-host and I have been producing random pieces of content together for a long while and haven't made a YouTube channel before, so it's been a lot of learning and growing, but has been a ton of fun. I've been streaming for a little over 2 years now, my co-host on and off for over a year, and the random streams together really just cemented it on making Loot Lads. We've spent a lot of time (and money by hiring artists, because hiring artists is a good thing) and effort on creating a relatively decent product, and I'm more and more proud of it as episodes are delivered. All about learning and growing.


We may have just started in September but we've been having a ton of fun with it, we have a wealth of content in the backlog that we're either proud of or "it's so dumb I can't help but love it" level of proud


I appreciate the spotlight, I cruise this place pretty frequently, try and give some feedback here and there, and raise as many ships as possible. If you like what we're doing, or have any questions on the back end with editing, recording, or any other technical questions feel free to reach out, I love chatting and helping people!


Take care, and thanks again!


Jekkus/Devon (and by extension probably Chris, my co-host, but I don't even think he uses Reddit?)
