Look up WW2 and tell me we're worth a shot again. Look up the manchester area bombing and tell me we're worth a shot again. Imagine being so fucking dumb and ignorant that you think it's a good thing to force people to be born into a world full of horrors and suffering. I think you're the real coward for pretending that life is a gift.
