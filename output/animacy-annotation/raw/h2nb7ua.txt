Oh, Thorin is certainly over-confident and ignorant of the dangers at this stage - I have to agree in that regard: your examples certainly demonstrate that (though I'd also argue waiting for Gandalf was certainly not an option... again, Thorin's point is logical - Gandalf isn't there, and time is running thin), but I still don't see why leaving Kili is bad.

I suppose there could be an argument that he is putting Kili in danger - if we are to take Bard's words as likely. Then again, it's certainly safer in Laketown than in Erebor imo. Hindsight aside.

I think, you could say leaving Kili *foreshadows* Thorin growing distant from his companions/nephews - as later we have the argument(s) between the two. But *in the moment*, I sill don't see it as a flaw of Thorin. But agree to disagree here, I think.

But I will agree that DoS is probably the best of the three for some of the reasons you mention. Though I have big gripes with it... it does have some good high points.
