No, its not a Kodak moment. Kodak was late and unaware that they cannot continue to be profitable by selling photographic film. PSA on the other hand is saying that it is not going to be easy transition. And if anything, long term, electric vehicles should expand vehicle lifetime with a lot less things to break, they should be more reliable than ICE counterparts. Electric engines can last for way, way longer then ICE. So, they are not wrong.
