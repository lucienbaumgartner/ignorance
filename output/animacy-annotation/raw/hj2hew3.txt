Awww you got your feelings hurt and didn’t like what someone said. You know calling someone cancer is a reportable offense.

Perhaps you should stop harassing me, crybaby. The mods were right, you need to shut the fuck up, boy.

Maybe learn to mind your own business.

You are so weak and ignorant that you have a thesis on what kind of person you are. You’re not special, you have brought nothing if interest to me today.

You’re someone just looking for conflict. You’re the cancer, you’re going to reply and think it’s some sweet comment, when in truth you’re just harassing me.

Leave me alone.
