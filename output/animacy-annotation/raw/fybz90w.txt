I’m afraid the US has already been thrust down that slippery slope by Trump. He has empowered the uneducated and ignorant that all inputs that they used to get that were reputable are fake: media, science, government etc etc. You see it everywhere now: people that ignore everything that doesn’t fit their world view, preferences or that feel the slightest bit uncomfortable. Even with Trump gone this will only get worse.
