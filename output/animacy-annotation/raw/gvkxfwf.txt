Who is doubling down? OP? The oil companies? Employees?


Every supermajor has announced major plans to pivot to renewables and cut carbon in the next couple of decades. Most cities are working to attract other businesses. But if you're a rig worker or chemist or whatever in your 40s with kids in school and a spouse who works at your company too, and family as childcare....you're saying it's their fault? They're dumb dumbs for getting into an industry that's closing down 20 years too early for them to retire out of it? They should move across the country, go back to school, and figure it out? 

Again, you seem really naive about what it's like to have a life somewhere and have your entire career trajectory slowly, slowly fade away. You're suggesting that it's an individual's fault, and it's quite gross and victim-blamey. Are you going to shame people born into a country that commits genocide or bombs someone else? I would hope not. Why blame someone who was born in an area with an industry that happened to start to die during their lifetime? Are you also blaming anyone in poverty in Detroit because hey, you should have seen it coming and left? It's so privileged and ignorant of the complex reality of the lives of adults with responsibilities and relationships.
