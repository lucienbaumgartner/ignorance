I think it makes some good points.

However, here in the west I would say that those protesting the loudest against such measures are not those truly impacted the most by them. The privileged who see masks as tyranny, consistently break anti-COVID measures purposefully and deliberately, don’t get vaccinated, etc. are truly the face of these types of things here. They are almost always right wing in their beliefs and are often so hypocritical and nonsensically childish that any points which they make which may hold a certain amount of water quickly fall apart. They are what I would deem useful idiots for the ruling class, and are incredibly anti-social in their behaviour (though this is not really their fault, it’s the predictable outcome of the processes which occur in the capitalist societies we live in).

Of course, we also have those who Fortnite dance on the graves of these people without seeing the tragedy of the reality we all face, which is a system which divides us and fills people’s brains with lies, while keeping us ignorant and bitter; at the end of the day, we are all just being tossed into the meat grinder, and there’s only one way to truly stop that.
