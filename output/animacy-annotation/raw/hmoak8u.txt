Yep, I've had friends in the past month who've had all the symptoms and were miserable for a full week testing negative on both rapid and PCR multiple times that first week until finally testing positive the next week.

Many people who might start feeling a little off this time of year might chalk it up to allergies or a seasonal thing, get tested, come up negative, and go about their lives as normal while being infectious and unaware of that until testing positive after a week of going around and exposing countless others. 

My biggest concern is for variants to be able to dodge initial detection. If a random mutation pops up giving a variant that ability along with other mutations increasing the odds of re-infection, it could spread like OG covid did when it first arrived.
