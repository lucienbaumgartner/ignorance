How is this either news or misery? 

The only people who would book flights during a pandemic must have taken into account that it could, and most likely would, be canceled at any time. 

Unless, ofcourse, people are ignorant and stupid, and feel like the restrictions are for everyone but themselves. 

Im feeling happy that the tens of thousands humans are missing their flights.
