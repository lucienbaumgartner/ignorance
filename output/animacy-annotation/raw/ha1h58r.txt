Personally, I don't think getting a gun is necessary. Pepper spay will subdue anyone, and it's a lot let dangerous for everyone involved. 

I would recommend just staying alert when you are in public. Targets of street crimes are usually people who are distracted and unaware of their surroundings. Also, follow your gut! You'd be surprised how many things you can avoid by keeping your eyes open and listening to your intuition.

Also, don't forget to have fun!!! You're starting something new, and that's always scary. But I'm sure you'll make a bunch of friends and you'll be feeling at home in no time!!!
