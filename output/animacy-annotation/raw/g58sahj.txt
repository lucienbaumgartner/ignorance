As a socialist here’s my take: We are a capitalistic society meaning we require a “rich” class and a “poor” class. The Middle East is unstable and unpredictable as hell.

If a capitalist system is to be maintained you either create inequality between your people and keep them happy and unaware of the expat through strong nationalism or you drag your own people through a decline and cut them into two pieces making a small portion rich and the rest poor ala USA. Considering this is such a small country option one would be far better for the economy and for the citizen. Option 2 requires a strong economic downturn.

If you don’t want a capitalist society then you get stabbed in the bag by the USA, your former ally
