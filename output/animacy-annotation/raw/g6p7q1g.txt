Is it just me or has the drop in quality of this sub become increasingly visible as of lately. Not that this sub was ever incredibly high quality or anything, but the self righteousness but disregard of skepticism from many of the posts here seems to have become more concentrated. People seem increasingly hypocritical and unaware of their own comments on others these days. Like wtf is with the posting of bogus polling or making fun of tik tok kids’ voices and some shit. I have noticed that I’m beginning to see more hostility in questioning the heard as of recently than I have in the past. Perhaps it’s just an above average busier week for that type of stuff and not that it’s becoming more common as a pattern. I hope it doesn’t continue but I see this sub falling into the realms of every other political sub on the site. Feel free to prove me wrong.
