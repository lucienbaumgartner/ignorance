And you're not dead though right? Like, did you watch a movie one time or something where they said vaccines are always 100% effective or where did you get that idea?

Like, this was like completely shocking to you that you still got the virus or what? And did you just ignore the information that this could happen, but that you would have a much lower probability of getting sick and dying from Covid because you are vaccinated?

Like seriously, you people here denying the efficacy of the shots because some vaccinated people can still get Covid -- you're literally just ignorant and unaware of how you're ignorant.
