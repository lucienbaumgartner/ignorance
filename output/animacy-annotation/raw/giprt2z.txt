...But you do understand why hate speech is a bad thing, right? Doesn't matter which political parties, Left or Right, uses hate speech to push a political agenda. It's bad for everyone.

Otherwise, I could just say this about you... *"people who love American Football is pathetic morons who can't make a good living, gotta gamble on games to get by. May have to suck a couple of dick if you lose a game or two. Anything to put food on their DIY cardboard table."*  This sort of attack is completely wrong and ignorant of me to make such claim about you, but hey! It doesn't matter, right? Freedom of speech! Nothing I say has to be true or nice...  *cus Merica boi!*

How about stop being a moron and be a decent person for once?  If that's too hard, then try being decent once a month and see how that goes.
