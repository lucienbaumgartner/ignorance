Okay guys, what's the SCP entry about the abandoned, 'haunted' school where there were reports of the original students showing up in the classrooms, asleep, and unaware that several decades had passed?  There was some spatial distortion, and a long exploration description, too.

edit: Nevermind, I found it.  It's 026.  Hook me up, Marvin.
