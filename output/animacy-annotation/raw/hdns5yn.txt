It was a good trick tho admit it. What people hate is socialism - but think they hate capitalism. They also did a similar mind fuck with the political parties. I grew up thinking leftist policies were pro personal liberty - I was taught that in school in fact. And then they call statism “liberal” politics. The whole thing is intentionally misleading and murky as hell to keep people totally confused and ignorant of terms and definitions. Actually super clever. It worked!
