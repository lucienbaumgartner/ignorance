The problem is most people don't think they are extreme. And most people don't realize factors involving "moderation". 

If a Moderate tells "extreme" Israelis to "get along with Nazis", then eventually Nazis kill the Israelis and the moderates as well. 

This, is a bit of the simplified thing I sometimes note:

The Tsar exiled Lenin. The republic let Lenin in. Lenin killed them all. 

Even when the Tsar thought that the republic wasn't extreme, they were effectively extreme. As it was they who led the way to extremism. 

There is also understanding of consequences. I recall when I served one point that was noted in missions was due to the down range impacts of some things, sometimes a 1-2 hour delay could cascade into a multi-day delay resulting in soldier deaths. 

Often, moderate mindset continually argues "but it is only an hour". While this isn't necessarily evil as might be being advocated by a spy or such, it is intrinsically ignorant and wrong in an equally detrimental reality to the same effect as the spy.
