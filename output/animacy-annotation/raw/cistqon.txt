I don't like that thinking.  If an attacker uses an implement to penetrate their victim the attacker isn't being gratified.  But that doesn't reduce the amount they're victimizing someone.

If a victim is unconscious uninjured and unaware that they'd been attacked (in either sense) - does their lack of genuine trauma excuse their attacker?  (of course it doesn't)
