I’ve been told r/herpes is a good sub for support and dating advice for people with herpes, or people who want to understand it more. 

Personally I think the stigma of having herpes is worse than the infection itself. A large majority of the population have it, but not everyone knows they have it because most of the people who have it are asymptomatic and unaware that they have it. 

Herpes does not kill people, or cause cancers, or infertility. It’s a minor annoyance from time to time, that’s about it. And you can treat it with antivirals to shorten the outbreak. 

I do believe in being upfront about it to potential partners and to use protection to minimize the risk of spreading. 

Best of luck op!!
