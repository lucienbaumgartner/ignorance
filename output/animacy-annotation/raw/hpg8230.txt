So you are refusing to have a conversation and just ignore my points?

This will be my last attempt to have a conversation. While yes, SOME are communist, the MAJORITY are not. It is important to understand your oppositions side so you can PROPERLY debate the opposite side. Not just DEBATE but to also find COMMON GROUND so you can CONVERT them to your side.

To disregard a whole section of America is NO DIFFERENT then what Hillary Clinton did calling hard working Americans "deplorables". It's ignorant and disingenuous.

I will add this since you will probably refuse to read any of this. Communism is evil. Communism has done more harm to the better of the world then any other ideology. The youth are not all communist. If you firmly believe that, you are part of the problem.
