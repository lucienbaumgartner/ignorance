It's not 99% of the rest of the world since we alone make up 18% of it.

Also when has the world caring about something been the barometer for deciding which issues are important? If you're too ignorant and stupid to tell India and Pakistan apart that's your problem. I can certainly tell apart a terrorist nation from my own. 

I don't want to make Pakistanis look bad, they do a splendid job of it themselves. I'd happily not give a shit about them if they stopped attacking my country first. 

"You are identical except religion" 

Lmao no, culture, ethnicity, language, governance, military, geography are also some of the few aspects that are completely different. 

Also what a stupid statement, identical except religion? Like religion is some small aspect of life that can be dismissed just so we can pretend we're all alike and have no differences or issues with each other. 

Don't scroll so far next time.
