Ok I guess you're really fucking dumb and don't even understand the most basic concepts of living in reality. Go to a doctor i think you have some severe brain damage or just general mental retardation.

So when you are asleep you are unconscious and unaware of the world around you. You can not do anything to effect the world around you and you are unable to defend yourself if needed. The reverse is true when you are awake. I hope you get the medical care for the severe head injury you must have received
