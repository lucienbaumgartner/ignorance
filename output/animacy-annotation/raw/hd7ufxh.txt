Yeah - coming to work is now more exhausting than ever; 

Covid protocols, arguing with adults about masks, working double time with less staff, putting up with selfish and unaware customers, being on ei every lockdown, working 12 hours in a hot kitchen understaffed, soon the vaccine passport, and our product service provider not having ingredients or chemicals needed to have consistent product. 

12.55 is not enough, 20 is not enough. Recently, we lost our KM, the new KM is going to leave unless they are paid more than 18/hr. Iâ€™m leaving because they (higher ups and managers) are stuck in their old ways, unwilling to offer pay raises, unwilling to help out regulars, and unaware of the actual stresses of our day to day work.

Things will change, but I think more and more restaurants will shut down before then.
