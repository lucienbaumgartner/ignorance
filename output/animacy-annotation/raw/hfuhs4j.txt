I don’t think you’ll find many of the duo-led true crime podcasts to be super respectful. Most of them are very banter heavy, and everyone struggles at keeping things light while maintaining respect. Honestly I just don’t really like listening to two people *discuss* a case. I want to hear the reporting, and pretty much any commentary takes away from it and makes it feel a little skeezy to me. 

Casefile is gold standard for true crime podcasts, but it is an individual telling you the story. I don’t find him to be robotic at all, but it’s probably not the most engaging for you. The thing is that they’re very well written, cover the cases in great detail, and are very respectful. 

Crime Junkie is hated here because of plagiarism (which tbh I think is at least a little overblown but ah well, I feel like you’re very capable of researching that and making your own call). They’re the only duo I care to listen to, but they can still be grating at times. A lot of really dumb questions get asked just to prompt the main host to tell the next big, etc., the hosts seem extremely sheltered and unaware of the real world on many levels. But I find them to be more respectful than most, and they’ve made some efforts at covering cases of missing POC and other marginalized, under-reported cases, and that means a fuck ton to me.
