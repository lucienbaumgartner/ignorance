Well, it's very circumstancial, isn't it? You did IVF out of state, which makes me think your local care centers don't have a lot of experience with it. Seeing "natural" fertilizations may make that particular OB complacent and unaware of the ah, quirks of IVF pregnancies. IVF pregnancies have more early bleeding, more chances of multiples, more breech babies, and more c-sections.
