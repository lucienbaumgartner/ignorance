I think most people are just weak as fuck. As harsh as it sounds, most people in the US are so ignorant and lazy and indoctrinated that theyâ€™re waiting for SOMEONE to save them, SOMETHING to cure them, SOMEONE else to fix their problems. If you take care of yourself and respect the health of people around you, things would be just fine. How the fuck did humanity exist for thousands of years without all of this bullshit? They just used common sense and did what was needed to fix your own problems. Free your mind, fix yourself and thats all you can do.
