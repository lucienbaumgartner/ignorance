Communicating in a matter that is as inoffensive as possible is what mannerisms are for, not for anyone government, or person to determine, certainly not to dictate. Cancel culture is toxic, but ultimately is another faucet of our culture that the government can’t intervene in because it would require an amount of control over what people can say, which would be hypocritical. You could say that your arguing for people to recognize PC boundaries, without the government control and PC police. Also I’d like to add that it’s possible but it doesn’t happen, only authoritarians convict people of crimes before they are committed. 

A post-Modernist sees nothing but groups, but I see individuals with differing opinions and levels at to which I agree with them on. If you see nothing but different factions battling it out to the end, you are a tribalist and a post-modernist. An anti-skeptic is a tribalist because tribalist only change their opinion when the tribe does, not to mention how arrogant and ignorant of history it is to believe you are right about everything.

That is one part I completely agree with Dawkins, religious freedom is very integral to a functioning civilization. However I start to disagree once we get into how he views religion as a whole, which is exactly how I previously viewed it.
