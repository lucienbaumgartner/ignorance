Go watch Kemi Badenock's speech about it in parliament.

Even a cursory glance at articles and books about CRT shows it completely ignores the individual and individualism and renders everything and everyone down to what group(s) they are a member of.

Aside from the fact its extremely Amerocentric and should therefore not be given the time of day outside of the US, its adherents call for what is effectively a segregated society. They demand that free things be given to people who belong to groups that have 'historical grievances', which in every example given by CRT adherents is for non-white demographics to demand stuff from white people.

Despite the fact that those same groups were victims of other groups, often to a far higher degree and also despite the fact that historically white people have suffered at the hands of many, many different non-white groups and cultures.

CRT is historically illiterate and ignorant, and is based on lies, collectivist thinking and petulance.

One example of a lie they tell is by trying to link modern day policing to slave patrols in the US. This is untrue in the extreme both in the US and elsewhere.

Modern policing the the UK is traces back to Sir Robert Peel (no relation at all to the slave trade), with most European police systems being variations on that. 

In the US, social scientists and the then-newly created posts of 'criminologists' advocated for a full time professional force in the early 1800's to deal with an explosion in the crime rate driven by the fact more and more people were flocking to the cities due to the industrial revolution. The oldest police forces in the US are, as far as I can find, are in northern non-slaving states and the oldest police forces specifically are the New York and Boston police forces.

The more you read, the more CRT starts to look like a bad joke.
