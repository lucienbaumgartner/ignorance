My conditioning is almost broken but I still have some reflexive libtardness.  Truly, I still reflexively type and say things that upon further examination, I don't really believe.

I know one thing though, Hillary (C)linton must be stopped at all costs.

Until recently I thought Trump was a willing Clinton plant to help her throw the election.  Then I thought he was being played for a Chump by the Clintons.

Wikileaks bears that out, elevating him to Pied Piper status, because the Democratic elite thought we were all still unaware and compliant. They only wanted him in the race to puff him up as some horrible scary Russian agent because no way would someone like Hillary (C)linton win otherwise.
