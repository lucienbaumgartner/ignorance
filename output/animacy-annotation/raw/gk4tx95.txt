The GG is appointed by the Prime Minister but serves as one of the only real checks on the PMs power. It’s his responsibility to appoint them but it’s not the first or the last time a PM has/will appoint a GG who favours them. 

Many PMs don’t appoint them based on their suitability for the job because it could hinder them in the future if they aren’t indifferent or supportive to their PM.

Short answer, yes it falls on Trudeau but he’s not the only PM to appoint someone not necessarily suited or prepared for the job. However this is the first GG in several years who has been so blatantly unprepared and unaware of their responsibilities as GG
