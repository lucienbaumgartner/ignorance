It's being rushed to keep you crybaby's happy. Trump and plenty of other logical people know we have no reason to rush a vaccine, or lock down and act like the world's on fire. For whatever reason though, the left tunes into cnn &amp; reddit 

(ran by the good ole ccp,no wonder china is portrayed as perfection here)

Yet still can't grasp that they're being bullshitted. Y'all cried for a vaccine and your great President say's no problem I'll put everyone on it &amp; get it here for you quick as possible!

 Even though he knows it's just pissing money away &amp; not needed at this point. More of us than you think already have herd immunity. The weak already died off for the most part hense cases dropping for 5 weeks strait. 

The one's depending on the Govt. to hold your hand and tell you it's safe to walk outside now, after you drastically weaken your immune system by sheltering inside a house for 8 months btw. That will be the next cluster of infections/deaths. They're in for a big reality check when a vaccine that works 60% of the time at best, probably closer to 40% in reality. Is the only thing you have to count on to save your ass from getting phenomena &amp; getting vented. We all know once you're vented your ass is grass. If covid don't kill you the vent will.  

TL/DR Trump does what you ask &amp; you're still so ungrateful and ignorant that now it's his fault it's being rushed.. definitely not the dem clan pushing fear to it's followers and making a mountain out of a mole hill right? In what universe was a vaccine &amp; a rushed one at that..Trump's idea? That was pelosi and fauci the fraud trying to use your sanity as leverage to turn their money printer back on. If Trump didn't have to coddle the entire left like they're a bunch of adult children then we would have went with herd immunity &amp; been stronger as a country for it. But, The Adult Children had to make it political as with everything from that side of the fence.
