&gt;What separates art from not art.

This is a trick question - the answer is 'Whatever each particular individual thinks separates according to their own particular definition of art"

Which is exactly why people disagree on this stuff in the first place. It's entirely subjective. 

&gt;Blindness and ignorance are not character flaws or personal attacks.

That's rather blind and ignorant of you to say. 

&gt;Saying that "art is pointless" is demonstrably incorrect.

If someone agrees with you on what the point of art is supposed to be, sure that's demonstrable. But the people you're disagreeing with almost certainly don't agree on what the point is. 

&gt;Yes, my bias is believing that art exists and matters. You got me.

Well... perhaps you should reflect on that
