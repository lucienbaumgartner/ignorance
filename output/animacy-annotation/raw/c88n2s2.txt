While I'm all for education on economics and financially responsibility, I think many people still missed the point of the article.  Those people that are eating burgers and smoking cigarettes are not necessarily uneducated and unaware that they are wasting money on fast food and ciggarettes.  They are enjoying them because they are the few pleasures they get out of life.  Would it make more sense to spend that $15-$20 on grocceries?  Definitely.  But smoking is coping mechanism and they are addicting now.  Quitting is stressful and they are already stressed all the time, one more stressor may be too much.  And if they don't have money for grocceries, then they probably don't have food in the house to grab and eat.  Poor or not, if you're hungry, you just want to eat.  And, again, fast food may by one of the few pleasures for them.  

I do think everyone should be learning better personal finance skills early on, but that is not going to do much to fix a broken system.  All of the budgeting in the world isn't going to helpd when you aren't making a living wage.  It may actually be more beneficial to educate the young and wealthy so they do not continue to perpetuate this consumer-driven economy that tramples those that can't keep up.  I think of the third and forth graders my son knows who bring expensive electronics to school.  (First off, I was pretty shocked when so many had iPhones and pads). I asked my son of they were worried about them being stolen or broken, he said no, they would just get a new one.  He, on the other hand does worry about bringing his video game to school becuase it would not be so easy for us to just replace it.  I think it is important for kids to understand the value of money.  Just because you have $300 to replace something, doesn't mean it makes sense to be careless with it.
