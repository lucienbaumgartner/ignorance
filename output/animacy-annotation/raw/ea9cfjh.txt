&gt;So how can A be true if people apparently decide based on B? And even if just half people choose A, stores would still be able to exist.

Because people are stupid and unaware that they are hurting themselves and others by their actions *in the long term.* 

The profit margins for stores is far thinner than you think it is for remaining open. If a third of people just drive over the county line and get their stuff, that's a third of the potential income gone for the store, who have no control over the taxes they are forced to charge.

The store then doesn't make a profit large enough to remain open and is forced to shut down. 

Now all of the people without personal transportation have to go further by bus (if possible) or beg rides to get their services in the next county over. Making it harder for these people to get the things they need. 

This is shit that happens. 

This is basically what Walmart does to small businesses. 

The reason it works in other places is because they have different tax systems. We would need to rework *everything* into one universal tax % across the country to fix an issue which honestly, isn't worth the humongous hassle in time and political fighting it would cause.
