I hope you realize how stupid and ignorant that argument is. Per capita emissions show who pollutes more, while total emissions don't really do that. They also show which countries are doing more against emissions. Example: China has around around 29% of the global emissions, while the US has 16%, yet China has more than 4.5 times the amount of people the US has. Do you see how totals make less sense? More people means more pollution.
