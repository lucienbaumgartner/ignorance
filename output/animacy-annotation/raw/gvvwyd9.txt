Hey Moonshot, just so you know, I am invested in Inovio because I do see this as an emerging platform. In my opinion, the market response to the withdrawal of DoD funding for phase III INO-4800 was a simplistic and guttural overreaction. Americans tend to be narrow minded and ignorant of the rest of the world. The potential for INO-4800 in the rest of the world is either unaffected by last Friday's news or it is positively affected by the divorce from handling by the FDA. Whatever potential Inovio had last Thursday is the same that it has tomorrow. If INO-4800 passes scientific scrutiny in China, it's still game on. Yes, we've lost some money on the stock price. But, it was hardly moving for a long time. What we really need is positive scientific data and a transition to phase III. I believe that will come before June.  Cheers.
