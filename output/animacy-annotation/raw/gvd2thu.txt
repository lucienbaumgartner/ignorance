Deaine was a female channeler who lived on the Seanchan continent at the time of Luthair Paendrag Mondwin's invasion in FY 992 where nations were mostly controlled by this channelers and no nation trusted the other. In fact at that time all female channelers in Seanchan proclaimed themselves to be Aes Sedai, but they were completely independent and unaware of the White Tower. Contrary to those grouped in the White Tower, these Seanchan Aes Sedai frequently fought each other, and they used the One Power as a weapon or to enslave people.
