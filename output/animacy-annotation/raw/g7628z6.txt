If there is no agreeing and disagreeing there is no culture. Are we all islands floating in the Ocean, unconnected and unaware of each other?

You haven’t heard me, perhaps you can hear Chuang Tzu: “Many are the men in the world who apply themselves to doctrines and policies, and each believe he has something that cannot be improved upon...But the world is in great disorder, the worthies and sages lack clarity of vision, and the Way and its Virtue are no longer One. So the world too often seizes upon one of its aspects, examines it, and pronounces it good. But it is like the case of the ear, the eye, the nose, and the mouth: each has its own kind of understanding, but their functions are not interchangeable. In the same way, the various skills of the hundred schools all have their strong points, and at times each may be of use. But none is wholly sufficient, none is universal. The scholar cramped in one corner of learning tries to judge the beauty of Heaven and earth, to pry into the principles of the ten thousand things, to scrutinize the perfection of the ancients, but seldom is he able to encompass the true beauty of Heaven and earth, to describe the true face of holy brightness.”

You have misunderstood me enough and wrangled too much, I have had my fill. You want to peddle the works of Jung, go on. As yet, from you or from him I see no wisdom that reveals itself. 

If you had asked ‘how is this different from the Tao, and how might we understand these things in comparison,’ we could have had a discussion and not a thinly veiled argument. Your posture reveals your inner nature, as does mine. I have continued on longer than my better judgment, and now I’m off.
