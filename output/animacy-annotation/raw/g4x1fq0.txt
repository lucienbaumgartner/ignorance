&gt; Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Doesn't make sense to me. Farmers became oppressors? How? 

IMO the biggest mistake India made was to glorify and idolize poverty and demonize modernity. We should have pushed farmers out of a non-viable profession instead of telling them it is a noble profession.
