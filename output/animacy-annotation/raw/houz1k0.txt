Yeah that was probably unwarranted. Like I said, hate taking the hard line but too many people seem to get off on immediately discounting any change or advancement in technology, assuming that what we currently have is working so well. It's so small minded and ignorant that people need to snap out of it. 

The world's food supply is fkd and is only going to get worse as the climate continues to change. Nobody is comparing costs of vertical farming to traditional farming in the past 100 years, they're talking about the next 100. Traditional farming isn't going to cut it, and is going to get very expensive to keep operating. Might have free sunshine going for it but it also relies heavily on water, fossil fuels and hell if a lot of infrastructure to make it all happen. The world is rapidly losing its arable land and we'll need alternative farming methods to make up for it. Nobody is saying park the tractors we got a better idea... it's to be used in addition to, not in replacement of. Localizing and stabilizing food production closer to urban areas where it's needed most is just sensible whether it's efficient or not. It'll become more feasible soon anyway with the current exponential growth of tech like renewable energy and power storage, as well as our advancements in building science and engineering. 

So IMHO it's just dumb to hate on concepts or tech earlier in its implementation or development. So it gets a dumbdumb response idk
