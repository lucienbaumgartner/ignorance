This is a fallacy. The media mix is changing. But there is only marketing. Just about any profession would be in bad shape if it was unaware and resistant to changing conditions and modern technology, and marketing has always been a leader in technology adoption. 

Sure there are people who can't accept change and you find them in any industry. 

Online folk -- in order to bolster their egos -- created the fiction of an online elite who have the  secret knowledge that electricity and information appliances are an up and comer. My god, the 1990's have got to be the longest damn decade of all time -- everybody is convinced it's still going on. 

There are no Amish marketers. No conspiracy theory I know of has anybody thinking the internet causes cancer. If you want to put out a dead tree flyer and you comprehend marketing, there's no sane reason you can't have a potential success for the right business. 

There is no tradition in marketing save "What's Working Now." Not ten years ago, twenty, fifty -- right now. You may be the general manager of a company -- you stick to DOS instead of recognizing the dominance of Windows -- you're out of a job.

Are online marketoids so insecure they have to have a straw man argument against traditional media, old school marketing, and anybody over the age of thirty? I don't think it's necessary. You either look out for your career and learn what's new -- secretary, plumber, marketing agency head -- or you get run over. Period. 

Where is Amazon? Going offline. It's not some crazy notion, but it is where traditional online marketing fears to tread. I can't really tell which side in this fictional either-or crap is more obtuse and calcified in its' response to the electric information appliance computer have become. 

I get it. You're of the now. Digerati and proud. You of all people recognized electricity was going to be big one day. Good for you. Get over it.
