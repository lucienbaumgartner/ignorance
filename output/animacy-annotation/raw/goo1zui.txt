I was calm until I saw your comment. I really don’t think you understand how rude and ignorant of you it was for you to come with the tone of “you’re going to get married to somebody else anyway and not have the same last name as your daughter so you might as well just give the father exactly what he wants anyway”. It was also very condescending and patronising, just so you know.
