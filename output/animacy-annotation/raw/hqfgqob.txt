NTA.... For this reason only.... You stood up for yourself and defended your partner; they can GFK.... No, you probably shouldn't have burst into their room but frankly they were being ignorant and disrespectful AF (especially since everything you're doing is boiling down to the fact that you're treating your partner respectfully and honoring her wishes and life goals) and it serves them right to have it thrown back into their faces; especially since your partner thought it was funny and wasn't offended by it; her support is all that matters.

I'm petty AF, so I would honestly allude to that moment in your grooms speech at the wedding and call his ass out.... Somehow; of course get the blessing of your spouse first ðŸ˜‰ (tho I don't felt like it'll be a problem with her)
