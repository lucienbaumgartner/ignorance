I would do the same - directly quote to your doctor, with your husband present, the crap he has been saying and allow the doctor to educate his ass on the topic. Though it may be coming from a place of wanting you to be healthy, him criticizing you and putting you down for something completely out of your control is detrimental on so many levels.

He may be completely ignorant and unaware of the woes of pregnancy (due to culture, education, etc) so give him access to education by means of your doctor or family/friends. Please, donâ€™t fall victim to his degradation and know that growing life is beautiful. Your body is kick ass and doing such amazing things.
