I’m sorry but what are you two talking about??? 

The book is literally titled “Genji Monogatari.” The English translation being “A Tale of Genji” is erroneous at best because the book is about several “Genjis” (singular and plural nouns are not differentiated as a matter of course in Japanese). That clues us into what the story is about. 

The book, while certainly written by a woman for a mainly woman audience, is not centered around the women in the book. They are conquests for the multiple Genji characters. And as messed up as it sounds, many audience members probably self-inserted themselves into the novel because the idea of a “Shining Prince Genji” who was handsome, smart, rich, and ignorant of boundaries (as were most men at the time, but the OG Genji was just more so, which made him even sexier somehow) was enticing to them like the ancient equivalent of 50 Shades of Gray. 

I personally would not list this book as a piece of feminist literature. It just feels gross to say it. OG Genji literally grooms a child named Murasaki (self-insert, perhaps?), rapes her at a young age (even her ladies in waiting objected because of how young she was), and makes her his “main” wife. But even she’s just a surrogate for Fujitsubo who is a surrogate for his dead mother that he strangely wants to bang because he had to grow up without her and that messed up his psyche. 

I’m rambling now, but if self-insert anime fanfiction with pedophilia and overly rapey male protagonists is feminist literature, then fine I guess. I just don’t agree. 

A think if you’re looking for a feminist book from that same era you should read “The Pillow Book” or “Makura no Soushi” by Sei Shounagon. It’s the collected musings of an empress’s court lady and they are hilarious!
