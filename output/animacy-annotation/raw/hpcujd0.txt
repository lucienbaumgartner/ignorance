They all suck so bad at it that’s why. 

It’s also boiled down to recruiting firms who put quotas and commission on recruiters; and these recruiters are not sales people. Most are young, ignorant, and inexperienced. They do zero candidate research any more, just web crawl LinkedIn and send generic messages. 

Not trying to brag at all, but I get head hunted multiple times per week. I like to think I have a strong resume but it’s more so my industry and related INdustries are difficult to hire for (special and unique skill sets).  I used to get thorough, well thought out and researched messages and emails. Now they are all lazy as hell, with zero personalization or effort. 

If I’m just a number in the recruiting process and you can’t put in any effort now, that tells me a lot about what I need to know.
