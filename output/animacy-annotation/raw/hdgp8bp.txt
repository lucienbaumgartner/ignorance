Just because we haven't found the physical cause doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We don't know what causes some people to like mustard and other people to hate it. Does that mean mustard lovers were sexually abused too?

On second thought, I just noticed you're also a 9/11 truther, a covid denier, and a *proud* racist, which is just unbelievable to me. It's hard to even try to have a discussion with someone so delusional and ignorant of science because there's no common ground here. It's just not worth the time. I don't even have a good recommendation for you because clearly, what you think constitutes 'research' led you to think these idiotic things in the first place.
