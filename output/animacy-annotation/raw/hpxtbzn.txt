I really don't know what I think anymore. I feel betrayed, ignored, frustrated and angry and bitter... I just don't know.

I don't think Luke and Kevin are bad people. I know they didn't intend for things to turn out this way. But the problem is, they've been praised too much, for too long. They just don't think they need any outside input or feedback anymore.

Basically, they're just ignorant and lazy. Not malicious. They just aren't who I thought they were. They are treating SMG4 as just another source of money. It's not special like it once was, designed to make people laugh, smile, and forget their troubles at least for as long as the episode lasted. But now, with characters dying and sadness and loss being regular parts of the show... it's just not what I signed up for. Like I've said before, I can't even laugh or smile at the newest episodes. There's just not the same feeling to them. And it's not just because of how deeply hurt I am by Axol's death. They just don't have the "soul" that they once had. It feels so corporatized and generic.

At the end of the day, the Hobo Bros. are businessmen. They are out to make money. And as long as people keep buying what they're selling, they won't be inclined to stop.
