If you like ML princes who spend their early years disguised as a girl and also are incredibly homicidal may I interest you Your Majesty, Please Don't Kill Me Again? 

You will start reading it and you will say to yourself "holy shit I hate the ML, I don't want her to end up with this complete monster", but if you keep reading you'll realize *he's* not the draw of this story, Lariette is. The FL might come off at first blush as someone who's weak, ignorant, and completely powerless, but that's what's so great about her, she has *nothing* to her advantage, so she has no choice but to bow down to the person she despises and fears most in a desperate bid to save her family, she's just so *mentally* strong in a way you don't usually see in FLs, and it's also great how she doesn't immediately forget how much she hates the ML, her fear and trauma and hatred burn strong within her and persist for a long time.

She also has just such amazing character growth; because she started off so ignorant and sheltered, you really get to go along on this journey with her where she opens her eyes to what's really been going on around her that she never saw in her first life, and her perspective changes from purely black and white, good and bad, to incorporate shades of grey as she learns there was a lot more to the story than she first thought
