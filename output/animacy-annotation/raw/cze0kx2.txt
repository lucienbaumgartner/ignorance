If he dodged you that well than he must have significantly outplayed you. The only situation where you dont have time to react is point blank crits, which tough break removed, so the minicrit, and lowered resists in addition to the charge drain should not have been necessary.

And before you mention corners I should add that demoknights have a very loud distinct audio cue, like spies decloaking once you learn to listen for it its easy to know when a demoknights coming and react accordingly. Like spy knight was a class that prays on unaware and ignorant players. I used to think spy was OP in my first few hundred hours, than I learned to pay attention to the behavior of my allies and listen for decloaks. When the tide turner came out I thought it was a tad too strong too, then I did the same thing with spy and thought it was a weak but fun and situational gimmick, which it was, now its just straight up trash and since tough break I have been far more useful at being a backline harassment demo with the sticky jumper, which offers mobility thats not restricted to a 12 second cooldown.
