Vargas and Bruce were fine signings no clue why you bundle them in. Cuddeyer I agree with was odd but Frazier provided your depth you were complaining about and swarzak was coming off a fine year. [also pretty sure](https://i.imgur.com/r2UhzhK.jpg) regardless how you talk to the Wilpons their desire was to reduce spending when sandy took over. Let’s not forget why he was hired as well. He was sent to us by selig in order to fix the Mets after the madoff debacle. “Sandy just didn’t want to do that” is quite possibly the most unaware and obtuse statement I’ve ever heard of regarding Mets payroll. In 2017 the Mets sucked so of course he traded away expiring deals. He didn’t trade away top 15 prospects for billy fucking Hamilton.
