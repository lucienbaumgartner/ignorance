No, I’m just sick of seeing these posts made by people who have no idea what they’re talking about. You’re not sticking it to the hedgies and it’s got nothing to do with the 99% sticking it to the 1%. That’s an ignorant and uninformed statement. The ONLY thing affecting AMC’s price is emotion from retail and institutions alike

That statement *could* apply to what DFV uncovered with GME a year ago, but that’s not what’s going on now
