The big difference is that most of the world's population was unaware and unable to influence the land bridge colonization of the Americas. Not so with Mars. It takes finesse and ability to land consistently on Mars. It doesn't take much to toss a bomb at a dome. For that matter it doesn't take much for someone inside that dome to burst everyone's bubble. 

Anything with people on Mars requires the tacit or active agreement of other nations, and I am not talking about the Outer Space Treaty.
