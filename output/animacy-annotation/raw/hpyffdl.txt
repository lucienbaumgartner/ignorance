Jordan Peterson was once asked if he should support gay marriage rights and said no because it was supported by Cultural Marxists. Anyone who thinks you have to be a Marxist to support gay marriage is a fucking right wing nut job.

His audience is so rabidly right wing, he has on multiple occasions had to “Answer the Jewish Question” which is clearly code for some straight up anti-Semitic nazi shit. He once referred to this as “One hell of a question.” He also thinks Hitler was an “evil genius”. Which is also a coded message by pretending to denounce Hitler while calling him a genius. He also said that the reason Hitler did the Holocaust was because he was “obsessed with cleaning.” This is also clearly anti-Semitic nazi shit. It’s a justification for hitlers actions all defended by his audience as “just an explanation of why Hitler did what he did.” Which has been debunked multiple times. Hitler committed the Holocaust because hated Jewish people because he was an idiotic racist bigot who was ignorant and stupid.

He routinely remarks about how European culture as defined through Christianity is the best in the world. 

Anything he doesn’t like is Cultural Marxism. Even though Marxism is about the economy and not culture.

He’s just a guru who sells people self help and then spits off right wing talking points.

Anyone with a brain can see passed his pseudo intellectual BS. Being knowledgeable as a psychologist doesn’t give you magical insight into every topic in the world, especially when you misunderstand history so much.
