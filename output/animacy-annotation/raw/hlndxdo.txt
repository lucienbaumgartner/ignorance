Sasta internet has enabled unaware and uneducated people from every point on the political spectrum to become increasingly relevant. Hence the sane voices on every side get lost in the chaos. Sasta internet has definitely revolutionised our country but it has its downsides as well. On a more positive note, itâ€™s kinda relieving to see people giving shit to Modi for repealing the farm laws; shows that there is a lot less andhbhakti in our country than people usually think there is.
