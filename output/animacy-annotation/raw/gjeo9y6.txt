Yea same I’m on 300mg a night but take one when ever.. like 600mg and a beer and a joint I’m good... the benzoez wasn’t cutting it.. so I told my gp iwamt to try pregab.... it 100% reduces my anxiety but at the same time I take them to feel dopey sleepy and unaware of what’s going on and that ain’t right I hate it I’ve swapped benzodiazepine and zolpidem for Pregabalin still taking till to fit in f the world Acc naa the people in it the world is cool... ok cool
