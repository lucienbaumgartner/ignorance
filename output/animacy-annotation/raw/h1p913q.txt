If someone goes to a black person saying they’re not born here without any evidence it’s racist. 


He only said it to Ted Cruz after the media called out his hypocrisy. 



Clearly, you are not black so you don’t know what it’s like to be on the reviving end of racism towards black people. You have zero credibility. You are obtuse and ignorant of what racism or dog whistles mean. 


Going to a Black person and saying they’re not American is the equivalent of saying “ go back to your country” if you don’t recognize that you are an idiot. 


Just because you are too stupid and ignorant to know what racism sounds like doesn’t mean it isn’t racist. 



And it isn’t because Obama is just black. It’s called context with American history. Sorry you’re uneducated. Educate yourself and stop asking stupid ass questions thanks.
