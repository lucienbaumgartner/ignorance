Proof?

You need proof?

You just cried about the news story itself, but you need me to **prove the details of the story TO YOU?**

Are you people this goddamn ill-informed and ignorant that you don't even know the basic goddamn facts of the stupid shit you're bitching about?

Or did you just pathetically whine about the 'bomb' and intended to *LIE* about it just because you thought you were going to score some cheap political victory?

#["A pipe bomb was reportedly found at RNC headquarters and destroyed by authorities, and a suspicious package arrived at DNC headquarters"](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/a-pipe-bomb-was-reportedly-found-at-rnc-headquarters-and-destroyed-by-authorities-and-a-suspicious-package-arrived-at-dnc-headquarters/ar-BB1cwYaO?ocid=uxbndlbing)

This is why the right thinks you garbage are irreparable fucking demons: you just asked me to 'prove' a key aspect of a news story YOU YOURSELF INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.
