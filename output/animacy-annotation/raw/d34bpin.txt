&gt; Anime/Manga where the MC has a special power but they're the only one with a power

{Kotoura-san} *deconstructs* this. Psychic abilities are so rare in this setting, even its science is literally unaware and unassuming that they exist. Our tragic MC just happens to be born with telepathy that's always on and thus grew up without knowing any better about said special power. This is only the first 10 minutes of the show too.

Read [my WT thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3cah9r/are_you_looking_for_a_slice_of_life_that_can_take/) because the narrative is much deeper than you might expect.
