Calling this a pvp game is like driving in traffic and considering all other drivers as racing opponents. Beating an unaware and uninterested driver off the line once the light turns green is a hollow victory.  Sure you might get someone interested in racing you, but you're still racing on streets when you can take your car to a race track and truly prove yourself. You tell a professional race car driver that you beat someone driving down main street and they will laugh at you.
