&gt; I think the idea that solely those who opposed Gove are the ones ignoring complexities and complications as a result of tribally-inspired dogma is pretty laughable.

No, I don't agree with Gove at all myself - probably phrased it poorly, the people who blithely agree with him are absolutely worse because they're the types who'll ignore experts completely and who border on completely ignorant and anti-science.

But I've definitely during the pandemic seen Gove's phrasing echoed (by people on all sides) when an expert says something as proof it must be true, because to disagree with them would suggest you're anti-expert like Gove, even though on plenty of matters related to Covid opinions have been split.
