Trust me as someone who understands, and didn't start Ranked until after 2+ years of playing casuals, ranked is the same shit lol. The players are just as bad and unaware and they don't rage anymore or any less than casuals. You're just imaging ranked being this magical place where the best players are, when really they are going to be just as good as your or worse. Promise!
