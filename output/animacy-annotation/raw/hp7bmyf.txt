&gt;when theyâ€™re not cultured and unaware that the shape is called a caryatid

Way to sound like a pretentious prick and show at the same time you actually don't know what you are talking about. 

The **shape** is not called "caryatid". It's inspired from Yoruban Caryatid that got it's name from Greek Caryatides. "The Greek term karyatides literally means "maidens of Karyai", an ancient town on the Peloponnese." The shape cannot be called caryatid because it's not, what you said it's false and uselessly pretentious blaming other people of lack of culture.
