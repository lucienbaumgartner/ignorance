That is where we differ. I do not believe in subjecting others to battles they don't wish to be apart of. That is a good way to make people tune you out and not listen.   


I have not once said to be silent in the face of racism. Those are words you have been putting in my mouth. I've repeatedly said now that we can hold people accountable for their behavior, but we can ALSO be mindful of those forced to be involved in the situation. We cannot force people to fight the fights they do not want to fight. As I said, that is a good way to make people tune you out and not listen.  


The only thing that was made clear in this group chat, is that one child will react explosively while the others just nope out. There was nothing \*constructive\* about what happened there. I would place real money that nothing in that mother's mindset changed beyond thinking that their child was being disrespectful and ignorant of their point of view. That is what happens when you immediately put someone on the defensive. They stop listening.   


There is a difference between being a **performative** ally and being a **constructive** ally against racisim. This whole idea that you can verbally open fire on people, and change their way of thinking in a few volatile text messages, is deeply flawed and it actually \*harms\* the fight against racism. Being an actual constructive ally means taking the time to think about a situation, about how to best reach a person, and how to hopefully help them see that what they are doing and how they are thinking is wrong and hurtful.   


I am not policing tone. I was trying to help OP see that yelling into the void and upsetting their siblings was not constructive, and it wasn't. They could have accomplished the same, if not more, by separately messaging their mother and trying to explain in better, less aggressive terms, why what they said was harmful and wrong. That would have held their mother accountable while also safeguarding their siblings right to not be harassed over their mother's ignorance. They could have then sat down and spoken together about how to approach their mother when their sibling was NOT at work, and could actually participate in a constructive dialogue to try and help their mother see things with more empathy and compassion.  


Performative VS Constructive. Harmful VS Helpful.   


Screaming 'Racist' into the void helps no one, because the void doesn't listen.
