I feel so many of my own emotions echoed in your experience. I went through the start of my last pregnancy so blissfully unaware and hopeful, and when I found out the baby was weeks behind and had no heartbeat I was hit by a truck. For me, I had gone through Christmas with this amazing secret of our August baby and by the end of the first week of January the writing was on the wall. No babe was coming. 

I feel lucky that I have a toddler already and throughout the very dark first few weeks with this loss I had convinced myself she was enough and I don’t have to risk the heartbreak again. However, it didn’t last too long and I knew when we were able to try again we wanted to try and complete our family. We got pregnant again right away but I haven’t had the same amount of hope and excitement this time, at least until I get some confirmation from my OB, and even then I know I won’t stop worrying and preparing for the worst. 

I have found that being open and talking about my miscarriage more has helped me process and recognize that baby will always be apart of me. It’s also allowed friends and family to open up about their own losses that they don’t talk about too. 

What hurts now is seeing all the pregnancy announcements for babies from July to September. I think, must be nice, but then quickly correct my snark because I don’t know what any of them went through to get that beautiful pregnancy. 

August 20, our due date, is going to be the hardest. I hope I am still pregnant still when we honour the babe that left us early.
