You have to just be trolling at this point. You also (incorrectly) criticized others for “not defending [their] position” and then immediately exempted yourself from the same standards. You’re employing the “be so blatantly wrong and ignorant that the person on the other side of the argument gives up” strat. You’ll never win a debate that way, you’ll just end up on your own little idiot island with only other idiots to talk to.
