The problem is that the number of men competing for the attention of women is scaled up too, some women get 50-100 messages a day, at least at a bar there is some kind of personal space, online it is a free for all, then men are separated and unaware that dozens of others are messaging the same woman.

Its not rough, its just fucked, its a dozen men messaging every woman, every day, the only positive thing coming out of online dating is that it is cultivating a new generation of multitaskers.
