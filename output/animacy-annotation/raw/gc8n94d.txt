At my first job (I was 15 at the time) one of the older ladies had brought in a cake as it was her birthday. She proudly asked people to guess her age.

Most people were graceful enough to say 40, some even did she didn’t look a day over 30.

Me, being socially unaware and bluntly honest like a kid, blurted out “80!”

She was 50. 🤦‍♀️
