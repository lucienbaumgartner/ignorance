Your retort is a “you mad bro?” away from being exactly what I’d expect, given the comment I replied to.  The implication of “mental weakness” is internet tough guy 101.  I mean if you sit, anywhere, reading comments on Reddit laughing out loud?  Seems unlikely, but a little unhinged if true.  Not sure where you managed to extrapolate that my day was “ruined”, I engaged in a conversation I have some perspective on. The declaration of how humorous you find something tends to betray your true feelings.  Are you mad bro? 

Nuance seems lost on you so I’ll reiterate.  A stereotype exists about Americans, namely they are insular small minded and unaware that the world outside the confines of their borders exists.  It’s not a view I subscribe to, I’ve spent some time in the States and met many interesting people. A group of privileged (and yes, young men who get to travel as they are good at a video game are damned lucky), think it makes them seem clever to be condescending about the country they are in. This is despite it being clear to anyone who has spent more than a day in this country (incidentally I’m NOT English) that they are never shown the best that country has to offer. They don’t like England? They never get to SEE England.  CoD esports is a niche interest at best, in the UK it’s not widely supported, chances are when they are here as little money as possible is spent on them.  They get a small sample of what cheap living in a city had to offer.  People being angry at this doesn’t make them weak.  It costs nothing to show respect when you visit someone else’s country.
