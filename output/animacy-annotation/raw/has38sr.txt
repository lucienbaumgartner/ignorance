Just for perspective there have been homeless, destitute people that make up significant percentages of world populations since the beginning of time. Ever been to a 3rd world country? Some ppl sound like that director who talked shit about lukas gage’s “small” apartment when he thought he was on mute. 

We shouldn’t make other ppl feel bad just bc we are sheltered and ignorant of reality.
