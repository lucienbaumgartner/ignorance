My boyfriend says, "I'm from California! What about you bro?" We love seeing their bewildered faces because he's first generation Viet and he's actually from LA. I'm Afro-Caribbean American so the person usually looks to me for "clarification" but I'm too busy laughing about it too care. Like why is that something that people wonder about?! And I find it disrespectful and ignorant that the person looks to me for clarification, even though my man speaks perfect English and can speak for himself.
