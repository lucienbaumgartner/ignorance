Dogs aren't like humans when it comes to mating, they don't need to be mentally aroused or sexually enticed to do something like that. Dogs will try to mount table legs and chairs, after all. They also have no sense of "shame"/propriety, since they'll readily mate with their own siblings and parents. So, they're really not all that discerning, especially the ones that have learned to mount as a way to relieve stress or anxiety.

That's why it's important not to whip your dog up into a frenzy with toys or games if it's prone to mounting people/things. But some people find that sort of thing funny when they're younger and inadvertently train their dog to hump everything by rewarding the behavior with lots of attention. Then when it's an uncute adult and is knocking houseguests over and embarrassing everyone, they abandon it and create an unadoptable/difficult to place pet.

This is just me guessing, but I'd venture to say that somebody who's unaware and selfish enough to sexually abuse their pet dog has probably also created the kind of confusing, inconsistent, and permissive home environment that would encourage some dogs to resort to stress mounting.
