As someone who is Chinese American, I hate that this happened. I've seen mainland Chinese tourists on a tour group I was on and though it's been stereotyped to hell, the things they say about mainland tourist are true. A couple of families were rude and ignorant of manners and etc. I'd go places with this tourist group and cringe when they did things most would normally deem socially wrong. Like a sign says specifically not to do something and they do it anyways for a photo or something and the tour guide would always have to stress the importance of following the rules of the establishment to the Chinese mainlanders specifically. 

It pisses me off because its stuff like that makes it an embarrassment to say that you are Chinese American. Like this isn't even a political view, it's just the way people act. 

It's been said that before the burning of the books and culling of educators, China was like the epitome of well manners and education with their confucian ideals. I think that was burned down and lost during that period, and then sprinkle in some overpopulation and poverty and loss of educators and books and it's not a recipe for success. That event must have been a major setback that set back decades of progress. Who knows how the world would be if that never happened.
