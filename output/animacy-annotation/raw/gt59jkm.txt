Thankfully, my pastor and I both smoke, and we often go out and have a cigar or a pipe together. Thankfully our church is level headed enough and they trust us enough that they aren't defensive when we explain out rationale and trust us enough that they are willing to hear us out. We don't flaunt things like tobacco and alcohol, but we also don't hide them. I personally don't drink due to an ethical agreement I signed for work, but I don't have any moral convictions against it. I would never encourage anyone to drink, that's their decision, but I would never say to drink by itself is sinful because scripture clearly doesn't say that. If it leads them to sin, or if they cannot function without it, then we have a sin problem, but a legalistic attack against the alcohol won't help, that's a case where pastoral counseling is needed. I personally believe that a hermeneutic that suggests that Jesus did not consume wine is irrational, and ignorant of history. Of course, when confronted, I don't say that, but I don't really back down either. I feel like legalism is more entrenched in the SBC now than we realize.
