A stone doesn't get heavier just because someone tries to lift it and fails. 

Just because I'm aware of these circumstances doesn't mean that they are mine or affected by me in any way.

I have my own biases which I'm both aware and unaware of.

I try to make points that wouldn't change due to bias.
