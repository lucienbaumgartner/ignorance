Keep defending the cowardice of the British. 

Do you know how hard it is to rebuild your entire infrastructure in a different part of your country from scratch and fight over a single city for months? (soviets did this) 

Your probably American and unaware that the war was already winding down and the soviets in Germany proper by the time US was making significant gains. Im a teacher and after traveling around I realized the US education systems coverage of both world wars is extremely lacking and only highlights US involvement despite soviets doing most of the heavy lifting.
