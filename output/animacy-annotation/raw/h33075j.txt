Removing the names of prejudice people and reminders of abuse doesn't change the past, but it does set a boundary and limit for the future. It says prejudice behavior is unacceptable and you don't deserve to be memorialized if you're an abuser. Removing them also prevents already traumatized marginalized people from having to be reminded of their traumas just to walk down the fucking street. It's about being inclusive. Constantly reminding people who experience prejudice just how prejudice the world is, by having it names after prejudice abusers is bullying. It is a constant reminder that you are less than others. As a disabled person, I know this all to well. No one should have to be reminded of prejudice against them just to live their lives. It is so insensitive and ignorant of privileged people to believe that they have the right to harm people, possibly causing their suicide, just to keep names and statues of dead people up, just because that's what privileged people want. Honestly, if you defend leaving up anything that idolizes prejudice people, you are a prejudice person and maybe you should work on that.
