I’m 22 in England. I feel like all I’m doing is waking up, working 8 hours a day just so I can pay my rent and bills and put food on the table and that’s all my life is at the moment. This lockdown is starting to get to me because I can’t see my friends and family. Pre lock down, I saw my friends/family multiple times a week. It’s also depressing knowing that I’ve got to work for the next 50 ish years to stay alive, the weekends go by so quickly too. I feel like I barely have any time to chill out because if I’m not working, I’m doing chores. I miss being young and unaware of the responsibilities adulthood comes with..
