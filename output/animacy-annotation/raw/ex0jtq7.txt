**The idea that Unions are not needed and are all bad**

If there is one thing video game development, VFX, and tech companies can teach us, as well as the fact that CEO pay has skyrocketed while worker compensation has stagnated (And not even caught up to inflation)... it's that we **need** unions. 

I mean sure unions take money in dues... but guess where that money goes: getting you vision, dental, health coverage, job security, continuing training, and more. And doing the math, it's often cheaper than if you just kept the money from union dues and went to buy that stuff on your own. (Lol, jobs in tech don't give you things like *dental* or *vision*.) 


**The establishment Democrats and the GOP**

The GOP *needs* to go. They care more about the wealthy and corporate donors than their actual voters. Seriously. Stop being so unaware and compliant. They're guilty of just about everything they bash the Democrats for. You know what they say.. Better dead than red. Note how they are considered "red". Hmmm... 

And Democrats aren't any different, also only claiming to represent people while simultaneously voting against them in favor of corporate donors. Follow the money.
