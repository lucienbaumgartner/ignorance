Doesn't alcohol have the opposite effects of nootropics? *"Nootropic also known as ‘cognitive enhancers’ are drugs that some people  use in an attempt to improve memory, increase mental alertness and  concentration as well as boost energy levels and wakefulness."* Alcohol, cannabis and many other class A and B drugs are known to make people philosophical, but I wouldn't use philosophy as a measurement of cognitive enhancement. You could be quite sedated and unaware of your surroundings while still very philosophical, which is the opposite of desired nootropical effects
