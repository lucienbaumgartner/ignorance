The Gospel reading this Sunday was [Matthew 18:23-45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A23-35&amp;version=NKJV).

The king does not speculate about the debtor's motivations, nor try to justify his behavior, nor pretend trust still exists. He simply cancels he debt: The debtor doesn't owe him any restitution. 

Now both the debtor and the king are free. The debtor, obviously, no longer has the king's anger hanging over him as a threat. But the king, too is free: He can now look at his servant without being filled with feelings of betrayal, anger, or need to punish. 

Unforgiveness, the saying goes, is letting somebody live in your head rent-free. He is happy and unaware that you are hurting yourself by replaying your inner script of wrongs he did to you. You can't see him without losing your peace. You are the one who is not free. 

By deciding to cancel his debt to you, and praying for him, you start becoming whole and free.

Feelings are the plow; your decision is the horse. Feelings *follow* your decision and action of forgiveness; they do not precede it. It may take significant time, but if *every time you think of this person* you pray for them, then feelings will begin to come in line. 

Try something like silently addressing that person: "I forgive you. I'm canceling your debt. You don't owe me anything. I bless you in the name of the Lord.  O Christ our God, bless and save him, and by his prayers, save me the sinner."

They may one da repent. They may one day earn back trust. But you can't stay bound and wounded until then, letting pain distort you because of someone else's action. For your salvation, you need to become free by canceling that debt.
