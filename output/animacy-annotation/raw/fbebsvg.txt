Jesus fucking christ stop being so idiotic. A long time ago people would go on stage painted black/wearing a black mask acting like they are dumb, lazy, and ignorant. That thing was done during the stage of segregation in America, and is now banned. People that find everything racist and people that are anti-white are now trying to dig it up so that white people won't be able to try and cosplay as black characters.
