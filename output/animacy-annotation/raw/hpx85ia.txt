Feeling disconnected from your country is one thing, but whole “I’m a citizen of the world” thing always struck me as ignorant and presumptive. Being relatively wealthy and able to travel pretty much wherever you want doesn’t give you the right to claim some kind of vague citizenship everywhere without the buy-in of people living in these places.
There are parts of the world (maybe Pakistan, per this video) where locals would very clearly rather not recognize your ‘citizenship’ and welcome you.
