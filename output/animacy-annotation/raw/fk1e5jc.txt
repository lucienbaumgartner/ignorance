&gt; I don’t understand how nothing bad happened and somehow OP is an asshole for doing literally nothing

By this logic, someone who tried to stab someone else and missed also wouldn't be the asshole, because "nothing bad happened".  Just because the outcome was good *doesn't mean* that this behavior was okay.  

You need to understand that as a straight person, you are in a very lucky position in that your parents and society doesn't care about your sexuality.  I find it difficult to believe that you are so sheltered and ignorant that you don't understand that there are people out there who *hate* their children for being gay.

&gt; If someone told my mom I was straight I wouldn’t be freaking the fuck out about it.

No shit.  "Straight" is the expected sexuality.  Do you *really* not understand how society treats gay people differently from straight people?

&gt; I don’t see how hiding it until they die is somehow a better way to live than just letting them disown you.

Are you serious right now?  "Just let them disown you" - yeah, so easy.  Some people want to keep a relationship with their parents even if they know they won't accept them for being gay.  Cutting off your parents, having your parents *disown* you is *really hard* and painful.

You have an astounding lack of empathy..
