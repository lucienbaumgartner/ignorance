Thank you for understanding. And yes I agree. As a progressive Christian myself, it really angers and upsets me that the fundamentalists have given is such a bad name to most people. Thankfully I think little by little people are realizing that not all Christians are like them, but it's still really sad that fundamentalists have hurt so many people with ignorant and harmful ideologies.
