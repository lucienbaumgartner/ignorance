To voluntarily leave my body and never come back. Fuck this place. Its full of stupid fucking people with their bullshit never-ending drama, everyone is right and no one is wrong, people don't want you to do what you want to do but they want to do what they want to do; People are so irrational, illogical, and ignorant that I dismissed all my friends and family. I cant be around nobody.
