I don't think its funny either. Someone died. Their family has to live with that. 

However.....I have no sympathy for the dead person. They could have prevented it. They chose to be willfully ignorant and obstinant. Thats on you man. You put it out for there for the public to see. I'm not sneaking into your private space.  You died for your political "team".
