Ok. I can see things got twisted a little bit. Or at least misinterpreted. So instead of copying and pasting i'll just say this. There's a lot of misconceptions here and it's unnecessary because we share the same views. I'm the last person you'll ever want to use the phrase 'caping for white people' for. I've been banned from most places because i've been accused of being 'too militant' (that's opinion, i'm just me at the end of the day). I've been pan-africanist for several years and embrace that title even if people think it's cheesy or somehow outdated. So let me clear this up. I'm not trying to earn stripes but just let you know i'm not in the business of making excuses for whites or 'caping for whites'. So let me clear this up further.

&gt;As I said it’s as simple as voting or educating someone. If you can’t do that you’re part of the problem, whether you’re white black hispanic Asian Indian etc.  
&gt;  
&gt; Except not enough people even do *that* or else the world would be a different place. Plus you have no choice but to speak up if you’re a black person because racism can and will affect you and your loved ones. Also why are you making it about yourself? In life, part of surviving is multitasking and taking on multiple issues. If you can do that at a 9-5 job, it shouldn’t be too hard for you to speak up against racism. I never disagreed with you otherwise on that but your language around this topic is suspect. 

1. I do community organizing. My mom used to work in soup kitchens and volunteered with the Black Panthers in Oakland then later the LA chapter. After moving down south she had me late (late 40's, which back then was beyond rare as far as births go) and had already converted to being a Jehovah's Witness by that time. She gave up the fight but my uncle was always active in social issues and so i'd kind of 'tag along' to rallies and such. I grew up with pan africanist beliefs via him and other men around me. Not only community organizing but I work with social workers too on certain situations, as well as try to be involved in workshops with local BLM and similar groups. Been involved in a lot of protest and 'know your rights' seminars when it came to police harassment among other things. I also teach small classes to local youth in my area (mostly South Dallas and Oak Cliff areas) about West African history and the resistance of Afro-Caribbean slaves in the west indies. My current thing i'm working on is helping out with "vegan soul food" vendors at a local event which is focusing on health betterment in the black community. I'm all about educating and helping the community, especially younger folks who seem to be caught up in foolishness where I live. I'm in the Dallas area now, and things aren't exactly 'organized' down here. So no i'm not an 'enabler' who sits by the side lines. "Busting my ass working" wasn't a direct reference to me, it was just to the composite person, the everyman. I'm personally always active. So once again you misconstrued me and made an assumption, just like I did, so we're both even. Onto the next one. You don't know me and I don't know you. I put words in your mouth before and you assumed wrong about me. Call it even and let's move on. 

2. 

&gt; Why do you Im making you the enemy? I’m simply replying to your comment. 

I meant that in reference to how my actions or words of seemingly putting words in your mouth and speaking out of pocket that you originally referenced in your previous post may have come off offensive and I may have made myself look like "The enemy" or been rude. I had meant to apologize. You didn't do anything to provoke the apology I just figured i'd do a side-statement and say so beforehand sorry if I had originally come off as acting like I knew you or making unnecessary assumptions or mini-insults. Once again my bad. That was the meaning of my "enemy" statement, to apologize and do what Liam apparently couldn't do--and that's check myself. So once again my mistake, in all seriousness.

3. As for whether or not I have "white friends". I've got a small number of actual "friends" (acquaintances are another story). Most are minorities but we sprinkle some ivory faces on top of that in the mix here and there lol. But so what if I do? that's not really the point I was making. I kind of went off on a tangent sure but I don't have some secret fear of white people's judgement, I give **zero fucks** about it to be honest. It is what it is. I was just stating that just to be stating it so probably it wasn't welcomed here. Once again my mistake but I Wasn't "protecting" or "caping" for white people, and it's offensive and ignorant that you would automatically assume that about me. I don't know you and you don't know me. That's not what my point was, and if that came off the wrong way that's on me. Preaching to the choir. 

4. MLK's view on moderates--100% factual and basically backed up by my "liberal" comments--is well known and i've actually always agreed with it and bring this up to the endless pools of people trying to whitewash MLK's image and message today with stupid revisionist history. So you're **preaching to the choir** here.

5. 

&gt; You can keep doing that. Other people can recognize that in a racist society most white People will have their own racial biases that they haven’t left at the front door, whether they’re active or inactive. I’ve experienced it. People here have experienced it. Again I don’t see the need for your “not all white people” response. I’m kind of disgusted now. Your response is similar to OP’s. They’re both off base. It’s as if you feel guilty or something and don’t want to paint all white people in a bad light because god forbid that happens, but literally no one was doing that. You made strawman arguments like “he’s not a maga supporter” or “white people who aren’t racist might be a surprise to you” and you really did a bad job at hiding your preconceived notions and biases. I’m frankly disappointed with your response.

**\^THE DEFINITION OF PREACHING TO THE CHOIR!!! LOOOL**

I grew up in racist-ass Louisiana, traveled to racist-ass places on the east coast, the midwest and the west coast even to so called 'liberal' oregon. ***So you don't have to tell me about latent racial biases in white people, one of the natural consequences of a white supremacist society. I experience it all the time just like YOU and every god damn black person in America does***! It's what my "ivy league" comment was referencing--people who put on the false mask of progressive respectability but ultimately the racism seeps out in subtle ways. I'd rather deal with a redneck whose nose I can break for calling me nigger than a person who pretends to be my friend but pulls the backstabbing racist card behind my back. You don't have to tell me what I know my dude. Once again, ***preaching to the choir!***
