People shit on me all the time over my job. Mostly vegans and chemophobes. I try to be understanding that they are just irrational and unaware that drinking a diet coke is provably a hundred times more dangerous then any product I could put down.

You know since most chemicals are specifically engineered to effect particular Arthropoda and Arachnida covered on the label.

Thanks for being a good person capttuna
