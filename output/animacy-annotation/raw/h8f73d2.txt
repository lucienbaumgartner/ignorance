Yeah monarchs who were positioned in proxy governments didnt invest in their "nations" science and education programs. because a few years before that there was no nation lines. Where as israel had citizens who were oppressed earlier and strived in science to have a competing edge in european cultures. you're comparing oranges with raisins. unfair and ignorant of geopolitics. 

"spreading their ideology worldwide" well that's the least educated thing you've said now. and ignoring how again the Nobel prize is mostly a joke, Obama received one and dropped more bombs than all previous presidents to him, and started a new war. a joke because Trump was absolutely a better nominee, which just makes it more hilarious

Yeah see your need to say a lot of scientist are atheists is actually dogmatic. you need to repeat that in order to feel an attachment to your group of thinkers.  it's very much a religious group,  especially if you're american where legally atheism is a religion.  but dont take my word for it, ask the library of atheist literature,  podcast, assemblies if you need more evidence it's a religion that lacks a belief in God.
