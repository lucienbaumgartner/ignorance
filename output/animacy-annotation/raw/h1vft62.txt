Can vouch for this as well. I never really had and influence on it I just think my brain or mind or something was like that then I got educated/got  older and realised I wasn’t straight. I also was young and unaware of the world so I don’t think I knew any better. Also I’m not identifying with anything as of but know I’m not straight
