Let me help you out here: it's called "mockery". I was making fun of how insipid and childish you sounded. But you're clearly too dense to pick up on that. Seriously, you're mind blowingly slow and unaware, and you're trying to tell someone that they don't think and are in special education, but you're so embarrassingly unaware of what's happening, you think I accidentally forgot to log into an alt account, instead of the fact that I was blatantly mocking you. And the longer you continue on with it, there more you display your total and complete lack of intelligence.

But, please, go ahead and embarrass yourself some more... How much lower would you care to sink?
