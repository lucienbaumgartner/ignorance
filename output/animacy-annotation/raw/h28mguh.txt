The fact Tuck was actually honest when he said _Gravity_ was a more personal record and not the aggro stuff most fans were asking for is one of the reasons I appreciate that record, even if it wasn't their best. Now this "we're heavy again, listen to us plz" talk doesn't really cut it for me, so I'm diving into this self-titled album completely blind and unaware of any of their prerelease hype so I can judge it for what it is.
