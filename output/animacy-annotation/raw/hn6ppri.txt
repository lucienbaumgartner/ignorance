I don't agree at all. 

Sure some teachers are assholes. It would be dishonest on my part to imply there arent any. But to say someone willing to dedicate their career to and go through a costly education to handle someone else's kids while underpaid for the sake of the powertrip alone is kinda ridiculous. 

Kids are emotionally immature and unaware of the consequences of their actions. That teacher in the OP pacing... You know what he was going through in his mind? He was likely weighing the future of his career and having to deal with these shit kids that hoot and holler the moment he walks out. 

Power imbalances exist everywhere. But there are certain lines that adults are expected to never cross that children are exempt from. Children do not respect their teachers because they can plainly see that their parents don't respect their teachers and the school administrators don't respect their teachers. This whole past year parents have been braying for teachers to be brought back to babysit their bad kids with no regard for their health. And even before this admin always undermined teachers to appease parents and cover their own asses. Parents have abidcated the responsibility of raising their kids and tossed on teachers to do it 20 at a time 8 hours out of the day. And the iPad does the rest at home. 

Public education has been reduced to state sponsored daycare. I'm not saying all teacher are exempt from their shitty behavior, Ive had shit teachers too. But in Americans current education structure, yes, I'm blaming the kids until explicitly proven otherwise.
