Absolutely. Your beliefs are your own, it's obnoxious and ignorant that he went there to change their culture and expose them to any array of viral and bacterial agents that they have never been exposed to before. Reminds me of how colonizers brought syphilis back to Europe in exchange for smallpox, or how the Inuit lost their language, dances, and gods because some Christians taught them the word of their God... in English. Now they are scrambling to try and preserve what is left of their traditions. 

Indoctrination into a paid cult is all evangelism and missionary ventures will ever be.
