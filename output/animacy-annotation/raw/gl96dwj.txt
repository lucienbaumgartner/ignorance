I grew up in a town over- when it was happening, our school also went into lockdown bc they weren’t sure if the shooter had fled or whether there was another driver at the time (or something- I was younger and stressed). It’s one of two times both my parents came to pick me up early. The day of the Sandy Hook shooting and 9/11. I didn’t personally know any of the kids, I can’t imagine holding that hurt. Dawn Hochspring was my sister’s babysitter and her husband George taught both my sister and I. I knew other people who grew up in the town who will never be the same, of course they won’t. Idk how you recover from something so disgusting and traumatic when your country not only fails to protect you, but also refuses to acknowledge or believe it happened. 

I live across the country now and have had multiple people bring up the ‘Sandy Hook hoax’ (god, even typing it makes my blood boil) because they hear ‘Connecticut’ and that’s what they think of. It’s frightening. Like, I would rather live in a world where that didn’t happen too, but you can’t just make that so because it’s more convenient for *you.* 

I used to be comforted by the fact that there aren’t too many people out there committed to holding onto a lie that actively harms and further traumatizes people... then COV happened and I realized that we live with a large group of people who are so misinformed and ignorant that the idea of a lizard cabal run by Hillary Clinton  trafficking children is more realIstic than children actually being murdered by an actual person with actual guns. I don’t think you could convince me that there is an argument to be had that would be in good faith. 

Sorry for the rant. I hate people. I hope your boss and her kids are doing okay and healing the best they can. Hope you’re staying safe too.
