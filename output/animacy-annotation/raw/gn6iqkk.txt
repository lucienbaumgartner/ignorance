also, an advice from women to women, i hope this serves as a lesson for u to educate yourself more with different types of contraception so you can avoid being panicky and unaware of the possible consequences (sucks that we don't have sex ed in the curriculum :((). u should also tell ur partner to be more careful bc the effects of ECP isn't easy at all.
