I think by watching Pearl Islands, you may change your mind about Sandra a little bit. Also depends on your sense of humor, haha, because I find her hilarious. 

Tony’s win is awesome, there is no doubt about that. 

There’s a good example of a nice person “lie, cheat, steal” game in season 13 Cook Islands that you could check out too. This sub doesn’t like Cook Islands, but I do personally. Some great characters for sure. 

And if you have extra time, you could watch Russell in his first season and see how he’s so unaware and ultimately bad at the game that he doesn’t change one bit before HvV. (Don’t know if you have watched season 19, Samoa). 

Happy watching!  So jealous you have so many seasons to watch...
