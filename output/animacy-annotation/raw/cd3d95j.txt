&gt;If we assume that the Bible strives for internal consistency, then we ought to begin with the presumption that all of the Bible is consistent absent convincing evidence to the contrary.

The Bible doesn't "strive" for anything. The Bible is an anthology of authors who were mostly unaware of each other and unaware that they were writing anything that would be canonized into the Bible.

&gt;Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem where Jesus was born. A week or so later he was then taken to Jerusalem for the ritual sacrifices and purification. Rather than going back to Nazareth (several days' journey), Mary and Joseph stayed in Bethlehem (less than a day's walk from the temple in Jerusalem) for the first year of Jesus's life. Given that Joseph was from the house of David, it is possible that he had family in the area, so he would not have been without connections and support while he stayed in Bethlehem. One year later, the wise men arrived in Bethlehem (after a detour in Jerusalem) and offered gifts to Jesus at his family's house. Joseph then had a dream where he was told to flee with his family to Egypt to escape Herod, which he did.

&gt;Years later, Herod died and an angel appeared to Joseph telling him to return to Israel. When he arrived, Joseph found out Archelaus was in charge, so he settled in his hometown of Nazareth rather than back in Bethlehem.


* The census happened ten years after Herod died.

* Luke says Joseph and Mary went straight to Nazareth after presenting Jesus at the Temple. 

* Matthew has Mary and Joseph already living in Bethlehem in a house and only deciding to move to Nazareth after they come back from Egypt because Herod's son, Archelaus, was Tetrarch in Judea, so they relocated to Galilee instead (and I guess never mind that the Tetrarch in Galilee is Herod Antipas, another of Herod's sons.

* Archelaus was Tetrarch of Judea from 4 BCE to 6 CE. He was so incompetent that he was removed by the Romans and Judea was annexed into the province of Syria. Quirinius was then appointed Governor of Syria and his first order of business was to impose a census and a tax. This was the first Roman census in Judea, and the first census in Palestine at all in centuries. It caused riots and small scale revolts.

* It did not apply to Galilee. Galilee was still under the authority of Antipas and not subject to a tax. No one living in Nazareth would have been affected by it or required to do anything.

* No census ever required anybody to return to their ancestral homes anyway. It would have been logistically impossible and served no purpose. It is frankly an absurdity on the part of Luke and is almost *ipso facto* proof that he's making up his entire nativity.


This ten year gap between Herod and Qurinius is a big problem. Quirinius was never given any jurisdiction over Judea until 10 years after Herod died.

There's no way to resolve this. It's just a flat contradiction.
