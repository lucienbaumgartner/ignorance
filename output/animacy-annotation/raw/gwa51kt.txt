NOT YOUR MISTAKE. DO NOT PAY HIM BACK. Don't feel bad.

It was his fault. Basta. If he was too stupid and ignorant that he did not even bother trying to learn anything themselves and put the blame on you, he actually deserves to lose the money (so he learns a lesson) and you shouldn't give them anything back. 

That said: did you just buy random options or something ?????? If anything I would've just bought him a couple S&amp;P 500 ETF share and let him wait 10 to 30 years.
