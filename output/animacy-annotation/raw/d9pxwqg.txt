You don't even know what fascism is. Trump is far from a fascist. Look at history, and show me what Mussolini and Trump have in common. Your knowledge of politics is shallow. Your smugness is built on straw. It is amazing to see how many people actively refuse education, and choose to be a part of the status quo. Quit going with the flow and being part of the "unaware and compliant citizenry"
