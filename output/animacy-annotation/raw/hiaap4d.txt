&gt;So Quebec's argument that Alberta "owes' it things is that Quebec's take of federal taxes spent on the oil sands from it adds up to 14 billion over 45 years?

Not about the oil sands specifically, and not over 45 years.

His argument is that the development of the province, from the buying of the land itself, to building the railway that helped it grow its economy in the late 1800s to, yes, the development of the oil sands have all been financed through the taxation of the Eastern provinces through federal spending, as Alberta was a have not province for the longest time.

In a confederation like Canada, provinces are expected to support each other, and Alberta's rejection of equalization payments comes off as selfish, shortsighted and ignorant of history.

&gt;Yo honestly, "it's Alberta's fault that Quebec uses oil, so really we're not to blame or this"?

His point about Quebec using "dirty" Albertan oil is not blaming Alberta specifically, but rather Quebec itself, stating that if Quebec wished to reduce its GGEs by taxing pollution it should buy from greener sources like Norway, Newfoundland or Algeria instead. Lis√©e quips that the losses Alberta would suffer from Quebec switching oil and gas suppliers (about 3B/year) would outweigh what it would gain by ceasing to contribute to equalization payments.
