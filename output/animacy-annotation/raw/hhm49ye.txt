So I'm 28 have a job making more than minimum. Can't afford housing or rent. But I'm not some immature child that blames bad policy and investment companies on the boomer generation. Most boomers are spoiled and unaware of how an economy works but every generation is going to have people that take advantage of a system like speculative realestate investment. You want change? Stop voting for politicians that allow companies to do this and actually invest in our economy rather than some useless "social issue" which is a distraction for the feeble minded while they empty your pockets. Unless you all want some kind of socialist hellscape.
