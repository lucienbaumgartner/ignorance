And itâ€™s nevertheless necessary, because of **focused**race-based discrimination that forcibly removed **almost exclusively black persons** from their rightful homes in NE Portland for Emmanuel hospital, I-5, and the Memorial Colosseum. Whole vibrant Black neighborhoods, and some of the most profitable Jazz clubs on the west coast, were surreptitiously bought up with coordinated city efforts, and then torn down never to be replaced, relegating Black homeowners to Vanport where they lost everything. 

To think this is racist and these funds would be better used is dumb as fuck and ignorant of Portland history.
