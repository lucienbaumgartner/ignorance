If you aren't a "real woman" then that would mean I can't be one either nor could any trans girl be. I'm trans but I am a *woman* and a real one at that! It sounds like you are dealing with some internalized transphobia. Don't listen to the transphobes, they are wrong and ignorant of us. You are a real woman, as real as any other. Love yourself girl, you deserve it! 

I'm sorry it didn't work out with that one girl, rejection really hurts and especially so when it's because of your body. I can guarantee you that there are so many lesbians who like girls like us, I know from experience. You will find a partner that will love you for you, one that will treat you how you deserve. I hope you find that one soon friend!!! ♥️
