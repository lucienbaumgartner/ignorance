I get that it's from a "random" account. But I thought for sure in this digital age these things wouldn't really be an issue anymore. Transactions are nearly immediate now and easily checked. Maybe I'm just naive and ignorant of banking. And yes I spoke with the branch manager. She was the one that assured me the funds would be available today. Which they are not. Which leaves little faith that the funds will be cleared on Monday. But I'll just have to wait and see. No other choice. 

My $2,000 earnest wire transfer was completed next day, but would $15,000 be an issue now? My bank said no, but it makes me wonder.
