[First I would suggest that you choose a model by which to answer and approach your questions.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#ProCon) I cannot answer your questions because the question of "What is consciousness?" is not answered. For instance if we were to hold a simple understanding of consciousness being merely self-aware of one's own perceived self (self-recognition) rather than a deeper valuation of consciousness (self-shaping) it is likely that we would maintain a much different type of mystified sense where in the first we would likely fall into solipsism whilst in the second we may venture down roads of empiricism with ourselves being the subject of study rather than the world being subjected to our studying.

This begets the second problem because consciousness is, in and of itself, a concept. So to be conscious and unaware of your own consciousness likely cannot exist. My reasoning is that in order to be conscious one must have a concept of consciousness. In the simplest reference above if you cannot recognize your own reflection then you have no sense of your own physical status; you do not and cannot know what you look like. This does not mean that you do not have vision by which to see your own reflection (which I think is closer to the question you asked) but instead that you simply cannot process it. Consciousness, even in the rudimentary sense, does seem to be relative to the ability to process oneself within the world rather than simply the world at large.
