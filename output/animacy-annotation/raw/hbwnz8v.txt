It absolutely is. If I’m taking up arms against a tyrannical government, you’re damn right I’m gonna take a weapon that has been tried and true for the job and had 60 years to evolve and improve.

The Springfield 1903 was a weapon of war. The fact that they’re okay with bolt guns, despite their position against said weapons is a showcase of their ignorance and/or their stupidity. 

Every weapon in existence, be it knives, swords, firearms, bows and arrows, have all been weapons of war. That’s the point of weapons, to improve your fighting capability, be it in civilian life or actual wartime. 

People who think they’ve got a “gotcha” moment by imposing that label on things with the intention of using the rhetoric and the mood generally set by war as a means of making it seems worse than it is aren’t clever. They’re stupid and ignorant of history at best and malicious at worst.

You can take all the power away from the phrase “weapon of war” by letting them know that yes, it is a “weapon of war” and it should still be legal.
