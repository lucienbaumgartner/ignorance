&gt;My point is, if you are young, and healthy, and especially if you are vaccinated - and scared of covid? You are simply ignorant and you have an irrational fear.

&gt;I'm simply saying leave people be who don't want it, its none of your business.

Agreeing with the latter, but I would say the inverse must also stand. Calling those who have had the COVID vaccine ignorant and irrational, is ignorant and irrational in my opinion. What constitutes rational fear I believe a global pandemic would come under. We must be careful about using this 'intellectual argument' amid pro vs anti. Neither is more intelligent than the other. Not a single soul (outside of speculation and conspiracy) knows anything for sure. The ignorant and irrational are those who fail to see this. As you say, &gt;Its called risk/reward analysis. But everybody's risk calculation is different - different risk factors, different existing mitigants, different risk ratings, different risk exposures, difference in access to risk control (I could go on but you get my jist). 

I am delighted that your choice has worked well for you to date. I hope it continues to. I hope your wife is ok and that her choice to take the vaccine serves her well.
