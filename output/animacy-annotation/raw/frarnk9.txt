Because healthy people can still transmit the disease to other people. The lockdown is not to keep the "healthy" people from catching the disease, its to help prevent the accidental spreading of the disease to at risk people via asymptomatic carriers.

You can personally be the most healthy, fit, person at the lowest risk of complications from Covid19 and still be a carrier. Worse than that, because you are so healthy and fit, you may be completely asymptomatic and unaware that you are infected. Contact with you could lead those more at risk to contracting Covid19 and developing complications.

Covid19 affects all of us, so be smart, be safe and above all be contentious, it's not just your well being that is at risk.
