If someone presented to the ER in the midst of a PSVT episode, with a heartrate of roughly &gt;200 bpm for a continued period of more than 15 minutes, causing shortness of breath and chest pains... and let's just say that they were whisked to a room immediately and were quite confused and unaware of the seriousness of what was happening, and a doctor told this hypothetical person "I'm going to give you a shot of something, you *will* feel like you are dying, but I promise you that you are not" ... Was that more than likely an example of a 'chemical cardioversion' ?
