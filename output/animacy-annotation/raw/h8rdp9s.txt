Name kind of depends on your target demographics as it is a way to quickly communicate to a customer that you do Vietnamese iced coffee.  You might not have the funds or time to go on a marketing campaign or get into a foodie blog to teach customers what your name and brand is all about. 

If it’s a Caucasian predominant demographic and unaware of Vietnamese foods, Vietnamese Iced Coffee might be the most straight forward name.  Saigon Brew could mean craft beer bar. Maybe Saigon Coffee or Saigon Coffee Brew.

You could pick a *Memorable Name:* Vietnamese Iced Coffee

Simply Ca Phe only if it’s Vietnamese predominant or very cultured/ethnically aware like in Southern California
