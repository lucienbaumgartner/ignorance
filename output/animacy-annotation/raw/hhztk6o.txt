I fear death because there's a chance that I become nothing. No consciousness, no spirit, nothing at all. I become completely insignificant and unaware of the events occurring. And I am really, really scared of that. Which is why I wanna leave my mark on this world and make a difference for some, no matter how few. At least I can rest knowing that I have done enough in this life and have made a difference for people. Of course, there's a chance that I burn in hell, go to heaven, or even live another life. Who knows?
