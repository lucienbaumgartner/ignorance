been happening to me this way for years now..found it hard to see this method through sometimes without suddenly entering sleep paralysis and absolutely losing your shit because you're awake and can't get your body to do what you want.  especially terrifying when your partner is in bed next to you awake and unaware of what's happening to you.. and you're wishing they would "kick" you out like in the movie Inception..but you can barely moan and can't move.
