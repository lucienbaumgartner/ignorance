I think controlling our own mind is simple but difficult but, controlling mind of others doesn't seem ez or probable. I believe in free will and determinative world at same time.   I have never been fan of Law of Attraction because people who told me about it were not very logical but it is similar with science, religion and spirituality. Many people spread false claims but some true and logical claims so it's hard to conclude any claim without considering possibility of truth is just Ignorant and biased. I believe in non duality as everyone being part of same one reality but having experience of individual consciousness and awareness so we all have our own free will and also have tiny control over surroundings due to karma or as science say causality.
