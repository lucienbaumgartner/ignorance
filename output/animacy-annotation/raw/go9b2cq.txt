Well, both airbags and seatbelts are in place in case of accidents (emergencies).  

Breathing (especially by healthy people) is not an emergency. 

Masks were originally intended to be used by the sick or suspected sick, only. Then, masks were used when social distancing of 6 ft was not possible. Now everyone just wears them while going about their day because they are uninformed and unaware that they don't stop virus transmission at all. 

So....not for use during emergencies either. 

 I'm headed to the pet store to go buy dog food now (maskless because I'm not sick), so have a great life, bye!
