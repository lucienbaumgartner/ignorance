As an aerospace engineer whose first gig was traffic engineering, no. You're just wrong.   


The Solomon Curve applies \*more heavily\* to highways. And it's what began the research that has showed us for nearly 50 years that governments are setting speed limits too low for safety. This is well-known and understood. Governments put a heavier weight on fuel efficiency than crash safety in North America. Period.   


You think that that was the last time the research was updated? It's updated \*routinely\*. And every single solitary set of research refers back to the Solomon Curve \*because it still applies.\*   


I'd recommend you never drive again, and that's my professional opinion.   


I don't have road rage problems. I DO have problems having conversations with people who are both ignorant AND stupid while they're smug about their utter lack of knowledge.   


Goodbye.
