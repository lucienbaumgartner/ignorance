I keep with the farms stance. Don’t interfere don’t insert yourself. For as much as phill hates the trolls it’s his own actions that are causing his downfall and the less money he gets the more rants he will go on.

The true irony of trolls is that if they keep going they eventually make the lolcow boring and safe. It takes a special individual to be both narcissistic and unaware of what people are saying about them.
