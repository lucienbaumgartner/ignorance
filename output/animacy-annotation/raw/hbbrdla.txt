I definitely didn't it expect it from the woman that watches Hannity. She's being weird about actually seeing me. Idk if she's trying to give me space or she's uncomfortable. What spurred me to just tell her was her saying she's uncomfortable seeing gay male kiss. She's wonderful and the best mom but kind of close minded and ignorant of the world
