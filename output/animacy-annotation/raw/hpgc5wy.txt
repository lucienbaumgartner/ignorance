1) You can spread the virus regardless of vaccination status. 

2) If you are vaxxed and go to bars/clubs /indoor restaurants without a mask, you are more likely to spread the virus than if you are unvaxxed and stay at home. 

3) You are dehumanizing people who aren't vaccinated by claiming they are "hateful and ignorant" and stating "they will spread to innocent people who do care"

4) You are also the victim of politicized media coverage that makes you feel afraid of or hateful towards a group of fellow human beings. I appreciate the spirit of your message, but I think that you hold biases too that you may not even be aware of.
