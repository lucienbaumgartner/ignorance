&gt;I can't be racist to madeshi because we are of literally same fucking race. Do you even know history of Nepal and how different ethnic groups have relation with each other?

Madheshi people comprise Brahmin and Dalit caste groups as well as ethnic groups such as Maithils, Bhojpuri and Bajjika speaking people. You literally don't know the reason why they are called Madhesis do you?

&gt;You keep on claiming china do this china do that but I can bet you don't have any piece of evidence for it. 

Which one? China has committed too many crimes. There are too many to list and well documented by Western and non-western media. Of course, unless you live in China you won't know about them. How is that great filter? The fact that you don't know them can only mean 2 things. One you are in China. 2 you are so uneducated and ignorant that you will under a rock. I think it's both. After all, only an idiot and CCP dog would claim US created the virus.
