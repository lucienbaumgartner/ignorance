Lack of role models, no money or social services that failed them, unprocessed trauma, brain injuries, years of learning to cope using drugs or anger instead of healthy processing of emotions. Those are some of the reasons I can think of. I try to think of these things when I see someone this ignorant and annoying, but I still usually get mad at them anyway haha.
