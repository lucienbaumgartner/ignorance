Actually rap culture comes from the violent ghettos from where these rappers come from, it's not the other way around, likewise violence comes from our own imagination which we then put into video games. Video games and movies show as the same amount of violence, and while it's fun to do something violent in a video game because it is a game, very few people would feel inclined to be violent outside of it. Watch a beheading on some movie or a video game and then watch a real beheading and tell me how fucking huge a difference there is, real violence is scary and tangible, video games are only video games and we are (even kids) sufficiently intelligent and unaware that what we see is a game or movie where we can explore violence in art. While I might find it fun to shoot down people in GTA and run them over with a car, perhaps kill drug dealers and civilians, it is not attached to a feeling I have before, I don't feel the need to do this in real life, I do it because a game is not real, and there are no consequences, my mind does not make it real nor do I have a urge to be violent after it.
