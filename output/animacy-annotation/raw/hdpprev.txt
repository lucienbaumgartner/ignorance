Leaving is a feat in itself, but staying out for good does require a strong support system. Abusers create can environment where isolation from support becomes easy (i.e. because those who are unaware and frustrated with why you might go back want to give up sounding like a broken record too). If not in your brother, please do find good, solid support in others you can trust. 

I’m sorry you’ve had to experience domestic violence. It’s never okay. Nor is re-traumatization. If you’re open to considering, though, try reflecting on your comment about about your brother’s “evil wife” not being a battered woman because she left immediately. Much in the same way you felt victimized all over again from your brother invalidating, it’s easy to compare and dismiss others’ experiences with domestic violence because they weren’t repetitive or somehow “bad enough” or “happened for long enough” or don’t match our own. That can also be invalidating to others’ experiences. 

I’m sorry you’ve been worn down by this whole thing. Take care of yourself.
