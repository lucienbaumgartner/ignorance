What makes me mad about these comment sections is that when they say “even if they have the right of way didn’t they look both ways” it’s like they’re almost at the point but not quite. 

Like, it’s UNFORTUNATE that we have to look. Drivers have become so self-absorbed, unaware, and aggressive that they will just keep going fast, instead of watching everything and slowing down. In a people first, car last system cars should have to look to go when no pedestrians are coming. And to those complaining that pedestrians should only have the right of way at crosswalks, they need to read up on how the auto industry lobbied to make walking in the road a crime. We almost had our way.
