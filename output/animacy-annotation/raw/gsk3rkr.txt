if you didn't watch GTA RP before 3.0, 2.0 had something labeled as Mag Dump season where criminals decided they'd rather shoot down cops than talk things out to make a statement that cops were not reciprocating enough on cop / criminal interactions 

what ended up happening, is that cops not involved and ignorant of the reasons for Mag Dump season got shot down which resulted in them deciding to either not play cop, play cop during certain time zones, or play on other GTA RP servers

RP wise it makes a whole lot more sense for Luka to become more hardened against criminals than blaming Spartan for the shooting.  The criminals are the people pulling the trigger here.
