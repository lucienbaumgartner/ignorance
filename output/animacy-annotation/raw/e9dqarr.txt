Again, you're presenting your opinion as fact - and yet one of the few facts I'm convinced about here is that you can't actually know.

I understand that you think marketing can only work in one way - and that because you've worked in the field, you're magically capable of knowing what's marketing in a community video with absolutely no margin of error.

To me, that's comically arrogant and ignorant.

That doesn't mean you're wrong, however. As I already said, I think you're right that some of it is scripted.

The uncertainty is about exactly what is scripted and what's not.

However, if you actually watch the show for a minute and you forget what you THINK you know - you will notice Chris isn't actually looking at the teleprompter or reading from a script when he goes into his passionate in-depth answers.

That's why I'm saying I don't think his answers are scripted in any kind of detail. There's no way a guy that's so lacking in polish and presentation can memorize a script with that kind of content and deliver it perfectly.

So, to me, he comes off as genuine - and I don't think it's "just marketing".

Honestly, I don't think CIG are particularly good at marketing overall - and I don't think it's been a big priority for them.

Obviously, they're aware that a lot of people are ignorant of game development at this level by now - and they're starting to understand that they have to expect less of people and present things with a certain coat of "marketing sugar" to avoid the worst and most vocal whining.

However, I'm personally not a fan of that - and I actually appreciate their somewhat amateurish approach to community communication.

With all that said, I'm more or less impervious to such things - as I look at the results and I look at consistency between words and actions.

I don't really need any more than that to have complete faith in CIG and what they're doing - even if they're making a ton of mistakes and miss targets all the time.
