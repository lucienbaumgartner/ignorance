Time wont collapse in on itself and will not effect the future without fragmenting a new timeline in which theborigional stays the same and unaware of the differences in the second. The hard part is navigating to travel between timelines.  Aside from that, the universe has a way of "correcting" itself. So say you go back and kill Hitler, likely someone else will just be the new hitler and the same events will take place. The o ly thing in the future that changes is that hitler dies and we all now know some other name as the Nazi leader and people might still get named Adolf after WW2.
