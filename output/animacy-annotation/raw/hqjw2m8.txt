The kid got heart and empathy and unlike most redditors in this thread.

As an atheist myself, nothing makes me more embarrassed of being an atheist than the army of arrogant, ignorant, and pretentious morons from r/atheism who go out of their way to attack a kid who wants good on people. No, you're not some high IQ genius for being an atheist, and no, being an atheist does not make you better than others.
