All these things about the Malays and Chinese, Malay civilization, China, and the west, were already known and well explored, and talked about by founding father leaders like Mahatir and LKY in their books, speeches, in ASEAN conferences, and so on.

They wrote heaps of books that have been discussed and dissected by academicians since my fathers time. 

Of course many of the blue pill swallowing anti-china shills are disconnected and ignorant of actual history and understanding of these things in their own countries and from their own leaders, and instead just parrot what Karen from the BBC and CNN has to say on the topic.
