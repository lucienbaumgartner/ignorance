As far as I can tell in my 60 years of life, the Bible offers no wisdom that is not purely of human origin and that has not been expressed by other religions, often in much more enlightening ways. However, unless one filters much of what the Bible says by what is morally acceptable today, much of the Bible's "wisdom" is patriarchal, and ignorant of what we consider to be basic human rights.

On the other, when you read the entire Bible, it refers to earlier sections not as myths or symbolic, it refers to them as being literal events or people.  But if we consider it to be simply symbolic, then there is every reason to reject its outdated, bigoted "wisdom" in favor of a much wider world view and there certainly is no reason, based on a "symbolic" scripture to think that a god might exist.

Think about it this way, if some to most of the Bible is "symbolic stories" just what do you have to show that God is any different from the Greek gods or how can you definitively tell the difference between "symbolic sins" and "real sins"?   In essence, if your assertion about the Bible being a "symbolic book" is true, then there is absolutely no reason to believe in God and every reason to assume that morality is completely subjective as well as every reason to deeply question any assertion made about morality based on Biblical standards.
