**im sorry but the main girl just seems so weak and really on the anime side than realistic.** shes overly emotional and unaware of her surroundings. i honestly dont know how she isnt bullied.  
  
she starts breaking down the moment someone cries due to her inexperience in war. she preaches to kids about how the 86 are being wrong but in a way that argues to them, which annoys the already disinterested crowd. theres no way youre gonna get through by just ranting your problems that they dont understand. also she just acts some cutesy and happy like everything is gonna go her way, and just not experienced and rather a casual. its like some guy who read a military strategy textbook pretending to be a veteran. its cringe.
