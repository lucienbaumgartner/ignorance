Shit, man, you  perfectly described myself. I just believed i am a naturally introverted person, completely neglecting to maintain relationships with people. 

At one point my sister, who was the closest person I had at that moment, told me that i had became selfish and ignorant of other people's feelings. Took me a bit to let that sink in. When it did, i tried as hard as i can to work on myself. 

Just little steps, call grandma when i get the chance, it would mean a world to her, and it's my 10 minutes of the day. Or visit a friend if they're on my way from work, to say hi, or spend some time with my family when I'm at home and actually ask them about their day. 

I realized that i had made my life to completely revolve around how i feel and while that isn't a bad thing per se, it's really not normal to be the only thing on your mind. 

Think a bit around the closest people around you, and whatever little thing you can remember to do/say, will have a massive impact on them and on yourself. 

I guess it's just easy to forget that sometimes it's not just easy to love/like someone, you gotta work a bit, only a little bit, and then everything will do itself.
