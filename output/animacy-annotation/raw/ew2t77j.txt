It doesn't really matter. You and most of this sub just use midlevels as your whipping boys for all the discontent you feel about your career, peers, and medicine. It's pointless to even try to have a conversation about our role I medicine. The people here are so hostile and ignorant that I can only assume it's a coping mechanism. People can't truly approach non-MDs this way and function in any sort of clinical environment.
