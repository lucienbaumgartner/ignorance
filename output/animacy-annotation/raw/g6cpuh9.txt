Of course you’re content making someone angry. A real life troll. You didn’t speak on what to do about birth control at all. Jumped to conclusions about what type of person I must be and tried to make it personal instead. That’s what a shitty person does. Ignores what the person is communicating with them about and acts like they’re on a high horse for someone reacting to their shitty behavior. You’re just ranting along about how great of a person you think you are because of your life decisions, ignoring how egotistical it is to push your views and say anything else is wrong. Assuming you’re probably not ignoring it, you’re just selfish and unaware of how you come off.
