YWBTA though I don’t blame you for wanting to call him out at all. The fact he never apologized speaks volumes about him. Most likely, if you say anything to him in front of other people, he will turn it on you and your family and the situation will be escalated again. 

What I would do just be SO NICE to him every single time you see him. Be polite and kind, especially in front of other people. Kill him with kindness. You don’t have to give him gifts or anything, just show him and everyone else how you can be the bigger person. I promise this will piss him off more than engaging him in another argument. He won’t even be able to talk shit about you or your family because you’re not giving him anything bad to talk about. I’ve done this loads of times with unapologetic assholes and it works like a charm. 

And when you’re super angry at him, just think: he’s the type of pathetic asshole that can’t even apologize. He’s so juvenile, thick headed and ignorant that he can’t swallow his pride for the short amount of time it would take to say “I’m sorry” and what a miserable life he just lead. Give him your pity, that’s all he deserves.
