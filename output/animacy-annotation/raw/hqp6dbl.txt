being not attracted to a trans person isn't transphobic, it is however when the only reason you arent attracted to them is because they are trans, let me explain. the term "transgender" includes a lot of different kinds of people. some have genitals you are attracted to, some don't, some have secondary sex characteristics you are attracted to, some don't, some have body types you are attracted to, some don't. the only thing binding all trans people is their self identifying as trans, nothing more. not being attracted to all trans people is ignorant and generalizing.
