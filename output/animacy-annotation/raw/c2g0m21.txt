Well it's not really "teen" driving that makes it dangerous. It's the lack of experience. A friend of mine has Golf r32 with 4WD and really powerful engine. He drives quite crazy, but I am not really afraid to go with him as he drives much more powerful car on a rally track. If you know how to control a car, then it's not dangerous. 

On a sidenote, some old people drive much worse than teenagers. They don't speed, but they are mostly blind and unaware that they are not in the middle of an empty field.
