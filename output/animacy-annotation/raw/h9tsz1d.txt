That is not toxic masculinity, it is a hell of a lot of testosterone (which normal healthy women seem quite fond of by the way) combined with bad parenting and or insecurity. Also when guys start fights to prove how tough they are, they are usually proving that to women because they are competing over them. Just like every male mammal that I am aware of. When you say stupid shit like this you just prove how uneducated and unaware of reality you are.

 The same thing that makes those men fight is the same thing that makes them join the military and defend your right to live free, or defend women or children from being attacked by some psychopath or raped non stop by the same. Go live in many parts of Africa for a while and have a discussion with them about toxic masculinity while they rape and murder you in front of your whole family. 

Men also literally build the whole comfortable world you live in at little cost to you and frankly judging by your response you are completely oblivious to it.  You have no idea how violent and hard life was just 100 years ago and still is in many parts of the world. The shitty parts of the world is where good strong intelligent men have not stepped in to make things right, to "civilize" it. 

Saying the way Men sometimes behave or misbehave and calling it toxic masculinity is like saying a woman getting pregnant is toxic femininity. Wake up and get an education that allows you to do something besides take a credit card to Starbucks to order coffee and post uneducated hateful drivel on the internet.
