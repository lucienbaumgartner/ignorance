&gt; Does this mean Jews and Christians don't believe in the same god too, since Jews don't believe Jesus was God?

According to the Jews? Yes. They don't think their God has sent their messiah.

&gt;  Jesus was a jew, so which god was he talking about?

According to him, he was talking about God. But do you think the Jews believe that?

&gt; Muslims believe in the same god as Christians and Jews; what you are saying here is essentially "only Christians believe in the god of Abraham" which is frankly absurd and ignorant of history.

No, what I'm saying is that each religion has certain parts that are incompatible with the thinking that they worship the same God.
