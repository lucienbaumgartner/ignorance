I can eat a vegan meal without being 100% vegan. I can eat a lactose free meal without being lactose free. I do not claim to be vegan, I claimed to DEFAULT to vegan meals due to the fact that my culture’s diet consists of an abundance of vegan recipes. Hiding your racial ignorance behind a mask of vegan savior doesn’t change the fact that you are ignorant and uneducated in regards to the global population, many of whom rely on animal products to survive.
