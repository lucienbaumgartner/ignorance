&gt; I'm entitled to them both, but I simply reject your assertion of the extent of one of those issues.

Then you're just wrong and historically ignorant and have no conception of how these things work. 

I laid it out pretty clearly. Saying "nuh uh" suggest to me that you reject it on an emotional basis because you can't even address the arguments head on.

&gt;I bear absolutely no personal responsibility for this, and neither did my ancestors.

The moment you began benefiting from the crimes of this nation you took on an obligation to take action, especially if your family resided here by choice, which is a great freedom than many had. 

I just think you have a very broken moral philosophy that is self interested and passive.

&gt;And according to the survey that this whole thread is about, that seems to be a common sentiment among Canadians. Good luck trying to convince them otherwise.

Usually you convince them by making enough mess that they grudgingly allow progress. That's a poor reflection on you. And this is where the shame of being Canadian begins to exist. You aren't personally responsible for the actions taken in the past but you are responsible for what you do today. You have abandoned your moral duty and you have indulged in a behavior that reinforces the continuation of the wrongs. That makes you a participant and someone who supports it. 

It just makes you a bad person.
