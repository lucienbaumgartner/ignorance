&gt; Those things only happened because the poor family were hard workers but had very few opportunities. Eventually their cynicism led them to become extremely loyal to only each other.

Yeah, that's not the film I saw. The family weren't "hard workers", they were opportunistic and lazy. They didn't work except to graft. And when they achieved anything they wasted it, as we see as soon as the rich family leaves the house, the poor family all turn up to gorge themselves and trash the place. 

The rich family were naive and ignorant of poverty. But that "crime" is portrayed *very* differently to the actions of the poor family. The wife for instance is portrayed almost as a child-like innocent, with such little agency of her own, she's almost ridiculously easy to manipulate by the poor family. Everything they tell her she believes without question, to the point that the film became entirely unrealistic for me. She was so ridiculously OTT gullible she wasn't a person as much as she was a plot device.
