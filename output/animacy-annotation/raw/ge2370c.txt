I agree with that. That’s part of what I’m saying. If someone is blackout drunk and unaware of their surroundings and/or actions, they cannot consent to sex, and we say they have been raped if someone takes advantage of them in that state. But then why do we still consider it cheating if a partner has sex with someone in that same state and not rape? Why do we say, “You knew what you were doing” when they were just as drunk as the person we told, “You could not have consented in that state so you were raped.” It seems hypocritical to me.
