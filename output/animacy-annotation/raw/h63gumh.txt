Yes I feel the same way, but I realized I have a more depth experience with what can go wrong in a childhood or home. I am fearful of ever becoming a parents because I know what it’s like to struggle for money, how easy children get traumatized, the dangers of pregnancy, etc. 

I also feel like disgusted by parenthood because the individual would have to be privileged and ignorant of the bad things that could go wrong, to willingly sign up for parenthood. 

It also makes me feel isolated and lonely because I don’t want what society wants. I’m “abnormal” again. 

It’s all very triggering.
