It's good in theory but harder in practice. Whenever I'm presented with a person like this, I just think to myself why would I spend my time and energy talking to somebody who is clearly so ignorant and hateful, you know? Whenever people around me tell a homophobic joke or say some misogynistic crap, I just smile at them and stare them down without saying anything. They are making me uncomfortable so I will make them uncomfortable too so they know what it feels like. Some get it, others don't. The latter I just wish a good day, put my headphones in and walk away.
