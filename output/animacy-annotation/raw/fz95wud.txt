Ha ha - I'm the tard??

The majority of Americans do ***NOT*** vote. 

The majority of Voters did ***NOT*** vote for Trump.

The best part is you idiots are so dumb and ignorant that Trump can just re-use previous politician taglines and you guys think they're brand new.

Trump supporters are neither silent, nor the majority. 

I'm sure you already know this though.
