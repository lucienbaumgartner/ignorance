&gt; And why is it so hard to realize that someone might be new and unaware and instead of mocking them you find another way to address it?

If you are unaware and make some mistakes, fair game. But if you read OP's comments she started insulting the staff... She acted like a cunt. Seriously, it's common sense that things don't operate the same way abroad as they do back home, how ignorant are you if you expect every country to behave the same way?
