Fair point. I suppose there does need to be a balance. Though for OP, while he does want approval, he needs to apply himself in order to get that, which he clearly isn't. It's as though he's expecting someone to approve of him without doing anything, which is both arrogant and ignorant of the struggles people face. It's a hard truth, but sometimes you need to face hard truths if you want to move forward.
