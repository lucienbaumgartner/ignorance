These kids had a problem precisely because the books weren’t in their local language. This guy translated it to their local language. Which is spoken only in their state. 
So having a single national language is exactly what won’t work. 


I shall assume you are not indian and unaware of India’s cultural history. States have protested when theyve felt other languages have been imposed on them. Our states were reorganised based on language precisely because of protests like these and people dying. 


It’s like saying the whole of Europe should have one language for teaching in schools and kids can speak in German or Belgian or whatever at home.
