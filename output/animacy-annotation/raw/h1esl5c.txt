Thats why I said ableism also includes that type of behavior. Like yes ableism is discrimination but also ignorance of disabled people and their abilities. To think someone in a wheelchair can't ride a bike just because they are mobility impaired or a blind person can't text just because they can't see. That's ableist. To see things through the lens of abled people with no understanding of what people with disabilities are able to do, to have a conviction that disabled people can't do the same things abled people can do is in a way, discriminatory, but it can't be harder for people to see it that way.

Discrimination includes prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, so to say that disabled people can't do something because they're disabled with complete conviction is discriminatory because that belief is based on the prejudice that disabled people can't do what abled people can do. But a lot of times it's not *because they're disabled,* it's because people can be ignorant and unaware that someone can actually do a particular activity based on their particular disability.
