The last time we went outside was around 4 hours ago. Iâ€™ve been with him observing him for around 45 minutes and he seems completely fine and unaware of the swelling.

Edit: I have a camera on his crate, it only captures video when he moves around but the first sign of swelling was when he shifted around at 9:30, I went in at 11:00 to take him outside. If it was an severe reaction that would have already happened, right?
