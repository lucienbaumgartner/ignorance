&gt; This kind of spying crap destroys free thought and breeds compliance. I think- and I could be wrong- there is probably some consortium of government/corporate peoples who have collectively determined that the only way to control people is for them to feel watched at every step (a fact demonstrated by research on crime in areas where CCTV has been introduced, etc).

Quoted directly from [leaked emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) (Wikileaks):

"And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."
