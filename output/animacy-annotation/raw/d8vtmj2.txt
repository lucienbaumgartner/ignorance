He already is the leader of the revolution.  I don't think that's what he bargained for, and surely not what the Democrats were going for when they decided to "elevate" him to "Pied Piper" status so the "unaware and compliant" citizenry would be scared into voting for Hillz.

But that's what we got, he is now the unlikely bearer of the revolution that started off as political, but as we watch our government antagonize a nuclear power and escalate tensions, this revolution is galvanizing into a movement of Patriots.

Funny to think of Trump as the head of that, hahahaha.  I was completely in shock n' awe to see folks posting Jill Stein tweets on The Donald.  Granted, the tweets fit their narrative ... but it's our narrative too, is it not?

When Americans come together as one, there is nothing we cannot accomplish, including preventing WW3 and tossing the corporate fascists out of power.  

We can do that.
