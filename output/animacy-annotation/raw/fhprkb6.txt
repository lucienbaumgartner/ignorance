Fine, ill do my good deed for the day and do your honework for you you fucking simpleton.

He was literally darkening pictures of Obama in attack ads during that same [campaign](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/john-mccains-2008-campaign-darkened-barack-obamas-skin-in-ads-study-finds-7930833),let alone the inherent absurdity of the implication that Arabs are neither decent or possibly even citizens.   I suppose you'd also have me believe he was unaware and unable to stop his vp choice from inciting such behavior in her speeches and rallies as well.

that's not even broaching any of his shitty human hits of the past like love of the Contras, Insane Forced Birth positions, The Keating 5 Savings and Loan Scandals, Pushing for creationism to be taught in schools, the list goes on.  He was a trash human with trash beliefs, that was actively trying to kill people the world over for most of his life and I'm glad he's dead.
