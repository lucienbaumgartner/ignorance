since your comment about teens transitioning for attention got deleted, here’s my response:

no one transitions for attention. some people don’t have dysphoria but they experience *euphoria* when presenting as their real gender. neither is a choice. some people don’t think they have dysphoria until much later, after they’ve accepted their identity and experienced euphoria. those people would possibly stay closeted and ignorant of their dysphoria forever if they weren’t “allowed” to be trans. no one here is arguing that being trans is a choice, just that this meme is gross and transphobic. let trans people be gender non conforming god damn it
