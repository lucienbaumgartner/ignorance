Above all, this individual is a hateful charlatan. She believes that she can use psychoanalysis to add an intellectual backing to her idiotic ramblings. Simply because she pretends to "*work*" with the unconscious, does not mean she has any verifiable understanding of what she claims to know. 

In my view, she is a complete moron who should not be further "examined" or "analyzed". It's like trying to find deeper meaning in the word vomit of Donald Trump, it just ain't there. She has exposed herself as hateful, idiotic, and ignorant of her shortcomings.
