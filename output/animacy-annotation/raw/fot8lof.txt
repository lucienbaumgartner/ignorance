With the exception of shady agencies or ones that have no idea what they're doing, it's nearly impossible to get a job as a copywriter without a creative portfolio. Assuming the job is for a midlevel copywriter, you're even more out of your depth as you'll need to show actual produced work to get that job plus a couple years of copy experience. But let's say its for a junior role----&gt; Junior portfolios today are largely built by attending a post-grad portfolio school (or ad school), where you spend up to 2 years learning how to build one, and undergoing multiple creative internships. The proliferation of these ad schools means having portfolio + internships are a prerequisite at this point to break in as a copywriter or creative at all. It's THAT competitive. Because of this, it's highly unlikely to make the switch from any other department into creative. It's hard to make the switch from any department to another period because of how ad agencies function. But the switch to creative is especially tough, because of all the specialized education and trials it takes to get your foot into that door in the first place.

If you're in a much smaller market where there's only a handful of agencies and all of them small, competition may be significantly less. But I still don't see any creative director in their right mind hiring a copywriter without a portfolio.

TLDR: Account executive  


EDIT: Lastly, applying for both jobs will immediately peg you as someone who is unaware and uninformed about how agencies function. That simple act may shoot you in the foot.
