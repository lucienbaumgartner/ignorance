Imagine being so brainwashed and ignorant, that your first thought when someone critiques the moronic Miami Cuban GOP hivemind is to go to the default "*he must be a Castro sympathizing commie*" ad hominem.  

It ***is*** possible to think that the Miami GOP Cubans are hypocritical imbeciles AND the Castros are murderous, sociopath frauds.  

Holy fuck, bro, mind blown right?

So remind me again what the fuck has the GOP done for Cuba again?  

(Other than talk a lot of shit at Versailles,  and impotently jerk off on Radio Mambi, that is....) 

PS.  I have first wave Cuban parents..and they co-sign me 100%.    Wake up, dipshit.
