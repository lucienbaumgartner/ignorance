What I don’t understand is that, I’m guessing a lot of neo-Nazis probably had grandparents or family members that fought in WWII. They probably had family that fought to defeat them. These people are so dumb and ignorant, that they criticize the “loser Dems” but worship 1. Nazis and 2. The Confederacy. Like... WHAT?! How does this sound logical in their idiotic little heads?!
