Lenin literally abolished private property. Hitler didn’t. 

Stalin was a tyrannical maniac and was responsible for Holodomor for sure. Authoritarianism is a plague, but even ideology-wise and even in praxis left wing authoritarianism has resulted in sustainable development and access to basic necessities such as housing, food, education, and healthcare. The auth left has much more redeemable qualities and proven methods than the far right has ever done. So no, they’re not comparable. The sins of tyrants using their power to inflict damage should never be forgotten and learned from, but to say they’re both basically the same is reductive and ignorant of history
