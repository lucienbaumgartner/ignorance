Omg! I was at the Meijer in Canton today, and I swear that I came home and said exactly this to my husband. I had to tell a couple of ladies to please back up because they were literally shopping right on top of me. People were so rude and ignorant that I only did half of my shopping and had to pop a xanax just to stand in line for 30 minutes. I usually avoid weekends at all cost, but I had to get some essentials. I will not be making this mistake again. FFS, I saw a woman with a newborn attached to her in a frontal carrier, and this child was not protected in any way from someone breathing within close proximity to her. I understand the struggle of kids, but it was scary to see her wearing a mask and the baby was just hanging there as a shield. It's kind of mind blowing.
