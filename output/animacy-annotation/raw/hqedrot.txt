Yes, but I think we should let Autistic people determine how they want to be addressed. Let us speak for ourselves.

Autism is a part of who we are. We can't separate from our selves. It is a core part of our identity.

To want to separate the Autism from the person is ignorant and ableist. Like the "Autism mums" out there who make us seem a burden.

Even medical professionals that are Allistic can't speak for us or tell us how to identify ourselves.
