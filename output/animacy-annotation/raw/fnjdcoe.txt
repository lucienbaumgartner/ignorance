It’s okay. It’s a big hurdle and honestly half the time people are so prideful and ignorant that it’s just hard not to put everyone in a box. I’m just in a more patient mood today. Sometimes I’m like “welp let’s just get rid of all the people who are directly hurting others” lol

Like those people in MI blocking the highway to protest shelter in place... it’s *really* hard to give those people the benefit of the doubt when they are literally holding up ambulances. Sometimes you just wanna smack someone.

But I think patience is a fruit the helps everyone grow. And we can’t expect people to change when we’re constantly yelling at them 😅 it’s amazing how many studies there are on human behavior and yet we still act contrary to what is the most helpful as a species most of the time. *shrug* maybe corona is the universe’s way of weeding us out 😅 stay safe!!
