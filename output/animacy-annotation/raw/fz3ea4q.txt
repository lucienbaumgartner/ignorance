I became a fan of shane in 2018, mostly through his docuseries and conspiracy videos. I had NO idea of his dodgy past, and when I started learning about it a few months ago I noped the fuck out of there and haven’t given him any views since. I did really enjoy his content, much less so the shit with jeffree, but I know there will be people who’ve been fans for 5+ years or who are just stubborn and ignorant that won’t have their mind changed by all of this surfacing. “Oh it’s in the past” yeah but it still fucking happened didn’t it and people don’t change THAT much
