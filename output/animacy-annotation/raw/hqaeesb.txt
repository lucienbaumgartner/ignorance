Are you u/Mimi_L's sibling? Did the user send you here?

I REPEAT: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON I JUST SUPPORT CONTENT CREATORS AND THEIR ABILITY TO DELETE HATEFUL COMMENTS.

Now stop being so ignorant and blind and actually take time to read my comments ffs. It isn't that hard.

Why do i always get in contact with you people on Reddit? Everywhere else people are able to read. Only here you find people that over and over again reply the same shit that just tells you that they don't even read your comments objectively. People like you need to get out of your door and have a disussion in real life because you have forgotten how that works. Hint: sometimes you need to listen.

And after telling them that they should read your comments you get this as an answer from u/Mimi_L : "I donâ€™t have time to argue with someone defending a racist and transphobe sorry Iâ€™m not reading your essay"

I hope you dont discuss like that offline because people will laugh at you for a reasonðŸ˜‚
