How pathetic that you think your friends speaking hindi is equivalent to be denied a job or denied a place to live based on nothing more than your race. Too dense to even understand that that is just being inconsiderate, not racist

Lmfao at you paying one dollar more. Yeah it is discriminatory. Does your simple minded self think that Chinese people facing discrimination therefore disproves Chinese privilege? You do also realise it isnt just Chinese people that pay more right? What you think there is malay privilege because everyone else pays a dollar more? 

What is ridiculous here is that your life is so privileged and ignorant that you cant even put yourself into the mind of a minority EVEN WHEN I GAVE YOU A LINK TO HELP... whenever a minority ends up in the news, there will always be racism in the comments. Have you ever felt that continual bigotry in your life?


How pathetic that you think simply seeing magically resolves the racism.


Did you even watch the video i gave from shanmugam? Or were you too ignorant to even watch that?

Even when LHL literally gives you examples you still dismiss it?  "Virtue signal" a BS excuse uneducated bigots like to use to cowardly ignore the problem. Lmfao at you blaming Indian programmers for your racist BS... Thankfully not all Chinese Singaporeans are as ignorant as you.
