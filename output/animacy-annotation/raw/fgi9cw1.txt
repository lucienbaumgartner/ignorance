&gt;He is the potus. He has every right to ignore his subordinates. They work for him not the other way around. Just like vindman who was crushed because Trump didnt use his Ukraine talking points, Trump is pres and he can dictate foreign policy as he pleases.

Sure, in the context of foreign policy, that can make sense. But this isn't foreign policy - this is *the weather*. Can you think of a better real life example of "old man yells at cloud"? This is an example of Trump ignoring *weather forecasts* because he believes, possibly out of arrogance and ignorance, that the weather should bend to his will. 

And you're okay with this? You think it's just fine that your chosen leader is so arrogant and ignorant that he expects *the weather* to bend to his will?
