Lol.. who did Amazon acquire? They only are in suspected talks with MGM... look, I really don’t care if you don’t like VIAC or not. But bottom line is they are a major media conglomerate, the only one left standing of any size and worth - CBS alone is huge, the most dominant prime time network, it destroys the other networks in ad revenue - also, ViacomCBS is the second largest content producer in the world, only behind Disney, and not by much... in a business where content is king, ViacomCBS has it, and it’s vertically integrated... it’s the golden goose.. and again, I cold care less about trying to convince you of anything. You’re obviously way uninformed and ignorant of the entire media space and how the industry works, because of you had even a bit of understanding, you’d see how incredibly valuable ViacomCBS is...
