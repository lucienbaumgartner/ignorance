Yeah, that is kind of the basic protagonist Murakami goes for, with a few exceptions. Murakami is not known for mixing up his formula lol. I think the basic idea is that these very mild-mannered, blasé characters always end up facing very dire situations without really knowing what the hell’s going on. I kind of think of it as being similar to Saitama from One Punch Man, Murakami’s characters are so unaware and disconnected from whatever is occurring that it becomes absurdly humorous.
