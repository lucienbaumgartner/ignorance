I got covid a week before winter break last year. I literally never left my dorm to begin with, and my friend needed a quiet place to study one night and I naively agreed.

He told me as he was leaving after being there for hours that he had chills and a bad headache a few days earlier, but felt fine now. I was mad that he didn't tell me this, made him get tested, he was positive. I tested positive the next day.

He's very uncaring and unaware of news/politics and thus basically believes whatever the last person who talked to him tells him. Turns out his roommate (who is outspokenly far-right and when the vaccine became available is now anti-vax of course) had convinced him that if you don't have it severe enough to be on a ventilator, it's impossible to spread it.

I had a bad case of it, too. No pre-existing conditions and am in great shape. I almost had to go to the hospital but luckily managed to fight it off after much agony. On top of that, I sank into a depression from losing 2 of my 5 senses, something that sounds like not a big deal but it fucks with your head really bad when you literally can't smell or taste....anything. It's impossible to describe and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I was unwilling to eat while going in and out of splitting headaches, nausea, chills, 102.8 degree fever, and more for almost 2 weeks straight. It was hell. Can't imagine if I got Delta whilst being unvaxxed.
