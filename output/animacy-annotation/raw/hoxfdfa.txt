&gt;I wrote a long reply, but looking back I genuinely don't want to make you uncomfortable, which this conversation is for understandable reasons. While you might not agree, I think we're both coming at this from a well-meaning place, but there's some sort of mismatch in our communication, which I'll take blame for. I will also admit that even though 14 quotes doesn't show "the true nature of the PL movement" or something, it does show that a not insignificant portion of people in the PL movement hold horrible views. 

Thank you. I appreciate it. Tbh I'm not going to respond to your replies because it really is quite disturbing to me to see anyone minimize or dilute the horrificness of that one no. 7 quote, which I think you were going with.

&gt;Thankfully, they seem to be a minority.

I'm not convinced of that and I don't know why you're assuming that. Do you really think that there are only 13-ish people in the entirety of the PL population who hold these views, and they happened to get elected to public office / became news commenters? I think the fact that they all have prominent positions and feel free to say these things tells me that they are broadly popular. 

&gt;Why is the "man" relevant? Is the implication that men can't be raped? But you are right, while I have been a victim of a lesser violation, I can't grasp how horrible rape is.

First I want to say that I am truly sorry you have been a victim of violation. That sucks and should never happen to anyone. 

So, men can absolutely be [raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender#:~:text=Rape%20of%20males,-Part%20of%20a&amp;text=A%20CDC%20study%20found%20that,an%20intimate%20partner%20or%20acquaintance). But it is far less frequent than women experiencing rape. I believe the current stats are [1 in 6](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence), and anecdotally I would say most of my friends have been raped or assaulted. (Me too). Whereas for men it's [1 in 71](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf). In addition, of men who are raped, most are raped by other men. Men do [almost all of the raping.](https://stoprape.humboldt.edu/statistics)

This isn't to demonize men, just to be realistic. Men, by and large, do not walk around with the threat of rape hanging over their heads. Men are not told to modify their behavior and make their lives smaller to avoid rape. Men don't carry their keys between their fingers while walking to their cars late at night just in case. 

Whereas these are universal experiences for women. We are always told, from puberty on, that it's a danger. Many of us have been mentally aware this could happen our whole lives, and know many others who have had it happen--often by the people we trust most. (As most rapists aren't psychos hiding in bushes, but people we already know--our friends, boyfriends, husbands etc. Mine was a boyfriend).

Are there women who say horrible, rapey things on this sub in support of abortion bans? Sure. But a position like "making me have a job is rape" or "taxes are rape" is just so blindingly insensitive and ignorant that the only way I can imagine someone saying or thinking that is if they have never been raped themselves and genuinely can't imagine being raped. That would likely be a cisgender man. Most women, even those who haven't ever been raped, can imagine it and have lived with the threat of it our whole lives.
