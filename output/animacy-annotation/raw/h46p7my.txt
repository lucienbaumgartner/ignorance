I’ve been boating for several decades and wake boats and their owners are much like the first batch of snow boarders in the first years on ski mountains.  

Most of them didn’t ski and their families didn’t ski/snow board.  They went up to the mountain and never had the education about mountain courtesy taught to them like skiing did.   They mostly didn’t take lessons, they were in large groups and unaware of how to behave.  It was really terrible for several years until they aged up and became wiser.  

I feel many wake board boat owners are similar.  These boats are their first experience with boat ownership and operation.  They are woefully unprepared and ignorant of common waterway courtesies.
