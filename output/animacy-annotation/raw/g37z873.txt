First of all, I commend you for asking, even if people might become rude about it. There’s a lot we don’t know and a lot of info that changes over time, you shouldn’t be assumed to just know everything. 

If the people going out to party were only going out in situations where all individuals want to assume the risk, or would be “fine” (i.e., no one who cared about getting COVID would get sick). However, there are very few people where this rule remains true. Most people don’t think about all of the other people they interact with who they could be exposing, because it’s a really weird thing to think about that we’ve never had to consider before. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of some people you may encounter who didn’t sign up for the risk you took on by going to that party: grocery store workers, food service (including contact delivery), transportation partners (Ubers, buses, planes, etc.), apartment/home maintenance staff, roommates/suitemates/housemates, professors/TAs/peers, any medical professionals or law enforcement, and even just people you’re waiting in line in front of or passing by (yes, even outside). These are all people you see who didn’t take on the risk of going to the party you went you. Sure they’re taking a risk by being out in public, but there’s a general societal standard of mutual respect and limited contact.  Sure the cashier at Publix knows there’s a risk by going into work, but they’re hoping that wearing masks, sanitizing, distancing, and general expectations of limited risk are going to be beneficial to lowering their risk of contracting it. Additionally, many of the people mentioned may not have a choice to be out because their job requires it or it’s a situation where distancing or isolation is unavoidable. 

But let’s just say it’s a more ideal situation and you don’t see any of those people. You’re locked in your house, getting contactless food deliveries, you experience no emergency (maintenance, medical, or otherwise), and the ONLY contact you have with other people is when you go out to party. Then that should be okay, right? Well actually not even then. You’re still putting others at risk, even if mostly indirectly. A more direct consideration is employees at locations you may be going to this party. Bar or club employees are being exposed, and while they most definitely understand the risk they’re taking on by working in such an environment, your individual decision still increases the risk of transmission to them. And to others. This is where the indirect part comes into play. Every additional person inside a party has a level of risk of having COVID (assuming they’re asymptomatic and unaware). That potential risk only affects their health if they are in strict isolation. However, when that one person interacts with someone else, the risk is passed on to them and every single person they interact with. So say Jerry doesn’t think he has COVID and goes to hang out with Molly one day. Jerry isn’t just exposing his risk to Molly, but also to Molly’s roommates, coworkers, and professors. And there’s also risk to the contacts of all of those people, and so on and so forth. Yes the risk is lower with each person away you move, but there’s still a risk. Now going back to that party. The situation with Jerry and Molly could have affected a lot of people, even with just one hang out. Now consider a large group of people all a part of that interaction. Think about all of the people interacting with each other, and the people they see, and who those people encounter.. a single interaction can exponentially increase transmission of a contagious virus. And the environment of a party/bar/club/etc. is a perfect storm for virus transmission. People are usually close together, not wearing masks, breathing heavily (dancing, singing, talking loudly), and add in alcohol/drugs, everyone’s judgment is lowered and there’s going to be some even less smart decisions made. 

And one final important thing I want to note regarding this is people choosing to take on risk when going out in public (in typically necessary situations like grocery shopping). Yes, people who don’t want to sick could (ideally) stay home and isolate and never have any interaction with anyone ever again. But most people can’t do that and don’t want to. Regardless of political views, everyone knows the economy has been hit hard and we want it to recover. We want our lives to get back to normal. And for the most part, we can start moving towards that **but it needs to be slow**. We can’t go from one day us all being locked inside to going out to raves the next. We have to make gradual, incremental changes as we learn more about this virus, take strides towards a vaccine or treatment, and try to keep as many people as can alive and healthy. So places are starting to open up, but some have mask mandates or other restrictions. We’re trying to get people back to affording their rent and food and feeling sane again, but trying to keep risks down. That requires an enormous level of trust in others and courtesy towards others. You have to trust that other people are making smart, low-risk decisions so *you* don’t get sick, but you also need to offer the same to others by not engaging in high-risk activities so that *they* don’t get sick. Spreading COVID around a community (because let’s be honest, a perfect bubble of partygoers will never be maintained, there’s going to be some “leaks” of interaction with outside individuals) is just going to cause increased outbreaks, more illness, more deaths, and likely spur another shutdown (to varying extents). It’ll just be moving backwards weeks, and possibly months, with the only positive outcome being a fun night with friends. 

Now I know I probably didn’t say everything completely right, but I tried to give a little context to why people are hating on parties so much. It’s not just about the people at the party, but everyone else in a community as well. To get through this as a society and hopefully get a life that’s as close to normal as can be, we **have** to stick together and work as a team. People are getting sick, people are dying, people are losing their jobs, people are going hungry, even if you don’t see these issues firsthand, they’re all around you and your actions impact every one.
