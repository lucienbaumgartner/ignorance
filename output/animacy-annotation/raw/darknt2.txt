I believe that there are two sides to the coin. The politicians are unaware and uninformed about sustainable "Development". Indian civil contractors, architects and the like have never demonstrated designs that please. 

Our culture of "lowest price first" + "corruption second" have lead to a culture where the aesthetics, environmental impact, disabled accessibility, lower maintenance costs etc. are all attributes that are ignored.

The bureaucracy is equally to blame. They are the ones who should encourage this, but instead simply go on building crap that no one needs.

I oppose the "Bangalore Steel Flyover" project, among the many problems is the cutting down of trees. Environmental opposition is ONLY ONE aspect, but I keep using that as the only argument because that is the only possible argument that has a slim chance of winning. Same with many projects. I oppose them on other grounds, but my arguments are always environmental because that is the only one that wins.
