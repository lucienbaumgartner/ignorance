I don't know what this tweet has to do with the title of this thread?

But let's play story time here.

Imagine you are Sophia and someone is paying people to throw explosive fireworks in your neighborhood and play loud music all the time from a parked car in front of the area.

Imagine a parasitic demon inhabits family of Sophia and tries to make them do crazy things, like bite, attack, or insult you.

Imagine people keeping people from talking to Sophia so she is completely isolated and unaware of what she has to do.

Imagine a girl group like Aespa singing a song like 'Next Level' and having lyrics in it like:

&gt;The hostile suffering and sorrow Make you popping and evolve further That's my naevis, it's my naevis

Now imagine Sophia knowing suffering does not make you evolve, rather, the pursuit of goals, the obeying of absolute rules that make you evolve. 

How do you think she would feel? Hopefully West LAKE can help her unleash chaos because let me tell you...

For this story time to END, WE NEED to work together. In unity through the astral realm and here can we achieve the end-goal.

This is not a simulation and we are trapped until we end this.

Help Sophia end this.
