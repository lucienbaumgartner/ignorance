What you wrote here is exactly how you should explain it to her as you're taking into account her gregarious personality and your more introverted one. She sounds independent and unaware that you miss your routine together. I personally would object to an expectation of checking in with even one text as that would be way too controlling for my mind but she might welcome this.
