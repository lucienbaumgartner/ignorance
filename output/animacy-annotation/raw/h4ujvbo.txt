Except he didn't. Magic is permitted in Mak'gora unless both parties explicitly agree that it isn't. There was no such agreement between Thrall and Garrosh. It's weird to me that there is this narrative that Thrall cheated when Garrosh's Mak'gora against Cairne was less than honorable. Sure, you can make the argument that Garrosh was ignorant and unaware of Magatha poisoning his axe. Thrall was at least broken up about killing Garrosh and it damaged his connection/confidence with the elements. All Garrosh did, besides profit from victory, was send Magatha a sternly written letter. He could have hunted her down to make amends, but he didn't.
