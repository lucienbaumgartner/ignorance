&gt; what? you are too spoiled to accept it?

first of all it's not "real life" it's a construct made for the benefit of the people at the very top of society. second of all, capitalism puts power in the hands of whiny little rich kids who do absolutely nothing

&gt; also exploitation does not exist 

I literally can't even make fun of this one, I can not fathom how ridiculously privileged and ignorant that statement is, though I bet the hundreds of millions of unpaid workers both in America and the global south can

&gt; ah yes, that system where you are forced to pay to a nobleman without your consent? and also is forced to let your gf sleep with him before you get married? 

First of all Prima Nocta was never a thing, though you not knowing  that does explain why you don't know shit about anything that isn't a rich people feelings line. Lastly, yes you are forced to give the value of your labor to a capitalist or starve to death, and that's excluding if your union is crushed and have to starve anyway
