You are absolutely right. I would advise to be excluded from the lawsuit for this reason.

It is unlikely anyone will receive a reasonable amount of money from this settlement.

The money you receive has nothing to do with student loans, interest incurred etc.

Each person who qualifies will receive their measly 500 or 1000 dollar amount plus an undisclosed amount per credit hour for every credit hour you paid for at Devry.

The amount per credit hour is never stated. I called 800 number and spoke with counselor, she stated there is no information on how much per credit hour we would receive.

They state in the settlement that they don't admit to running the false ads yet are attempting to place all these people in a settlement an mail them out a couple thousand dollar checks while they sweep it under the rug and take away your right to actually sue them in the future.

This is nothing more than a deceptive way to catch people unaware and desperate for money while they gain immunity.
