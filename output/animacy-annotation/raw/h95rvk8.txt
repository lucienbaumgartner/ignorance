If you weren't so uneducated and knew your history you wouldn't use loaded edge lord terms like "terrorism" as if they have any real world value or moral significanc. There also concepts related to cultural relativism and judging past actions by today's standards which just shows your intellectual immaturity and ignorance. You are confirmation biasing your "America is the great Satan" narrative because you are uneducated and ignorant of the academic field of ethics and can't see past your edgelord narratives. Much of your immaturity comes from you not knowing how to reason logically. You have literally no clue how uneducated and naive you are. Then you just openly admitted you will remain willfully ignorant and uneducated...
