&gt;I believe most rapists rape people of their own race.

Quite likely, but I don't know the numbers for that, and it's also irrelevant.

You literally claimed women have the privilege of not having worry about a potential rapist since he *might* not be attracted to them. Can you not see how ridiculous and ignorant that sounds? The possibility of something happening to a woman walking alone compared to a man is very different.

&gt;I’m saying that this one particular rapist probably doesn’t attack those types of females.  

You have no way of knowing that, and neither do those women.

&gt;And I’m pretty sure rape has at least a little something to do with attraction. 

I'm sure attraction can play a part, but it doesn't have to. Ugly women and men get raped too. Besides that there are people and rapists who *are* attracted to different races, the elderly, obese people or children. Your argument doesn't make sense and just makes you come across as racist and a shallow person who judges people by their looks. Please take a good look at what you wrote and think about it.
