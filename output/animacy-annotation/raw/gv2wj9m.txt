So you refer to “them Irish”, then mention the Irish government, then say you’re not talking about the Irish state but specifically about people who were of Irish descent but were participating with the British in colonization. 
So those people would probably have considered themselves more British than Irish given the common history, and the fact they were colonizing under Britain’s flag leaves no culpability on the Irish state itself or the Irish people as a whole. Ireland did not have colonies.

It would have been correct had you just said that modern Irish people need to recognize that they benefit from modern conceptions of whiteness, and need to stop simply complaining about their historical oppression as a colony of Britain whenever the plights of other people are brought up, but stating that historically Irish people are separately, specifically complicit in colonization on a whole is just disingenuous and ignorant of history. Britain practiced methods of colonization in Ireland from the 1200s until the 1900s that they would then use to even more damaging effect on other peoples. 

The actions of Irish people who then left to another country, became citizens of that country, and were then subsequently complicit in colonization cannot be considered flat out “Irish people”, and instead should be properly referred to as that if that’s what you’re criticizing.
