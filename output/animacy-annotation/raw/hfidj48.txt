What about venting about people I find annoying? 
For example, there's this girl who acts in an overly bubbly and sweet manner. At first I thought she was just a super nice to the core person but hanging out with her, she surprised me with how selfish and rude she can be. (She grew up pretty wealthy so I'm assuming she's spoiled and unaware of her rudeness)

What pisses me off even more is how blinded my guy and girl friends are due to her "innocent" facade.

I don't know if a part of me is jealous that someone who seems as fake as her can still be liked by people or disappointed in the people who believe her act.

Granted, I don't know if it's her upbringing that made her act spoiled or if her niceness is a facade. Either way this is one of the examples I would rant about.
