It is 100% the driver's fault. 

Every school bus I've ever seen has both the window sign AND blinking lights.  All new school buses have both.  Most now have an extending arm in front that requires children to not walk directly in front of the bus (to prevent them from being hit by THE BUS)  I know that the reason there's not a bigger extension into the opposite travel path is because of the risk of hitting another vehicle (mostly trucks).  

 When I took my driver's test, I had to answer several questions about stopping for school buses.  That was in 1998.  I'm all for retesting/recertifying periodically, but anyone who sees a stopped school bus and doesn't think "Hmm, maybe I need to be careful, there's kids in the area" is dangerously unaware and willfully ignorant of others and situational awareness.
