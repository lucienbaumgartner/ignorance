As parent I would interpret “I’m an Atheist” as “I’m very confused” so I would be generally understanding unless the tone of conversation was disrespectful, after all a kid needs to respect their parents specially if they are the ones paying the bills.

I would also point out that atheism as practiced by most atheists is nothing but a general feeling superiority over religions and religious people, justified under the false pretense that religious people are closed minded, ignorant and dogmatic, when in reality most hard line atheists will fall into the exact same category, being just as much irrational and ignorant with regard to their beliefs — yes, beliefs — than the most violent and ignorant religious people. 

The right attitude, the healthy attitude towards life is SKEPTICISM geared towards all forms of authority along with deep self awareness of one’s own values and beliefs — including the knowledge of all external influences that lead you to believe in certain things (e.g. if you are an atheist, where did you get the idea that atheism is a superior philosophy? Where did you first hear about this idea? Did you hear it from a primary, secondary or tertiary source?). The cost of not having this attitude, whether if you call yourself an atheist or a religious person, is being unaware of who is trying to manipulate you. This unawareness is widespread among atheists, which is the reason why most self proclaimed atheists nowadays functionally behave as marxists — which is the worse religion of all, since not even a true religion.
