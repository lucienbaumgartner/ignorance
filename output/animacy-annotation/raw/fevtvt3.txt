The fact when I started playing Arknight not knowing anything and got Exusiai, blissfully ignorant and unaware that she was the center rate up in the current headhunt because I didn't know that the elite 2 system works like the mod 3 system in GFL.

So anyway, besides being cute and having guns for wings, is she good?
