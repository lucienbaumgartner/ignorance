&gt;Since "red pill" doesn't have any rigid meaning, your rant was pointless. I don't subscribe to a set of beliefs called "the red pill"

I'd love to see where I call the "red pill" a specific set of beliefs. You can say you've been "red-pilled" with any line of thought, the thought itself isn't what matters, it's the belief you've been "red-pilled" about said line of thought that is garbage. 

&gt;it's a euphemism to describe discovering that the world you grew up in is fake and gay

We're going to act as if the red pill only means "Haha the world isn't sunshine and rainbows xd guess I'm a grown up now" huh? Being "red-pilled" means you've been enlightened on the "undeniable truth" of a situation instead of being naive and unaware. That is it. It is commonly used on places like 4chan and other counter-culture forums. If you aren't even aware of how it's commonly used within internet culture, why are you using it?
