I have panic attacks but I differentiate  them from rage attacks, which I used to get when I was younger and unaware of my PTSD and chronic depression. And yes, I would literally toss furniture and break things, and frequently hurt myself in the process.

As for thinking you would die, I feel ya. My first panic attack I thought I was having a heart attack but I rode it out. When I later told my doc about it he yelled at me that I should have called an ambulance  or gone to the ER anyway because, he said, women who do get heart attacks tend to think it's  just a panic attack and then die while waiting for it to pass.
