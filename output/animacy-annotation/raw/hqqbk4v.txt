Are you sure it wouldn't be better reserved for the heavily blue States that lead the nation in homelessness bc their policies are ignorant and barely sustainable like Cali, new York, Hawaii,  etc.? I would say states where homeless people run amuck shitting in the streets like a 3rd world country is probably closer.
