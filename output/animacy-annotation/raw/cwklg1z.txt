Take time out of the equation. Time is not applicable here.

Imagine that we are all part of one giant octopus.

We are the tips of its tentacles.

Each tentacle is protruding into a box (our life experience).

Each tentacle is protruding through a different hole.

Each tentacle is self-aware, and unaware that they are all connected to the same host octopus.
