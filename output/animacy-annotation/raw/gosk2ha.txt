 I think that he's a big example of ignorance sometimes being as bad as malice. He's hyper-passionate, but also entirely blind to his own faults and the effect he has on others. Never seems to grow, to change, to experience an actual character arc that would let him do either. He just keeps pushing forward, ignoring all the negatives in life, addicted to fun and fame. 

WB described him as being like a excited little puppy, and that's what I mean by ignorant. Not stupid...more that he's blind to the damage he can (and does) cause. A puppy knocks over a vase while playing, feels bad if someone shouts at them, and then goes right back to playing. If nobody teaches them to be better, then they'll just keep wrecking things, and not caring.

He's entirely devoid of self-awareness, can't see himself the way others do, and by the time he figures it out...all the damage is already done. In the real world there are millions of people like that, selfish and ignorant of others, even if they're not malicious (sometimes). He represents something a lot of people hate, and seems unable to move past that. So, revulsion.
