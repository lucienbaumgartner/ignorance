Maybe just make peace with the fact that you can’t control how other people feel. If there is stability in the family life, keep it that way.  Your personal sex and romantic life really isn’t anyone’s business in the first place, and I think too many people are too concerned with being “accepted” by everyone. That’s never gonna happen because nobody is universally accepted by everyone. We all got our quirks, secrets, opinions and judgements. 

Obviously I dont know your life so you gotta do what you think is right in context. But letting go of the need to be approved, even by family, can take a weight off of you.  If the people you grew up around are generally ignorant and judgemental, then so be it.  That is their shortcoming, not yours. And to desire approval or acceptance from people who are ignorant does not seem logical to me. 

Be yourself and make peace with the knowledge that you can only change yourself.  And as RuPaul says, “what other people think of you is none of your business”

With all that said, I am not “gay” nor do I use any particar term to identify myself sexually, I totally understand the coming home shock. But having lived at home for a while, and gotten over my own shit… the truth is that barely anyone actually gives a shit about my sex life. 

Good luck!
