&gt;I'm basing them on why no-knock warrants exist in the first place and why they have been used.  They are used for officer safety and to protect the community by controlling when and where the capture occurs and ideally catching the suspect(s) unaware and unable to mount violent resistance (hopefully asleep).  They're also used to prevent destruction of evidence.

Yes because a person like Paul Manafort was going to pose real resistance to the police... I think it's overused when white collar criminals are its target for example...
