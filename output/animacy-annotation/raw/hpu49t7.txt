If they came in to this group and started replying to people calling them evil and hideous and monstrous then that would be anti-social and toxic. That would be fair reasoning for a ban. But they didn't, they spoke negatively about this group in a seperate group because they disagree with the beliefs and ideas posted here. That might be an insult to you but there is nothing wrong with that, and that does not give you a reason to ban them.






There is no excusing what you did. It would be like me banning someone from attending a church because they spoke negatively of our beliefs elsewhere. How are they meant to potentially begin dialogue and learn to accept or further disagree with said beliefs if you instantly silence them.





What you did was ignorant and childish, you should unban them ideally. If you continue your behaviour and silencing and carry that throughout your life you will become blocked off and simply view everyone else as evil, and will interpret all negativity or criticism as a direct attack against you.




I hope you can learn from this experience.
