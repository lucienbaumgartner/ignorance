NTA 100%! This is some ableist BS right here. They have taken advantage of your hospitality, and your SIL is so rude and ignorant that she not only refuses to learn sign language, she blames you when you aren’t able to hear her? That’s completely ridiculous. 

What kind of mom just slips out of the house like that without checking with the person watching her baby, telling them when it last ate and had its diapers changed, making sure they know where everything is the baby might need? That’s odd. 

The blame rests solely on SIL for this one. She remained wilfully ignorant of your hearing abilities and is trying to make that your fault. It’s not. It’s ridiculous to expect you to go through every room of your house any time they are out on the off-chance they left their baby. They are trying to make you compensate for their complete lack of understanding you. Don’t let them manipulate you. Kick them out, and don’t feel guilty. I feel sorry for that poor baby too, because her parents failed her and are trying to push that responsibility on someone who didn’t ask for it. Shame on them.
