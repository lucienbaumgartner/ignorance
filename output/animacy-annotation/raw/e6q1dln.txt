He wasn't great at public speaking or thinking on his feet, and there's the unfortunate reality that a large portion of people hear a southern accent and think "dumb," but the dude knew his shit about certain things. With Trump, I'm 99% sure there's not a single subject on which I wouldn't be more of an expert than him if I just took 10 minutes looking it up on wikipedia, and I'm kind of a dumb motherfucker.

I'm not being hyperbolic, the dude seems that stupid, unaware and delusional.
