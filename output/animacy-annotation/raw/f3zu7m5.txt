I don't downvote unless the post or comment is so reprehensible and ignorant that I fear it will do hard to the median intelligence of the group. That being said, if I find I disagree or find something so banal or mildly misdirected, I do what I do in real life and move on. I have realized that there is no need for anger or agitation with regards to someone's beliefs or opinions. Someone who is misguided will remain misguided until such time that they choose to open themselves up to new ideas. To those who have made negative statements about the OP's post, you clicked on it either because you were interested or that you wished to make a negative comment that has not furthered the conversation one iota. I believe it to be a valid question and if I had not, I would have scrolled past it and forgotten it in a matter of moments.
