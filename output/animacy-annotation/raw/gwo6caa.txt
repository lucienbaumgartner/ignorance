People who make and who sign such petitions are absolute retards! What effect is this gonna have on the PM? Nothing! When ferocious protests like anti CAA protests and farmer protests couldn't rock this Govt, this petition is stupid. God knows what people are trying to achieve.

And no it doesn't send a message. None what so ever. The govt is blind, deaf, aloof and ignorant of such stupidities which are made by a microscopic minority of the overall electorate
