&gt; So far, Denver agencies have made more than 672 contacts, given out 280 warnings, issued 15 orders to comply and one citation.

no one is saying you are murdering children.

they are just saying you are a selfish idiot if you truly feel the need to push the limits of the stay at home order.

You going out to run - explicitly permitted, unless you are running with friends and you are basically touching each other while running.  You are not in violation of the stay at home order.  Go to a park that you can walk (or run whatever) to.  Go outside on your own two feet.  That is permitted.

there is no internet virtue signalling here.  Just people saying "come on, give us a break, just listen to what has been said and suck it up for a few weeks.  can you just do that or do you have to be so selfish and unaware that you put people needlessly at risk"
