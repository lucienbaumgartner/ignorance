To be honest the letterbox design of the docking port seems to be a throw back to the days of the earlier Elite games where they needed docking to be an easy to program yet hard to play game mechanism.

"Whats an easy to program yet hard to play mechanic" I hear you cry? Large object, small hole. "But when you're in a cobra everything will kill you!" pipes up the great unwashed. 

Then in that case when you are swollen with profit, fat with wealth and strong of shield, piloting the great ships of endgame let the never ending station rotation also be your great enemy, for the all encompassing Lords of FDev are unaware and therefore unable to implement many other kinds of game play elements that will be present in future video games for they have not been implemented in our time line! 

Thus when the great resurgence of the space sim provides the ample opportunity for Elite to spawn, grow, thrive and profit once again; old, outdated, unnecessary and obnoxiously average game play mechanics will rise again under the warm familiar guise of "homage" and "nostalgia". 

PRAISE BE TO THE BRABEN.
