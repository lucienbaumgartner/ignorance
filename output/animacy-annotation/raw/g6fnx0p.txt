You're falling forward, stay steadfast in your determination to improve. It sounds like you've been progressively checking off weeks, and months of sobriety... think back to a time when you were more care free and unaware of your issues and the damage they can cause... now give yourself a pat on the back for how far you've come, and look forward to where you're about to go. The guilt you feel from screwing up comes from a knowledge and maturity towards addiction that many never gain. We learn from our mistakes, so that they can make us even better.   


It's the good ones that always seem to break.
