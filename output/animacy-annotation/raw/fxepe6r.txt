You're not even on the same fucking scale. The whole point is that you shouldn't focus on fighting enemies in a spy mission.   
  
You go into the vault, the enemies are unaware and easy to avoid.   
You can either avoid them without stealth, which takes more time, or avoid them with stealth, which takes less time.   
  
The stealth is fucking irrelevant.
