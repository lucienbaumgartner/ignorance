I've found a big part of being gay and unaware of yourself is feeling strongly and heavily attracted to VERY specific people but having 0 explanation for yourself or others because you don't even entertain it could be a gay thing. Like how I was in love with the best friend of the main character in Princess Diaries at like 8 years old who, on reflection, is 100% coded lesbian. But as a kid I was just like "gosh she would be a swell friend I just think she's so neat."
