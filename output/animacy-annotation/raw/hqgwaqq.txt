When men talk about women who have hurt them, I hear a lot of them using misogynistic language which geeneralise all women as being these ignorant and hurtful creatures.

When talking about women, you should be talking about them like you'd be talking about any other person who's hurt you. Just be honest, don't make any sexist implications.
