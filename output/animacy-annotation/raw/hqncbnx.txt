Firstly, they ALL do it. She was interviewed and defending everyone’s right to do so. Nowhere is there any discussion about her actual trades. This information is easy to find. She even said that everyone is required to disclose. I imagine that some don’t. 

Secondly, the worst offenders by a large margin are the 4 who sold their stocks right before the covid sell-off. https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market. Those persons should all lose their seats and arguably go to jail because those trades were so obviously dubious. The majority of them are Republicans (surprise). No one's making cheeky memes about them.

The only thing funny about this is how ignorant and deliberate it is to make such an effort to point at Pelosi as the chief demon of this phenomenon. Anybody who knows anything about anything knows that this is not the case. They all trade. One only needs to consult the link I posted to find those who act far worse.

Troll level stuff. She talked about trading because she was interviewed. No discussion about her actual trades. 

Have that same interviewer ask those same questions to Mitch McConnell and see what he says.
