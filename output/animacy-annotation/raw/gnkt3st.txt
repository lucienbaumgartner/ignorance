The funny thing about all of this is that in the grand scheme of things 1619 project makes almost no difference on what actually happens in US history classrooms and itâ€™s sent conservatives into an epic tailspin.

The work of the NCTE, otoh, is massively influential and practically amounts to much larger changes about what happens in the classroom. And conservatives have never made a peep.

Is it all a grift or are conservatives just dumb and unaware of currents in education?
