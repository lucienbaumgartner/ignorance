its because they are immature/ socially inept and can't handle social situations without reassurance from a partner every second.  Look at the behavior of little children in a social situation and then watch women together....No difference.  Women are given the illusion of equality but in reality they are kept immature and sexualized and unaware that the cage they have always been in has just been made transparent.  Men have a similar struggle going on  but thats another topic
