&gt; Feral cats are domesticated cats that live in the wild by definition. Google it.

"In the wild" simply means "not belonging to any human". Not "outside of cities".

Feral cats can and do live in cities and are indeed a problem in some places.

&gt; Domestic cats are nowhere near adequate vermin control in cities.. for every cat that is a subpar vermin hunter in the grand scheme, there are hundreds that won't even bother hunting vermin.

This is simply false. Cats are excellent at hunting vermin and kill hundreds each year. Moreover, their presence also deters such creatures from even inhabiting certain areas.

Anyone who has had a vermin problem then acquired a cat is likely to observe a very significant difference.

&gt; You are very clearly uneducated on the matter, you should do some basic research before pretending to know what you're talking about.

See, this is the problem with anti-vaxxers like yourself - you think that you've "done research" but you're actually incompetent and unaware of it. Because of your deep level of incompetence, you're both incapable of doing research, and you think you have, as you desperately search out affirmation of your false world view.

You are no different from such people.

Yes, cats absolutely make an enormous difference as to local rodent populations, and especially their boldness. One study of cat-rat interactions found that even though the cats only killed a couple rats over the course of a couple months, the presence of cats led to a 99% reduction in rat presence in the FOV of their motion-sensitive cameras, meaning that the presence of cats deterred the rats from venturing out into the spaces that cats occupied.

Cats kill more than an order of magnitude more small mammals than birds, as birds are vastly more difficult prey.
