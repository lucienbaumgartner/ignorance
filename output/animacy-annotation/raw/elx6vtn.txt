Stupid lady. My kids get their flu shot but I don't. I caught the swine flu before we had a vaccine for it. My doctor refuses to give me one since I am a carrier of that. Know what that means? I'm guaranteed to get the flu every single flu season cause 1. I'm more susceptible and 2. I'm not allowed to get a flu shot. It must truly be nice to be blissfully ignorant and unaware that people like you make people like me literally sick. 

For those wondering, the years following the 2009 flu epidemic I got a flu shot and it made me severely ill. I didn't know I was supposed to tell doctors I had caught the swine flu so that they would know not give me a flu shot. I haven't had a flu shot since 2011 for that reason. Really fucking sucks.
