I cal them “fucking morons”. I’ve been hit twice riding a motorcycle, both times it wasn’t my fault, but I was wearing gloves, a jacket, a helmet (full face the second time because pavement surfing on your face fucking sucks), boots and jeans... and I still broke a bunch of bones and got a bunch of strawberries from where my coat rode up a bit.

If I’d been wearing no helmet I’d probably be dead right now. If I wasn’t wearing a jacket I can only imagine how mangled my entire torso would have been.
Honestly, I can’t imagine being so arrogant and ignorant that I’d think not wearing a helmet was a good idea. You have no airbags, seat belts, roll cages, crumple zones, engine to absorbe the impact... you have to wear protection because your bike has no safety features in the event of an accident. I don’t fucking care if it’s hot out, you know how much road rash burns?
