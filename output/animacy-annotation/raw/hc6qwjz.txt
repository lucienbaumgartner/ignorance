No, it is not.  Evolution measures overall species success, not a one-time win.  A blowfly is not greater than a lion by any metric.  

But if you are trying to say that capitalists are parasites and workers are the host...you are deeply retarded and unaware of what happens when the best and brightest are not in charge.  Workers are at the bottom for a reason.
