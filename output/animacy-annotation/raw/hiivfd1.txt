Well you shouldn't take the response from ppl that have never worked in their life . Boomers literally screwed us so bad all you have to do is point. 
I got in a similar argument with my fam, I sayed you can't get food stamps unless you have a social security number. They take 2 secs to look it up and without a spread of humanity, try to defend their argument that you don't have to have a social if you have kids and can "get food stamps with no social". 
I stopped them. I said in your attempt to discredit me, you are saying we should let children starve so that way you don't have to pay as much taxes. I find boomers to be the least moral and ignorant of about anything they don't instantly agree with.
