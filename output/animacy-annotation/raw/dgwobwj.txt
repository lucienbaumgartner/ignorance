I went for drinks with a friend of over 2 years and one of his friends - we all worked at the same place - on a regular Friday night

Not sure if drugged or not. Was gang raped. They fled the country, never had justice, deal with 2+ years of expensive therapy just to cope with PTSD

Am forever angry at people who think rape jokes are funny. They are so uneducated and unaware and callous creatures

Intimacy in my marriage strongly affected

I still find ways to be happy and am freakishly highly functioning 

But it still really sucks
