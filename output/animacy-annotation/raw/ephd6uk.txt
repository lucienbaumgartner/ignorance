Indoctrination runs deep.  I remember having a short conversation with my mother about one of the Gospel Topics.  As I critiqued the Church on the topic, even though the critiques was honest, clear, and concise, she was shocked.  She mentioned my comments could lead
apostasy.

The problem with my mother is that she struggles with many aspects of her life today caused by not advancing herself educationally, lacking individuality and self confidence, having little money, and still having debt into the retirement years.

My mother supports the very organization that is the root cause of her problems at this point in her life.  Yet she is unaware and loyal to what I often refer to as the beast (Mormon Church).

It takes a strong individual to break away from a cult and an even stronger individual to stand strong against those that are indoctrinated.
