&gt; Perception is a weak, blunt tool.

Except you're not making an effort to improve your perceptions so your technology will always be affected and held back by it.

&gt; You could try and build your thought patterns and technologies on those mistaken perceptions

And what if our current perceptions of the universe are mistaken? What if they're not revealing the whole thing to us? What if we're developing programs and technology based on scattered information with huge chunks missing?

&gt; The novel Flatland from 1880s

Yes, we've all read it. It's science fiction with a story. Also based on the author's perceptions of the universe (three dimensional).

&gt; you're writing as if you've had some personal revelation

Stopped taking you seriously here. Consider excluding personal insults from your comments when while we have this discussion. 

&gt; Your personal incredulity about imagination and visualisation being inferior to direct perception doesn't hold much weight.

And I'm sorry that you're so arrogant and ignorant that you think that it's impossible that our biological perceptions of the universe actually affects everything about us, even mathematics that math snobs deem "perfect" and "flawless".

But it's okay, there's still time for you to learn.
