Not buying it. This shows done a good job standing on its own you don’t have to reference events of the show but you should at the very least mention his cousin. Considering that’s another aspect of Superman. If this show pulls a Smallville and just forget about it for 7 seasons not really a good look considering this time they don’t really have the excuse of Clark being young and ignorant of his Kryptonian heritage. Besides Supergirl never stopped referencing Superman so neither should he.
