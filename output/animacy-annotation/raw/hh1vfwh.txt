My SO and I haven’t had any kind of intimate relations in 10 years. I sleep with the dog. Does he really think I’m ok with that? He’s a dufus if he thinks I am. I told him years ago that he is supposed to make sure I never need another man, for anything, but he ignored that too. His ps5 is much more interesting than me I guess. It’s ok though, because it keeps him distracted and unaware of the time while I’m out playing with AP.
