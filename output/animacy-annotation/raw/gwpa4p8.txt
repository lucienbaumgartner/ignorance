I'm so sorry, my response was incredibly tailored to those based in the United States. That was thoughtless and ignorant of me. 

I completely understand the appeal of having your school and life paid for if you can handle what comes along with it. **BUT, please promise me that if you start feeling hopeless and/or trapped with no way out that you will send me a DM**. I will do everything in my power to help you figure out an escape plan. There are ALWAYS options. 

Do you have friends or extended family you could potentially move in with? Even as a temporary option while you figure something else out?
