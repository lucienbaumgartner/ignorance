I'm with you, MCW.  At least I know how you feel where the 'family' is concerned.  We're trying to get together now, but there's always that elephant in the room that has to be ignored.  But some of them are so terrified and ignorant of the facts that it's difficult to know how to handle things.  My cousin, for instance, who was trying very hard to get us all together, could only get two tables of four in a pub.  I remarked that it was a very intelligent virus that could tell the difference between four people and six people sitting together.   She was extremely 'unsettled', let's say.....

At least my OH, who is not on the same page as I am, and is a jabx2, can at least laugh at the jokes.  The rest of the family (besides bro and SIL) are thralls.
