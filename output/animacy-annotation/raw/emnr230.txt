At this point in history, to make comments about willingness to vote for trump without any qualification of "what was I thinking?" or "I'm sorry" is a lost cause or an outright trump supporter trying to falsely play the middle and sew discord. You're trying to bring rational, empathetic thinking to a fight where the other guy is throwing his own shit and aiming at your mouth. 

I love a lot of Bernie and haven't backed a candidate for 2020 as it's entirely too early, but unapologetically FUCK people like this guy holding his vote hostage unless we can overlook the fact that he's still not fully decided where he stands on basic tenants of human decency.

It's time to pause the traditional liberal/conservative "across the aisle" debates - the lines of right and wrong are clearly established with 380 pages of evidence of you need beyond you've gut - there is zero gray area with trump. If you supported him, or didn't vote, and can now publicly own up to how dangerous and ignorant that position is/was, I'm EXCITED to have a discussion about your thoughts and concerns on the future, if not they're all yours to help build a magical glitter bridge between heaven and hell NewtonWasABigG.
