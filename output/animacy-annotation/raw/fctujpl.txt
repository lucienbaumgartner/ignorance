Lol, I know porn is bad and I'm aware of the effects. I'm a part of r/nofap. 
 
The "whole internet" isn't being censored by Google. That is a propaganda based claim used by extremists in order to make you feel unaware and scared. They then tell you "But there's truth here. I have the answers. I know what you're looking for and they can't provide it, but I can." The truth is, if you download any browser app on your phone that isn't Google, chrome, or sAfArI you can switch your search engine to something like duckduckgo or startpage and find everything unfiltered and not censored.
 
You can't get mad about what a company is choosing or not choosing to broadcast on their products. You also can't fall for the propaganda bullshit extremists are pushing so heavily now. The internet has made a vast majority of people gullible, and it's frightening. You keep your eyes open too, stay safe.
