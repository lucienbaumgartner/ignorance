As a woman: it depends on what the meaning behind the compliment is. If there's nothing objectifying/ sexual behind it, I feel like everyone else: happy but pretending not to agree so that I appear to be humble and unaware of my looks (although, now that I'm older I am much more in line with my own insecurities. I don't feel irresistible anymore :-D). 

When getting compliments  on my looks from strangers it feels like I'm this thing that is being observed and graded. At the same time, women are raised to be agreeable which means a lot of us (less now I suppose) feel we have to smile and be grateful even though we don't like it.
