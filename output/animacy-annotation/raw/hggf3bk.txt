I think this auto-pilot thing might be an INTP default that makes a lot of us unaware and stuck. Seems like most XXTP types are. For the last decade, I was very extroverted &amp; fucked up my life a lot &amp; didn't know my life has been running on auto-pilot until this year, I finally snapped and woke up from it. 

I am reaching my 30s &amp; went through a lot of trauma from others that it caused me to be an extreme introvert that it caused me to stop &amp; look back and self-reflect and so I taught myself self awareness &amp; self love.

If I compared myself to who I was last year, I definitely changed because I learned from my traumas and I am really proud of who I am today compared to the hot mess I was last year, because I had no self respect or self love growing up.

I  feel I didn't change much externally, but I think it is normal for INTP's to be in their heads a lot. I think mental wealth is important though so maybe you should work on that. I am now a person who doesn't really care about the outsiders because I am aware that I am different and of a rarer type. 

I just know that I am being true to myself and that I do not care about the society and social norms and other people's opinion and their validation of how I am like and how I am living my life, even if they are my own family and friends.

Reminder that a lot of people are not being true to themselves, because they cannot handle the truth and dislike being honest. Don't compare yourself to everyone else, they might just be the other common personality types unlike us.

The most important thing here is that as long as you are happy.
