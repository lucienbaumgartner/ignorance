Speaking as a pastor’s son who went through about 15 years of agnosticism, 3-4 years of atheism, and then came back to a much different Christianity, your thinly-veiled attempts at evangelism are wearing me out. You seem young and speaking outside your depth. With time, you’ll learn everything is more complex than you’re making it. I find it offensive to suggest you know “the will of God” concretely enough to suggest the way someone lives is or isn’t right. Christianity is a pretty large umbrella. It’s also within a fairly large umbrella of other faith traditions. To claim your singular interpretation of a faith tradition as correct is both ignorant and dangerous. Loosely translated, Jesus says something like, “let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” Consider your level of confidence may show you more the Pharisee foil in the story of Christ.
