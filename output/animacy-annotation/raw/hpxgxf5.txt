Well...if Karen is a self proclaimed "addict", then Bob over there next to her is a self proclaimed addict to burgers. 

But seriously, one look at these people and you can figure out EXACTLY what is going on in their heads. 

But now, the people who got off of heavy drugs using kratom and the people who use kratom to battle pain instead of drugs that can kill them will wake up with worry in their heart....meanwhile, Bob and Karen will wake up and congratulate themselves thinking they did something good in the world only because they have no sense of control over their lives and fear anything they don't understand and therefore impose their antiquated, ignorant and often racist beliefs on everybody else. 

Gross, is what they are.
