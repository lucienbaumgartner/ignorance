I think a lot of it stems from this major fear of being wrong. Like your average teen won’t care, but when they grow up and realize the label that they’ve been using for so long doesn’t fit, it’s massively uncomfortable to change it. They *know* the ignorant and hurtful comments and invasive questions that will come their way as a result of this change. 

But our culture (at least here in the US) is far too rigid about these kinds of things in the first place. If people had that grace and flexibility to try labels, then they’d be a lot less likely to pigeonhole themselves and feel stuck in the first place. 

I also think it comes from parents fearing that their kid won’t be “normal.” Like they comfort themselves by telling themselves that this is just a manifestation of teen rebellion, etc. so they hold onto hope that their kid will turn out “normal” in the end, and ultimately, their narrow worldview will be justified.
