It's called a provisional ballot. But experts actually call it a "placebo ballot." Because it gives you the satisfaction of having voted, without you ever knowing it was never counted.

Now, they just give you a provisional ballot to get you out of their hair. And you leave happy and unaware that you were just fucked in the ass by your own government.
