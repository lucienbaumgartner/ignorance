That's the issue, they do come to Scotland and say it, fairly often. America might be a melting pot, but Scotland isn't. If you grew up in Scotland or moved here and embraced the culture: you're Scottish. I and many others think that it's rude and ignorant of Americans (who only know American culture) to claim that they're Scottish, when in reality they know fuck all about being Scottish.
