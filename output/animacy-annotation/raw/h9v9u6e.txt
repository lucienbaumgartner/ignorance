When my boyfriend and I started dating he touched me in my sleep thinking I would enjoy it and we could begin having sex. I have been sexually assaulted as a child by a same-aged family member in my sleep so this triggered me and I got upset. Not only was I trying to rest, it made me feel disgusting. He was very apologetic and unaware of that trauma. Since then he has respected that boundary, as he should.
