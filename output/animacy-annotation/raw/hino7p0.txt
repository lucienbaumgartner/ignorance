I disagree with you. The way she spoke sounded like a great level of distance between them to me lol 

Chatted and "do you guys chat" are different. I've had neighbour's who made me uncomfortable and they may have qualified those interactions as chats whereas I would not, and they never had let's say... my number or any social media means of contacting me nor would I have responded in the event they somehow did. 

Also, where did it say she was invited in? Because I read that she had the opportunity to see his home, stepping inside is different too. "Yeah I can spare some margarine, just step in for a second I'll put some in a container for you" I literally had a kids dad start welcoming himself into our backyard and chilling with my family when I wasn't here, because I was dumb enough to agree to get his young son a drink and he followed me, he made us all extremely uncomfortable and I pulled the plug when he started grilling about where I'd been over the weekend. I'm sure he was harmless and unaware of how violating he was of boundaries and inappropriately comfortable with people he did not know. I now act cold, indifferent and refuse to speak at all when I've seen him at the park. There is no reason to know the schedule of a person who hasn't told you their schedule lol OP is at risk of developing obsession or coming across way too strong and scaring the dude way tf off, that's all I'm saying. She's fantasizing like he's her manic pixie dream Boi and he's literally just a gent who happens to live across her building.
