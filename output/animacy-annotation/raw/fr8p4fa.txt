No. A thousand times no.

I've talked about this on and off for *years*. Downvoting on Reddit is *often* used incorrectly, and that's a great and blatant example of that.

Fallacies should be *debated*. Downvoting merely discourages and inhibits those we *want* to come and debate to not do so. Which lowers the bar on content due to those that *come anyway* despite this (trolls, etc).

Downvote obvious intentional lying, insulting, egregious intentional evasiveness, etc, all you want. But downvoting mistakes in honest (though often unaware and uninformed due to lack of experience, exposure, and awareness) is silly and worse than useless.

But, I've said all this before. And it seems a very large percentage disagree with this.
