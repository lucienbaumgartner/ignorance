&gt;I feel like they made the idea of "maverick" so much more confusing. Is it a virus that makes reploids go crazy or is it just a term to define all those robots who oppose coexisting with humans a la Magneto's Brotherhood? Are the robots sick and unaware of their actions or are they merely agreeing with Sigma's schemes, making them a lot less sympathetic and likeable?

It's kind of both and this is something the series has present since almost forever, Vile was always a Maverick by his own will, or the Repliforce that was wrongly accused of being Mavericks despite not being infected, or Gate's Nightmare Investigators who were all killed off because false accusations.

The virus does still influence some of the bosses, X2 and X5's probably being the main examples, making them go violent and what not, but it's not always the main factor.
