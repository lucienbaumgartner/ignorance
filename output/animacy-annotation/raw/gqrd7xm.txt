When I did R.E. in school and it broke down the different types of christian views I wouldn't put down presbyterianism or rather my local church as it stands today as fundamentalist, that was more like evangelicals, I mean it's been a while but I'd associate a lot of fundamentalist views as being hardcore strict beliefs.

Maybe my local church is just built different but even when training as a leader to help with youth groups basically to give back the community, it was extremely lax, views weren't ever forced onto people.

Maybe I'm just young and ignorant of presbyterians background but even googling more info it does mention it's views have changed a lot and they're more modernised so in terms of the religion I still believe it's lax compared to what I studied at school of other different christian faiths, but in terms of running it, I don't know much to really comment on that.
