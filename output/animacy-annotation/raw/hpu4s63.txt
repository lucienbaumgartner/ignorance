Just remember a LOT of odds and ends get swept into larger domains, and that Norse Gods jump is all about creativity. And not getting shanked by Loki and his compressed sawdust knife. Have fun with it, and think about all the little details like 'why are horny/infatuated people so dumb and unaware?' and 'The Power of Love' being a common jumper power booster.
