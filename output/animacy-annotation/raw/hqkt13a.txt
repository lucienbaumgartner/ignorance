Cunts behind computer screens talking like thier better than others.  


Your comment is some weird judgement on the internet about people you don't know and might not even exist. When you say 'cunts' asre you actually talking about everybody that's taken MDMA and found it to be amazing? People like Sam Harris founded an entire career after this drug experience.  


I don't understand your comment at all. It makes me sad that people are so ignorant and judgemental.
