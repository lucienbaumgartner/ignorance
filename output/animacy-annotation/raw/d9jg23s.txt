Our upbringing? Are we not capable of realizing sexism is wrong on our own? Are we completely unaware and unable to think for ourselves? I feel like OP's post is something I'd read in the darkest depths of tumblr. A man talking over a women doesn't make him sexist, it makes him an asshole. Same go's for a women who interrupts/talks over another women, would that make her sexist? Fuck no.
