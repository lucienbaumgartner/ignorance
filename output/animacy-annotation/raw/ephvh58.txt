"We can be friends, so long as you get therapy for your obvious mental illness."

Wow, what a guy. I'm amazed people like that even still exist. My only reproach here would be that you shouldn't have blanked him. A short, curt "I am not playing at this table any more because of your intolerant beliefs" would have been a much better approach.

I'm 35 now, and so many situations in the past would have been simpler and less stressful if I'd just spoken my mind and been done with it.

Otherwise, you are 100% in the right here. I wouldn't want to play with someone who gets the cold sweats at the mere thought of homosexuality (even though I'm straight, but that isn't the point), and suggests you seek help with a straight face. That's so unbelievably rude and ignorant that it beggars belief. He's the one who is in need of help.
