They are detained for failure to identify, failure to identify is only a crime if you are arrested. They are not the same. That is a good question to why they wasted time because that is exactly what they did, they wasted taxpayer money and everyone's time because they were incompetent, ignorant and incorrect. How many arrests do you think this tag team are making and crimes they are stopping? Lol. They're grasping at straws, same as you.
