lmao. Comparing a serious problem like depression (anxiety, etc.) with someone's inability to just deal with the fact a game isn't on EASY MODE and you have to actually WIN some matches to progress your infamy at Legend rank is actually more pathetic and ignorant that I can ever imagine.

You should be ashamed of yourself.
