Again, not Tejasvi's tweet. Tarek Fatah's remarks shared by Tejasvi. Either way, it is Tejasvi trying to raise awareness about this issue. Statistics unfortunately, do not attract as much attention as controversial statements.
You can do the research yourself and find out the statistics, which by the way, are extremely high. He tried to raise awareness and protect women's rights. That is not sexist AT ALL.

And you sound very frustrated. That must be why you called me "blind and ignorant". That is why I responded back to you saying that you must be rattled.
