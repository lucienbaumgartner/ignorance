Jesus, Reddit is such a cesspool because people like you talk like you have knowledge of the subject you are discussing and it's clear you have none at all.

What's worse is you can verify everything I've said with a 2 second Google search, but you're do lazy and narcissistic, and your drive to be right at all costs makes you say lazy and ignorant that you can't even do that.
