I was born in the late 80's and I've seen the whole advent of the internet as we know it today. A lot of "trolling" we would do as kids was generally harmless and done purely for humorous intent. Running a disinformation campaign designed to confuse and anger already ignorant and angry people for comedic purposes--that, I think is funny. As long as it's done with humorous intent and doesn't directly harm anyone or destroy their life I see no problem with it. It's basically the internet version of the prank calls we would do as a kid.

That Whitney Houston thing is hilarious btw.
