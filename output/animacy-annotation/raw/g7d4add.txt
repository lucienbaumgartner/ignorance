The song style of this show is the thing that I miss the most from the 2000s. I'm a M20 that grew up with Camp Rock, HSM, Hannah Montana, and all teen movies from this era that used this song genre (e.g. Freaky Friday, The princess diaries, etc). It's such a nostalgic feeling. JATP brought us back to a time we were simpler, happier and unaware of the evil around us. And for that, I'll be forever grateful.
