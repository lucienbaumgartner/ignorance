Thank you so much for posting this reply. You just described my inner thoughts better than I could have.

My biggest fear is this:

It’s the future. I’m old, say 80 years old or something. I had my dream career and hit every goal I wanted to. Due to this career, I am financially well off. I met my wife when I was younger and we’ve been together ever since. I have a big loving family, and have kids and grandkids who are all doing very well. I live in a nice house, I still keep up with some friends, I basically have everything I could ever want. 

What good is any of it if there’s still so much suffering in the world?

I’m 22 right now, and I live in the United States. I haven’t come from the place of highest privilege or anything, I guess I’m pretty middle class haha. I’ve always had a roof over my head, food on the table, a great relationship with my family, heck I even went to private school my whole life (something I didn’t appreciate or recognize the significance of until after I graduated high school). 

I can talk about semantics of life all day, about this and that, how life is complicated, whatever. It really boils down this: how can I go about life, pursuing the things I want out of life, when others don’t get that choice? How can I turn a blind eye to suffering and say, “Oh, that’s not my problem?” 

I can’t. 

When life gets real, I resonate with your last statement: “I would rather be miserable and care about others than be happy and unaware of the suffering around me.”
