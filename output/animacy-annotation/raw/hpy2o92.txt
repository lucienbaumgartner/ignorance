&gt;No, I know you're trying to say because I take steroids I must be dumb and ignorant and easily swayed. 

Banter aside for a moment, I legitimately had no idea you used steroids when I wrote that. I based it purely on seeing you put forward the laughable notion that Michelle Obama is transgender, as though her entire life hasn't been thoroughly scrutinized. 

So please, don't take it as a comment on your testosterone supplementation, take it as a comment on your supreme gullibility and willingness to believe ridiculous claims devoid of evidence purely due to how invested you are in tribalism. 


&gt;I think it's happening on this Joe Biden thing actually.

What does this mean? You don't think Biden is secretly transgender? 

I'm not quite sure how to reply to that.
