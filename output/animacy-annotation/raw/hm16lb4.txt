honestly hate having dreads rn because i don't want someone to think i'm being racist and unaware of the historical context they have but i don't want to lose all of my hair just cutting them off and i still don't have a de-dreader comb so i'm just waiting for the day someone says "but actually" like my hair didn't do this on its own
