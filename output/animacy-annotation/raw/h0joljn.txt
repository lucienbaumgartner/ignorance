She's literally a mentally ill narcissist, raised in wealthy privilege. Some raised like that will develop into mature independent adults, others like Eugenia remain entitled and ignorant of the world. Combine that with a narcissistic personality which thrives on attention, doesn't understand or care how their behaviour affects others, and which never admits mistakes or accepts blame, and you have present day Eugenia Cooney.

People like that are some of the least deserving of emotional investment, because it's never appreciated or reciprocated.
