I don't think you realize that the terminology that you're using is pretty messed up.

What does local population mean? If an Indian or Pakistani settles abroad they're no longer nationals or citizens of your country. So maybe stop clinging to them? They're a part of the local population as much anyone there.

It's problematic that your definition of a Spaniard is a white European origin person only. It's both incorrect and ignorant of the diversity of that country.
