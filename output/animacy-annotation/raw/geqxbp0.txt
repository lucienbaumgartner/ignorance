Sorry about the delay, it's been a busy week for me.  I will admit that cutting out crossovers really reduces the list of fics I have on hand (I read a lot of crossovers) but I've still got a few you might like:

[Order 66-S](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11387023/1/Order-66-S):  This fic presumes that upon studying the long list of emergency orders they needed to memorize, several clones would conclude that in the case that the Jedi turned traitor, there is no way *their* Jedi would have betrayed the Republic.  So, when Order 66 fires off a detachment of the 501st breaks off to make sure that Anakin and Padme get away safely (AU where Anakin did not fall to the Dark Side but everything else went as canon).

[Sibling Revelry](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858012/1/Sibling-Revelry):  Mid OT, Vader figures out that Leia is his daughter.  The problem is that Luke is unaware and Imperial intel suggests that the two have started dating.  In a panic Vader does his best to get them to break up.  Meanwhile, a Luke and Leia who are just friends get very confused at the dude on base who is trying to break them up, so they pretend to take their relationship to the next level just to troll him.  The rest of the Rebel high command gets in on it as a joke while note realizing that they are actually running one of the most effective counter-intelligence campaigns ever.

[The Sith Who Brought Life Day](https://archiveofourown.org/works/377554/chapters/616150): A canon-compliant story of the Imperial Intelligence officer who managed to attach a name to the man who destroyed the Death Star and him presenting his findings to Darth Vader.
