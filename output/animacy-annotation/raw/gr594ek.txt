I am no longer a prostitute, I was a prostitute because my full time job was not enough to keep me from being homeless. Youâ€™re coming at this very judgmentally and inappropriately. And in fact, I am a very strongly spiritual person. My entire life has been guided by spirituality, even at my lowest point where I could afford to eat once a week. Your views on other people are what makes you unattractive. Not everyone has to follow your beliefs to be worthy of love. 

Also, you know nothing about me. I am an engineer now with a good paying job, a loving family, and zero ties to my past. You, however, have shown that you are intolerant and ignorant of any experience other than your own. I wish you luck in bettering yourself.
