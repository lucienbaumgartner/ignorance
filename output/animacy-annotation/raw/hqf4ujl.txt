Yes, I know it is. My point is the child isn't being stupid, and even if he/she was, assault isn't an appropriate reaction. The child appeared to be stationary and unaware of what was happening, and the clowns only voiced an issue literally a second before trampling the child, this is disgusting.

I'm not even going to get into your comment about other people not having a problem. Nobody should be assaulted, especially not someone who isn't doing harm. I'm not going to excuse violence as readily as you seem to be willing to.
