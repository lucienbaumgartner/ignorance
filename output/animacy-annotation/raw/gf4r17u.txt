My portfolio is 92% Eth and 8% Nano. Not a whale, maybe a slightly larger goldfish, but just bought a new position of 30,000 nano as nano tests support at 96-98 cents. A few people I know have recently done the same, totally uncoordinated and unaware of each others actions till after the fact. Alt season and nano lift off might be just around the corner, if enough people are independently thinking the same thing. In addition I'm getting a lot of messages in my friend circles asking me about nano in particular, whati think of it, from people who previously only knew about BTC, Eth, and Xrp. Not sure how they're finding out to be honest but I think nano is going to be one of the ones to watch in the next bull run despite the hate it gets in r/cc and r/ethfinance.
