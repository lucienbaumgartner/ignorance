Isnt Ireland part of the Uk? Well Northern Ireland at least and I been doing some paperwork and you are actually very right bout that I guess I letted the whole American ego get to me I mean People here in the US we get told that nobody does it bigger and better than us and that anything and anywhere we want to go is possible now that’s such a ignorant and arrogant and stupid of me to believe that it was very easy to travel to the UK although since it’s one of my dreams I’ll keep trying tho and if Uk doesn’t end up working than it’ll be Germany or France
