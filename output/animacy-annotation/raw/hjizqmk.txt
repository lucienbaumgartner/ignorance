Honestly irl I wouldn't have tried to befriend Talbott as I would acknowledge his boundaries 

I love my MC but I was annoyed that she didn't understand that "no means no" this applies to friendships as well as romance

My MC was only thirteen during the TLSQ so I dont think she was disrespectful she was unaware and desperate to please
