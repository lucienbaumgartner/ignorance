My baby Is 2 months old. His dad pushed me, threatened me, and used me before I knew I was pregnant. as well as he has very terrible mental health issues that I didn't know were so bad till recently. He quite literally wears foil in his hat, that's not a joke. And he's been harassing his other baby mother's. I found out disgusting and horrific things about him. As soon as I saw my baby all that resentment faded into love for one being, disinterest in new love, and a schedule too tight to fit much more than some me time. I told my baby father, before I knew how bad he was, that if he admitted that what he'd done to me was wrong I'd let him be part of our kids life. He completely denied his actions and even refused to say the words themselves. So, I dropped him. Eventually he got mad and blocked me and I stayed as far from him as I could, till thankfully he moved to bother and harass his other Bms. He should be in jail. Sometimes bitter, single, childless, people will have rude comments to say about how I ruined my life with a kid, but if they were so happy with themselves they wouldn't be so focused on being bothered by my little mans existence. Sometimes I think about my baby's father, wishing I could give him a good slap. But.. I know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with being a single mother. But there is something wrong with there being so many men who are unreliable and unaware of how important what they created actually is. They don't understand the actual pain of pregnancy cause I guarantee if their little brains could comprehend it, creating life, they wouldn't be such aholes. (not to generalize all men) the only people who are gonna say single moms are wrong, are people who blindly follow society and all the confusing, unnecessary, harmful, and judgemental rules. Life was created to be random. Not to be perfect. That's why we can't always let ourselves be sad when things aren't "picture perfect" cause that's not what was always meant to happen.
