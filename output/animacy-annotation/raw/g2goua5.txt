*cough*

the 'dreams' are basically movies. kinda realistic, believability is important for outlandish stuff like flying to work, etc, and they're used to impart ideas to the ~~dreamer~~ viewer. 

That's why Leo is like a Christopher Nolan insert. They're a film crew, making something for Cillian Murphy to believe. What Christopher Nolan does to us, is question whether him making the film is making a dreamspace, and whether he himself is in a dreamspace like Cobb is, but unaware and totally happy accepting the absurdity of his life as 'real', even if there's no totem to prove it. 

real, not real, you can't say because memory is created in your head and the tests are only as valid as what we detect the results with -- our consciousness.
