Lol sure, although it does depend on what kind of racism….. I’m sure as hell not gonna date guy who punches old man in subway or guy yelling and assaulting at political rally..

If it’s like slightly racist and ignorant of cultures and doesn’t really know about stereotypes and slurs, then yeah it’s fine
