I was a kindergartner in uptown Manhattan. I remember going to school like any other day and then my parents picking me up halfway through and being absolutely thrilled. I also remember the somber atmosphere around anyone older but being blissfully unaware and ignorant of the severity of what happened. Pretty spooky.
