There was an interesting article in one of the of the CofD books that described, that being able to ignore the supernatural is actually a survival mechanic and an evolutionary advantage in that world, since being happy and unaware of the possibility that any time something terrible can ruin your live keeps people out of trouble and makes them procreate and prosper more and better.

Therefore the live in the CofD for most mortals is basically identical to our world. It would be different, but it wouldnâ€™t feel differently.

The WoD is a bit different, because the entire world is described as a bit more corrupt and dire, not just in regard of the supernaturals. That means it would feel normal to a mortal, but your WoD twin would probably a bit more depressed and despaired then you are (no matter how you yourself feel on that scale) and therefore easier to manipulate or drawn to rebellion against the suppressors, who ever that might be.
