Referring to the organ donor aspect of this thread.  My wife has had three renal grafts (kidney transplants). She’s on dialysis and can’t have another graft.  Her first donor was her mother. Her second kidney came from me.  As a living donor it’s my considered opinion that anyone who won’t be a post death donor is a selfish and ignorant of the way organs are truly distributed. If I can be a donor when I’m alive you can do it when your dead. It won’t hurt, I promise.
