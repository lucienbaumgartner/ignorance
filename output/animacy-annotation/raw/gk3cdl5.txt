And I already said that your BRZ has low hp and acceleration numbers for a sports car and clearly other people care about that more than you. 

What do you want me to say? Do you want me to tell you your BRZ is fast and they're wrong, or that you're just a superior driver for feeling brave at 240 in a BRZ? Because I've done that in a rental car and I dont think that means shit. Just shows how reckless and unaware of real danger you are.

Since you care what other people say and seem to think you're such a great driver, why not take your BRZ to a track day or rallyx and see what you can do. I got nothing else for you mate.
