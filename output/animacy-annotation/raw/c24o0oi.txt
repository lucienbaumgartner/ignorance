There is a bit of debate about that in the rabbit-owning community. A lot of people are starting to believe that it's a playing dead out of fear response.

There's not really a lot of solid evidence so far as I know, though. But IMO it makes more sense than laying a rabbit on it's back being an orgasmic experience for the bunny. Anecdotally, I've known rabbits who display irritated or upset behavior after a trance, and rabbits who seem totally normal and unaware that it happened.
