&gt; If I cared to read the post that I told you many posts back I had no interest in? I merely glanced at it and spotted drivel like 'Corbynista' which only justified my stance in not reading it in its entirety in the first place. I also told you I have no interest in what you have to say.

So basically you're saying you made it up. Also Corbynista merely means supporter of Corbyn.

You should take some interest - you're clearly very uninformed and ignorant of the facts.
