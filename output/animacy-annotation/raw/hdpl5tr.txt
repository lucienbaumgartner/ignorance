I appreciate the fact that this late in my life im still able to encounter people who challenge my perception of what it means to be completely helpless and unaware of their ego. 

I genuinely hope you are able to challenge yourself in order to understand the multiplayer experience this game offers. Complacency leads to mediocrity which leads to anxiety. If you can't challenge your understanding of a video game, you will struggle to grow in more important aspects of your adult life.
