I disagree.

Rasta isn't about just smoking cannabis, it's absolutely a lifestyle and belief system.

A 2 year old holding a branch of a completely harmless, especially in the THC-A form it is shown here.

You are taken back by this because of fear mongering and prohibition. This photo isn't even equal to a child being around open alcohol containers which we see all the time at birthdays.

Your outlook on his parents and events here seem absolutely shortsighted and ignorant.



That said, I truly wish you all the best. Have fun, stay safe.
