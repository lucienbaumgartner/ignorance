Ultra woke and young (like 18-25) will say it’s not their job to educate you. 

My law school was super woke and it was 24/7 eggshell walking. As an example, during a class said they were “colorblind and don’t see race” and it was a collective pants shitting. I wasn’t even in the class and I heard all about how ignorant and horrible this student was. It’s a dumb though it was well meaning take, but everyone acted like she said the N word in the public defenders clinic. The school recently made the New York Post for Israeli/Palestinian drama. I’ve got loads of stories that I’d be happy to share lmao.
