Nope, it just presents you with a different set of problems and worries...

I'm not sure, Happiness isn't a sustainable mindset, anyone I've met that is really happy is usually very naive and unaware of their existence/ place in the universe. 

I saw a mentally challenged child eating ice cream the other week, and he was so happy, so living in that very moment, made me quite jealous. 

I would be eating it thinking, wow this is 356 calories, I better adjust the rest of my intake for the day, I wonder where the wooden stick is sourced from? wow the plastic wrapper is unrecyclable who does that these days........?

And that's it, the ice cream is ruined and I'm just getting fat!
