&gt; This is a tragedy, but for anyone who's criticising the kids - fair call, it was stupid, but no one will win from tut-tutting, because so many of us have been there, in the middle of a situation where we almost died, and survived, thinking nothing of it because we were young and unaware of the risks.

I wouldn't called it tut-tutting. It's more a howl of anguish when you can clearly see the risks, and know they are very real and present, but in NZ culture it's just "Boy's being Boys".

Fuck no. Its not just Boy's being Boys. This idiot burn out, codies bourbon and cola, fast &amp; furious boy racer culture needs to die out fast before more tragedies like this happen.
