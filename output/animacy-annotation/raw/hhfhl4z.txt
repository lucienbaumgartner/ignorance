&gt;	I'm a terrible person for knowing I'm fit and strong and am more likely to be in a work related accident than have any reaction to a cold?

You’re a terrible person for ignoring the mountains of science and high quality reporting on the fact that COVID-19 is not a cold or a flu. It is a novel pathogen, and even though you’re unlikely to die, you will pass it on to many others and eventually some will.

You’re selfish.

&gt;	Maybe lesser people than I might need the vaccine 

Once again, selfish and ignorant of what the vaccine actually does.

&gt;	Don’t lump me in with fat losers and their winz provided mobility scooters

Lol, ding ding, we have a winner!

&gt;	Protect the vulnerable but the rest of us should be able to continue our lives.

The vaccine is to protect the vulnerable. That’s the only viable protection. However, it will also protect you, and just because you had a moderate course of the flu doesn’t mean you won’t get extremely sick from COVID.
