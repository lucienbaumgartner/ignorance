Not at all. Spirituality has been directly identified with religious contexts for the entirety of human history, and has only in the last several years, started to become disassociated, because people want to try to secularize it so as to keep the term around while making it seem harmless. 

Spirituality still implies the requirement of purpose in life, as you explicitly stated, which implies the requirement of structure and order to our universe. The association of an ordered universe with positive mental health still shows a clear religious identification, that I don't think is necessary for well-being for every person. It certainly isn't necessary for me. My interpretation of the universe is chaotic, unsure and unaware, and I in it, am unsure and unaware, but I try to make the best decisions I can. 

It would be disingenuous for me to try to find some purpose in life that justifies everything that I do, if I don't believe there is some underlying purpose, and would likely be a detriment to my mental health, instead of bolstering it. I'm not going to look for false purpose, or advocate to others that this is a critical component for them. If they find purpose on their own, that's great, and it will likely help them, but it's not essential, and it doesn't even have to be defined in a spiritual context as you insist.
