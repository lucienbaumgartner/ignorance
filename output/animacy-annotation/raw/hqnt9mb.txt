Literally the shit written on the board is ignorant hateful garbage.

Lmao wtf? “Let’s go Brandon” ain’t hateful? Posting pictures of “deformed people” and claiming they are vaccine babies ain’t hateful and ignorant? “Mask in your car hurr durr” meme? “Vaccine missinfo but mail in ballots” wink guy? ”let me put on sunscreen so you don’t get sunburnt”. “My body my choice, checkmate libtards” ain’t hateful. Fauci said mask don’t work but then . . .

If all the hate coming from the people being nominated doesn’t affect you as much as the post your responding to, you need take a fucking hard look in the mirror before you judge other people as being ignorant and hateful. The amount of times I heard  “Don’t you feel stupid wearing masks  that don’t work?” At work is fucking depressing. 

It’s been a fucking year and “research ignored by doctors” keeps peddling parasite and malaria medicine? 

No experimental vaccine but experimental antibodies are okay along with off label drug use? 🧐 (I should make an old guy meme)

Where is your ignorance line drawn?

There was a parable inN church growing up that I heard a few times about a drowning man. He refuses help and dies multiple times, asks god why he didn’t help him, god responds with I did multiple times.

Help is here in multiple forms, people are willfully ignoring it
