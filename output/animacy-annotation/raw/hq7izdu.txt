No. I was bringing to your attention the fact that the Taliban were largely mobilized,funded,and generally assisted by the CIA. Which is important to consider during this discussion. It supports my point that western countries are complicit in the instability that they wield to seize cultural artifacts. I never once said that the strain of Islam practiced by the Taliban is peaceful,that if it weren’t for the US it would be sunshine and rainbows. You extrapolated that from a few sentences because you were caught unprepared and unaware that your prime example did not support your point and instead supported mine. I blamed the Taliban for what the Taliban did. But it’s downright ahistorical to omit the role the US played in their organization,funding, and training. I can’t explain this to you anymore plainly.
