She's so fat and ignorant shes gonna prioritize acceptance over her health. I mean c'mon this fat shit is not even gonna life past her fucking 20s. Can't imagine in what kind of childhood you learn these gross and idiotic lifestyles that leads up to you becoming this fat, this ignorant and this stupid. 
This has everything to do with how parents influence their children. Parents aren't educated about nutrition and health, then they learn their children the way they care for themselves. Fast forward to now, it turned in to this whole fucking movement that believes that everything has to be accepted. Even being so fucking fat and ignorant that you not having a boyfriend is because they are fat phobic and not because you are as fat us a small whale. 
Lemme close with this wise ass piece of science 
'if you're overweight, you eat to much. And if you are underweight, you eat too Little'. It's not genetic, it's not because the energy in the air, it's not because you have toxins in your body, it's not because you don't work out, it's not because you eat your emotions, it's not because you are young and growing fast, it's not because your father was the same at your age. 
Make the change, you won't be there tomorrow but you can make a change tomorrow
