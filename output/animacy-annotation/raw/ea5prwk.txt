You say that as if it was maliciously intended by her church leaders. I wouldn't assume that. It *may* be, but IMO it's more likely that they just genuinely believe in whatever they're teaching and that they're trying to protect their flock. However misdirected and ignorant that is, we gain nothing by pointing them out as evil people. If anything that'll just create an even larger us vs them divide and make any communication with people trapped there harder.

Of course there are churches who are actually led by pure evil greedy assholes too. I don't believe that most of them are though.
