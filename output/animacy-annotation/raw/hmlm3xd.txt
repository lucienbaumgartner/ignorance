Racism doesn’t have to be explicit or even intentional. Subconscious or unconscious racism is a thing you know, in this case based on preconceived notion and prejudices that somehow Chinese companies have to be somehow less legit than US or European counterparts.

Let me be more specific.

For example, saying CAAC holding EH shares because the stock price was going up (which of course is patently false) shows clear bias: would he suggest FAA is holding Joby shares when JOBY stock goes up? Or EASA is holding Lilium shares when LILM is up?

Another example, if you read the whole tweet thread, the same reporter in a different tweet suggests that somehow the fact that CAAC working closely with EH “seem inappropriate in the context of EASA or FAA”. This is particularly ironic, unaware and Western elitist considering the FAA and Boeing 737 MAX debacle. Put that aside, to publicly insinuate there is inappropriateness, based on no specific information, except for established prejudices that “somehow if Chinese companies and agencies are doing well or working closely, there must be something nefarious” is racist.

Want more? Sure.

The same reporter considers EHANG’s flight in Indonesia with government backing is not “hard facts” and is “publicity stunt” and choose not to report; but Volocopter flight in Korea with government support, somehow is so vastly different that the same outlet would write multiple articles about?
