Exactly. This is why the atlatl was so common and successful in the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia, while there is zero evidence of its existence in Africa.

The atlatl is an incredibly effective weapon, but it is only useful when the hunter is able to get close enough. African animals had an innate fear of humans, so they would flee before the humans could get close enough.

Animals that were naive and unaware of how dangerous humans are would be less likely to run away when approached.
