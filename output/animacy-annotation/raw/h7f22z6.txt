who, specifically, did the lakers "pass" on that year? nobody is ever able to answer that

that was the narrative on r/nba, yes

in actual reality though, the only free agent name even remotely linked to LAL that offseason was, like, Seth Curry I guess? and even he ran straight for a Dallas reunion without a shred of consideration for or discussion with any other team

but yeah, the popular narrative here is "haha kawhi punked the lakers lmao lakers bad" when in reality the lakers neither gained nor lost a single tangible asset from the whole weird saga

and *not only was that narrative nonsensical and ignorant of the reality of free agents at the time*, but **the lakers ended up winning the title**, so it's even more hilariously confusing when people act like kawhi somehow "fleeced" the lakers

kawhi fleeced the lakers right into an NBA title i guess lol
