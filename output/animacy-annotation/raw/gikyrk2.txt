If we are to preserve the beauty and integrity of this country, we must be willing to challenge the politicians and laws that stress our civil liberties.

You seem to have a very narrow view of the world, that it doesn't matter what politicians do and what happens outside of the scope of your own reality.

It absolutely is a calmer way of living - "if my stomach is full, why should I care what happens to other people?" but it is this way of thinking that led many Germans in the Nazi's rise to power to be ignorant and unaware of the true horror that were to come. But ofcourse, judging by your belief that white people are better because of their civility or subserviantness, I wouldn't be shocked if you would have fit right in inside 1939's Germany.
