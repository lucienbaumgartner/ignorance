I will say, just getting up and doing those things are going to help your self confidence! I didn't do my own laundry until I moved out at 20 because nmom refused to let us touch the washing machine. We were so sheltered and ignorant that we just let her do it, because she would get angry otherwise. 

These days (31f), I'm still learning which cleaning products you use, how to use a dishwasher, how to check tire pressure, etc. Things that she should have taught me, but made me feel too stupid to try. I am grateful for every chore and every learning experience because for once they are mine. Even if I fuck up, I ruin a good sweater in the washer, or I melt a plastic container in the dishwasher, who is there to scold me? It doesn't matter because I give myself enough grace to make mistakes and not tear myself up over it. 

I hope one day you reach this level, because it is such a beautiful freeing feeling. And I hope this helps in some way! Good luck!!
