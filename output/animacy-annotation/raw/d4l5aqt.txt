I don't mind " Plot Armor." it just means my favorite characters stay alive

I think the main complaint of Arya getting stabbed was that she was very off character. Very aloof and unaware that there would be consequences for betraying a assassins guild. This is why theorys of Arya actually being Sexy jesus with a mask or that Arya was waif and waif was arya was being thrown around, because it seemed like lazy or bad writing that bad ass Arya that's been training for 1.5 seasons just got snuck up on and stabbed like a some common street urchin.
