I don't ask much about my friends, when I was younger I never greeted them when i entered the class, if at some point I feel like saying something j got straight and strike a conversation but I guess that bothered them, I don't like going out so I'd refuse most of the time so maybe they thought I just don't want to hang out with them, they got closer to each other but I couldn't get closer to them.

I'm very careless and unaware of my surroundings, I can't really tell what a person is saying or thinking unless they say it directly to me, problems happened between my friends but I never felt directly involved, when we started drifting away I never cared enough to approach them and maintain a relationship, and I guess they wanted it me to be the one to approach so they didn't approach me first either.

I have a certain image if myself, but that image could be very distorted, maybe I was rude and pretentious without realising it, recently I've been remembering things I did in the past and feeling shocked, I wonder how I really was.

I've chnsged through time, but I think many people might find me dull or boring, I don't have any deep interest in anything, there's not much I can talk about with others except for studying, and if I end up talking about something else I feel like I'm only talking about myself and centering the conversation around me which makes me uncomfortable. I feel like I don't listen to people as much as I should, I can't bring myself to be interested in them enough to ask questions and learn more about them, it's not thya I feel bored or uninterested when they talk about themselves, but I don't know how to open a conversation or steer it towards them. I think it's easier for me to get a long with someone who says things whenever they feel like it without the need for me to ask or open a conversation, I don't know if you get me.
