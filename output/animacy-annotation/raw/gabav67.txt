I just move because its the logical thing to do and not worth it not to move. I can take a sideways step or I can try to be a hardass because "I don't want to be pushed around" and start an awkward scene or confrontation. Seems like a waste of energy. Too many assholes to try and police everyone. You'd never get anywhere doing that. Accept that people are like that just like a dog on the sidewalk barks at you as you walk by. Don't stop to fight every barking dog.

But of course I always wonder why so often it doesn't seem to be a reciprocal thing where BOTH parties move. It seems like so many people lack common etiquette, logic, manners, etc. 

I've never thought as it as racism. People of all colors have done this to me, even Asians and even females. They're likely just rude and inconsiderate, or at best totally aloof and unaware of what they're doing.
