Question is... Why? Laptops are prebuilts thats litteraly portable. 2 scenarios. A the people behind it decided to shove the best settings for the specs to run optimally for better ratings and price per laptop is fair. Or they are lazy and ignorant and they dont even try to get it optimally installed. And only on the second option whould result in you having a damn reason to try to overclock it.
