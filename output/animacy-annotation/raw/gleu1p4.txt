"Biological woman" is reductive, offensive, and tbh as someone w a degree in biology it's a meaningless phrase. 

"Biological sex" is complicated and diverse. Variation outside of the standard 2 options is normal and somewhat common. Furthermore, medical transition literally changes one's sex characteristics / their biology. Referring to cis women as "biological women" erases and generalizes. And it's transphobic in that it implies that cis women are the default and trans women are just approximations (as well as transhobic in other ways). 

Anyone who's offended by the word cis is just being petty and ignorant of biolgogy, linguistics, and social science.
