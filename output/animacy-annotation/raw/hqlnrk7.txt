First clip it seems you're painfully unaware and quite slow to loot unstashed items

Second clip you are in the middle of nowhere, run into a fence, and then decide you want to fight (with an incredibly low ergo weapon)

Third clip I literally watch you see someone in the left portion of your screen (hurr durr where the 2-3 other spawns are, might want to keep an eye on that) and keep running to get shot in the side of the head.

Fourth clip, I assume this right out of spawn. You are engaging another player coming from a spawn while standing in the middle of a road with your side turned towards another spawn at the traintracks. What do you expect? You said you have 900 hours?..
