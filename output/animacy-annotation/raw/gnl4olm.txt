Hi everyone! Thank god for this forum 🙏🏼 I also am in need of opinions on my SA profile. I’ve been in 1 arrangement in the past but turns out, it wasn’t much of a SR after all. I was new and unaware and technically I still am! I almost want to make another profile on SA so I can see what the other girls are doing with their profiles. Send help 😅

I’m also new to Reddit so please forgive me if I’m doing this all wrong 🤦🏼‍♀️
