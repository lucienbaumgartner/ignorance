My grandfather smoked his whole his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, “If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you need to stop immediately.” He teared up when he realized what was at stake. He quit cold-turkey that very day. Three years later he died of lung cancer. We were very closed and his death destroyed me. My mother said to me, “please never smoke. Dont put your family through what your grandfather put us through.” I agreed. At 24, I never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your comments are so fukn immature and ignorant that it gave me cancer anyways.
