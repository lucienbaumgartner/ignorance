I can relate to that.  My nmom is so broken and unaware that it's sad.  I pity her.  She will never have the emotional intelligence to grasp the vast, rich, beautiful world that exists, directly above all of her capabilities as a human.  It would be impossible to describe to her.   Like trying to describe life on Mars to a dog.  

Anyways, yes, it's all very sad.  But she gets no love from me anymore.  I am, and always was, a good son.  I landed in the lap of a bad mom.  A very bad, unfit mother.  I have so many blessings and things to be grateful for.  But she did me wrong.  Everyday of my life, because she never loved me and never will.  

So take pity like you would on an ant that will never know the joy of laughter.  Then move on.   I think we have felt bad at their hands long enough.
