&gt;I mean im literally not. I couldnt care less about you or your opinion

As evidenced by your fevered rate of responses.

&gt;because you couldnt lift 150lbs? Or because you think people cant?

Oh, I squat plenty more than 150 lbs., but I'm not so deluded and ignorant that I don't recognize that some people, who theoretically according to their weight/height should be able to, can't.

You resorted to ad hominem attacks pretty early, so I'll fire one back in response for good measure: you should keep using "your" in incorrect places, it lets people know exactly the mental midget that you are.

You have a great day too, lil guy.
