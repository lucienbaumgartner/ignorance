You're vastly misinterpreting the role agents play in the matrix. They're not there to kill the One or even stop Zion from exploring the matrix. There purpose is to simply keep the majority of humans happy and ignorant of the outside world. A program going haywire and crashing things gets removed by the agents. A human going Kung Fu on a truck doing 120 down the Los Angeles freeway gets chased away from prying eyes. They maintain the integrity of the matrix by limiting how much damage a human or defective program can cause. 10 witnesses to a random event can be silenced by government agents. 100 witnesses to an event can be fixed with a déjà vu reset. 1000 witnesses to an event can crash the local matrix as they all start wondering why people are dodging bullets or driving on the sides of buildings. Agents don't need developer tools to fix problems and work within the rules of the matrix just like everyone else. Adding in a line of code that lets them become invincible means Zion can steal and copy that code making their operatives invincible as well.
