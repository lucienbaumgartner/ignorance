An employer or management that brings politics in to work is never an environment you want to be around.  Find a tribe and enjoy going to work so
You can build meaningful relations/mentors.
Or raise the volume and drown it out until you find a better place to work.

The business is changing, but your boss/chefs should always have respect for you and make you part of the team.

Regardless if anyone believes in the disease it most definitely effected business/sales and derailed the entire industry…and if anyone denies that they’re ignorant and foolish.
