This is the typical response I get from people.

It's not closed minded to refute a position you have researched and refuted before UNLESS new information has been introduced or the facts have changed.

It's not closed minded if you already know the issue and the facts surrounding it.

All the fact checkers have terrible records of honesty, and because they are not news sites they never retract the false info.

Read Drudge. Listen to Mark Levin. Ignore the msm. Read the uncensored news sub and the conservative sub.

Life is hard and requires hard work. There is no easy button. You have to develop your own ability to find the truth in a sea of misinformation brought to you by the Democrat controlled media.

It's intentional, the effort to dumb down society, make them unaware and compliant.

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

Oh and let me make this clear: Wikileaks has a perfect accuracy record, no corrections or retractions even after several court cases challenging their veracity. It's an internet age phenomenon, no traditional news outlet has a record of 100% accuracy.

So there's another thing to look at, how many retractions has a source made? Fact checkers never retract anything even when proven false, in part because they know many of the poorly will read and believe it.
