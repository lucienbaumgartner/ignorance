Americans generally appear to be selfish, arrogant and unaware of anyone or anything other than them.  


This crosses over to everything they do. Mask wearing.. Driving.. Healthcare.. Work..  
They are fundamentally, socially broken to such a degree that they don't even know they ARE broken and as such, it isn't really even selfishness. It's abusive leftovers, and they're playing catch up to the world stage.  
Even those TRYING to be aware and PC in the US, live in clumsy loud instances of ironic double standards.  
Ranting about racism and mask wearing on facebook one moment, and dating on tinder and hanging out with their friends regardless the next..  


The disconnect is particularly painful. Some are catching up, but it is incredibly slow.
