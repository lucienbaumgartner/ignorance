1. How on EARTH does a woman liking other women have anything to do with virginity? If a woman wanted to be ‘virginal’ to appeal to men she would just… not have sex? She could just be abstinent so why on earth would she need to ‘become’ a lesbian? Not that any women actually care whether men want them to be a virgin since the men who want that are most likely controlling, insecure, misogynistic fucks (unless it’s for religious purposes but that’s another conversation). Lesbians don’t want to be with men ever and straight/bi women who want to be virgins to appeal to men (which I literally never hear of by the way) can just not have sex, so what the fuck does being a lesbian have to do with virginity? 

2. You talk a lot about how men like their women ‘free from dick and thoughts of other men’ and that ‘competition is unacceptable’. Sounds like you’re projecting here. You don’t speak for all men. Sounds to me like you’re very insecure. THAT’S why you don’t want women having sex with other men. Because you’re scared they’re better than you and that women won’t want you if they can have other men. Maybe bring this up in therapy? And if you wanna know the difference between them and you, the men that women WANT to sleep with don’t go around saying shit like this.

3. ‘Men hate women who are willing to have sex with them’ makes you sound rapey, ignorant and gross. You shouldn’t be having sex with a woman if she doesn’t want to have sex with you fucking DUH. Ever heard of consent?
