There is 100% a pattern of people viscerally reacting to something that is uncomfortable or distasteful to them. I listen to a lot of music that would drive most people insane. (Noise, grindcore punk, metal)

My dad hates Nirvana. He thinks it’s untalented pathetic drug addict rebellious teenager nihilism. He is ignorant and biased. 

So no, I don’t discount that as a factor. I am making a broad statement here and there obviously will be exceptions and not everything is racism. I’m saying I have witnessed a pattern myself in real life that mimics what people are describing in this sub that is absolutely influenced by racism and/or ignorance.
