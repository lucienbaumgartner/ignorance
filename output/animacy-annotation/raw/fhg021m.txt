You are making excuses again, now it is poor mental health as the reason people don't go to the gym.  Do you have any data to back that up?

The problem with that line of reasoning is you are blaming everything and everyone without actually looking for the root cause.  It is not my fault I don't have a good job, the system is rigged against me.  That is easier to stomach than....I don't have the skills or the resume to get the job I want, I am the problem and need to improve.  It is a perfect recipe to never achieve your goals or get anywhere.

And you look at lazy as an attack, that is a mistake.  We are all lazy and ignorant, that is fine but making excuses that you aren't doesn't leave any room to improve or better yourself.
