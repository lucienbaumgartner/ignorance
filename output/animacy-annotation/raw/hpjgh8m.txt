There’s two sides of me that react completely different to this sentiment. 
The first is the side that completely understands and genuinely agrees with what you’re saying. Those places should be your safe space. Somewhere you can hangout with like minded people. A place where you shouldn’t have that anxiety about making a move not knowing whether or not the person you’re hitting on is also gay or bi sexual. It makes total sense to not want that space invaded by people who are only visiting because of the “novelty” of going to a gay bar. 
The second side of me, the ignorant and less empathetic side, a side I’m actively trying to make smaller through dialogues like this. Doesn’t get it. Inclusion and equality are what we’re all aiming for. A world where sexuality is as important as our favourite colour. 
I know this second stance essentially ignores every single transgression and the years of oppression which I also know is wrong. My main question which was never asked for is. What is the end goal? I get that I’m most likely about to get downvoted to oblivion but I’m open minded and If discussion can remove the second side entirely I’m open to it
