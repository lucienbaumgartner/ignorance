YTA. Vasectomy would have prevented this from ever happening if this is how you've always felt. It seems shortsighted and ignorant that you at least haven't taken any preventative measures from ensuring this day never came. People change their minds all the time, women especially when it comes to children. 

My wife and I agreed to no kids 4 years ago before we married.  Shes got medical reasons and I've got personal ones. But at least once a year she'll go on a "do you ever think about having a baby?" Bender and I just ride it out - safe in the knowledge that the vasectomy is my shield.

You tho? You're stuck looking like a heartless prick to your wife who now feels super alone and you're asking the internet if you're a dickhead. Better get your shit together and make things right. Man up.
