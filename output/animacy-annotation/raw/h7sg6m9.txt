I hope, at the end of all of this, Hasan doesn't get too much blowback, for as much as he seems naive and ignorant of the nature of the industry, he seems like an OK guy, one who maybe got in way over his head with the talent and manpower that he had at his disposal. People like him are pretty common on the indie scene and a lot of them drift between unfinished product to unfinished product while talking like each game is going to be this amazing, next big thing.

For real, if this is nothing, the biggest loser in this whole debacle is Sony, its embarrassing that they would advertise a game that barely exists outside of a trailer with store bought assets, with such poor quality and allow it to grow into this big thing.

A lot of people have followed this whole drama and it speaks volumes of Sonys attitude and quality control towards independent games.

Part of me hopes it is a super secret Kojima game, but only because the alternative is that Sony don't give a rats ass about  how they look as long as their beating the competition , which is a bad sign going forward, Silent Hill will be getting dragged through even more mud by Boober Team and Hasan will basically be finished as a creator and will likely get a bit of harassment, which sucks.
