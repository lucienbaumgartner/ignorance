You underestimate how unaware and naive non-car people are. Some guy at my office got one several years back, complete POS. Knowing that me and my cubicle mate were car guys, people kept coming up to us all the time saying, did you see that car out in the parking lot? Itâ€™s like a Ferrari/lambo or something!
