I understand I have my issues with mask and I have opinions on that. But I wear a mask just to be safe and keep people safe as well I get that. I don't believe the mask is completely protect you but better then nothing. I put it on. If you don't u will not get serve hehe. So I put it on when I am out in public or shopping. If people really really think it's a hoax then make ur fucking coffee ur self. But when I go to buy it u respect the policy. Common sense. I don't know I think people need to treat each other with respect and understanding. It seems everybody is itching for a fight. Also ignorance is a lot in play. Proud and ignorant. That is what I hate. Instead we need to be humble and serving to each other. After all we share this earth we must be sensitive to other people needs. When you are sensitive to people need and humble you're self you become happy. Call it crazy but I get joy from serving people then thinking it's all about me.
