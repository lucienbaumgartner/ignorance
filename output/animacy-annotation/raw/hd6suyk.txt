&gt;If youre a gay person whos 100% convinced that hes straight, youre a person who decided to lie to yourself over facing the truth. 

I want a life like yours, ignorant and unaware of others problems.



Its not always necessary that one person should be at fault. The spouse is suffering but the closeted person is suffering too. Its no one's fault except the homophpbes running rampant in society making it harder and harder for people to come out of the closet. Getting rid of those is the solution to the problem- as they are the problem. No one else.
