Yeah I’m required to go to AA/NA meetings because of treatment in lieu and I could never take their shit seriously just because I’m atheist and they have such a focus on god or a “higher power”. It’s super annoying and ignorant that they chose to believe no one is able to get sober without fully believing in the religious bullshit
