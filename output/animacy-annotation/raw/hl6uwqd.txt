Bro you know what I mean. Every Dasher I know is driving a shitbox from the late 90s, driving all over the god damned place for like $10/h+ possible tips being exploited by a massive corporate entity who has no regard or ounce of compassion for the people allowing their business model to work. And so many of them are unaware and oblivious to it because of said exploitation. But you're right, perhaps I should've said one of, rather than literally.
