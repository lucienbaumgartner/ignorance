&gt; So now with the second event wish miHoYo is finally getting rid of one of the scummy tactics (Fear of missing out) 

You seem to have missed the entirety of the argument.

No one is complaining about a second banner. EVERYONE is complaining about the lack of a roadmap. 

Everyone has known Itto and Albedo would be on the upcoming banner for the better part of a month. Throwing a surprise Eula into the mix means A) many were caught unaware and unprepared - and won't be able to wish for Eula and B) Eula won't be showing again for another 6 months.

This does NOTHING to alleviate the fear of missing out. Keep in mind, there's been no clear policy on whether the second event wish banner will be regular - or will be one off at MHY's discretion. If anything - this exacerbates the initial complaint: "We have no roadmap - no idea what's coming up" - and increases everyone's fear: "I'm even MORE scared of missing out now."

&gt; *Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to 'Screw You Mihoyo!'*
