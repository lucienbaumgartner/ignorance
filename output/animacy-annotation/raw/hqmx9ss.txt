That’s a negative. Game is not worth the full price tag or even on sale for the matter. Doesn’t reflect any previous battlefield games, and show’s just of ignorant and disconnected dice and ea are from their fans. Even after the lack of info and the shit beta i thought fuck it and gave it a go and even got the gold edition thinking that hopefully some how the game would be remotely close to how bf use to be. Well all i can say was that was a mistake. Been a big battlefield fan since around bc2/bf3, and i can say this game is market more towards people who like the whole micro transactions skins bs and not people who have been long term fans. I would definitely hold out for a few more months to maybe a year. The more people who don’t play it or hold out, maybe it’ll push dice to fix and shape the game into a true battlefield game.
