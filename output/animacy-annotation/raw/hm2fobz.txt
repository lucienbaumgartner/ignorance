Your quite right , that's why I didn't mention the famine, the whole situation in that time was as immoral as it gets.I never knew anything about it until I saw an interview with Sinead O'Connor and her passionate discription of the time .
Having family history from the Cork area I read up on the period.I had no idea of the suffering and the total disregard for the people by the landowners.... not the finest moment in history.
Your point is totally justified in any condemnation of the British empire period.
The original post was about the French poster scoring points over Britain during the Indian famine..... to blame British empire for the monsoon rains not happening causing the crop failures is ridiculous.If the condemnation is justified there is nothing to say except perhaps sorry( even though I have had nothing to do with it personally). But people just make claims that are not right I try to put the positive benifits that have come out of that period we all take for granted now,( without a single notion of how we actually came to have them)
The drive for trade and materials for industry that brought us new invention and technology in its wake, also brought infrastructure and commercial projects that made money to build more infrastructure...... Some of the poorest countries had populations practically naked and ignorant of the outside world.
There was of course lots of people taken advantage of , but lots of people benifited .
The things that are essential for our way of life have been developed from the period of the industrial Revolution and the British empire having the drive and money made the inventions and the skill to produce these ideas possible.
I'm not condoning the empire days nor am I condemning them.
It was what it was good and bad.
