No one's taxes actually fuel the economy.

If you confiscated the entire wealth, not just portions of a year's earnings... And 50 (or how ever old Elon is) years worth of accumulated wealth and that of ever billionaire... You wouldn't even pay for 1 year's spending budget from Congress.

The economy is fueled by the government infusing newly minted currency into the economy on a yearly basis.

You can not tax the middle class into prosperity via the wealthy. Sorry... Just won't happen.

I am not saying don't tax the rich... I'm saying it doesn't do hardly anything.

And my main point was that anything they do to the rich they will eventually do to you. 

The thought process "it only impacts billionaires, who cares" is completely irrational and ignorant of our countries history. 

If an unrealized gains tax is established, YOU will pay it at some point in your lifetime. And so will every future generation.

We can't fix any societal issue with other people's money.
