This. If you want what it comes down to is I would argue that I don't consider it true life but that point is purely philosophical. 
As far as what it is at the end of the day? If you are a fact and science believer it doesn't matter, it isn't hurt and unaware and undeveloped in complexity so why does it matter?
The ONLY thing it comes down to is religious philosophy, that's it, anything else is just folly and a cover.
