I mean, the crux of your view is correct. People tend to demonize other people who disagree with them, or find them outside of their tribe. This is almost a "water is wet" statement. 

**BUT...**

Then you started saying things like "the media always pushes and affirms their opponent's views rather than their own" or "Both sides have their pros and cons and both sides are, in my view, as bad as each other." 

These things are measurable. And at the end of day, study after study, news network after news network...the right are FAR MORE guilty of this than the left in our society. 

Saying "both sides are the same" is lazy and ignorant of the situation as a whole. It just isn't true. And imagine how crazy it would be if it were the truth! Two political parties perfectly equal in their bullshit, how rare do you think that is? Two *political parties*, in all their diversity, all their different followers, all their major players, all their new networks than lean more one way or another, all the advertising, all their campaigning, **EVERYTHING** added up, and these two are equal? 

It's a pretty textbook Dunning-Kruger scenario to think you are above both parties thinking they are essentially the same.
