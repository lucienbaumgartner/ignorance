She's right. And I'm going to be kind but honest with you. You're a parent. You've been a parent for 10 years. You should know how to properly feed your children. You should know how to get your children bathed. You should know how to get your children in bed at a reasonable hour - on what I'm presuming was a school night, since it's a Tuesday. 

I have a feeling that you did this on purpose. *I really hope I'm wrong*, but it sounds like maybe you wanted to be the "fun parent" so you intentionally behaved like a clueless babysitter. Or maybe you wanted to prove to your wife that you shouldn't be trusted with the childcare, because you don't want to do it, so you feigned incompetence so that she won't leave you with that much work in the future. I hope I'm wrong, but the way you behaved was so tenaciously irresponsible and ignorant, that I think it was forced. Which I don't understand. Who wants their spouse to think they can't be trusted to properly tend their own children? You must be super confident that she'd never divorce you and sue for custody. Because, if she did, you've just given her a lot of ammunition.

Or maybe you aren't some mastermind. In which case, you were lazy. And your lack of basic parenting knowledge is really worrying. Unless you have literally never been home during the evening, never had dinner with your kids, never been present for bath time, never been present for bed time *in the last ten years* \- which I highly doubt - you should know more about your children's needs. Let this be a wake up call. Do better with your kiddos. They deserve better from you and so does your wife. YTA.
