Kalik. That’s the beer you’re thinking of. Pronounced “click”. I worked in the Bahamas (I used to be on a yacht transport crew), and Nassau was hilariously sketchy and I say this having also worked in Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. I’ve been in some suuuper sketchy situations in the Caribbean and southern North Atlantic but luckily I’ve always been super drunk and unaware and I look (and dress) like a broke Hawaiian uncle (tattered boardshorts, twenty year old t-shirt, shower flip flops) so no one assumes I have a dime to my name.  And I don’t.
