Aw, I definitely understand your anxiety, but STIs are truly ubiquitous. The majority of people with genital herpes are asymptomatic and unaware of their status. The 3-year timeline unfortunately doesn’t mean much for a virus like HSV, since it spends most of its time in a latent phase where it lives in the nerves, but is kept from replicating by the infected person’s immune system. You or your partner could be asymptomatic carriers and never have known it. But none of this is meant to worry you, just to encourage you to get checked out so you and your partner know your status. If you end up being positive for HSV, your partner can also get a blood test to find out her status, although this is more for peace of mind than anything since you’re committed to one another. If you are found to be positive and she is seronegative, using condoms can minimize the risk of transmission, since the virus sheds both when you’re symptomatic and asymptomatic.
