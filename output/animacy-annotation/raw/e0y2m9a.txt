Sweetie, have you ever seen the sort who regard things such as the EDL as worthwhile? It’s really quite terrifying- one should be compassionate as it’s obvious life has dealt them a pretty horrible hand- but they are not likely to ever make a really good choice in anything. From diet, to education, to communication they lack ability. They are  dimly aware their life is horrible but lack the insight to see how their choices affect outcomes. Unaware and angry they seek an external focus for the anger, and they pick the easy outsider. Itsrather sad but they cannot be allowed a morsel of anything but derision as they are bottom feeding vermin.
