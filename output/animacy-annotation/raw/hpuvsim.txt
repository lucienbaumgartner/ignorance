No, you won’t enjoy them “far, far less as an adult” and what fucking book with Aeschylus and William Penn epigraphs that’s 700 pages long is “clearly written for children”? The Harry Potter series are pointedly adult in many aspects more than any piece of youth fiction is, and that’s why it was so popular. Your comment is utterly dismissive, ignorant and arrogant
