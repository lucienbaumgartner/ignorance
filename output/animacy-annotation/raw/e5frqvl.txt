Goodness, this is bothering you. I enjoy you playing with my quote though to blow it out of proportion.  Apparently you see it's more accepting to be unaware and upset rather than attempting to be  understanding that maybe you just don't know how much work can go into something. Did I ever claim to know the process? So how can I elaborate further? I can make some shit up if that would appease you.
