It's hard to imagine that Sam doesn't think that situations are disparate. The situation on 1/6 was obviously unlike any other. Anyone should have been able to expect what Trump's crowd would get up to without sufficient security. The lack of security was truly bizarre. I guess I don't see what the evidence is that whoever was in charge of security was like, "well, a lot of Trump supporters are about to descend on Washington DC but they are white, so it should be fine".  You would have to be completely brain-dead and unaware of the political situation and KKK level racist to have this reasoning. Maybe that's what happened but it seems like there are other possible narratives. Maybe Trump had some kind of hand in the security levels and thought that whatever went down would be good for his cause? Maybe pro-establishment people wanted chaos to create the impetus for banning Trump from social media, deplatforming Parler, and putting random protest goers on no-fly lists to dissuade other people from opposing the establishment?
