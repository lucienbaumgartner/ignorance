Thanks for at least hearing me out. Please don't allow the Reddit echo chamber to blind you to the quiet majority of the unvaccinated population, which are not Q-Anon or Trump supporters.

You are right--the black community is not really here defending itself. They're being drowned out. Make no mistake my friend, it *is* a narrative being pushed. Reddit *is* being propagandized. Most of the people helping to create the narrative don't even realize it.

I have talked to my co-workers about this very topic, and they \[liberal-minded black folks\] were all surprised to learn that Reddit thinks they are Q-Anon.

**All I ask is that you do not** ***dehumanize*** **everyone who remains unvaccinated.** You may feel that there are no good reasons to remain skeptical, but you are neither omniscient nor omnipotent--neither am I. The difference of opinion may seem ludicrous to you, but that does not make it objectively ludicrous. There is an immense amount of pressure to keep people like me quiet; yes, the most loud-mouthed and ignorant of the bunch tend to be heard the most. That's why I'm here chatting with you in an environment that is extremely inhospitable and prejudiced to me--because I think it's critical for people to realize we are not all a bunch of alt-right conspiracy theorists. Most of us aren't. We're just being drowned out.
