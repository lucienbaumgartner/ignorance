She's self absorbed, narcissistic, and ignorant of the people around her.
She refused to accept that her daughter doest like girly shit, and forced a fucking princess party on her, when nobody wanted it. Even after she realised that, she said she wouldn't change a thing. The thing is.. She could have a princess parry for herself anytime she wants, but she hijacked her daughter's party to do it and doesn't regret that, is in itself such a selfish thing to do.

Then forcing her ethical/ moral principles on Sandy. Debbie can't even understand that it's an individual choice of everyone of what they do in their lives. Sandy didn't wanna be a mom, it is perfectly fine. Just because she became one and lowkey regrets it, even though Fiona and others told her not to do that, she wants to force it on other teen mom's to do the same.
I might be biased here, but Debbie was total nuts in the last 2 seasons. Toxic asf, and unbearable.
