I can't imagine Ray Bradbury would have ever thought that Fahrenheit 451 would slowly but surely become a work of non-fiction. 

Wall TV's that are on all the time and can be tuned to a channel of pure propaganda that can manipulate millions in a matter of minutes: ✅
Seashells (AirPods) that are worn all the time, no matter the setting or need for them: ✅
Societal wide obsession with athletics rather than academics: ✅
Rejection of philosophy and science: ✅
Personal feelings and opinion are considered the same as logic and reason: ✅
Fast cars and more advanced toys(i.e. guns, drones, smartphones, etc.) for adults: ✅
And last but not least, book burning(analogous to censorship): ✅

Scary country to live in right now. 
Even scarier for the children being left with such a willfully ignorant and dangerous society.
