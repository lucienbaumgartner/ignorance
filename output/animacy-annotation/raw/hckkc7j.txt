It is not how "I feel", your views are objectively backwards, misogynistic, over the top judgmental to the point of dehumanizing others, belittling, and ignorant. That isn't disputable. You not taking any "performance increasing substances" does not make you better or less disgusting than someone who does. You are clearly just a child who is making a bunch of uneducated and ignorant assumptions to confirmation bias and rationalize your personal choices at the expense of others around you.
