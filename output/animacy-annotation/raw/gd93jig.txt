I get your point,  Peterson does a poor job separating himself from this critique I must say, so obviously this is my opinion and presumably my bias influencing me but I genuinely believe he's misinformed, slightly ignorant and unaware of how lacking his study of the Nazis was.

The best argument I can make with this is, remember the Zizek debate? JBP in the past has said he studied Marx and for the debate he said he re-read the communist manifesto. Now, as can be seen by his poor performance, his assumption that all there is to Marx is the communist manifesto is hilariously naive. It was basically a pamphlet designed to radicalize peasants. But he was confident he had done his research. So maybe he's this naive when it comes to the study of Nazis too? That's what I believe anyway
