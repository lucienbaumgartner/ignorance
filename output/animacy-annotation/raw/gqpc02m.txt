It's very inaccurate and just plain stupid at times. There's no evidence presented that Ã–calan tries to emulate Stalin, and I dont see the point of comparing the kurdish revolution to the spanish revolution like its supposed to set some kind of precedent. All in all pretty narrow-minded and unaware of the intricacies of the kurdish struggle.
