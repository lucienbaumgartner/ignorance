The absolute MAIN problem with all religions and topics like this however is:

Children believe what is taught to them. Kids fear they are going to burn for eternity for natural feelings and desires. Children fear of someone watching them and hearing their thoughts at all times. This is nothing less than child abuse and it is shameful. Itâ€™s disgusting and ignorant that the church has yet to come to the realization of the evil of their ways and the detriment they do to the mental health of children and young adults.
