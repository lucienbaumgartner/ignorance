Sorry, but you are copying misinformation here. Argument you are using refers to herd immunity which is applicable for other used vaccines and diseases. However we know, that due to nature of coronaviruses (also flu virus) herd immunity is impossible to reach with current vaccines and natural immunity. THESE VACCINES DO NOT STOP THE SPREAD. It was a lie shared in media to promote vaccinations. So every vaccinated person is the same danger to immuno compromised, If not bigger as they are more likely to be asymptomatic and unaware of being sick.
