Agreed. It seems disrespectful and ignorant of him to make plans this way, but that doesn't mean her response isn't assholish too. Making bullshit into a battle is the fastest way to terminate a relationship.

Well, except it seems like he's doing what he feels entitled to do *in the house, his home* not in "a vacuum." We disagree entirely there on the location where this situation is playing out lol. I don't see it as an ethereal concept removed from tangible locations floating up in the lofty realm of ideas, I see it as taking place within a home where two people are supposed to be living out their personal and mutual lives because they'd intended to. Pretty sure the courts would see it that way. So. Uh oh. OP is gonna have to address her own petty jealousy as well as her partner's foolishness.
