Ya... Sorry but you're just far too young and ignorant of the world to have any opinion on any of this. You have one example of a person who was fully brainwashed to believe it's what he had to spend his entire life doing, instead of, I dunno, watching you grow? For more than a cpl hours a week? My parents were totally fine with it all too, doesn't mean it's right, doesn't mean it's the way human beings are supposed to spend their precious lives. If you were right then there wouldn't be entire COUNTRIES changing their policies and laws on labor, would there? Again, you have no leg to stand on here. Come back when your spirit is broken by years of missed opportunities and too little control over your life like the rest of ours lmao
