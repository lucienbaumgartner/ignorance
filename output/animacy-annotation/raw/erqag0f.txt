I agree, but some of them might really be unaware and loose almost all of their investment. Such a steep premium feels a bit like a calculated scam from the early market makers - or actually if Greyscale prevented true discovery to take place and limit the market for the market makers they might be in trouble. Am I wrong? Just curious, not familiar with Greyscale and how does their fund work. Seems really weird there is not enough people willing to sell ETH sub $1000...
