I’ve stuck with my regular corded Apple headphones for this reason. I feel unaware and vulnerable if I don’t have enough hearing outside of my podcast/music. Some people prefer noise cancelling which is a bother if you’re trying to get their attention but I think it’s just important to realize we’re all sharing the road, like you said. Some people are just better at sharing than others lol
