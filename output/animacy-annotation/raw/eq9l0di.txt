Obviously its an unpopular opinion... but for example take Robin Williams into account. You cant sit there and say he never tried to seek help. No fucking way. Someone who brought endless joy to millions of people who had ample time and ability to seek help couldnt? Why? Maybe for some there is no help. Look at Chester of Linkin Park. I had the privileged of meeting him on 3 occasions because my manager at the time was like leader of the LP street team. And I in no way wish he "found help and was still alive" because to assume to say he never sought help would be disgraceful and ignorant. That man has found a peace he never could in life and regardless how sad it makes you he is more at peace than any of us will ever be. For that I am happy for him. Sure I wish both men were still around but that is me being selfish. Wishing they were alive and happy again truly only helps me in the moment. 

One could argue talking someone out of suicide is less "treatment" and more brain washing them into accepting life. Life for many is far far darker than youll ever realize.
