First. I am sorry your parents and brother reacted in such a catastrophically inappropriate manner. Your identity is yours alone and can put you in danger in this fucked up society. That was very immature and irresponsible of your brother. Equally naive and ignorant of your parents. 

Second. As someone who has cut off some family before for inappropriate behaviors/interactions; I can say there is a point in time where you decide that’s enough. Similar to bad relationships, sometimes love blinds you and gives you “reasons to stay” but eventually you will feel comfortable standing up for yourself. I wish you the best of luck. And welcome to the bi family 💗💜💙
