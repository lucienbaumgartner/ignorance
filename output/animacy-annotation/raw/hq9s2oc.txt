Fishing is even more absurd to me because it’s just so destructive and ignorant of the environment, stocks and the ecosystem.

Watching David Attenborough showcase how the world fishes, and the sheer numbers we pull up daily is nonsensical - surely, there’s no way we’re eating that much fish daily? 

Fwiw, I don’t eat fish, though nothing to do with moral reasons, I just don’t like it. 🤷‍♂️
