“Your body, your choice “

Until you pass it on to someone, then it’s your choice to have done so. And if they suffered greatly, that was your choice to make them suffer. That makes you a bad selfish and stupid person in my opinion, but not yours. Fair enough.

I’ve had it. I survived, but 5 weeks on I’m still affected. So for the little effort it takes (none of my close contacts tested positive as I’m generally fairly careful) I’m happy I care enough about others to wear a mask and vaccinate myself to help reduce my chances of passing it on and to protect myself from selfish stupid people.

Hard to believe people are still this selfish and ignorant of all these details.
