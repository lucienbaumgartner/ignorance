I think i would rather have an argument with a 5 year old who can't even understand the concept of light wavelengths because you are so stubborn and ignorant that you just want to believe what you think and arent open to what the truth is.

COLOR is what we call our perception of the WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT that enter our eye.

COLOR in and of itself does not exist. I dont know how to get this point across because even if I gave you a perfect explanation you would still refuse and argue with me.
