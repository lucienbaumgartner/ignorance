This is a terrible appeal to emotion and should not be used a basis of broad public policy. No doubt people with loved ones who have died from covid feel sad about it. But that can be said about any deadly disease, which there are countless. My position is based on the data, not emotional arrogance. Covid is objectively not dangerous for the vast majority of people on earth. And even for the most vulnerable it's far from a death sentence. Every attempt to try to control covid has been a complete failure everywhere on earth. It is insane to continue doing what has proven not to work, especially since covid is not uniquely deadly. Reorganizing society around covid suppression is foolish and disgusting. Your position is emotional and irrational and ignorant of the actual data.
