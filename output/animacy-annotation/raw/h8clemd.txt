Remember pmo is the"normal" in this society, don't knock your friends for it. I see this narrative all the time, but you should not expect people to understand something that's not "normal" to them. If people are open to it than that's cool, but if they're not then just don't bother and simply move on. They will one day realise it or they won't, on their own. 

There's no need to judge people on something that society has deemed normal their whole lives. Most of us were at some point in our lives, unaware and ignorant of pmo, just like your friends are at this point in time.
