That might be one of the most naive things Ive ever heard someone say. 

"Over time the success of our non-interventionalist policies will lead other people to copy us. That will cut down on the bad things that others do."

I dont want to laugh in your face, as that would be rude, but that is so hopelessly naive and ignorant that I dont really know what to say.
