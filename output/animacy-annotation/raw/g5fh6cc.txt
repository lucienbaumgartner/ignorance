You made me remember something: in some indigenous tribes in Brazil, whenever twins are born they kill one of them, (the second one out) because they believe twins are evil.

A friend of mine worked with this tribe for a while as a nurse and told me that. Later I researched and found out it is actually true. However, it's not considered a crime, because "it's their culture and we must preserve their ways" and we can't dictate our Constitution to them.

Fuck it. For me it's straight up murder of an innocent. I don't care if your culture is backwards and ignorant. That twin child had absolutely no idea of the culture it was about to be born into. That child could have been born anywhere else on the planet, but had the terrible "luck" to be born in that ridiculous way of handling twin births.

You can bet your ass that this specific way of life is defended fiercely by the Left, liberals, new left, globalists, or whatever.
