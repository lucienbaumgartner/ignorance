There is no light without the dark. Need to be aware and prepared at all times for unwanted, unpredictable and unavoidable negativity. That's how you accidently put yourself into the middle of situations that you are unprepared for. (Mass shootings for example.. Its pretty trendy these days. Along with kidnapping)
It much easier to be happy knowing and staying aware and ready for many of the dangers around you vs being blissfully happy being unaware and ignorant of them. They arent gonna disappear or avoid you. Something horrible can happen to any of us at any given time or place.
