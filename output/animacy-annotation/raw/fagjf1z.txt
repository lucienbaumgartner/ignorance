&gt;What the comment actually says is that Poland is more sexist, and that therefore men are more trapped in traditional roles, and suffer more from toxic masculinity.

Again, if that were the case then why is Poland higher than much more traditional countries such as Russia and Ukraine? "Traditional roles" are undesirable no question there, however blaming those as an umbrella term should never be a detractor from tackling the actual issues. And sadly it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  For example, take your point 1 and 2. These are examples of men being forced into the role of provider 

If that were the case than doesn't it mean the causes of this role aren't really "traditional" as of now and groups claiming to fight these gender roles are doing the exact opposite? The issue of family courts and alimony has always been labelled as a "men's rights activists thing" and people fighting for it have been branded as sexist. The very same groups that claim to fight against "toxic masculinity" have fought against joint custody law proposals in the US for example. "Masculinity" is obviously not what's causing these laws then.

The same happens with the way workers are treated. Every fight for fair treatment in the workplace as a gendered issue always talks about women's treatment in the workplace, despite men usually getting the short end of the stick here.

Both these cases are of modern causes, modern ideologies and modern movements in the fight for human rights. How can we call these issues "traditional" then? If the issue is men being mistreated in the workplace then we talk about men being mistreated in the workplace. If the issue is biased family courts then we talk about biased family courts. That way we deal with the issue regardless of the cause and whether it's "traditional" or "modern". Using "traditional sexism" as an umbrella term instead is a warranty that society will remain unaware and inactive on these issues.
