Well, there was this one time when I went to a sleazy studio for a commercial demo. Not only was the demo bad, but when I pointed out some of the bad things in it, the owners gaslit me over it. They said I had plagiarized the script and been rude and ignorant of everything they said in the booth, none of which was true. It wasn’t until months later that I found out that everything they had said was a lie, so I demanded a refund, telling them that if hey didn’t, I’d tell everybody I knew about them. A few days later, they framed me for sending phony death threats. Months after that, I impersonated one to get back at the other, which worked well enough to destroy that person’s career, but the other person caught me in the act, blackmailed me into publicly confessing, and then went back on his word not to call me out if I did. Not only that, but he also repeated his lies about the death threats. After years of trying and failing to convince the mods of a big Discord server to let me back in and getting kicked out of other servers and projects because of said lies, I’d had enough, so I reported him to a talent agency because he had been posting ableist jokes and borderline pedophilic pictures on his social media pages. I haven’t heard a word about either of them since.
