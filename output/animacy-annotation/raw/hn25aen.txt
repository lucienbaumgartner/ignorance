Sweet! This is the second time in two days I have given critical but extremely well received feedback on someone else's creative project (which is usually against my 'rules' as that sort of well intentioned shit can be rude and ignorant of their development process) so I'm psyched to hear that it was helpful!

Yeah what you're doing, I'm sure there's other people doing it but you're the first I've seen so you'd absolutely have my attention doing something like that in an easily consumable bitesize format that's also dense enough that it's not just (exact signal chain down to equipment serial numbers) but (concept into concept into concept, you can try and emulate this with your gear but I used X, Y, and Z) I'd be an absolute regular because I hate tone chasing on guitar and am glad that there's people who don't doing it so that hypothetically I can grab tones quickly from someone who put a lot of thought into it.  (I once tried to make a library of tones and quickly fell out of it so you would legit provide a real service).

Just checked out your vid, oh yeah, you're totally set man. You have a great voice for this.
