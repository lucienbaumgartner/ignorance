Oooh some random person on reddit with a throwaway has declared me to be arrogant and ignorant! That means I must be! 


I guess I’ll just throw away all of my books, forget the years of study I’ve completed and forget everything I learned in my Quran class (shame because my goal was to become a hafiz) because the great Mufti /u/throwitaway-727- has officially declared me to be arrogant and ignorant.
