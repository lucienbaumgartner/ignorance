&gt; Posse Comitatus Act

[For those unaware and too lazy to google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act):

The US military generally cannot act as US law enforcement or used to enforce US domestic policy. There are some very narrow exceptions such as being used to put down insurrection or rebellions under the [Insurrection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act), respond to threats that involve nuclear weapons, or provide surveillance/intelligence gathering/observation/equipment for domestic law enforcement on operations such as drug interdiction and counter-terrorism missions
