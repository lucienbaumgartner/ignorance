Bri knew brooks was so taking advantage of her mom even though Vicki lied to her daughters face.  Everybody was trying desperately hard to warn Vicki about brooks but she was so desperate and ignorant that she lied all day, every day about brooks.  She also said brooks was abusing towards her and in the next breath shares that when he left, she was running behind his car begging him to stay.  And was seen in Florida visiting brooks.     I don’t know about y’all, but the first time a child of mine shares that my boyfriend is abusive  and inappropriate towards them is the day they leave with the shirt on their back.  Vicki &amp; Brooks are 2 peas in a pod And are scum of the earth who deserve each other.   End of rant.
