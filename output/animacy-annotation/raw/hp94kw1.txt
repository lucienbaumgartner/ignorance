There was definitely a concerted troll effort keep both Warren and Sanders out of the Oval Office (and not just trolls and foreign actors, but the usual media and political machines too).

It’s really unfortunate how Bernie ended up with a cult of personality; while it’s good that disaffected/disengaged people started getting involved, I think those types tended to be politically ignorant and more vulnerable to manipulation (such eating their own for purity and loyalty tests—not to say people shouldn’t have standards, but that wasn’t what was happening). (Note: Obligatory “not all Bernie supporters,” including myself.) 

I think the progressives (and adjacent supporters) who’d been around the block and paid attention in previous cycles tended to like both Warren and Sanders based on their records and/or values and/or proposals, paid attention to other candidates and their records (even calling out lies and odd conspiracy theories), and were less swayed by unnuanced takes and shenanigans by “trolls” and drama llamas.
