Her "own it" doesn't feel genuine. I think it's surface-level and simplistic. She seems to find it catchy, and she maybe sees how it makes people feel like they owe her something, like it makes them defensive. I think she feels powerful, momentarily, when she puts people on the defensive. 

She seems like she doesn't care about the truth. She cares about what serves her in the moment. She comes across as one of the most despicable housewives. I say "comes across" because I don't know this woman. I just see her behavior on TV, Insta, whatever, but I don't know her. 

I think if you're a person with even a smidge of integrity, her behavior is baffling because it makes no sense for someone with a bit of integrity to be so hypocritical and unaware of their hypocrisy even when it's brought to their attention. But if you entertain the idea that her behavior has no integrity, it makes more sense, like just because Christian Bale played Batman in a movie doesn't mean he solves crimes or whatever. For me, the only way I can make sense of her behavior is to see her as someone who has no moral center. She acts only in the ways she believes will serve her in the moment regardless of who or what can be destroyed in the process. I don't think anything she says has depth. Her words seem like empty shells, like when you eat pistachios and you see a shell with no pistachio in it, and you're like, wtf, why is this here? I don't know. This is what I think of Rinna's behavior and the things she says. A pistachio shell that's missing the pistachio. It's flavored and it's in the nice bag that I bought, but it's got no real use, substance, inner core.
