You raise a complex and well-articulated point. I think you answered your own query with the circle back to IBLP. 

The doctrine of Gothard discourages all form of critical thinking (unless one counts self-reflection on personal shortcomings). Higher education from accredited universities is open only to the very, very few pursuing medical or legal careers (and then we’ve seen several examples on the medical side where these individuals’ licenses are revoked but they continue to practice insular medicine within the cult).

A person who never is allowed, let alone encouraged, to identify and develop critical thinking skills will never think deeply about their faith. They’ll never be able to articulate what they cannot consider, only parrot what they’ve heard said or been told is the proper response.

Gothard was a tyrant. He oppressed people, kept them ignorant and reliant.
