It's one of my favourite movies. So many emotions and issues were dealt in a realistic and intricate way. Brother being unaware and assumptive, having no understanding of his privilege. Mother not realising her problematic conditioning. Mother in law siding with the son but later realising her fallbacks. Women putting their wishes on the back burner and not getting any acknowledgement for their sacrifice.

More than it just being about abuse, it was about how systematic abuse is in our society, irrespective of class and roles of the individual. Educated or uneducated, working or not working.. Rich or poor, abuse is very common and always makes things toxic. Only some have no choice but to live with that toxicity.


Judging that movie is enough to show what a limited view she has at life.
