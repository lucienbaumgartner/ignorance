&gt;How do you know Apple is 1% shorted? Where are you getting your information? Because those same places also have GME shorted at less than 10% lmao.

I just googled Apple short interest. I don't really know that much about Apple as a stock since I've never invested in it and never plan to invest in it. 

As for GME, the short interest is hidden through Deep ITM options. There's been a ton of DD on this.

 The fact that you don't know tells me you're extremely uninformed and ignorant of the situation. Please read up on what's going on before commenting further ( sort this sub by the DD flair). Otherwise there's not really a point in even trying to have  a discussion with you. Have a good day!
