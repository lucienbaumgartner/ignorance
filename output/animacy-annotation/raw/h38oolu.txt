No. The leaks point to a generational leap.

Every Nintendo generation has been 5-5 and a half years, or just about.

That is the timeline we are leading up to, and that's what the leaks point to. A new generation. You don't refresh a generation on the timeline that you normally release a new one.

Basically: You're fucking dumb and ignorant of Nintendo's history.
