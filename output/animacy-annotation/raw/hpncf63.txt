Talk about r/selfawarewolves...

I was not, I will not, I would not, EVER, under any circumstances, laugh at the rape, murder, or rape and murder, of any woman, let alone a child, let alone a child from my hometown 2 years older than me. It's disgusting you're assuming I would. I laughed because my husband is oblivious. We weren't laughing at her, we weren't laughing at her brother, the victims were never, ever the joke. The butt of the joke was my husband: a stupid, asshole kid doing stupid, asshole kid things. The rape was not the joke. The murder was not the joke. It was my husband being ignorant and thoughtless. 

And how would you feel if your doctor gave you a prostate exam without wearing gloves? I imagine you wouldn't be comfortable with that, either. Also, it's pretty fucking hypocritical to make insensitive remarks about my trauma while accusing me of doing the same about someone else's.
