Listen mate. I know i was being a vindictive little shit before cause at the time of replying I was angry at something else. But I'm talking about "fiance was horribly depressed and was not sexually active for months" she's doing great btw. And were having plenty of sex now. 

However, its really really sad and ignorant that you'd decry all pron just because you A. Dated a porn addict or B. Blamed porn for you not getting sex all the time or whatever. Terribly selfish take. Sounds like fds shit. Well. I hope beyond plausibility that your bedroom is no longer dead.
