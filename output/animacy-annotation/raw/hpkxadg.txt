I get the point but I think it’s just a difference in opinion. An example: I’m gay, and growing up Ender’s Game was one of my favorite books. Orson Scott Card (the author) is a notorious homophobe who thinks people are gay by choice or because of trauma they experienced as children. He thinks gay marriage should be illegal, and used to believe homosexuality should be criminalized. It sucks he has that opinion, but I don’t think he should be removed from the series. He was involved in the movie (which was bad but I digress) and that was the right decision in my opinion. He created the world and the characters. It’s terrible that he’s ignorant and homophobic, but I don’t let him bother me. I take the series for what it is: an amazing story created by a flawed man. That’s how I feel about Harry Potter too. But of course people have the right to disagree.
