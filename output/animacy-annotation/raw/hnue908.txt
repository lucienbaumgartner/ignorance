It's worth noting that the Warhammer wiki has this to say about the people the Wolves were defending:

&gt;the Inquisitors voted to sterilize and quarantine-for-life the remaining population of the Hive World in Adeptus Arbites work-camps scattered across the galaxy even though it was generally considered untainted and ignorant of the truth concerning the existence of Chaos. The valiant Imperial Guard and other human defenders of the world were to suffer the same fate or be liquidated. 

So, they were to be killed or sent to the gulag for potentially knowing demons existed, not for being tainted/corrupted...which is why the Space Wolves stood up for them in the first place. The Inquisitor's position is hypothetically defensible, but the facts on the ground make it much less so.
