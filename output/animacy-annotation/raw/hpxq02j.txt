Just because you're not happy with your own life doesn't mean you have the slightest bit of insight into what makes other people happy. Music is a huge part of my life, it's my job, a hobby and a passion. I would be considerably less happy if music disappeared from my life and for you to assert otherwise makes you seem like an incredibly ignorant and unintelligent person.
