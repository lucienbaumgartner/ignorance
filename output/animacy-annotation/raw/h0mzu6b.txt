I've always wondered about and been interested in BDSM ever since I met my roommate in university who was into it. I just got into my first serious relationship (still am with same partner today) and started having sex/interested in sex around that time so I was inexperienced and unaware of how broad the sex education really is before I met her. She was an awesome roommate. 

Fast forward 8 years later, my partner and I decided to get into the lifestyle and never looked back because we've become much more intimate than before and discovered parts about us we never knew about and it makes things even more exciting. I can go on about how great it has been as an outlet lol. 

I really owe it to my roommate for having a sex-positive outlook, that I really admired and has an everlasting effect on me ever since.
