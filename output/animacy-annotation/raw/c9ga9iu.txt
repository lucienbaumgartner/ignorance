Ok, I'll tell my story of the only police involvement I've ever had: 


One night, shenanigans were done. We were dropping people off, the day was done, I was tired and the goals were won. However, we found a stop sign posted on a straight away and we noticed something wrong right away. 


You see, as we were stopped there for particular reason, we decided to right this unfathomable treason. We got out, went to the sign, pulled up and up it came just fine. So there we were, a bunch of teenagers, unwillingly out of line. 


We decide the best course of action in this particular instance would be to put it in a friends yard. However, we had quite a trying problem as this friend lived quite a distance. So three blocks we ran since fitting it in a car was rather hard and finally we made it there. 


We all went home from there, unconscious and unaware, that a lady called in to the police and reported my friends license plate.
