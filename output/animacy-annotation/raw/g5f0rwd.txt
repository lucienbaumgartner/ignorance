So this might sound weird but a major factor is how old you are and where are you “are in life”. I found that parents generally but conservative parents very specifically do not take their children’s opinions seriously until they get to a certain age and hit certain milestones.

Add to that how one of the consistent messages of the right is that being a liberal is a sign of being young and unaware of how the world works and how people outgrow it.
