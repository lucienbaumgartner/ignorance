You say i fail to use logic but you have a severe lack in realpolitik, do you now what that means? 600 is plenty for a nation like Somalia, Furthermore the government itself is subservient to US policy. The US is in Somalia for its own interests.

Or do you really think NATO is patrolling our seas and air for our benefit? Thats naive and ignorant of history to be honest.

Henry Kissinger put it best. The US has no friends, only interests. Do you know better than Henry Kissinger?
