I think these observations are easier to make considering the nature of the sub and the abundance of users and content. Not too comparable to what the post is about. The articles try to breakdown and validate what they think happened in one specific event. I disagree with them because I think there's not sufficient evidence to support their claims. You don't. 

There's bias, more or less. Who's not biased to an extent? You seem fine with the sub being overwhelmingly right-leaning. It might be preferable to it being overwhelmingly left-leaning to you regardless or not if you have any ideological leaning. I'd like something in the middle because it's 100% biased toward a particular political leaning right now. You want a conspiracy sub undiluted from political ideology because it's meaningless. The sub should bother you then because it's not that. If you can't see that, then you're biased and unaware of that bias or don't browse regularly. See, we're all biased. I'm biased toward thinking right-wingers and refugees from censored right-wing subs are overrepresented here. It's not that I don't want them, but I'd like a fair representation of different views or at least avoidance of circle-jerking. I'm biased against unfettered and unopposed partisanship. I'm also biased against elites and tyrannical governments. Buying into the left-right dichotomy isn't mutually exclusive with being aware of who the actual enemies are.

Just normal opinions. They're based on browsing this sub on a near consistent basis. I think I stopped being antagonistic and I did apologize and you messaged this.
