About the power amror I think k that Tanaka mentions that it wouldn't matter if they did.1

Laconia power suits might be that much better and she is a properly  trained marine so she xan use hers better. 

I think she was trying to appease the Laconias and negotiate in good faith. So shveisbokayigb the card , ook how good we are that we keep 100% of our sofe of the deal please do the same. She has family on the planet so... any other armor suit might have come up on the scans on Tanaka and that would be registered as potential threat and terminate the negotiations.


She is a newbie negotiator,she doesn't understand the concept of always negotiating from  a position of power and that at this level as soon as you are at a disadvantage you are eaten alive. Uou can see she is arrogant and ignorant and regrets her decision the moment Tanaka sets her foot on the station, but it is too late of she goves the order for everyone to suit up then the deal is over so she pays along.

After that the brain goes in to flight or fight so she might didn't thing about the PDC, but I think there is better explanation for that 

She is betting on one of the two ships to go rescue Tanaka so that she can fight the other and give time to the Rocci to escape. This is mentioned in the book too when she thinks about the strategy. 

If Tanaka was dead then they would have captured Rocci  you can see she is sacrificing herself to give rocci a chance.

So overall good tactician as soon as bullets start flying, socks at the political game.

She is out of her league like Naomi explains. Holden and Naomi know that no matter what fascist/authoritarian goes don't stick to their ends of a bargain. You can appease them, the only way to win is crush them, show force and stand up to them. There is a recent example in history.

They also know that wining the long game is the only way of winning
