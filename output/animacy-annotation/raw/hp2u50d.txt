"Traditional foods (like tacos which are simply a cheap cut of meat and simple grain preparation that people have been eating since before white people colonized the continent)"

you know the fact that you are WHOLLY unaware and IGNORANT of the FACT that the ancient Mexicans ATE NO MEAT prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century

{because it was the Spanish [your said "white people"} who FIRST introduced cows, pigs, goats, sheep, and chicken to Mexico}

means that i cant enter into a serious conversation about this {Mesoamerican studies} with you.
because youve just proved you really have no idea what you are talking about.

nice try. move along.
