&gt;But they *are* your enemies. You won't make them not your enemy by treating them as if they weren't. 

Only if I decide to take that point of virw. By treating them as an enemy I am making them an enemy.

&gt;They will kill you. Yes, they're misguided and ignorant, that doesn't mean they won't kill you. 

Which is why it's so important to address the thought processes and the perspective of being enemies before things escalate to that point. 

&gt;and you should act as such until they aren't your enemy.

Then they will never not be your enemy because you will never not treat them as such.

&gt; Otherwise you're likely to use appeasement and mollifying tactics which are exactly what they want from you, anything but the utmost resistance.

If you're weak willed, maybe. These ideas should be aired and derided/shamed/mocked, as should the people holding them. 

&gt;Because seriously, they outright will not stop considering you an enemy until you're subservient or dead. You can't just pretend they're not your enemy and hope that stops "the hate" when sometimes yeah, they really are your enemy.

You don't just pretend. You actively exercise patience and understanding so they don't feel attacked and then you gradually change their views.


&gt;And that'll never happen when they're platformed on the media in the first place. It's equivalent to suggesting one debate ISIS supporters or antiabolitionists or something - it obviously only lends legitimacy to them and presents them as a potentially reasonable possibility in a debate even when you shit on them, on issues thoroughly settled

Only when the opposition doesn't have the intellect or fortitude to show the ideas for the ridiculousness that they are.
