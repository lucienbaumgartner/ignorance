I’m sorry they invalidated you. It’s not up to any therapist to dismiss, criticise, justify whatever you discover about yourself. She’s obviously ignorant and arrogant. In case you’d still like to know more about asexuality, I suggest the podcast Psychology in Seattle and the episodes about the topic. He’s a great example of how a psychologist should address such matters.
