It’s sad and ignorant that you think applying for asylum will get you anything under this administration. And it shows your lack of awareness that having a gun will protect you from armed gangs. You can shoot one or two, but they will come for you, and make an example of you. Plus counties don’t have a constitutional right to a firearm, and therefore have no means to defend themselves. Again, you need to work out those empathy muscles.
