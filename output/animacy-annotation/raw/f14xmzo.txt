I think the whole point of this sub is that there exists white men who believe they are thick skinned, calm, and rational, when in reality they are actually fragile.  


This tweet makes a statement mocking the fragile white men. "thick skins and calmly rational attitudes" is what he says, but all the replies are going to be the fragile white men who are angry that jokes are being made only at their expense.  


After content like this gets posted on the sub, we get another look at the fragile white men in the comments. They are usually the most downvoted and unaware that this sub is about them.  

I explained the joke, hope it's still funny! It is to me!
