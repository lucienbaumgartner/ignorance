I'm an outsider, so forgive me for not knowing your ways. Might I offer that questioning is only constructive if you're questioning the right things. 

Should you question me on why I had eggs this morning for breakfast, since that would fall under the category of "everything"? I think you'd agree that it wouldn't lead anywhere interesting or productive. 

Seems as though the mod, while perhaps phrasing things in a way that triggers free thinkers, is trying to keep the conversation within the bounds of productive conversation rather than devolving into squabbling over minutiae. 

That's what I got from reading the post, blissfully unaware and free from any internal politics that may be clouding the issue.
