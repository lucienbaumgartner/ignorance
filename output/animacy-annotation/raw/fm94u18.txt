Imagine being this ignorant, believing your own unpopular opinion is the end all be all fact and that anyone who thinks otherwise is the delusional one. If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.
