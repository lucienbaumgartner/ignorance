“You can’t eat any meat of any kind and call yourself an animal lover”

And your brain is the one hurting? Your only argument is other animals are as smart as dogs. People don’t measure the animals they eat based on an intelligence chart. People bond with certain animals and attach feelings with them, it makes complete sense why they do that and not with others that they eat. It’s a similar reason some cultures eat dogs, most of those people don’t attach themselves emotionally to those animals. It’s not “wrong” or “evil”, it’s just how people are. 

For you to try to say a person doesn’t truly love their dog and other animals because they eat beef shows how small minded and ignorant of a person you are.
