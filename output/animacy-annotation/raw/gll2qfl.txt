To say Mikan is just fanservice is just as stupid. She had those two scenes in chapter one where you couldn't see anything. She wore a one piece bikini which wasn't sexual at all. There were those those times where she was on top of Hajime however she was fully clothed and it was mostly done as a joke. 

The completely degrade her character to just those scenes is wrong. She is still carrying, helpful, is a huge help in the first two chapters with her autopsies, her free time events are really heart warming how she opens up to Hajime. 

Muja is different. She is the same stereotype as Mikan on the surface level but handled differently. Muja is a adult in a school full of minors. She is sexual clumsy and unaware of it. Mikan is aware of it and clearly doesn't like being in such situations. Meanwhile Muja has been portrayed so far as clueless. She is also actively going after a relationship with one student who she is supposed to care for.
