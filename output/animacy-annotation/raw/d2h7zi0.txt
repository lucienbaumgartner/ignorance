I'm allowed to tell whoever the fuck I want. Especially when it's anonymous like this. I don't need condescending pieces of shit like you to validate my abuse. Congrats on knowing nothing about how abuse victims deal with pain.

&gt; you think you're the only one who has suffered abuse

That's a huge stretch and I never said that. I'm sorry you're completely socially unaware and inept at helping those who have dealt with abuse. Maybe you should actually learn about how to help by taking a workshop or something instead of continuing to be a terrible fucking person at it.
