So many retards in the comment section. Not one of you people have actually analyzed the situation. Remember when biden left our only strategic airbase and never told anyone, so it was overrun? What about him never talking about terror attacks, and then once they happened, he never used the "deadly force" he said he'd use? Why didn't he pull out in May, like trump originally made the deal for? Even if he didn't leave in May, why did he pull out his troops before taking everyone out of the country? Are you people just so blond and ignorant that you forget these things? Or are you just puppets for r/politics? Seems like Mr. "You ain't black" isn't doing to hot in the polls, either. He's nearly at 40%.
