The 70s were !fabulous! (I was 15-20 yr old)... because I was a young, selfish, and unaware of the real world.  Fun times but I was totally irresponsible.  

I'm not proud of who I was back then, but that feeling of 'life is limitless and so much fun' was the memory that I used and based my climb back into the world after my 30s...  after a divorce, being a single parent, facing devastating financial challenges.  

Now in my 60s, I've found the last two decades to be the most awesome.  Totally surpassing my youthful pleasures.  Life in all its nuances has so much more meaning and depth now.  

The light is so much more beautiful when you've seen the shadows.
