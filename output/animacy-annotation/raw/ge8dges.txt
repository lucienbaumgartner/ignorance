Its basically us, as a society, growing to adjust to social media the way we had to adjust for cable news.

We have no mental antibodies for social media, just like we had none for 24/7 news and the uses Murdoch put it to. ‘Fake news’? That’s using social media to *turn you away from other sources of information*, to listen to weight of opinion (ie, bots and carefully constructed echo chambers) over such silly things as ‘news’ or even ‘your own eyes and ears’.

I expect that Trump years, and at least the next 5, will be the peak of social media influence over an unaware and highly vulnerable population. It’s possible we’ve already passed the peak of it, but I wouldn’t bet on it.

But you can already see social media adjusting for being gamed, as well as increasing awareness that is *is* gamed, as people start to inoculate themselves, cut themselves off, and generally see the same patterns of splintering and focusing as some dive deeper and others...step back.
