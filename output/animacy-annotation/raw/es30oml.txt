"Nuremberg-esque rally"... Jesus Christ, get a grip. The worst thing Trump said at that rally is

&gt;“That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,” Trump replied, smiling and shaking his head. “Only in the Panhandle.

Were he anyone but who he is, that would have been seen a subtle "Jesus fuck how fucking redneck are you people" comment, but no, because it's Trump, he's "encouraging extrajudicial killings." Not to mention the fact that his literal preceding sentence is (paraphrased) "We don't use weapons on them, other countries do, we don't, I won't let that happen".

&gt;his joking response raised concerns that he was tacitly encouraging extrajudicial killings and brutality against asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants

But hell, even if he said "go nuts dude, just don't get caught", it would ***still*** not be in the *slightest* way comparable to Nuremberg. Where's the military and paramilitary guard? Where's the dictator rhetoric?

&gt;The German people are happy in the knowledge that the constantly changing leadership has now been replaced by a fixed pole; a force which considers itself the representative of the best blood, and, knowing this, has elevated themselves to the leadership of this Nation and is determined to keep this leadership, to use it to the best advantage and never to relinquish it again.

Where's the appeal to race and blood?

I really don't know whether you think the comparison is apt because you have no concept of just how *vile* Hitler's rhetoric actually was, or because you're so simple-minded and ignorant that the only bad thing you can relate to is Hitler, so you apply it in every circumstance...
