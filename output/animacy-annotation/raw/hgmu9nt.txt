I had a lot of faith in Respawn over the development of Apex and I'm willing to go to bat over a lot of the gameplay decisions they've made.

However, the servers are awful, events have been lacklustre and it's just not been a fun time overall to be playing this game. I haven't played it properly for like two weeks now and it's just because all the mounting issues the game is having feel like a headache to deal with and then on top of that they keep trying to sell you things. 

The community can be really fucking dumb and ignorant of how much work goes into game development but they aren't wrong and the game is in a bad state. Respawn are quite frankly lucky that people keep organising boycotts because quite frankly this could lead to people being completely disinterested in this game which is a way worse state for it.
