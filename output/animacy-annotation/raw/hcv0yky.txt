why would it chase anyone away? short positions are very dangerous to hold. if there are shorts, then why not open a long to squeeze them out? shorts have no limit to downside risk.  if the market keeps going up, they have to pay back the loaned bitcoin no matter the price, plus interest.  while longs can only lose what they invested.   

this whole "shorts are evil" narrative is really childish and ignorant of how markets really work.
