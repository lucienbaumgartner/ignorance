Yeah, Billie continues to be a self-destructive hurricane with zero self-awareness, and the way she continues to drink heavily after promising Ruth they'd both stop is horrible, and it's worse that she's constantly trying to get Ruth to do it too. 

At least Ruth understands that she needs help, but Billie is so arrogant and unaware that she's dragging Ruth down with her.
