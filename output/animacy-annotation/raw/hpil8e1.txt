What's stopping you from acting like an adult and doing a comprehensive search on this topic so that you can actually learn something for once in your life, instead of crying and complaining, seriously??

Maybe you shouldn't be looking on Reddit for your answers when there are texts and studies written by academics on this subject. It's really not that farfetched to believe that the people who enslaved others based in their race took part in barbaric practices like cannibalism, considering they believed Africans were not even human beings and treated them like animals. Your ignorant and baseless skepticism makes you look delusional like all the other illiterate and Racist Hillbillies who love making excuses for this behavior, even when there is documented evidence that still exists. 

I mentioned that the same barbaric practices of sexual abuse towards children and experimentation occured in Residential Schools, but just with that same topic there are people exactly like you who choose to remain willfully lgnorant when people try to tell their experiences and knowledge of the matter. No one believed the indigenous children when they said their friends and family members went missing, even when they grew up and are now adults. Now we are STILL finding hundreds of bodies that were buried, hidden, and covered up by the Catholic church, multiple governments, and many school officials. 

&gt;We probably agree on a lot of things

We definitely don't, because I don't align myself with Dumbazz children who can't take the time to properly educate themselves. If you're incompetent and slow, just say thatü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it's a lot less words than spewing nonsense and embarrassing yourself LMAO
