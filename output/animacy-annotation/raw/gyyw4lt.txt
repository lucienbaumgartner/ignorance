You’re being awfully hostile for no reason.
For starters, if you honestly think his assistants and editors are random people he just met of the street and aren’t people he himself trusted with his work, and which he himself trained, you’re absolutely mad and need your head checked.

All you need to do is look at Duranki, a manga developed by his assistants with help from Miura. That by itself shows that they are more than capable of creating work comparable to Miura, so don’t you dare insult his assistants like that.

The fact that you think that his “relatively new” assistants aren’t capable of producing work Miura would approve of when they have made something that absolutely proves they can, you’re beyond ignorant.

If you think this his assistants wouldn’t hint at potentially carrying on his work, which this statement whether you like it or not, can absolutely be interpreted as, then you’re also arrogant and self centuries beyond belief.

Don’t you dare decide for certain what someone else is saying, when they say something that is up for interpretation, and then insult anyone who dares point out your ridiculous logic or even dares suggest otherwise.

Your final statement is the most ridiculous, and ignorant of them all. In what way would this be unjapanese of them? 
So do you get to decide what is or isn’t Japanese enough by your own nonsense standards?
This is absolutely NOT unjapansese. 
You’re so wrong, it’s actually painful.
Series like Familiar of Zero and Itazura na kiss, had endings or at least some kind of closure even after their respective authors died, BECAUSE it would be more respectable for the ones closest to them to finish the story they couldn’t. It would be more unjapanese not to do this.

Your head needs more than a wobble to fix, if there is anything in your head to be fixed.
