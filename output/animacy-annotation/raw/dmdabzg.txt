The argument to stop eating beef because of the inhumane treatment of the animal is understandable but not likely to convince others.  Most people assume, willfully, the cow is unaware and ignorant.  Instead consider the environmental impact this industry has on the planet ie green house gases, energy input to caloric output, and usable land area needs.   These all suggest a more practical and relevant argument to reduce consumption of beef.  

Yes i still eat beef.  It tastes good and i like it.  However, 15 years ago i would eat it daily but now i eat it only 1-2x per month.  Im raising my kids and teaching them about the costs of our choices, they fully understand and support the decision.  

Dont argue with ignorance, teach the next generation to know better and think critically.
