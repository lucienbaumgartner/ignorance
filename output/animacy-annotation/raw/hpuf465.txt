This isn’t what I would consider “high brow”, and certainly, these guys arent the enemy by any stretch of the imagination. 

“Discover” isn’t the word either. You don’t think Akash has experienced outright prejudice? They cater to a certain audience but these guys are by no means unaware of the existence of racial bias.  

There is a very real dynamic that exists in society where you can be wealthy and a minority, and someone can be ignorant and hurtful to you, but it doesn’t matter as much because of your social standing.  Their prejudice is essentially just insulting, rather than coming from a position of power in racism. It’s toothless racism. “A plying and bitter” but harmless. Akash gets this probably all the time. Like in literally every show. 

Anyways, I wouldn’t consider this a discovery. More like, they have a “slower” audience that they are well aware of, and this is how they let them synthesize the reasoning behind critical race theory and the reality of racial dynamics in America. Their audience in turn either shows that they are aware (read the top comments), shows that they are understanding and will say “damn, that’s crazy, I never knew that and that’s wrong”, or does what some people would do anyways, which is deny it exists/be aggrieved/get pissed off that they even brought it up. The last group are the trolls and even ostracized on their show.
