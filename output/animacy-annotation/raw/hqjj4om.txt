Absolutely understand. I would also never pick up a hitchhiker. And I also know when to empathize with my clients and when they’re asking me to do something that’d put me at risk or is manipulative.

In typical Reddit fashion, my point has been twisted and prodded and argued so much I have no idea what stance people have any more.

My whole point is lamenting about the fact that so many people would sooner help a dog and watch a homeless person starve. Everyone going “yeah BUT HOMELESS PEOPLE DANGEROUS” only proves my point.

I’m not expecting everyone to quit there jobs and become social workers lmao. But our society is lacking so much empathy right now, and I was just trying to shine some light on the plight of poor people. 

As we know, people who are afraid of something tend to also become hateful and ignorant of that thing. We see it with poor people, minorities, immigrants, whatever. 

It’s sad to me that people are justifying a lack of assistance for poor people as a “they deserve it, they’re criminals.”
