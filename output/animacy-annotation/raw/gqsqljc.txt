The SEC backed themselves into a corner pretty bad. Ripple is seeking precious SEC documents that will show the SEC was totally incompetent and ignorant of the facts. And the SEC is fighting hard to convince the judge to dismiss Ripple's request for these special documents. 

The Courts need to do the right thing here, and now allow the SEC to continue its bully tactics on XRP investors/holders.
