I’ll just leave this here, it does a good job to speak for itself. Greed is what drives most current divisions in the Métis, as cries of “there stealing our funding” pour out of ignorant, and stupidly foolish lips. We are stronger as a people, the larger our numbers. Some would seek to take that away, in hopes of maybe destroying a threat before it becomes too big. Why not bring in blood quantum and insure the doom of our nation like that of the status Indian for a pittance bribe from our government. Arrogant fools

Louis riel once wrote

"Until Now it (the name Métis) has served to designate the race emerging from the mixed blood of Europeans and the savages, but it is also proper to identify a race of men who would be recruited from mixing all bloods, between them, and, while shaped by the French Canadian mold, would keep the remembrance of its origins, by calling itself Métis.

The name Métis would be agreeable to all, because it is not exclusive and have the advantages of mentioning in suitable ways, the contingent by which each nation would contribute to generate the new people.  ( letter de louis riel a paul proulx 10 mai 1877 (translated from French))"

He also wrote:

"When it comes to the Eastern provinces of Canada, many Métis live there persecuted under the attires of the Indian costume. Their villages are villages of indigence. Their Indian title to the soil is however as good as the Indian title of the Metis of Manitoba.” (our translation from French)"
