&gt; That said, unaware and uninformed are the only part of the definition that makes sense to be used here and what she said clearly does make sense. That is, if one is to protect ones liberty they had best know who supports that liberty and who does not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Being uninformed is the primary problem that must be addressed first.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The psychological aspects of the word "complacent" with regard to achievement are irrelevant to the effort. But the awareness, concern, and thinking aspects are very important.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course there must be a better word to use and I won't bother to criticize Merriam Webster for misidentifying a most important meaning of the word. BE THAT as it may the word "complacent" is used and has been used with regard lack of awareness and lack of concern of gun rights from as early as the 1621.

You just pulled a "you didn't build that."  

The rest of that sentence is the important part. Try reading it.

&gt;This meaning says zilch about any psychological sense of undue over-satisfaction from achievement. It says exactly that the public aren't aware of any problem and aren't concerned.

&gt;Maybe the word complacent has changed meaning in 400 years. But the concern has not.

&gt;So Yes. I read first definition the Merriam Webster definition and found it even less suitable than the second and unnecessarily internal and complicated in comparison to how it has been used in regard to defending one's liberty. Maybe their dictionary ought to update. Barry Goldwater understood the problem.

&gt;Footnote: The Oxford Dictionary of American English does emphasize thinking and concern aspects of complacency.   

You're not disagreeing with what I said there, if you actually read what I said.   


In the end, you're just making up excuses to hate on her. She's saying there's too many people that aren't going out to vote because they don't realize how big the threats really are.  

She's absolutely, positively, 100% correct.
