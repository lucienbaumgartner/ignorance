And on top of that, I think a lot of people are just afraid of talk about it so they trick themselves into thinking racism doesn’t exist anymore. I honestly think some of “don’t see color” people are being genuine but it’s because they are so sheltered and ignorant that they just can’t comprehend that minorities in this country have a different experience than they do. 

I think the way civil rights is taught in school is a problem. Maybe it wasn’t the case for everyone, but fifth grade me kinda just got the gist that MLK gave his famous speech and then boom, racism was eradicated forever.
