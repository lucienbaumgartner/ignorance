In 1956 a freshly 21 year old John Key was walking around Auckland, lost, afraid, and unaware of what he was to do with his life. When suddenly, James Bond himself, Sean Connery came up to him and said "So, it's your twenty-furrrst" and he said "yes, how did you know?" and Sean looked at him, winked, grabbed his shoulder firmly and said "you're the man now, dog" and John realised in that moment every pony tail he wanted to grab and Sean knowingly smiled and walked away and the day has forever been memorialised since.
