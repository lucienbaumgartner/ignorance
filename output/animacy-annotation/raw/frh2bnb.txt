Wait a minute this is a condition? I never knew I had this|yeah, that was my first reaction when somebody told me about it!! i totally thought when i was younger everybody did it as bad as i did.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf1nh3/)
I have this too, as a result of OCD. Hair, eyebrows, pimples, scabs, you name it. Do your loved ones know, or do you find yourself hiding it?|When i was younger, my parents had no idea it was not absolutely natural. It was relatively easy to hide until i hit puberty, now my face is full of just.. red. I try hard to hide it but when it comes to anything on my face, it always gets brought up from worry. I only found out it was actually a condition a few months ago, so only my parents know ive been diagnosed. otherwise anybody that knows me pretty much knows that i pick at any surface of my body and make it bleed on the regular. But yeah, if i could just make pimples not appear, i would so much rather everybody not know|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf31q2/)
What does s/h mean? Also what does treatment consist of? I feel like I might have this but do a pretty ok job at hiding it so I'm nervous about asking for help.|s/h means self harm. so hurting yourself on purpose. I havent found much that can help, but I've noticed that an increase of my ADHD meds (a stimulant) causes me to be more anxious, and unaware that I'm picking. On a day to day basis the best thing I've found is just holding something in my hand like a squishie or another stim toy, and avoid looking at pimples or anything like that on others. Honestly, if if you can being it up with your doctor and if needed, without your parents|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frfgld3/)
It's also known as tweeking.  I didn't know that non-metheads did that stuff.  It's got to be miserable.  My ex's family has a few dope addicts and I've seen them dig big ass holes in their faces "working on a pimple".|oh damn, I didnt even know that was an effect of that.  Honestly, from so many years of it, unless I really dig a bad one (a scab)then I usually am numb to the pain. but the visual effects are for sure really noticeable|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frexrpg/)
What kind of medication do you take?  That sounds a lot like what my husband does .. he constantly picks at the back of his head, and it got infected bad one time and had to have it drained.   He doesn't even know he is doing it half the time.|For adhd to help my focus, i take concerta and for depression, prozac. Yea, a common occurence from it is that you dont usually notice when you are picking then suddenly theres blood everywhere. It does sound a bit like that, and im sorry he had to go through that!! Ive only had minor infections, nothing thats sent me to the hospital or anything.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frexsak/)
What spot on your body do you visit the most?|either my face or arms. most of my worst scars are on my arms, from having such easy access for so many years. I wear t-shirts often so its hard to resist there|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf28nk/)
Whatâ€™s your favorite thing to pick at?|scabs!! bug bites in the summer especially. although its incredibly pleasing, i hate picking pimples. anythig shaped like a bubble gets me riled up to do it really|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf31lf/)
How do people react to seeing you?|people stare. alot. especially little kids. it doesnt help that i also have dyed hair and usualky stand out in a crowd, but ive gotten used to people just awkwardly noticing all the redness|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf63pi/)
If you start ADHD meds avoid amphetamines both me and my friends have found it can make you pick and scratch|yeah, I have found that having a high dose of my old stimulant heightened alot of my problems, including the scratching and stuff|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frfsyu4/)
I have this but with my nails and the skin around them. I chew and pick my fingers and toes. For some reason this kind isn't considered as serious because "oh yeah I'm a nail biter too."  It's gotten so bad that my dentist a couple years go said the dentine is wearing down on my teeth, and that's hard to restore, and that I needed to stop. The picking of my skin has led to scarring that I was told may be permanent.  I'm getting scared I'm ruining myself for good and I don't know what to do. I've had a lot of success with antidepressants quelling some that compulsive behavior, but that's it. I have ADHD as well and I take medication for it, but that hasn't really made a difference.  Have you found any success in any treatment?|unfortunately, no. this is also a symptom of mine but with picking the skin with my nails, not teeth. Yeah a big stresser for me is the fact that so much of the scars are permanent. I really feel you on that one. Unfortunately the only thing I've found that helps is having toys (like stim toys, squishes etc)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frg7zg3/)
Do you perhaps like to dabble in the methamphetamines?|No, I havent taken any drugs like that. heard that it was a factor for some other people though, which I can see. as far as I can remember I've had it for a long while, furthest memory is destroying a mosquito bite when I was 8|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frghjnk/)
Oh my God how much worse is it quarantine? My skin is badd|it's so terrible!! at least when I was in school I had distractions, being bored is the worst part of it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frgw2k3/)
