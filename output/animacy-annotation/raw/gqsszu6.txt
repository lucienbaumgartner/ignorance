What else did they know about her? What else was relevant? Why was she in the street at 3am sleeping?

It's a combination of all the circumstances, and at multiple levels her gender plays a role. Your assertion that men are disproportionately violently attacked is a complete non sequitur as it doesn't apply to her situation, and furthermore, doesnt help, meaning what you say simply has zero utility. 

Your insinuation that her attackers were correct that she was lucky to be a girl because she would be more likely to be beaten up, when she was already beaten up far worse than the vast majority of men and women ever are in their lives, is really, morally repugnant, and ignorant of the multitude of factors that put her in that situation and made her attackers feel validated. 

Their motives are IRRELEVANT. The realities are what they are.

Facts tell a story. The story you tell is she is lucky. And I should take *you* seriously? Please.
