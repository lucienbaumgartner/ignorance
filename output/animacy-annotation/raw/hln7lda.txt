Not sure who said "Don't look like food if you don't want to be eaten".

He was an easy target because he's a foreigner (i.e. rich), skinny, alone and unaware of his surroundings. He was probably monitored first before getting mugged. They wanted his backpack as these are notorious targets for muggers because of all the stuff he mentioned: laptop, tablet, extra phone, charger, etc

Passports and cash should be kept in an internal hidden pocket that's hard to detect and access. What was he thinking?

I can't believe he said that he hopes Lebanon has a US embassy. First of all, that's condescending. Second, he should've memorized the address and phone number of the US embassy before even boarding a plane to a third world country!
