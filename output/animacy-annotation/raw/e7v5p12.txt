As long as stealing/scamming is more profitable than actually getting a proper job, people will keep doing it. There's so many tourist that are so naive and unaware that it's simply too easy for them. Last year in Madrid I saw 2 guys trying to pickpocket someone who had his wallet in his backpocket of his jeans. I shoved them aside and told them to fuck off. They didn't even raise a word, they simply left. I started looking around for police, but sadly non around.  

  

Also in the video you can see the pickpocket of the petition scam walk right after her looking straight into the camera.
