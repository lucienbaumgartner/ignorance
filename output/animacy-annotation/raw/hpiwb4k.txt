Yeah, well here's a hard truth for you. Universal Abolitionism was a weird fringe belief that originated in Britain. Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, Native nayltions in the Americas - sexual slavery was incredibly widespread in indigenous North America - all thought slavery was great. They just didn't personally want to be slaves.

The idea however imperfect that there should be universal human rights? The new United States was ahead of almost everyone at the time.

Your smug presenting is ignorant and stupid
