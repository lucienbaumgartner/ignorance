Ben Simmons is in a toxic work environment with a boss and teammates who publicly belittle him and have undermined his confidence.  If you don’t want to believe he’s mentally hurting because you assume he’s faking it then that’s your opinion and speculation alone.  For all we know, he could’ve been too ashamed or embarrassed to mention his issues at first and maybe his back was actually hurt too. You can’t definitely say he’s faking it or not. 

Finally just because demar derozan or kevin love can play with mental health issues doesn’t mean that every player can. Depression or anxiety can obviously impact people differently so it’s really just ignorant and stupid for you to say ben should just go out there and play when he’s already said that he doesn’t feel like he can at the moment.
