Seen it against black Arubans by other Arubans but kinda subtle- but not to those who were the target, and like anywhere itâ€™s pretty stratified economically. Go to Sint Nicolas and see where the poor and black people live. Dutch are typically pretty ignorant and racist nation. South Africa, Northern Ireland. No surprises.
