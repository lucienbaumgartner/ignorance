1. That’s awfully easy to say if you have the privilege of not being affected by such a blantantly racist policy. 

2. If a candidate is so socially unaware and generally conservative on that issue, that’s likely indicative that they aren’t progressive enough on a lot of other social issues and are not a good representation of where the Democratic Party should be if it wants to have any credence to being the party that actually gives a shit about people (esp minorities)
