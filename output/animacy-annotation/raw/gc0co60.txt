I wonder if people are forgetting this, but in the databook, it's stated Dabi's and Twice's relationship to be that of brotherhood, which implies Dabi's soft spot for Twice.
 
Now this isn't something apparent in the manga since Dabi has little interaction with the league, but I can't dismiss and say he didn't care about Twice's death at all. I think that Hawks betrayal to Twice really did resonate with him in some way. He says it himself that it's "not his fault" for causing the mansion to get sieged and remarks how scummy heroes are. He even says how "messed up" Hawks' standards are and denies Twice's life as "unlucky" because Twice had obviously enjoyed his time in the league since they openly accepted him. I do not think Dabi is this incompetent and unaware of what goes in the League. 

In a way, you could argue that him utilizing Hawks actions was to spur revenge on him for he did to Twice, since before Twice died, he said for Hawks to "die" and here, Hawks has metaphorically died since his quirk may have been lost, and his reputation is now also crumbling away slowly. We learn here and in this chapter, just how seriously Dabi takes his *sense* of justice.
