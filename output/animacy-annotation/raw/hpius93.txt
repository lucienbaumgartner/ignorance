I've heard people say 'its just a hoax, by media, to gain attention' while each family has someone who got severely affected or even dead, but still, people are dumb enough to call covid fake. Here, in India, we've seen the worst, I seriously doubt our generation will see a time so tough again. It was apocalyptic, burial and cremation grounds fell short. It's estimated that 5 million people died. Literally, families have been wiped out. Many children have lost both of their parents. Literally everyone I know, had COVID or had someone in their family with COVID, and that too without any exception!!. It's really insensitive and ignorant of people to underestimate and deny it's danger
