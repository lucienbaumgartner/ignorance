Luckily I made the switch to higher ed so that I wouldn't have to deal with entitled parents, or districts that take advantage of educators. I've been remote this entire year NOT because it's easier (it is in fact far more difficult) but because higher education as a whole decided that remote learning was far safer for all involved, faculty, staff, and students. 


For the hybrid classes we do offer, the level of protocols in place to have a safe environment is VERY cumbersome. Did you know you're only supposed to have people in a space for 90 minutes tops before you take 30 minutes to air out the space? That the level of occupancy for safety is actually far below what is being allowed in K-12 schools? That the cleaning requirements for a space are incredibly involved and require sweeping a space multiple times during a school day, and any time you turn over a classroom?


NONE of this is happening in K-12 because they don't have the funds, and the districts won't require it because they are receiving pressure from the state and parents to reopen. 


Again, as others have told you, you are uninformed and ignorant of the dangers of being crammed into a small room with 30 children for an entire day.
