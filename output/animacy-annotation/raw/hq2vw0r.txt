Iâ€™m not really gonna give much advice because seems like folks have pretty much covered it. 
Just came to say this is such a helpful and empathetic comment. Most of them seem to be, really. I love our lil community. 
Some people reallllly donâ€™t understand mania and will be like â€˜well justâ€¦.donâ€™t do itâ€™ which is just an ignorant and dismissive af thing to say. So itâ€™s cool folks are being so understanding and helpful. 


And OPâ€”I feel you on the mania. Itâ€™s super hard and/or impossible to control sometimes and of course we always face the consequences when we come back down, so I second everything feelsickbesick said. 


The inkless pokes are a *great* idea that Iâ€™ve never heard or thought of! 


When Iâ€™m manic Iâ€™ll do a tat just to try to make myself feel in control of something and/or because I donâ€™t give a shit about the consequences (which is actually how I initially got into s&amp;p in the first place haha, for better or worse). Sounds like youâ€™re maybe the same way, yeah?


So, what I ended up doing was getting alllllll the proper supplies asap (I think you said you did get them, but just in case: gloves, tat needles, tat ink, ink cups, green soap/any unscented gentle soap, distilled water, squeeze bottle, hustle butter/some kind of balm, transfer paper, transfer cream or gelâ€”itâ€™s certainly an investment but worth it). 
That way, the next time I was manic (since thatâ€™s inevitable) and wanted to do a tat RIGHT NOW then I already had everything I needed on hand to do it safely and didnâ€™t have to wait, since thatâ€™s damn near impossible in a manic state. 


Iâ€™m sure I repeated stuff others have said, but just wanted to say I empathize with ya and if you follow the advice folks gave, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get great. ðŸ’œ
