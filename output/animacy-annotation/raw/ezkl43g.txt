Again, another article mentioning some special offended group that nobody has actually seen or heard from about this special. The problem was that it sucked for a comedian who’s done such great work in the past. He even makes the same tired “I identify as crazy thing x ha ha” joke that every hack comedian has ever made, and everybody expects far more than that from a comedian like Dave Chapelle. That’s not even mentioning how harmful and ignorant that joke even is and whether it’s supposed to be “ironic” or not it marginalizes and in some situations can actively lead to harm for an entire group of people.
