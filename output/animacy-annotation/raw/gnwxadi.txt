(Well if that is a power of your character, it may not be. But some attacks have special effects other than what is presented. For instance, if say a bullet had the power to damage all forms of matter, solid or not, then it could damage a more gaseous form. Maybe a bit less than if it were solid, but still cause some damage. But if a bullet had the power to, say, damage the very soul of a being, then it will 100% damage them. If you're constantly playing to be one step ahead of an enemy at all times, then that seems a bit unfair and ignorant of the laws of other worlds. Speaking of which, I assume that your character was hit by such a bullet.)
