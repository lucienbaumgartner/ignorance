You have a point, but I think he's really just immature and ignorant. That doesn't necessarily give him an excuse, but I don't think he's really even capable of thinking about these things maturely and rationally.

I don't follow him, but what little I've seen, even next to other kid-oriented streamers like jacksepticeye, or in interviews where he's not putting on the streamer role, Felix always comes across as someone mentally way below his age.
