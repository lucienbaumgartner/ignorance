You’re giving the Islamic account of what the Kaaba was which isn’t the truth. It was a pagan site where more than one god is worshipped and Islam usurped it and incorporated it into ifs religion to gain followers. Same thing by making Jerusalem important it help convert the people tho easier by keeping that site holy to them. It’s politics and mind games. It’s fairly pathetic and ignorant of you to really believe it was still being god worshipped there when it’s clear proof that the civilizations all over the area were idol worshippers and worshipping more than one god. Bum ass
