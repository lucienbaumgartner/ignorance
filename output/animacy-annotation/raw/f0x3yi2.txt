Have him respond (and it can’t be you). 

“Mother,  I wasn’t ignoring you.  But since you cannot respect my marriage and my partner THIS is me officially putting you in time out. as soon as I hang up this phone THEN I’m ignoring you!  So get your act together or you’ll be ignored when MY child will be born too!”  

Personally I’ve always hated when people say things like “is op controlling you”. I’ve always dreamt my husband would respond with things like 

“ did you really raise me as so small minded and ignorant that I could let another person control me?  Like your question for example : is op controlling me?  When really that question should say : is op controlling you better than I am?.  That would be more appropriate.  You’re upset you didn’t get your way and instead of being an adult about it you insult my intelligence and assume a person/woman can control me against my will. “
