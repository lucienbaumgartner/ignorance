&gt;But to say that all unwanted pregnancies are 100% on the man's shoulders feels fucking slimy and ignorant of the human reality to me.


The article isn't arguing this. It is saying that 100% of the pregnancies are caused by men ejaculating irresponsibly. Which is true. That sentence does not mean women are not involved or that women don't own our bodies. Acknowledging the reality that men are responsible does not mean women have no right over their own body. 

You seem to be disagreeing because you do not understand the articles point. It's a common logic error. 100% of x are responsible does not mean only x are responsible. 100% of eggs are round. Eggs are not the only round thing. 

100% of slaps to the face are caused by the person with the slapping hand. If we want to stop slapping we cannot only focus on slapees. We should also focus on the slappers who are doing the action, instead of exclusively blaming, targeting, and punishing the people being slapped. Slaps are caused by those who slap, and that statement does not contradict the fact that consensual slaps also involve the consent of the slapee. Women always bear the responsibilities of an unwanted pregnancy, men rarely do, so why is the law focused on only punishing women?


I would add that if a woman gets pregnant without intending to, the vast majority of burdens will fall on her. It sucks but it is self inflicted, not inflicted onto someone else. A cis man causes pregnancies for someone else. So if you want to discourage that behavior you can't ignore the men causing the problem for others, in order to exklusively punish the ones who the problem is being inflicted on and who  carry the burden.
