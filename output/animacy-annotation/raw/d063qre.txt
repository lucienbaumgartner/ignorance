The dev's are taking the long term approach towards the game; by fixing it internally (restructuring the engine. renderer, etc.) It just gets so much flak because people are impatient and unaware that a quality game takes time. The reason why I believe in DayZ and it's developers is because they're consistent and committed to delivering the game everybody wants, themselves included. While they may lose a huge proportion of there user base for doing so, which they have, it will still pay off in the end. All you cry baby haters will be back on DayZ's doorstep six months to a year from now sucking the dev's dicks for having created such an awesome game... Too many people are close minded in this world -- truly unfortunate but you'll learn the hard way in life.

Edit: And yeah I'm generally an asshole
