He does like her. I'm not bitter now jealous, but I can easily tell when something that I'm not "supposed to worry about" is indeed something to worry about. I don't want to stop him from talking to people, I just don't want someone who's supposed to be my bf, flirting with, and jerking off to pictures of our coworkers. We both work there and everyone knows we're together, so it's super awkward. The person that told me that really tried to tell me i was being ignorant, and dumb for making this a big issue. He basically said all men are like this, and that I need to suck it up, or I'll never be happy. Now I know, he's crazy.
