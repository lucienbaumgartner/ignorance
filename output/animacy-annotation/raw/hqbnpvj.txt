You know what’s great about Reddit is you can be whoever you want to be if you take a old scathed up account that no one wanted. Smart people who don’t want the public to know anything about them do this. No social platforms whatsoever.

On another note- You choose to be that guy who wants to argue with everyone and call people names. You assume too much and I’m certain it will get you into some trouble you can’t type your way out of one day babe. 

Maybe stop while you’re ahead? I mean just look at your history? Showing off weed, arguing with others calling them fat, ignorant, and dumb? You’re better than this, I know it, you can change, you can have a new year ahead, turn a new leaf, get outside, into the gym, less games, more exercise. 

Like I said. PM me and we will get you on a strict diet and workout regimen. You can do this babe
