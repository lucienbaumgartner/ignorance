Two questions/comments:
1)  you should sue your home inspector for not flagging this issue prior to formal sale. Either they're ignorant and willfully incompetent or both. Borderline criminal negligence. 

2)  how much did the "professional" whack you for the final repair bill?  ... which I might seriously to legally recoup from home inspection company...
