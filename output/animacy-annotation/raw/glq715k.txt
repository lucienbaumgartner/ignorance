LOL, if you honestly think those WW1-esque tanks can even hold a candle to an M1 Abrams, you're even more hopeless and ignorant of our modern capabilities than I thought. 

Our tanks far exceed their own in capabilities of Range, Piercing Capability, Speed, and general maneuverability and mobility. Those tanks are mounted on rails, any tank can easily pick them off from a few miles away while the latter is struggling to even pinpoint the location of the one destroying them.
