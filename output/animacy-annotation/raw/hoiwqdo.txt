To be fair, it’s because women are the underdogs. Even 100 years ago it was VERY atypical for women to have a source of income or wealth. In the U.S., anyways, money is what defines you and makes you a person. 

Women are at such a disadvantage in this sector - I work an 8-5 like my Dad before me, and his Dad, and his Dad - there is a legacy of messaging to me, experience passed on to me, and priorities passed on to me from the male counterparts in my family. At an early age I realized being financially sustainable is something I MUST attain, and my make family gave me a roadmap on how to do it (not to mention messaging from society communicating that I must do it, and how). 

Now enter women. They want a piece of that pie but have no roadmap on how to do it, relative to men. Some men actively want to stop them, no less. The only hard currency for women say, 200 years ago was their body for sex and child-rearing and their works of service (typically around the house as no job). It’s not easy to climb out of that hole (esp while still preserving those “currencies” at the same time) - there is no good blueprint on how to do it. What the modern feminist movement has arrived at isn’t perfect. But certainly it’s not surprising that it remains totally ignorant of men - women don’t want to attain “flight” working together with cooperation of men - they want to do it “men be damned”. Unfortunate, but that’s what the thousands of years of the man/woman paradigm has produced - both men and women completely petulant and ignorant of each other’s reality, playing a game of tug-of-war
