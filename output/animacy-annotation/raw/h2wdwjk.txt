This is horrific. How would you be expected to help an autistic brother....when you're 5? Let alone, *no matter how old you are?*  I can't imagine the confusion, the guilt, the fear you felt....all unnecessary and NOT your fault. My queen/waif (mostly waif) mom treated my brother like shit, ignored him when depressed, dismissed my warnings that he seemed suicidal...and then he killed himself. But then my mom started twisting the story. The implication was that I was selfish and unaware of my brother's issues because I had moved away and was off living a 'good life due to their sacrifices.'  My mom was 'tirelessly' tending to my brother and left with this sadness, while I was off oblivious to all they were going thru. It was infuriating. Everyone believed my mom. The reality was, she didn't care for him, and took no accountability for parenting him.
