Saying Lukaku is dumb and unaware of position is weird, and frankly it comes off a tad racist. I'll admit I didn't watch every single minute of their season, but I have seen enough to see how good he was. 

Lukaku was killing it in the World Cup mate, those are big games. Didn't he score against Juventus, AC Milan, Lazio, Napoli, and Roma this season? The only top 7 team he didn't score against was Atalanta AFAIK.
