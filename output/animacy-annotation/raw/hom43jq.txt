What we want is unaware and dazed "the walking dead" zombies that are , slow, have trouble with stairs and just want to nibble on you a bit. What we will get are the pissed off and focused in their hate "28 days later" and "world War Z" zombies that run, jump, climb and want tear you to shreds. Two totally different worlds right there.
