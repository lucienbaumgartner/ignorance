You're making your life difficult for no reason. You do not own the restaurant thus you not "selling" pork. You have no control over what products it sells. 

As for other "meats" this is irrelevant. There's nothing wrong with selling meat by non-muslims to non-muslims.

As convert of over 20 years you are example why you need to study within madhab as DIY Islam does not work. Many people of my generation learned Islam by books and videos online and years later we learned we were deficient and ignorant of our deen and made our life more difficult than it should be. We all , in one way or another, had start all over and actually learn Islam from the beginning.

As new convert your primary focus for the first six months is tawheed, taharah and Salah. All other issues like the one you are bothered are inconsequential to you. As new convert you have dispensations and allowances for most things since those issues are minor to major events learning a live in a new way.


My advice do not take fatwa from people who do not deal with converts and do not live within your nation. Taking fatwa from someone in Pakstan or Saudi is dangerous since most have never left their country and do not know what harm their fatwa can cause. 


&gt;Anyone familiar with our history knows that debating over conflicting foreign based rulings has caused more harm than benefit over the last 50 ears. Especially since 90% of the time, the scholars who issue rulings from abroad directed at Americans, sometimes specifically at Black American Muslims, are not present to respond to questions, or to receive additional information, or to explain their often confusing verbiage or to verify whether the translations of their rulings into English are even accurate.
