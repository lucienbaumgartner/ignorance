&gt;large amounts of knowledge was lost to what degree we will never know.

To a great extent we do know how much was lost, which makes everything so much worse. We know exactly how many lost works of famous Greek philosophers there are because they were references in the works we found have left. Thankfully all the best stuff did make it through the ages, even if only by allusion from other texts, so we have a good idea of the philosophical framework of the classical world. I'd still suspect that a world like fenris would absolutely maintain myths and legends which would be corrupted versions of actual earth history. 

I suspect the reason why debris is so unrealistically backwards and unaware of human history has more to do with the dificulty of building a believable mythic history of the dark age of technology than anything else. Building such a mythic history would require having an actual history of the age of technology and the machine rebellion to mythologies, similar to the Eldar's mythic history of the "gods" and the fall of their civilization.
