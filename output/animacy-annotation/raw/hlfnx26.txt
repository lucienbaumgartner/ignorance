I went in watching that whole trial with the assumption he was kinda hoping to run into trouble as an excuse to exact some kind of revenge. But very quickly, it became obvious he is a very good person and was doing nothing but good. He tried his best to not get physical. 100% if he acted passive he would have been killed, for what? Being a responsible upstanding member of society. His very existence there, was a judgment on all these pathetic losers, who are so deluded and ignorant of the world, they will blame anyone but themselves. And to the dude who lived and lied.. maybe donâ€™t run at someone with a gun and try to kill them after repeatedly saying you are going to kill him. Shame it was only his limp bicep that got obliterated.
