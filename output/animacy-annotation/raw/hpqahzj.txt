Thanks! I try to make sure to supply context for all my theories. Though I will be the first to admit that I have other theories that even with context and quotes straight up offend some readers with how they hint at characters motives in book three.

This theory is pretty safe from that kind of bias since its not that shocking for readers to see Kvothe as ignorant and foolish in a logically mappable way. This same non-sequitur logic can be applied to a bevy of Kvothe's actions in the books but a lot of those are still up in the air in a lot of cases.

Ambrose and the Candle, Assuming Devi is behind the maleficence, and blindly getting an illegal flatbow to make his bloodless, are some clear cut non-sequitor fumbles by Kvothe where he fails to take in all the pertinent details. 

Where it really gets spicy and is guaranteed to earn me push back from readers is trying to apply this same level of logical scrutiny to other deep held beliefs of Kvothe like Did Ambrose really hire those thugs, was Caudicus actually poisoning the Maer, and the biggest of all... Did the Chandrian really kill his troupe. I don't have these answers... but the textual evidence we have points to Kvothe being shit at deduction when it comes to these kinds of assumptions turned belief.
