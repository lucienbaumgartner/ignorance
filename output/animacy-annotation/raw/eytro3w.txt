I had a similarly frustrating argument once with a guy I was dating.  

It was about voter intelligence testing.  He thought he had come up with the idea himself, but there’s actually a long history there - voter “intelligence” testing  was used in the south the American south during the Jim Crow period to systematically prevent black people from voting – the various state governments just made sure that the questions were cultural-knowledge -type questions that white people would be far more likely to answer correctly.

I patiently explained that this was a compelling illustration of why voter intelligence testing is not a good idea - it gives the ruling party a lot of power to shape the test so as to selectively suppress certain votes.

He continued to insist that it was a good idea, until eventually, I became personally convinced that he was so stupid and ignorant that if a truly objective voter intelligence test was even possible, he would fail it.

I broke up with him a few days later, after a very long relationship.  That discussion was the final straw.

Two additional points:

Punching walls is not a healthy communication method.  You should really work on that, both for the sake of your hands (I can’t imagine that that kind of trauma is good for them, in the long term), and your future relationships.

Also – the head of state of Myanmar (Burma) is not a dictator; she (not he, btw) was elected, and enjoys wide popular support in the country, from what I understand.  

Whenever something awful happens, we tend to assume that it’s a dictator, but elected leaders can also be party to crimes against humanity.
