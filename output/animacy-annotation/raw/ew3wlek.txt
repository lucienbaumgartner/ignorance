I am sure that Obama does seem like a good guy to the dumb and ignorant. That is a round-about way of getting to the problem, to wit: the Dem electorate is made up of dumb, ignorant people. They are the ones who seemingly have never heard of any Obama scandal and the ones who believe Putin installed Trump. This is a hard group to connect with because they are immune from logic. 

BTW, your attempt at an argument would carry more weight if Obama was running against Trump. If racism was at work, then why not sell out the country to have Mitt Romney installed? 

You will try to respond, and you will trip over all the inferences you make, taking you farther and farther away from fact and reality, and to the point of utter worthlessness. But, hey, go ahead.
