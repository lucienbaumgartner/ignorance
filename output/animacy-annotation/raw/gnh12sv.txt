Your comment is beyond naive and ignorant of the true root of problem. You're arguing that women are somehow hardwired to avoid engineering when you said so yourself that India has much higher rates of women in engineering. Do Indian women biologically prefer engineering? It can't possibly be because Indian women care more about financial success because a [whopping 40% of female engineers in India are unemployed](https://www.businessinsider.in/a-whopping-40-of-indias-women-engineers-dont-have-jobs-because-of-rampant-sexism-at-workplace/articleshow/67486684.cms) due to India's much more severe sexism. Perhaps there's many more factors at play than just whatever bullshit theory you make up that sounds somewhat plausible. 

The fact that there's [an entire series of wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_engineering) dedicated to sexism and stereotypes directed towards women in engineering should show that *this is a very real and serious issue.*

Do some reading before you share your edgy eugenics theory that women biologically don't belong in engineering. It's dipshits like you that's the reason many women don't feel comfortable getting into engineering. 

For the record, I'm a man who works in engineering.
