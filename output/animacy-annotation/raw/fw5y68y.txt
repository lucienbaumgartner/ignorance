I think it's also important to consider that in a video she made a few years ago now that was her reacting to her old videos, you could see in her reactions, and she explicitly stated, that her old videos were no longer her style, not did they reflect her personality or who she was as a person anymore nor her views, and she genuinely felt great discomfort in watching them. 
She even addressed (I don't remember if it was in that video or another one) that she (and tbh society as a whole at that time) was unaware and unknowingly non-inclusive to non-binary and GNC folks. 
I sincerely believe that she couldn't have gone back and filtered through her own videos to even rewatch and reassess their content to even be aware of certain words or sentiments she used and expressed that maybe could have been more harmful and she otherwise would have archived out of her own volition. 
Further, she has previously used past mistakes as an opportunity to educate others and using her platform in the most positive way fucking possible. 

(I may come back to edit this later because there was another thought I wanted to add that has now escaped me)
