Lol imagine being so insecure and ignorant that you say shit like this. And no, I’m not talking about communism in the slightest you ignorant fuck I’m talking about socialistic values and policies, a lot of which in some ways are already enacted in our country. If you understood even the basics of the two you would understand that. Also what the fuck do you mean the universal income hasn’t been proven? 

Here is a nice write up of the programs that have been tried, you know what the one consistency is when it comes to the only negative that is discussed? It’s right wing politicians bitching about the cost. Isn’t that funny, so concerned about the little guys tax dollars when the tax dollars are going back to the little guy but not when the money is going into the pockets of ceos and their fellow corrupt politicians. 

And lastly, immigrants, let’s discuss these people. First off, I could care less if these people broke a law to get here, I really don’t, we see people break the law with certain justifications every day and we just kind of shrug our shoulders and keep going, I think that 9/10 of these people have some pretty great justifications for uprooting their family and taking a thousand mile journey in the hope that there may be food and shelter and no drug cartels at the end of it. 

I would highly advise you to look through your own families record because of course if your family came here illegally I don’t think we want them or their progeny here because they may have broken the law to get here in the first place. 

You should really read up on that big greenish metal woman they have up in New York, I think you would be shocked at what she has to say about immigration and people like you.
