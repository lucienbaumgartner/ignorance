Violent protests and/or rioting of any kind is obviously undesirable.

However, there's a huge difference between protesting over civil rights issues and causing damage to private property and literally storming the legislative body of the most powerful country in the world.  That has literally never been done before, and the US flag over the Capitol was lowered and replaced with Trump's flag while the Confederate flag was, for the first time, brought into the halls.

To say that these two things are the same is disingenuous and ignorant of the historical and philosophical significance of yesterday's events.
