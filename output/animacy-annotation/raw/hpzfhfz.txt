Waaaaaay back in the day, I was working as a home visiting case manager..  I parked on my client's block and put my off-brand Club across my steering wheel but didn't lock it into place. Apparently, my momo Club slipped and set the horn blaring while I was at my client's house.  I heard jt and I even thought - damn, that's ignorant and annoying.  Imagine my shame and embarrassment when I left about 45 minutes later and  realized it was MY car.  The icing on top of the cake was I had gotten a ticket for it too.  I don't remember what the charge was but I think it was about $50.
