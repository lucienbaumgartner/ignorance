Had this discussion with a friend recently. I likened it (for me) to being a kid trapped in an adult body. Sense of adventure, excitement, sometimes I felt like I was 7, sometimes 17, just genuinely carefree and unaware of responsibilities or societal expectations. If included sex ok, if it didn’t ok, but being together was somehow like going back to childhood and living life in its’ purest, natural form. Weird, I dunno. Chemistry is different things for different people.
