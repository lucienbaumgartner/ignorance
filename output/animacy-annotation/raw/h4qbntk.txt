To say feminists patiently waited for voting rights is absurd and ignorant of history. Feminists invented the use of the hunger strike and, although occurring in Great Britain, one committed suicide by throwing herself into the path of the Kingâ€™s Horse at a horse race as a political statement. 

The point is that feminists were as hardcore as they get and every action they took was a necessary bold move to establish equal rights.
