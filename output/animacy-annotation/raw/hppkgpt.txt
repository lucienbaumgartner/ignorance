Do you actually have any idea how many Russian peasants and workers died due to sheer negligence under the autocracy of Nicholas? How much social reform was denied out of hand, radicalizing the underrepresented millions until the revolutionary rhetoric of Lenin was mainstream? How about the despicable anti-Semitism, the persecution of ethnic minorities, done with the tsar's explicit approval by his governors? His regime's violent disregard for the well being of it's citizens is what made revolution an inevitability, and what made the victory of the ultra violent Bolsheviks in that free for all basically a guarantee. Nicholas was both indecisive, and stubborn. Ignorant, and unwilling to be convinced. Out of touch to the greatest extent imaginable, and it killed millions.
