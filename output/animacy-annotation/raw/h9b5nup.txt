Long post because this is actually a conversation. Right on. Thanks for being open to new ideas/information, your first comment was intense enough that I thought this wouldn’t be a conversation. Pleasant surprise.

So let’s talk about this one. You’re correct of course, they aren’t prescription drugs. But almost everyone gets drunk at least once, and folks like me with a severe genetic component immediately trigger that sector of the brain. I was young and ignorant of my own genetics, tried a beer at a party and immediately could not stop. I got sober at 21.

For cigarettes, the primary driver for young people at this point is really poor mental health and no health care. If you have crippling clinical anxiety and can’t get treated, nicotine will genuinely help you function better, at least for a time.

Think about the last instance there. You have severe clinical anxiety that stops you from living a normal life, you can’t get treated, finally you break and smoke and it fixes it. Now you have a choice between being unhealthy in the long run and not being able to live your life at all. Which would you choose? I’m dead serious regarding how severe clinical anxiety is, I’m treated for it.

For non-genetic alcoholism (it’s actually more rare than genetic-based, albeit from my ~200 person sample size), severe trauma. Always severe trauma. 

On that end, when you’ve been so psychologically broken for so long with no relief, you have a few drinks and for the first time you feel safe, comfortable, and a little happy even. The relief is indescribable. In recovery programs, alcohol is formally described as an initial “solution” for developing alcoholics, the thing that worked when nothing else did.
