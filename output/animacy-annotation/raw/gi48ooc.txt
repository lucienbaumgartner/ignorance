I feel ya. We are deadening ourselves and our senses. It hurts to look around and find gazes turned downward, a complete metaphor for being asleep and unaware of the world around us. We perpetuate it as well; September 1st Apple Day, ooohhhh boy i can't wait! More like a technological Klonopin if you ask me. And it's been cast into every fabric of society where you simply cannot excel or 'be' if you're not with the newest tech. 

And that online digging that seems to be all the craze. It's just a different form of social communism. And professional, in your example. 

My friend was turned down for a police position in 2008 because his facebook had a few pictures of him with alcohol. He deleted it. Reapplied a year later... no problems. Got the job. I ditched FB soon after. The AOL incognito chatroom days were long gone. Your online profile is YOU now, by societys' standards. But we all know it's not.. it's your projection of yourself. It's no good, it's not real, and it's only getting not real-er with deep fake bullshit.

Anyway. Cheers ya pig
