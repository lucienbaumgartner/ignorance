&gt;The point is that Westeros is unprepared and unaware of the threat from the East.

Why would they be unprepared or unaware. The King (Varys) would have spies all over Essos and many lords conduct trade with the Free Cities. Surely they would be aware that a large horde of horselords had come to town and were asking about ships.

&gt;The Dothraki sea is the way it is, because they destroyed cities and towns out there.

All of them from the Century of Blood. We haven't heard of them being destroyed recently which would make sense if my theory is true and the Dothraki have regressed since the Century of Blood.

Also my problem with Sarnor and how they were destroyed is that for the most part they do seem to have stone walls, so how did the Dothraki get inside. I'm sure that they can somewhat maintain a siege or just keep the surrounding areas bare of any food, but the text specifically says that they got inside, torched and destroyed the cities and took many many slaves, and I'm just wondering how.
