Civil war is what they want. It's what they've been pining for for the last decade. The far right want an excuse to use the guns they cling to on those they see as threats to their (white) country. They want an excuse to kill the "other" without a trial, and be cheered for it. They want retribution for the loss of the original civil war. They want people scared, ignorant, and unaware of what is happening when power is in their hands. If Hitler had this type of disinformation at his disposal, Germany would have fallen to the Nazis much quicker; we are in very scary territory: any person who studied history knows exactly where we are, and those who haven't are cheering it on.
