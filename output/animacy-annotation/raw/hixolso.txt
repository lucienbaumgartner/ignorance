This is why it is dangerous to an executive who isn't good at navigating foreign affairs.  The public is too immediately self interested to care and in most instances not intelligent enough to understand long term effects.  

Saying we should just "get out of Afghanistan" is the left wing version of "just nuke the whole place" that you hear on the right.  Equally idiotic and ignorant of the larger geopolitical realities.
