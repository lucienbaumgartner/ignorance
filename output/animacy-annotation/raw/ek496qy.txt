Simply put, the best place to draw the line is wherever you think it should be. If you’re ok with the initial comments, but don’t want them to come back and keep talking about it then tell them that. Some people are actively just trying to take viewers, and some people are just oblivious and ignorant that they’re doing something rude. Remember - at the end of the day it is **your** channel and you get to decide what is allowed, and how to handle the rules being broken. You should feel “safe” and secure in your own stream, so handle viewers (both good and bad) as you see for to make it that way. If this isn’t enjoyable for you, then what’s the point?
