Go whine about seat belt laws or the fact that everyone has to stop at traffic lights. It would be a better argument.

The fact is society requires us to do certain things. It has *always* required of us certain things. Whining about them just makes you look petulant and unaware of history and reality. Whining about them while people continue to die makes you look like a ghoul. 

“BuT mUh FrEeDoM!!!” ceases to have any moral authority when people are dying and being debilitated for life.
