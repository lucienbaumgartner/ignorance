I’m not sure if they *should*, but I think they *will*. They pulled the trigger (pun intended) on removing Jamar and then Kyle pretty much only because of fan pressure. That fan pressure is always going to surround him now, and it’s already become more of a liability for them as a functioning business with several big name sponsors to have someone that will bring negative PR to the show. Plus it’s probably better for the guy to leave because if he does go into the house, even if he’s the nicest most pleasant person in the world, he’s gonna get completely slandered no matter what, so both he and the show should just cut their losses. And I’m sure they have alternates because these shows always do, AND he doesn’t even seem like that big of a super fan so it’s not like it’s a dream cut short for him. He seemed very much one dimensional and unaware of what he was getting into anyway, from the limited videos we saw.
