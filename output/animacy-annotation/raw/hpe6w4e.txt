My weight fluctuated a ton. It normally does because I’ve always gone through episodes of unhealthy eating habits (sometimes I’d eat too much, sometimes too little.)  After I confronted him about his porn use, I felt more comfortable and gained some weight. But things changed when I realized he wasn’t completely sober (which at that point I was very naive and unaware of what the process of porn addiction was really like.) When this devastation hit me, I went from 145 lbs to 125 lbs in 5 weeks. I ate NOTHING. It was terrible. I gained that weight back when I went back to using food to cope. For a while I weighed more than I knew was healthy for my body.  Overtime as things changed, I arrived at a good weight that has been mostly stable. But I did find relief in excessive eating especially because I lost all hope in him appreciating my body. I thought he wouldn’t ever love my body as much as he loved those women online, so why even try.
