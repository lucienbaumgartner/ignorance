Do you want to answer my question first? You clearly didn't read the link I sent.

I too have never accidentally got anyone pregnant, but I'm not so closed minded and ignorant that I think it never happens. As I said, contraception is not perfect, and "pulling out", whilst reducing the chances, is not infallible either. It's basic science my dude.

Eh, who am I kidding, you're in your own little precious, ignorant bubble. Not amount of scientifically proven fact is ever going to sway you from your anecdotal 'evidence'.
