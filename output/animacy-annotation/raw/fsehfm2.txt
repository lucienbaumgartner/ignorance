Your logic is faulty at best and incomprehensibly unaware and unable for a to empathize with people's frustrations.  Buildings and goods don't mean a damn thing as they are insured and quickly repaired . Rioting is happening in other cities and states because the crimes committed by police have happened there too and if not, those states are a part of our crumbling "democracy ", its America as a whole in solidarity (since we're not compromised of autonomous states) because what happens in our nation affects all Americans , quite obviously, it has you incensed, albeit at the wrong aspects but you are feeling something for your country .
