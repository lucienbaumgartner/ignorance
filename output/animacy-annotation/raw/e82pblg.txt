When her mom just kept going and going while Chloe sat there crying I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. At no point did she stop and think, "I'm upsetting my daughter, I need to stop. I shouldn't be upsetting her right now over something small like a car ride."

That woman is so unaware and so stuck on what SHE wants Chloe to do that she can't see anything else.
