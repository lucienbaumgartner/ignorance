Why do both sides always think it's the uninformed and ignorant that votes the other?  Democrats say it's the rural uneducated, ignorant dumb red necks, conservatives say it's ignorant, uniformed brainwashed ghettos and cities.  Can't we agree that people who have different views aren't necessarily ignorant or uneducated, they are just different?
