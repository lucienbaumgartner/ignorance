Yes..100% jealousy/  We are SO jealous!

I can only dream of living in a crappy apartment in Tampa....to wake up next to a vile woman who is physically bigger than me.   Wow...that would be so great!

And..I obviously wish I had no mode of transportation other than Uber....having multiple cars is such a drag.  I have to get insurance and remember to update the tags...they are so lucky!

I am also envious of their ultra cool lifestyle!  They get drunk and get high...that is so cool!   I wish I could do that...oh wait, I guess any fucking loser can do that.   Take the off the list.

I will also admit I wish I had my very own Twitch show....but how would that even be possible?  I cannot imagine the incredible effort it must take to create such a top flight program...

I also wish I was delusional and unaware of reality.....that must be so comforting when you look like Brett.

Yes...we are all so jealous.   He is only 50 and he has amassed so much....he lives like a king!
