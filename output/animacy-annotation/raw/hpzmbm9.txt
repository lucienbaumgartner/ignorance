Dear God. This is the exact reason why I can’t stand Trump. We need more sensible republicans and less Trumps, Margery Taylor Greens, and the other nut jobs that have taken over the Republican Party. Claiming that another AMERICAN is a communist because you don’t agree with them  is not only ignorant and childish, but downright irresponsible. 

Also, just so everyone starts freaking out about me being in a particular political party, the left has to many nut jobs of their own. Tribalism is bullshit.
