What he said was "look how we treat unvaccinated people" or something like that. 

Which is ridiculous, because we still treat them like humans, humans that aren't following the rules set forth in this pandemic. Many of which are NOT the govt (totally legal - see Spanish flu) but private businesses that are justifiably worried about covid spreading inside their establishments.

We're not treating them as sub-human, we're treating them like they're selfish, ignorant and inconsiderate of those around them. 

It is not covid disinformation.

But do watch out for those people, the "I don't wanna vax/mask" people, because those people are the kind of people who don't see others as whole humans and are willing to round them up because they don't think enough like them. 
ANYONE willing to round people up because they don't conform to the set established new laws that interfere with democracy.

Wearing a mask does not qualify. That's a normal pandemic response feature.
