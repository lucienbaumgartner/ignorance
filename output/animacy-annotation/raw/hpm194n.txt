&gt; They don't listen because you're calling them stupid

No, if they listened I wouldn't call them stupid. Again, this is you putting the onus of not being an ignorant and dangerous person on someone else rather than the responsibility of the individual in question. It's quite the sleight of hand for someone to believe in individualism yet take no responsibility for their own beliefs because they are unable to reason their way to caring for themselves and others.

&gt; If they choose that public health officials don't have the power to make them get vaccinated, so be it.
