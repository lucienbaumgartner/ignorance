I know I keep reccing it in this sub, but try the Beaufort Scales Mysteries, by Kim M. Watt - first book is {{Baking Bad}} - it's sweet without being saccharine, warm-hearted and oh-so very funny! (And there are crimes to solve! ...And dragons!)

{{Picture Miss Seeton, by Heron Carvic}} - a comedic parody of the elderly crime-solving heroines like Miss Marple and Miss Silver, but with the twist that unlike then, the protagonist is completely innocent and unaware of anything going on, but an absolute accidental trouble magnet!

{{All Creatures Great &amp; Small, by James Herriot}}

{{Constable on the Hill, by Nicholas Rhea}}

{{A Quiet Life in the Country, by T. E. Kinsey}} - historic cosy mystery, with Lady Hardcastle and her maid/friend Flo...trying but failing to have a quiet retirement!
