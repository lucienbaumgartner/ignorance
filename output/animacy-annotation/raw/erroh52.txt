Both oral and genital herpes are accounted for in that ~95% statistic actually! And both strains can infect both the genitals and mouth area. It’s also possible to get herpes in your eyes, fingers, etc. A lot of people are massively uneducated on HSV and likely carrying it, unaware and asymptomatic or just plain ill-informed as to what their symptoms actually indicate. You’d be surprised how many people with HSV1 on their lips are still performing oral sex on their partners and spreading it, because they genuinely think cold sores are just as harmless and non-contagious as kanker sores or something similar.
