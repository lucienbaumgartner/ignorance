He called Abe Lincoln “a beast”, he did not agree with Abe Lincoln he simply thought that the chaos caused by the democratic position on the civil war wasn’t good (their candidate was a general who thought it should continue but their position was that they should ask the CSA for peace). He was firmly a supporter of the CSA sympathetic democrats.

It’s not “standard for that era” nor were his other racist statements, again this was the era when Canadians were working on the Underground Railroad and helping abolitionists. Pretending like his views weren’t extreme for the era is simply wrong. It also wasn’t “standard until 30-40 years ago” again that’s false and ignorant of actual historical reality where these laws and ideas were only really commonplace among former slave owners. 

I was not saying anything nice about Churchill I was pointing out that the only reason he ever became Prime Minister was because his contemporary conservatives were so incredibly pro-Nazi before the war the public and the opposition were about to go into full revolt if any of them became PM. 

There’s a big difference between homophobia and believing in subjugation and bans on interracial marriage.

Like I said these things you are saying are completely ahistorical... John A MacDonalds views were commonplace in the 1760s... he lived in the 1860s though and your grasp on history doesn’t seem strong enough to understand that
