&gt; Because he gave his intent two sentences later in his speech when he asked the crowd to “peacefully make their voices heard”

Which contradicts his previous statement. 

&gt;Again right after saying their were good people on both sides trump said “and I don’t mean the neo nazis or white supremacists” you are either disingenuous to a degree unheard of or you simply are unaware and ignorant of what happened.

Which contradicts his statement that there were very fine people because they were all marching with Nazis. Would you March with Nazis?

&gt;I suppose I could have said another reason to hate trump but let’s face it you are just trying to dog pile on the latest mud slinging regardless if it’s true. Just keep on regurgitating that narrative.

No need. Trump’s done. It’s going to be a lot of suffering for him. 

&gt;And woosh right over his head goes the point. If having no government appeals to you then I can’t understand why you are even here unless you just want to be a troll.

You are confused.
