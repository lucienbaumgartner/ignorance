No, its really not. You're literally saying black people are so stupid and ignorant that they're being forced to attack random Asian people because Trump said mean things about China.



I'll be sure to tell my fiance and her friend that were assaulted by a black guy in the NYC subway last week that the innocent Black gentleman spit at them and threatened to push them on to the subway tracks because he was forced to by white supremacy and Trump's hateful rhetoric.
