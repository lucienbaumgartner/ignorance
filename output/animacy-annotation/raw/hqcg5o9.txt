&gt;No you dont.

I don't, and neither does much of the music world.

&gt;Yes, progressive doom metal.

[Not remotely](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/pallbearer/foundations-of-burden/)

Your ignorance about progressive metal does not make Pallbearer progressive. 

&gt;Yes you are well versed in very bland genres of music. That explains your overall bland music tastes both inside and outside of metal.

You continue to make ignorant and bigoted assessments against music genres you know dick about.

&gt;And your problem is your obsession with them is more important than the quality of the music even if it isnt the "pure" definition.

At no point did I ever suggest that the terminology was somehow better than the quality.

Recommend your ""shoegaze"" list all you like, you can argue it is a useful list for shoegaze fans - but none of the artists on there are identified as shoegaze anywhere.

&gt;Name one and explain the flaws.

I don't need to. You either like a song or you don't. Me not liking a particular song you send doesn't mean it is bad - it just means I am indifferent to it.

&gt;No it isnt.

Yes it is. You are not the human arbiter on what is good or bad music. You are just a nasty, hateful human being.
