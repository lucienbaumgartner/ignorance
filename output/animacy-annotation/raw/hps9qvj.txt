&gt;Even through the fat...

Is this really necessary?  Yes, she's fat.  She's morbidly obese.  There would be no show if that wasn't the case.  Why do some of you have to keep making ignorant and nasty comments about her size and looks?  Tammy has so many actual personality issues, obvious mental health problems, and clearly the way she treats people is horrible, especially those who are just trying to help her.  But some of the comments on here are just ignorant, childish "she's so fat" type of bs.   Some of you seem to be just as emotionally stunted as she is.  Down vote all you want.
