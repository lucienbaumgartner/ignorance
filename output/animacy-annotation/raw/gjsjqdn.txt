If I were to guess, distracted and unaware of parked cars. Parked cars = no red lights, so they just plowed right into them at full speed.

I can't really see it being a lane change gone wrong because it's so dead center. Person definitely would've had at least a few seconds to realize they fucked up.

Should be nailed by ICBC for this one though. Anything short of a major medical incident is really inexcusable.
