It's quite a small church, so it may be that the only place to go is outside. I'm worried that if I do have to excuse myself the few people I know there will be offended. The friend I'm staying with isn't fully aware of my SA, and one of the people we're going with is deeply religious and unaware that I'm an atheist.
