NTA. Your very privileged friend is perpetuating stereotypes that actively harm less privileged Black people just so he can get laid. It's an amusing game to him, and one that is unlikely to have dangerous repercussions for him as long as he's only using it around equally privileged college kids. But it's not a game, nor amusing, for the people whose dialect he is mimicking, or whose lived experiences he's co-opting just to pull girls. 

He is literally othering low-income Black people with genuinely difficult lives, making them out to be some stereotyped idea of "people who talk like this are tough, don't have real feelings, and are criminals". Which is great for him, because he can shed that character anytime he wants. But all the white kids he's putting this act on for are going to go into the world and look at ACTUAL low-income black people and think this bullshit is all true, and continue to see them as a threat and somehow less human and more "other" than themselves. 

**Good for you for outing him, even inadvertently! He sounds thoughtless, ignorant and manipulative, and he's lucky if this is the worst consequence he deals with for his gross lies. NTA.**
