Wait.... now I consider myself quite the dark souls veteran as in I've beaten every game but demon souls never even played it actually, and Sotfs is by far my favorite one. And I dont see the drawback to farming lvls at all besides it taking longer to finish a playthrough which to me is irrelevant personally.

I suppose if you're new and unaware that (60 str and 10 end) *dies to boss* dosent equal "grind to build more str." That makes complete sense. But I've just seen/heard so many other players condemn *grinding* but my Iron Keep is 100% empty of enemy npcs and I'm god mode before dranglac castle. Lol
