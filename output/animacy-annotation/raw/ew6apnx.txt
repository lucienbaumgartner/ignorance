I'm glad they see that addicts are taking these drugs because they have mental health issues that aren't or cannot be treated, but are treated by the opioids themselves. People think we all want victim status to "big pharma", but some of us actually enjoy and need these opioids to function. Mental pain can be as every bit as painful as physical pain and there is a gap being created where pain patients think it's all the addicts fault that they're getting dicked. It's these ridiculous rules and drug war laws that are creating all this tension and taking lives. Not all of us are crying "dear god, help me get off opiates, i'm so addicted". I willingly take opiates because they treat a severe mental health disorder and ironically can treat addiction (buprenorphine, methadone).   


People are just so grossly uneducated and ignorant that I feel like we can never see anything really helping people who struggle with heroin or opioid addiction. :(
