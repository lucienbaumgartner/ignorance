You are probably so oblivious and unaware that you spend most of your time in your head.  Someone else needs to feed you.  You probably need a trusted "handler", someone to hold your hand and suggest actions for you.  You can still be smart, and you still see things around you, you just don't pay attention to them.  You are busy contemplating the nature of butterflies.
