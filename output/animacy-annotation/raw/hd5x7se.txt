Thats just dumb and ignorant of you, and diminishes any counterargument you could be trying to pose here. Mockery has its places, but gross misrepresentations of what was said only serve to undermine any counter efforts you post. 

For anyone who didnt read the Tweet the left lost their minds over:

&gt; My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it &amp; became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it &amp; make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied

She never says the vaccine made him impotent, or made his balls to become swolen. She relates a story told by a friend, as to why that friend isnt getting the vaccine. That would be like me saying "My friend confided in me that he actually liked hitler, and thats why he wants to be a nazi", and then getting mad at me, and saying i'm a nazi, simply for repeating something that was told to me.  Do you see how dumb that makes you look to do something like that? It would be one thing if she was like "BRO THE VAC GONA MAKE YO BALS FAL OFF AND UR GURL LEAV U", but thats not what she did. She related a story that was told to her, about a friend, and why hes afraid of it. 

The second half of what she said is absolutely correct, and incredibly important - that you  SHOULD pray to whatever you put your faith into, that the vaccine IS Safe, and that NOBODY should be allowed to bully you or force you into making medical alterations to your body. 

I'm not trying to ascribe some profound sagicious wisdom to her tweets either. it was a simple Statement, that people too embedded in their cult cant see for anything but an attack on their newfound religon.

Try being a little more profound and intentional with your thought process rather than just letting the ragebait mockery flow forth.
