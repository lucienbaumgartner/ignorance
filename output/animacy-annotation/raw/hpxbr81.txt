In your analogy you find it hard to understand why there is conflict within the group of people who have been disenfranchised? Ofcourse the group being treated like shit is more likely to treat others like shit, Google what a viscious circle is. To understand your own analogy it would take very little knowledge of basic psychology. My og comment wasn't implying that you're being racist my guy, just ignorant and biased. Being biased is a human condition, it's our job to be self aware.
