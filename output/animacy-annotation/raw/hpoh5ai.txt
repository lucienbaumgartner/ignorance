Try commenting this in r/Nihilism lol.

Your first paragraph reeks of a controlling parent. So what if your child was disrespectful towards all the religions (I'm talking about disrespecting a religion, not a religious person)? Would you have him/her throw out of your house just because you fail to indoctrinate and manipulate them? You create a sentient human life, manipulate it and when it doesn't turns out to be like you wanted, it's their fault?

Your second paragraph reeks of ignorance. Just because you've met atheists who are ignorant and indignant doesn't mean everyone else is the same. I'm here to make you realise that most people will always feel their own ideology is superior no matter what, atheists are human too, but athiesm is not an ideology, it's simply rejection of faith. Feeling rejection of faith is superior is not 'wrong' nor right , based on your perception of wrong and right.

So what a person is an atheist because of his feeling alone and not his intellect? It doesn't mean they aren't atheists.
