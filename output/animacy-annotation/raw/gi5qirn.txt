Ironically, I don't think it could happen. You basically just described Ben Shapiro, and while I wouldn't exactly call him intelligent, he certainly tries to be or at least tries to come across as though he truly cares about the discourse, and all that does is open him up to getting repeatedly dunked on by Twitter.

It's the very fact that Trump is unashamedly stupid and unaware that allows him to avoid losing support, because he avoids discussion about it all together. That might work well for getting a certain frothing demographic to support you, but it doesn't do much in the way of policy or working with other countries. Nobody likes to work with that kind of person.
