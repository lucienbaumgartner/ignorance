&gt;You’re not self-made

Nope, and neither are the native Americans.


&gt;It’s already happening and there’s nothing you can do about it.

That's not true at all, there's plenty I can do. There is no tough talk, it's simple facts.


Winners don't pay losers for losing. This is how it's been since cavemen, and how it'll be the same when we are spacebound. 

We. Don't. Pay. Losers. For. Losing.


This is a fact, however strongly you feel otherwise, and how many "you will pay," you want to use. All your tough talk is just that, and only shows how naive, inexperienced, and ignorant of history you are. 


Native Americans will NEVER, EVER reclaim even 1% of their native lands. Bet. 


You aren't a leftist, you're a liberal. You're interested in helping the loser no matter the circumstances, it's laughable.


I'm done talking with you, though. We aren't going to change the other's mind, so why bother.
