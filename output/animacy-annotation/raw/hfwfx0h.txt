Eh I can understand the intent but it comes off as a bit insensitive and ignorant of reality.  There's plenty that can go wrong in your life that is unplanned and will financially bend you but we still deal with it.  Cars, kids, pets, houses, etc.  It's all very unnecessary if you're inclined to live a life that excludes them but it's incredibly hard to do so here we are.

The issue is financial planning and being able to control yourself with your money.  You can most definitely afford most of what you want or need if you can plan for it but again, society doesn't encourage it outside of 401ks and other things that benefit the company as well.  In the end you are right: If you cannot see yourself being able to financially maintain pets either get a pet that is low cost and maintenance or don't get one at all.
