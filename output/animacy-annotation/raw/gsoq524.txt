Dope, thanks for bringing something to my attention that I was *already very aware of*! The thing is, I'm not going off of just some shit I heard in a Facebook post. I'm talking about people that I have *literally seen with my own eyes* or at least in video clips. There's no compromising with someone that's proudly ignorant of scientific fact and will absolutely lose their mind if you ask them to wear a mask for a few minutes inside a store.

Honestly, that video really just helped further the pro-mask position by emphasizing that anger, fear based ignorant thoughts will spread like wildfire to the angry, fearful and ignorant. That and explaining the base mechanics of how a virus spreads that a 5 year old could understand.
