We kind of have this, at least in Western NY. Handguns at the age of 21. Shotguns/rifles at the age of 12. I took a 2 day safety course. It's 2, 10 hour days learning the laws, safe handling, storage, transport. I think concealed carry is 21 as well? Not sure, don't have a desire or reason to own a hand gun. Just a shotgun is fine. I hunt whitetail deer (actually season is almost over now) to save money on food. If I get a deer I don't buy a quarter of a cow for the winter/spring because the deer can normally hold us over. I agree there should be a refresher course though. Definitely have met some people that clearly do not know how to handle a firearm and that's just dangerous and ignorant of them not to learn
