After The fourth of July, Im never going to be apart of a party with drinking if I can help it. (Unless they seriously ration it out) one of my friends who is the easiests to get along with (and also quite the stoner.) Was extremely violent and unaware that be was drunk and was trying to drive away. Another friend threw up all night then took some pills which only worsened the situation.  During this i had to rescue another friend from a part were the host was drunk and pulled out a gun on someone. As far as im concerned marijauna is so much safer than alchohol.
