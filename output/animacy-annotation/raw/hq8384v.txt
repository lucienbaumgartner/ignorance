I'm sorry, but I have had polycystic ovaries since I was 11, and have had 9 surgeries. Once to remove a torsion on my right ovary, and 8 more times to remove multiple large cysts. When the cyst couldn't be removed by surgery, the only option you have is let them burst on their own, and handle it with rest and pain medicine. Oh yes, it hurts like fucking hell, but you don't have operations for bursted cysts. Cysts are supposed to burst. If I'm ignorant and incorrect, I apologize. But in my 20 years with endometriosis and polycystic ovaries, I have NEVER heard of getting an operation for a bursted cyst.
