I just don't get it. Is it so difficult to understand that even vaccinated 3 times, you still can get covid and spread it around! Why do you focus on the small amount of unvaccinated people, while the vaccinated people can spread this virus unknown because untested and unaware of being contaminated.
BTW didn't you learn manners and respect at school? At 21 you should know better.
BTW I'm totally vaccinated, booster including but i will never point a finger to an other person.
