I've driven all over Canada and I've never seen more unaware and incompetent drivers as the Vancouver area. It took a while for me to believe how poor the drivers truly are in van, but just go on the highway and watch them try to merge. 

The amount of cars with side damage from not understanding where their vehicle is while parking is astonishing.
