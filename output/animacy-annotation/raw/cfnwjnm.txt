I was about 13 years old and flying to visit my dad. I had one stop and once everyone departed, I was asked to stay in my seat for a head count. I was young and unaware that after the head count, I could get up to go to the bathroom. I really had to go. Then, people started to board. Couldn't get up to go. Captain announces that we are preparing for take off. My eyes are just about turning yellow because I have to pee so bad. The pilot takes off. As we're ascending, I take off towards the back of the plane to the laboratory. The flight attendant grabs me and straps me into the seat next to her till the pilot levels off. We levels off and I make it to the bathroom just in time!
