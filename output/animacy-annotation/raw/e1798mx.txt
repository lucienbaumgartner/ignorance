Haha I see. It just seems surreal to me that people are so unaware and egotistical. Reddit is what I’ve used for years so it’s kind of a big surpise to me in some ways that people still are such insecure maniacs on Facebook but on the other hand I also somewhat expected it to get progressively worse. Can only imagine the other gold he posts lol.
