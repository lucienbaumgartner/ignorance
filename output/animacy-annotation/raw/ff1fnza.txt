I think this was a really good question that generated really good discussion. 

As a non-believer, I see a difference between comments that address specific theological errors in fundamentalism, and those who comment in more general terms like “REAL Christians don’t hate”. Other people have addressed the no-true-Scotsman fallacy, and I have nothing to add to that, so I’d like to address the first sort of comments.

I really, really enjoy comments that get into theological scholarship. Like I said, I’m a non-believer. Having someone on this sub point out that fundies are more attached to Paul than to the actual gospels, and that arguably makes them more Pauline than Christian, is a useful perspective. It also helps when someone with a grounding in theology or biblical scholarship can explain the historical context of a particular quote from scripture, or point out the differences between the KJV and an accurate translation of the text. 

The second type of comment is also a valuable form of snark. To me there’s a huge difference between saying “NotAllChristians” and pointing out that fundies are so deluded and ignorant that they aren’t even doing the Bible right.
