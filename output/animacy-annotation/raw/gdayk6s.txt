As a young child, I would spend my summers abroad in the Caribbean with my cousins. For the most part, we’d spend all day hanging out at a park right across the street from my aunts house.

Inside the park there were these stone circular structures and in order to get to the roof you’d have to climb up onto the end of the structure, find your balance and manage not to fall. Well, one day, that’s exactly what we did and when we got to the top there were a ton of needles up there and we were practically tip toeing around them just to leave right after that.

I think back to that story and cringe as an adult because as a kid I was pretty naive and unaware that those needles were being used most likely for drug use and it wasn’t the safest environment to be in to say the least.
