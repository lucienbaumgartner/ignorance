I think the issue here is that this sub thinks they're the only sample of players, when in reality there's only 13,304 subs. I dont think im very far off when I say that there are millions of other players who are blissfully unaware and perfectly content with playing the game as is, and most are happy with the rewards they get (plenty of my league mates are definitely included in this group).


&gt;Also, we make money for them by watching ads. Do you think the rich boys have time to sit and watch 20 ads when they don't have to.

Would you watch ads if EA didn't provide you with 5 stamina? Please do not act like you are doing them a favour, EA provides you with a reward for watching ad's.
