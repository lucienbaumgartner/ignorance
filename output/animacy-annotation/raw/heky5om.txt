&gt; France does have more power in the EU than Slovenia, that's just how it is.

And yet presidency is not decided by who is the more influencial. There are many aspect of the EU that shows a certain amount of equality. I find that the claim that France would hold the army power very farfetched and ignorant of the reality, this will be an army led by an european patchwork of military personnel with the council as its top, something like that.

What France will want is help with its overseas territory, more precisely, Pacific ones. France interventionism in Africa is dying so I doubt there will be request on that area.
