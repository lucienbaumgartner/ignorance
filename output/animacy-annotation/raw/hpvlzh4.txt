I mean, I get that parents might need caffeine to stay up late and set up everything for Christmas morning but like… be smart &amp; plan ahead. There’s energy drinks. Make coffee at home. The thing that made me angry is this couple obviously saw that we were struggling to clean and prep everything and all they cared about was getting us to stop everything and make them drinks. With the lights off and everything. They were so inconsiderate, pushy and ignorant that it made me angry. I can’t understand people like that.
