You’re accusing me of “not taking responsibility for” hundreds of millions of dead bodies, but you think *my* point is slimy and sick?

Last I checked, I haven’t killed anyone, thanks, but whenever Christians open that particular Pandora’s Box the natural answer is always to point at all the violence and injustice that has been perpetuated in the name of the Cross over the millennia. So I would advise staying away from it in the future, because you’re making the Church look hypocritical and unaware of its own history. 

Evil people use power structures to do evil things. That goes for feudalism, capitalism, communism, all religions, and home owners associations. 

And by the way, you completely side stepped the main point that even if I granted you that Marxism was responsible for the most terrible atrocities in human history, **neither I nor any national Democrat is a Marxist**. I did not come here to defend frickin Marxism. The conversation has only ended up here because of your insistence that you know better than progressives what their platform is, and yet you have **not once** given a scrap of evidence that Biden, Sanders, AOC, or anyone else in a position of power who you accuse of pushing “Marxist black supremacy” actually supports any policy that would in fact result in a Marxist or black supremacist state. 

I’m not answering a single reply until you back your accusations or assumptions up with links to actual policies, videos, or statements made by the politicians you are accusing. Take my silence as judgment of your failure to do so in the future.
