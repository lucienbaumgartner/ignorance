&gt;I don't think we have to accept that premise. While all are appearances there are differences in the appearances.

Let's put it another way: consciousness either is, or is not. That's the only difference possible for consciousness. We're aware that we're aware when we're awake, and unaware that we're aware while asleep (usually). 

When consciousness is, any "thing" we refer to must be made of consciousness, otherwise we wouldn't be conscious of it. 

There may appear to be a multiplicity of things, but if they all depend upon consciousness for their capacity of even being a thing at all, is there really a difference? 

Everything is made of consciousness. Seeing the body is too frees our false will, and peace becomes whole. If one is not a body, but consciousness, the one does not need to worry or struggle or compete, as oneness is oneness and flow flows. 

The giving up of this false control is to be peace.
