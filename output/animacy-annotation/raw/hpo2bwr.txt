1. The Transferred Nation's Unnatural level of power - Self explanatory

2. Easily-Avoidable Civilian Casualties - Some fanficsz especially copy-paste, often repeat these types of casualties from Min-Min's NHS. Primarily in Gim and the Kingdom of Fenn. These transferred nations could've easily been written to aversion due to the MC nation's disposition.

3. Excessive reaction - I've seen some fanfics that bear rather unnecessarily copious amounts of reactions along the lines of: Pi√üer-pants Horrified or Comical Anger. While such things seems quite plausible and even expected, the pitfall is that it gets amplified and repeated so excessively.

4. Political Inaccuracy - depending on the type of civilization, era, world, etc... the MC nation comes from, the political ways may differ. However for simplicity I'll state this from a modern standpoint; The political disposition of the fanfic narion can sometimes be either; Forced, Inconsistent, Childish, Naive, Poor, Excessive, Impossible, Inaccurate, or to put it simply... Incorrect.

5. Increased Arrogance - So far, I've only seen one fanfic (which I prefer not to disclose) that presents this. The antagonists get unbelievably more arrogant, ignorant, and prideful, this gets even worse if the nation in particular is undoubtably powerful, as an example: Better than the United states of america.

6. Excessive action - I don't mean action as in fights such as gunfights or duels, but I more refer to entire military deployment, sometimes unmecessarily large amounts of vessels, aircraft, or ground units. Sometimes unnecessarily powerful assets being deployed to engage enemies, some even insignificant enough to be eliminated by a platoon or company. And sometimes it's the classic 'Nuclear Option', one fanfic in particular simply bombed parpaldia into oblivion with a Nuke at the first moment.
