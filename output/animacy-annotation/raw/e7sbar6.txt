*Eris watched as Aaron placed the money for his drink and her tip on the bar. If he was paying that meant he was probably leaving and if he was leaving that meant he was probably gonna start snooping around. Then as if almost on queue he winked at her which garnered yet another roll of her eyes and a disapproving shudder as if she were completely and utterly disgusted by the notion, which for all intents and purposes she was...*

"Just because I have'm on me don't mean I gotta wear them..." *She said flatly as she unenthusiastically waved him off then deposited the money for his drink into the till and pocketed her tip.*

*A few minutes later Eris exited the bar via a side exit which led to the darkend alleyway. She never did like leaving through the front door and always opted for the side or back exits. She took out her phone from her pocket and began casually scrolling through her notifications as she walked down the sidewalk. To a casual observer she'd appear to be blissfully unaware and unafraid of her surroundings but in reality she was paying very close attention, nonchalantly taking in her surroundings with her peripheral vision and listening for any uncommon noises.*
