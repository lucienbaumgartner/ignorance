I would tell her you checked it with your nutritionist or doctor (which probably did I assume). And that they said it's fine. And then assert that position that they are right and therefor it's all good.

It's gonna be hard to say something against that. I think many people are pretty tolerant and unaware of what bs arguments they sometimes present against veganism. But if it get's too absurd, they realise that what they are saying can't be right and starts to sound ridiculous.

I would see this likely being the case when she'd have to take a position that your doctor and dietician are both wrong, but she is right. If she actually did, then I think it's fine to resent her to a certain degree, I mean it has to click at some point if she wants the best for the child.
