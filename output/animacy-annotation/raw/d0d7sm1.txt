I agree with everything - but confidence doesn't require that you be aware of weaknesses, or improve them. Whatever effects there are caused by that young kid having confidence (and being naive about his own limitations/etc.) are irrelevent to the "I have confidence" statement. Also the supposition that he might get stabbed through that facade is just that, supposition and it's not guaranteed to happen at all - or even be possible.

Fundamentally you assume that a person with confidence and weaknesses (even if he is unaware of it) is confident as a facade. Which technically is only possible if he's aware of them and "masking" some inner doubt with a confident mask. If he's unaware, and confident then he is just that.

The point is that confidence doesn't require weaknesses to be present.
