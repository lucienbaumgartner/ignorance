To be fair, I'm not "shitting on people" who don't believe the same as me. I don't mind people being anti-gun, I don't mind people wanting nothing to do with guns. I don't mind them believing that. What I mind is people trying to set or demand policy on something they have little knowledge on. You can look around Reddit and see how upset people are about politicians trying to see internet and telecommunication policy while knowing nothing about it all, that's how gunowners feel about people advocating for gun control.

I wouldn't mind having the discussion, just don't come to the table so woefully unaware and ignorant of what you're debating. I immediately stop taking your argument serious when you start using terms like "military-style assault weapon" or misusing terms like clips or semiautomatic.
