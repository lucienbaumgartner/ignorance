“I only know how to use A and don’t know how to use B. Since I cannot possibly be wrong and ignorant, that means that anything I don’t know how to use MUST be so flawed that my *Superior Brain TM* would recognise it as foolish to use.

Therefore, I come to the conclusion that A is superior in every way to B”
