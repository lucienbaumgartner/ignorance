It might actually be really painless.

From my understanding of horrendous burn accidents (where people's skin is melted off in some explosion) they are often shockingly calm and unaware of the severity. From memory, the first few layers of skin hold most of the receptors for pain, so if they are very quickly burnt off, the rest of you didn't have the sensors to register the nightmare you are in.

I don't know if the same thing would happen here
