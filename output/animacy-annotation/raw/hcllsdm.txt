Are you me? I could have written this about 8 years ago.

For me, it was a first date. I decided to try one of those apps that blur your photo, and as a result the woman I was matched with was larger than I was used to. Like you, I tended to err on the side of traditionally slim; before this particular woman, I'd never dated anyone larger than an A cup. But the sex was great and our personalities gelled immediately.

What did I do? Well, the fact that our fifth wedding anniversary is coming up in a few months is probably your answer.

Now, don't get me wrong: you have a right to be attracted to whatever you're attracted to. We, as humans, don't control attraction. But you should also reevaluate your emphasis on attraction. The problem with appearances is that they change over time. Let's say you meet a woman who looks exactly like you want a woman to look like. Well, what happens when she gains 15 lb in what my wife calls "happy weight"? (I gained more like 30! To be sure I was close to "underweight" on the BMI when we met.) What happens if she gets pregnant? What happens if neither of these things happen but 10 years past and you suddenly discover gray hairs or wrinkles? _Looks change._ What doesn't change is personality... And if you want to create a relationship that will stand the test of time, you root it in personality.

TL;DR: yes, shallow and ignorant.

That being said, this isn't your fault. The blunt fact is that Western culture trains people to be shallow and ignorant. In your case, it worked. And that's fine. You didn't know better.

But now you do.

And now that you know better, consider doing better. =)
