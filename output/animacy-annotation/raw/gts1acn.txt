Yes we can be VERY emotional. Overly so, resulting in a stereotypical toxic ENTP

All types have emotions and have Fi. The issue with ENTPs like me is that, because we're so detached and unaware of our emotions, we run away and skimp our negative emotions and do not process them. As result, over time those negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, hate or whatever build up until it's too much and starts overwhelming us. And even at that point, we still try to run away from it. Resulting in a very unhealthy ENTP

Your dad, as with any other unhealthy ENTP, needs either Therapy. Or start a mindfulness/meditation regime. (I find meditation to be the only thing that enables the process of emotions in a healthy manner). Otherwise one day he's gonna blow up and have a life crisis.
