So, as I understand it, there are three stages, 1) completely unconscious and unaware that there’s anything more for us, 2) an awakened state where we can oscillate back and forth between being present and then reflecting on presence with mind, and 3) pure consciousness where mind is no longer relevant.  

I think I’m at number 2 - the theory is a lot easier to grasp than just being present all the time - I can only get a little bit of stillness from daily meditation but I just started a few months ago.
