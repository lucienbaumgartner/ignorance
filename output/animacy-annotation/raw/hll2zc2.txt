I have a strong aversion to comparing and ranking deaths after the shit I heard when I lost my mom and my best friend suddenly in my late 20’s. I never even tell people I understand the loss of their mom, because every situation is different. I will say even though I don’t have children, I can’t really imagine anything worse than that. 

To compare the death of a loved one to losing a pet is one of the most unaware and despicable things you can say to a grieving person. That’s all you need to know about them.
