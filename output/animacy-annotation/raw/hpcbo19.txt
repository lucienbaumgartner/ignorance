I've never really gotten comments from women. I'm sure it happens to some guys like you said. I always took it to mean I was unattractive until I realized later in life that girls are literally bombarded with that kind of stuff do they normally don't do it to others. They're drowning in attention while males are often times starving.

I think this is where alot of the disconnect comes from. We all kind of just assume our experience matches the experience of other individuals and it definitely does not. We see this disconnect come up in almost every controversial topic.

To be honest, without posts like this or similar tiktoks, I would never had had any idea the amount of danger women have to worry about. I knew 10 years ago I would have thought that people were overexaggerating and there's not really an issue because it never happened to me.

I think the majority of people are not taking into account the experience on the other side. The best we can do is keep sharing the other sides perspective when it comes up in conversation and keep sharing/upvoting/commenting on posts like these.

Some of the world are jerks who will ignore it, some already know it and some just are unaware and willing to learn.
