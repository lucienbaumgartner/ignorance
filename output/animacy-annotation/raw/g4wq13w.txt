Fair enough. As much as you disagree, it’s kinda correct. I don’t really care what you say because I know better than all of you idiots, but you are all so fucking dense and ignorant that you think you’re geniuses. You’re not. There is no convincing you all, understandable. Most people would disagree with being called dumb, but I can totally sleep easy knowing that you are all absolute buffoons. May god have pity on you poor bastards. I’m sorry that you were cursed with idiocy.
