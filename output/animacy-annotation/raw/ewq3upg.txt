Exactly. He’s not a racist he’s just ignorant - people don’t necessarily know the difference between these two things. He’s insensitive and ignorant - that doesn’t make him a racist it makes him a bit of a douche. I don’t have a problem with a douchey President. I do, however, have a problem with a racist president - which Trump is not.
