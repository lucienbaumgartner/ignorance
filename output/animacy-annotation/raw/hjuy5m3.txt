#1 and #3 are deal breakers for me. I would never date anyone who thinks that shit.

Based on your description of him, he sounds like he has a mental disorder that is undiagnosed and needs medication... So if that's not ironic, i don't know what is.

But it sounds like he has no self awareness or is completely inconsiderate and ignorant of your situation... And his own.


I hate to say it but he's got to go... He sounds toxic
