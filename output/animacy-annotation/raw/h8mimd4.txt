Maybe he was going to warn Kyoshi about the danger of having Jianzhu as an avatar teacher.

I always assumed Yun liked Kyoshi cause she was pure at first and unaware of many bad things in their world. So when they met for the final time and Kyoshi said "No Yun, I'm here to put you down", he looked disappointed cause she lost that sense of innocence. The Kyoshi he knew would never do something like that. Idk he may have been jealous of her avatarhood but for better or for worse he also tried protecting her.
