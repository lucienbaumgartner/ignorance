&gt; The downloading of real child porn is causing abuse. if you do it you create the market for it even if your the 4000th person to download it, a real child was abused to sate you. 

No, they weren't. That's clearly just a lie you're telling yourself because it makes you feel more comfortable. They were abused to satisfy the abuser. They filmed it for voyeuristic purposes, which other voyeurs then consume. This in no way suggests that was the point of the abuse, as though it's filming a commercial for floor cleaner as though it wouldn't have existed without a pay check.  

The Mexican cartels cut someone to pieces with chainsaws and film it. If that gets shared, I don't contribute to the act or create it whether I hover the mouse over the play button and press or don't. 

How is viewing child porn any different in terms of the producers being unaware and uninterested with my existence and that product being created whether I watch/don't ? 

It's nonsense. There should be nothing we can agree on quicker than the fact that nobody anywhere is sexually abusing children based on market demand as a primary motivator. It's why although it could make sense that you could sell a kidney for profit in theory, you still have 2.
