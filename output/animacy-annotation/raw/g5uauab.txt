I don’t go here but this is very important. This literally just happened to me. The groupme had about 30-50 students in it and people were messaging about the quiz the entire time we were taking the quiz and I stupidly didn’t leave the group or report it to my professor. Instead I made a comment about my score and how it didn’t tell you what answers you got wrong once I finished the quiz and now I either have to drop the class which I can’t do while still being a full time student or have to be reported to the honor counsil which also isn’t really an option bc the program I’m trying to get into won’t let me apply with an honor code violation. I was stupid and unaware that not reporting cheating was an honor code violation and now I’ve screwed myself over in my first semester of college.
