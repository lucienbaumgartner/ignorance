You, did the right thing. I read a quote once, it read something like this. 

"Putting down animals is the hardest thing for a vet to do. More then often the animal is brought in and is alone with the vet, you can see in their eyes, they're searching for their owners, scared and unaware of what is about to happen."

Wouldn't you prefer your loved one to at least spend its dying moments in the comfort of your company, home laying in his favorite place, with his favorite people.
