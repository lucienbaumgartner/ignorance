Oh you misunderstand, it’s not about hating Towa. 

Like when Inuyasha was so careless and unaware of Tessaigas power (wind scar), then came Sesshomaru and shoved it in his face, forcing him to understand what a careless fool he was (at the time). Inuyasha didn’t like it obviously, and Sesshomaru actually beat sense into Inuyasha a couple times and it’s just great to see. 

Because we all wish we could smack even our favorite characters at times for being fools.
