All you truly, completely need for a wedding is you, your partner, something to wear, and someone to legally marry you. The rest is whatever you want to make of it. I highly recommend "A Practical Wedding"! 

This is my mantra when my (slightly unaware and totally sweet) future husband says "well I thought we had to" when I ask him for opinions lol
