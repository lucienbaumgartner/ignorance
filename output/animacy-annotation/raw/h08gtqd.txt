This person isn't cut out for small business department head. 

My favorite part is that they pushed back when he responded from vacation and Alex is all "what, I can't check my email now?". He needs to quit before he's fired because this person doesn't typically last long in this structure when you are so combative and unaware that owners don't just "detach", even when they say they want to. 

I thrive in this environment. Others simply do not and that's OK but he's treading on thin ice and should certain pull the rip cord before Alex cuts it for him. I rolled my eyes so hard at the fact this person cannot accept that Alex doesn't need to say "This is my business." It's a given. Stop being so thick and accept that he's the boss, ffs. 

This is also why many people don't do well coming out of contracting and being a customer. He's clearly not used to having a boss. Get used to it or get stepping.
