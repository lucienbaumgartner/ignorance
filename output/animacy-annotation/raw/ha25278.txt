&gt; and will enough people get vaccinated for these stats to allow herd immunity.


[Herd immunity is literally impossible even if 100% of people were vaccinated](https://www.politico.eu/article/herd-immunity-not-a-possibility-with-delta-variant/). 


[Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads in communities with a high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387v1#disqus_thread). 



&gt;We find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine “breakthrough” infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.


So regardless, even if 100% of people were vaccinated, it would not end the pandemic, it would not make a difference. Covid will become endemic and will be with humanity until the species meets its inevitable fate. **Barring people from an education or forcing them to present their "papers" in order to grab dinner is Orwellian. Once governments have power over the individual, you will never get it back. Vaccination mandates and vaccine passports make no logical sense and are just a way for the government to have more control over you**

Getting the covid vaccine is backed by science. But so is rapid testing, proper mask wearing, and early treatment with anti virals. When has the science of vaccines ever been debated? We are discussing the merits of a vaccine mandate and passport system. We are discussing issues surrounding freedom of movement and individual bodily autonomy. How naive and ignorant of history do you have to be to not realize what this has the potential to become? I can tell you're quite a privileged child and have never lived in an authoritarian country.
