"TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and IP stands for Internet Protocol. (more definition). In the workplace, IP is a way of addressing networked devices and most people are totally unaware and unconcerned with what is their computer's IP address, but I imagine from time to time if I am remotely administering a computer I may need to know its IP address and I may need to instruct a caller how to find their IP address and troubleshoot their network connection in cases where their computer has no IP address or just a default address from the Operating System. In some cases I might need to help someone identify a printer or other networked device's IP address to access that device."
