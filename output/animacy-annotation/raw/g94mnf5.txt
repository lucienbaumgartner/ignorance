I am from Greece so i bootlick noone. Coming from you though thats rich. I have said what i have to say. At the end of the day we are both insignificant in the grand scale of political tit for tat. I do not vote,and you are so brainwashed and ignorant that conversing is wasteful. Either way the board is set and even if Biden wins you will fail. Even if by some miracle you manage to both win and you are allowed by the elite, that biden and harris are lackeys of, to establish your pervasive views,it wont last. The pile of human filth that you call comrades will sell you out,trying to enrich themselves, and a resistance will form that will either slap the party out of existence like what happened here with Pasok,or even worse the whole thing will come down from the inside as extreme fascist elements of the democratic party that were allowed to ban or mob people freely,get pushed out as they become a liability to the newly elected dems. This is my final try of perhaps helping you. I dont mind you ignoring the points of my previous comment and going on random ramblings as i do understand you are very young or you majored in gender studies leaving you basically useless to everyone around you. Either way heed my warning: do not fall for the idiocy they push to you. Vote biden all you want but do it by thinking critically and having all the facts. Thats it for me though. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and may you have a long and fullfilling life. Goid day.
