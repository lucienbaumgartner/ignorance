It's a joke. Probably a bad one if I have to explain it.. but why not..

A common response to reading u/notimpressed's comment would be to call it a relationship goal. I wouldn't be surprised to see a screenshot of this comment with the title "relationship goals" in another subreddit. 

I offered a look at the story from a pessimists pov and called it "pessimistic relationship goals'. 

(when the subreddit becomes unaware and ironic)
