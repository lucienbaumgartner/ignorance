You’re so confident yet so misinformed. Disney+ isn’t doing a “racial circus switchamaroo”. Falcon was Captain America in the comics prior to his introduction to the movies years ago. They’re following source material for a character and adapting it to film. There hasn’t been any race changing here, you’re just ignorant and unaware of what you’re judging.
