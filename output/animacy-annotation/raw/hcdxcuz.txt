just me maybe but, i just saw shang-chi and during the majority of the movie, in a mostly empty theater at 10:15AM on monday morning, the guy directly behind me with his giant bucket of pop-corn shuffling his hand in there to gobble it down chewing with his mouth open, even during the quiet scenes is why i wish i could have just watched it at home.... or that i could at least legally slap that motherfucker.

people are selfish as fuck and ignorant of how they affect others.
