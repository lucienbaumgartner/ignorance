I road tripped 5,000 miles in September / October. I almost got killed by a semi more than 20 times. It is incredible how unaware and downright unskilled or at least inexperienced a lot of these drivers are. 

Next road trip I will actively avoid trucking routes even if it's hundreds or thousands of miles detour.
