As an American, this is probably the most accurate comment I’ve seen here so far. 

The “afraid to travel” is very, very true, and incredibly sad. I try to explain to people that our inner cities are significantly more unsafe than almost anywhere they’ll travel, but they don’t listen.

I also think the lack of travel serves to keep many Americans close-minded and unaware that any other way or life (see all the other stereotypes) is possible, let alone seriously preferable.

Please just know that we’re not all like this. The lot of us that have traveled, are interested in other cultures, are not gun-toting lunatics, understand what fair labor practices are, etc., are very embarrassed by these things. 

In summation, why must it be so hard to immigrate to the EU!!!
