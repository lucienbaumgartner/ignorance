Re read it all and get back to me...you missed the bit where she pulled some pretty fascist-esque moves to postion herself as candidate. 

You should really read the wikileaks emails for yourself and see whats in there.

That one is a good starting point.."And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging." 

Still sure Trump is the fascist and not the Dems?
