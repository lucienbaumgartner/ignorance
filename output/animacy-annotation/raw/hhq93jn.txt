&gt;I hear so much anti-middle-class talk these days like they are the enemy. Having a 'comfortable' life with options should be the aim for everyone - not seen as a bad thing that should be shot down.

I agree a comfortable life is what we should all strive for however the "Middle Class" in Britain is a mess,  a lot of them are so over privileged and ignorant that the thought of not going abroad every single year or having to live in a mix of state and private housing is the equivalent of being a homeless drug addict.  The group is internally split as well, depending on where you are you it might be so bad that doing physical labour over a mindlesss useless office job (even if the physical labour pays more) would be looked down upon the same as working at the local supermarket or fast food establishment. Meanwhile other middle class people might not care about any of that but try to fit in with the ones who want and pretend to be upper class just because "That's what we're supposed to do"  which kinda makes the whole term unless in modern terms considering how bad snobbery has gotten these part 25--30 years and the rise of people getting into extreme debt just to keep up the appearance that they're middle class or better.
