&gt; Many people who might start feeling a little off this time of year might chalk it up to allergies or a seasonal thing, get tested, come up negative, and go about their lives as normal while being infectious and unaware of that until testing positive after a week of going around and exposing countless others.

Usually the recommendation is that even with a negative test you should still isolate until 24 hours after the last symptoms go away. At least that what you have to do here. 

&gt;What if I have a negative test result?
&gt;If your COVID-19 test is negative, you can enter public spaces once you have been symptom-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and you feel well enough.
