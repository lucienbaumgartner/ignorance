But also we know from scientific observation that we are in fact pattern recognizing creatures. We look at the clouds and we see shapes and animals. We look at the Bible and we see connections and then because we go into it with the assumption that people back in those days must all be uneducated and ignorant that this had to be inspired by a deity. 

Also I wouldn’t say God isn’t real. I would say that the Christian God is most likely not real. There seems to be way to many logical fallacies for it to be a possibility and ultimately, as you can read the replies I’ve gotten so far, It boils down to faith or quoting the Bible which present new problems like “how can we trust the Bible is actually the word of God”.

But I’m not here to “convert” anyone I just have always thought of this “question” and was curious what Christians would say about it
