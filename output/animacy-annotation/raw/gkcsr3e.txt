I live in fear of my little sister and nieces and nephews doing something so dangerous while operating under the thought that itâ€™s fun and exciting and cool. I wish they were never introduced to the internet until they were at a suitable age. Then again I donâ€™t want them growing up naive and unaware of the dangers of the world. I wish I could raise them to be aware without the fear of them partaking. Because I finally understand that no matter how well you raise or teach a child, outside influence also plays a big role. Environment plays a large role in shaping us but I live in fear that theyâ€™ll do something stupid in the name of fun and lose their chance to continue shaping themselves into the kind and intelligent humans I know theyâ€™ll be. Iâ€™m not a parent but I truly fear being one. I wouldnâ€™t be able to let my kids out of my constant sight even as I want space from them ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­.
