It's been one of the most frustrating and unbelievable things I've been through in my 40+ years.  

Here we all are, fallout from a virus that's killed millions of people, and it's hard to believe a new virus has long-term effects, that it's merely a mental health issue.  Mental health is important; I have a degree in that field, but it makes me angry when I see articles and doctors that make it seem like that's the main focus.  I'm like, duh, anyone whose body is damaged in a way that standard labs don't make clear, who is debilitated health wise, is a medical mystery and spends many months taking on the medical community to figure it out, so therefore no easy answers and treatment, is going to experience anxiety and depression; that's a normal and natural response.  

People can be ignorant and judgmental.  So, when you get asked, "why do you have a big gap in your work history?" and the explanation is health issues that are not understood (like a major accident that took a long time to heal from), that effects a person's ability to land a job when they're well enough.  What employer wants to hire what appears to be an unhealthy employee, who has not been able to work due to their health, but doesn't have a clear diagnosis that shows why that was, who got treatment and can confirm they're well since having that treatment.  It has a major impact on a person's life even for those who eventually recover or partially recover enough to take on some form of work.  So, you feel a big relief that you've survived and are hopeful you're on the way to being able to function at a job.  But then, you're dealing with the discrimination having long covid creates.  

Soap box rant over.
