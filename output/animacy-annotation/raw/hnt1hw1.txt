I use my blinkers (even when driving my BMW!), it's almost more effort to NOT use them because it is so habitual.

But in my experience the people complaining the loudest about people not using blinkers tend to be pretty self-unaware and poor drivers themselves. Not using blinkers just happens to be one of the most obvious driving mistakes so it's easy to call out. It almost comes across as an inferiority complex. "How dare they not use their blinkers! Do they think they are more important than everyone else?!" 

There are a number of things in certain driving situations that are just as if not more dangerous than people not using blinkers, and some people are just completely oblivious these things.
