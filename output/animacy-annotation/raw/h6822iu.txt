Because anyone that's ever murdered someone while intoxicated behind the wheel never intended to. That's the difference... but it was due to their irresponsibility that lead to the event. Imagine someone drove over your mother and said in court "sorry I was drunk and unaware of my actions" wouldn't that infuriate you?
