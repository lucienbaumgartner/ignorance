RUMI  Re-Mind - Contrast - Juxtapose 

**"We are like a bow in the grip of God’s hand.
God sends us out upon various tasks. In reality
God is the agent, not the bow. The bow is merely
an instrument, unaware and unconscious of God,
so that the world’s apparent order can be maintained.
Mighty indeed is the bow that becomes
aware of the Bowman’s hand!
What can you say about a world whose perpetuation
and order rests on heedlessness? Don’t
you see how the people who are awakened
become indifferent to this world? Through child
hood, people grow and gain strength from negligence
and play. How else can they ever have
grown up to become men and women? Therefore,
God puts us through pains and labors to wash
away those acts of negligence and make us clean.
Only then are we able to become aware of the
other world.
The human being is like a dunghill, a heap of
manure. If this manure-heap is precious, it is
because hidden in it is the seal ring of the King.
You are like a sack of corn. The King cries out,
“Where are you carrying that corn? My cup is in
it.” People are unaware of the cup, being
absorbed in the corn. If they knew of the cup,
how could the corn distract them? Now, every
thought that draws you toward the other world,
making you cold and indifferent to this lower
world, is a reflection of that cup flashing out.
When men and women yearn after this lower
world, however, this is a sign that the cup has
become hidden in the heap.**  -Discourses
