You are pathetic. I bet your family is disgusted with you. 

You know that wearing a mask can save lives and you’re so fucking selfish and ignorant that you refuse. You’re a disgraceful excuse for a human being. 

Nobody is asking you to live in fear. They’re asking you to take some personal responsibility to help save lives. 

Imagine being such a piece of shit that you know a simple action on your part could literally save human life and still refusing to do so.
