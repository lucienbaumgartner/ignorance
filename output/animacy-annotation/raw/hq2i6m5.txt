YTA. Are you really this self unaware and toxic? God I hope this is fake. I feel bad for the kids. Wouldn't be surprised if there are some teenage pregnancies in the future. If this is real, this kind of crazy controlling behavior tends to result in kids rebelling and lying to their parents instead of going to them for help and guidance. Also the daughter will have no idea how to operate independently in the future. That's not even addressing the audacity and entitlement of bringing 8 kids when 1 was invited. Wtf. Please please be fake
