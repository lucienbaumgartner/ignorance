I'd be okay with the death penalty if the system was 100% accurate, but I know its not.  Some studies show that that there's been a 4-5% margin of error, and there have been cases where the person convicted was clearly mentally ill and unaware of the consequences of their crime.

Also, inmates on death row can cost taxpayers even more with the appeals process.
