I can see where you’re coming from, but I personally think the “1939 Warsawish” comment is pretty offensive. This is promoting businesses from disadvantaged groups. Disagreeing with the practice is fine. Calling it overcorrection is fair. Comparing it to the Third Reich, though, is just completely hyperbolic and ignorant of the differing motivations behind the labels applied to a group of people. 

Also, it isn’t absurd to assume that some people will actually search by the labels. I know a ton of people would love to buy from veterans to support their country and feminists would love to empower female business owners through their wallet, as just two examples.
