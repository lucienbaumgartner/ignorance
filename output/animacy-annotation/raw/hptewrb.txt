Whenever i complain anywhere about players refusing to do the bare minimum in late or end game content (aoeing as a dps, CDs as a tank for themselves OR the main tank in 8man content, basic mechanics like earthshakers that appear in ARR and never go away) i get told that maybe they level skipped, maybe they story skipper, maybe they're disabled, maybe this, maybe that.

And no one seems to understand that isnt mine, or anyone else's, problem. You queued for a level 80+ duty. That's 80+ levels to know the basic of the job and the game. You acknowledged the responsibility of the role you accepted when you queued. Do it or get out. I have literally never met a game community that's so desperate to be "friendly" that you can be a totally lazy, inconsiderate jerk and force everyone in every duty to carry you while you put forward no effort, and as long as you dont say anything abusive in chat, people will endlessly white knight for you.

Showing up to a group activity totally unprepared, ignorant and unwilling to learn is still toxic, people. Stop indulging this nonsense.
