&gt; In all honesty, many of Snowden's revelations were rehashes of what other whistle blowers had said.

If you had listened to it, you would know that is not true. He specifically explained what the difference was between previous whistleblowers and him. The previous guys only exposed corruption and the STELLARWIND program but the rest started after 2007. Everyone suspected that phones were being listened to but they didnt know about PRISM and the hardware backdoors that came out with Snowden.

So Snowden did reveal a lot of new stuff, conflating the 2 is disingenuous.

&gt; Whistle blowers like William Binney came out years before Snowden. 

The funny thing is that the other guys who think like you, also claimed that Snowden is a fake just because he acts shy and weirdly, but Binney does too. So if Binney is genuine, then Snowden has to be too. It's not uncommon for tech guys to be nerds and shy you know. 

&gt; The basic premise for the Panopticon's success is that prisoners must believe they are being watched, but must not know when. Thus, whether or not the prisoners are actively being watched is irrelevant to their behavioral change. They begin to self-regulate and self-censor.

Well this is nonsense because

A) Now we are always watched

B) Most people dont give a crap and are just as active if not more active despite of this. The danger exists, but most people are just so stupid and ignorant that they will give up their privacy despite this.
