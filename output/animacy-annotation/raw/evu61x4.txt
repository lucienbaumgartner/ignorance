Disobeying unjust laws is understandable. Being so stubborn and ignorant that you assume all cops are shit is not.  Our system is very far from perfect, and could definitely be improved. However, I really don't understand what ACAB morons think would happen if cops just disappeared. They'd probably just whine about how government does nothing for the people. This is one of the most delusional, moronic groups in our society.
