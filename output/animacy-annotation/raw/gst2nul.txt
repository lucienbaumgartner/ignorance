I relate to this so much! I will tell you that when I was on a schedule of living like how your friends described it, I felt better but not perfect. Now that I think about it, I was just depressed and unaware of it as my daily mood plummeted. But now that I'm at home, I even avoid exercise and water sometimes because my dad says "that's what you're missing" and if he was right then it would mean I was just being stupid instead of having depression and sh like the doctors say. I am dealing with denial and I still need to admit some things to myself.
