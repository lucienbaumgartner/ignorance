But are Australians actually sick and tired of Scummo and his band of back scratchers and sexual predators? I hope they are, but until they lose an election in a historic landslide followed by genuine corruption and criminal investigations, I’ll maintain some skepticism. 

I guess I’m not convinced that the average voter isn’t so totally apathetic and ignorant that they will think about any of this when they go to the polls.
