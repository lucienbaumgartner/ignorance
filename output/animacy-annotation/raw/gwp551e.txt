1. That's still my main work laptop! 
2. At school, everyone is trying to deal with, and somehow placate all the new insecurities that arrive as a teenager. Many young people discover that the 'disgust reaction' as a response to things they don't understand, is a socially acceptable way to avoid mockery. It's the easier option. "I don't get this, mocking it is the safer approach in terms of the social hierarchy than asking questions, because that would put me lower than you, because it's an admission that you know stuff i don't.' tl;dr. Most kids are stupid, angry, and unaware that they're angry because they're stupid. Their transition to adulthood consists mainly of learning to hide their stupidity and anger. I was originally going to post ' hey, love the old school remote' but it got weird. 
Enjoy school. Enjoy collecting Apple products. Check out dosdude1, he wrote an amazing hack that would let you put Catalina on that laptop! xx
