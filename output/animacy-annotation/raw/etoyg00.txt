It’s basically because they weren’t raised right. That’s a little harsh but more specifically it’s because when they were children no one explained to them not to do it and how offensive it is to others. They often to get offended when asked to stop because they are completely oblivious and unaware that it’s rude in the first place.  

I have a friend who can’t really breath through his nose due to it being broken so many times so he kinda has to chew like that in order to breath. Everyone else should shut their mouths when they chew.
