Did your doctor swab your sores? If not, go back in about 6-12 weeks to get blood-tested, which should give you a better understanding of which type (HSV1 or HSV2) that you contracted.

Yes, it is possible for one of you to have not gotten it, but I would still inform both of them just in case. The person who I contracted it from was asymptomatic and unaware that he had anything. So I called him and just basically said, "Hey, I was wondering if you had a second to talk. I just wanted to let you know that I was just diagnosed with genital herpes; in this case, HSV1. As my blood tests came back negative from January to March, and you're the only person who I've had any contact with in the time it would take for my initial outbreak to occur, I'm fairly confident that I contracted it from you. I just wanted to let you know so that you can go get tested and take the proper precautions moving forward."

He was devastated and kept apologizing to me, but we later found out that he had dated someone with HSV1 for a long time, and chances were that he had gotten it from her and just never had an outbreak, so he was unaware. I told him I wasn't angry at him (which was true; I was angry at the situation but not at him) because he hadn't known, but I just wanted to ensure that he knew so he could be more careful moving forward.

Your friend and the guy she knew may be shocked at first, or angry, or distraught. They may say it wasn't them. Either way, just bridge the discussion not angrily, but informative. "Initial outbreaks generally happen within 2-20 days of getting the virus; our night together is within that time frame, and the doctor is generally sure that this is when I contracted it. I don't want you to freak out, but it is something that I think both of you should look into."
