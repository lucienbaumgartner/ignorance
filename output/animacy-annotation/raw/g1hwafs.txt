Someone who realizes people like that rotten asshole are literally the cause of human death across the world. Even if this pandemic was hypothetically not fatal it would still be a giant assperson's move to sicken someone for two weeks and if it was the standard flu, that still kills geriatric people and the compromised.

So I'm someone who still realizes how dangeroud this infection still is, even after several months where most people just let themselves go, annoyed and ignorant that its still a life stealing killer of a disease-- they're forgetting masks because its too hard and blowing up over what truly amounts to a small task to save some person from a death.
