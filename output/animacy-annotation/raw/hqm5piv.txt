What's even more cringe is your know-it-all attitude that provides 'best-guesses' that aren't even remotely close to being based in reality. You come onto Reddit to headhunt and desperately search for a feel-good moment that could send people to the hospital from how cringe it is. Have fun being dumb, bad and ignorant of anything that goes on in the comp scene. But keep pretending as you do. It's good entertainment for the ones who actually play the game competitively. The biggest irony is I actually gave you stone cold facts, and you rejected approaching any of them critically because you have zero ideas how to without google which isn't going to even give you the answers you're seeking. Get a grip, you suck at arguing and I don't even think you know the definition of irony is. Idiot.
