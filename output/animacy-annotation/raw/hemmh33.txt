&gt;hard to get a vaccine
Yeah, no, I walked down to my local pharmacy and got a jab right then and there.  It took longer to fill out the paperwork.

That was my mistake, I meant a vaccine card rather than a passport.  The thingy they scan when you go places.  Plenty of people got it when they found out they couldn't go eat in a restaurant without having gotten the vaccine. Saving the lives of fellow human beings?  Nope, not worth it, don't tread on me.  Going to eat at fucking Applebee's again?  Sign me up, gimme that sweet sweet vaccine juice.

&gt;fuck you
And fuck you right back.  Any creature so selfish and ignorant that they equate a vaccine with being sent to the gas chambers in a modern-day holocaust is an animal.  Plain and simple. If you can't do good under any circumstances without being forced to, then you're an animal.
