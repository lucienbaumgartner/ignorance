&gt;You do understand that hunting has strict rules nowadays right?

Do you understand that the world is a bigger place that the nice first world country in which you live, right?

&gt;No animal is hunted to extinction by hunters anymore

Do you live under a rock? Countless species are endangered by [hunting and poaching](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8019170/12-of-the-worlds-most-endangered-animals-hunted-by-ruthless-poachers/#:~:text=THE%20world's%20most%20endangered%20animals%20are%20on%20the%20verge%20of,%2C%20jewellery%2C%20clothes%20and%20souvenirs.&amp;text=Elephants%20are%20being%20hunted%20to,each%20year%20for%20their%20ivory). While you whine and deny this, the chinese are slaughtering wildlife in asia and south america.

&gt;Every hunter consumes/eats the meat of the animal they have harvested and in addition to that

Yeah, i hear that poachers love the taste of rhino horn and elephant tusks,  just like the chinese love the taste of tiger genitals and hunters love to eat their trophies.

&gt;hunting is important to control the population of certain animals.

While hunting sometimes helps to control populations, it's important to note that the reason why most of these populations became pests it's because hunters wiped out their predators.

&gt;fortunately there are not many poachers left

This is statement so wrong and ignorant, that i don't know where to begin.
