"If I already have HIV, can I get another kind of HIV? When a person with HIV gets another type, or strain, of the virus it is called HIV superinfection. The new strain of HIV can replace the original strain or remain along with the original strain."--copy pasted from Google
With that being said, you can get it more than once. Different strains, same virus. Please educate yourself before parroting false information, it makes us ALL look bad, ignorant, and unwilling to accept being wrong.
