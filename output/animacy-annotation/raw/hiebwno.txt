I think calling him extremely intelligent is quite a stretch—he was charismatic and arrogant but so hubristic and ignorant that he allowed himself to be shivved by his second-in-command.

For me he was cartoon-like because he lacked any real complexity. Real people have delusions, but Pope lacked any of the nuance and character developed in Alpha and portrayed so wonderfully by Samantha Morton. Alpha was a despicable character, made highly watchable by the story and performance. I didn’t get nearly as much from Pope.
