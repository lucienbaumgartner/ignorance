&gt;My first example of what I mean is Kamala Harris. She was selected because of explicit racism, and Democrats are ok with that. Biden straight up said “I’m only going to pick a black woman.” So he did. And Democrats don’t seem to care one bit.

He never said this. He committed to picking a woman but said nothing about race. Regardless, what about this is racist? Aiming for diversity is a bad thing, let alone racist?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Second example is immigration. It seems almost inconceivable to many on the left that people are opposed to immigration for reasons other than race. When Republicans defend their positions, I hear about either the economy, national sovereignty, or cultural values, almost never a word about race.

Yeah, and when people discuss the Civil War they mention "states rights." People know racism is bad and so not many people will outwardly say, "keep brown people out!!!"

But regardless, what you're describing is an extremely narrow, naive idea of racism. The consequences of immigration are inherently racist as it disproportionately affects people of color. We're not policing people coming in from Ireland and Russia. Whether the intention is inherently racist or not is secondary to the fact that the structure of immigration policy is itself racist. And if you support the immigration policy, then you are supporting a racist structure.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Third example. In the California recall election, a common phrase I heard to describe Larry Elder was “The black face of white supremacy.” Excuse me? People really believe this stuff? Talk about doublespeak. This dude hardly even mentioned race in his campaign. He’s black. In a state that is majority Latino. Yet he’s supposed to be a white supremacist? Imagine if Republicans talked about a white liberal like “oh if he’s elected he’ll betray his race.” It would be an instant firestorm. But you’ll never hear a Republican say that, because they don’t generally think in terms of race, Democrats do.

The argument is that his policy positions supported structures of white supremacy. I don't know what his being black or California being majority Latino has to do with anything. Are you trying to argue there weren't Jews who enabled the policy of the Nazis? Or black supporters of the Confederacy? Or women in favor of the patriarchy?

A black person "betraying his race" means continuing to uphold structures of racism. You might disagree about whether Elder did so or not, but speaking purely in terms of concept it's a fairly easy one to understand. The only way to dispel that being a possibility is if you think racism against black people doesn't exist in America. Compare that to your example of a white person "betraying his race." What would that even mean in the context of modern US society? How are white people being oppressed? What structures are holding back white people that a white governor could maintain or even support?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And finally, Virginia. The day after the elections, I turn on MSNBC, and sure enough, the primary explanation for the Republican win was calling them racists. The same racists who elected Winsome Sears, I guess? The highest ranking woman of Color in Virginia history is a Republican. If they’re really motivated by racism, they did a crappy job at it. Once again, imagine the fallout if the roles were reversed.

You are once again showing an extremely narrow view of racism. "Racism" isn't a binary concept where we all either have it or don't have it permanently. You've done some racist shit. I've done some racist shit. Everyone has. Sometimes consciously, sometimes subconsciously. The idea that electing a black person once erases racism for good is ridiculous. Do you want to claim that the US doesn't have a racism problem because Obama was elected? Do you genuinely think that's a good argument?

The incoming Virginia governor made "Critical Race Theory," which isn't even taught in public schools below the college level, his top campaign priority. [Roughly 1 in 4 Virginia voters](https://apnews.com/article/virginia-election-ap-votecast-survey-75520c5c9a245bee384526abc138a61a) said in exit polls that CRT was their biggest voting issue. Yes, race played a big role in the Virginia governor election. This isn't speculatory. It's literally in the data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or how about Elizabeth Warren? She claimed to be Native. When she took the DNA test, it showed she was only 1/64. She’s whiter than most Americans, yet felt the need to pretend otherwise. Yet Trump is the real racist for making fun of her, apparently.

Yeah, that was really shitty and ignorant of her. She apologized for it and the Cherokee nation said they believe her apology is sincere. As I said earlier, we are all guilty of racism to some degree in our lives. The idea that we need to have perfect records to point out other people's poor actions and beliefs is an absurd concept that would effectively lead to nobody being able to ever criticize anything ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine if you called 911 to report a drunk driver and the dispatcher responded with, "oh well remember that time you made an illegal turn 10 years ago?" That would be fucking stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

But really, let's assume the worst in all of these instances and assert they are as fully "racist" as you claim. You really think that makes Democrats "as racist if not more so" than Republicans? You earnestly think \~90% of black people in America are voting in favor of racism every election? You think nominating Kamala and Liz saying stupid shit about her DNA test is as bad as or worse than putting Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon in policy positions or using drug wars to imprison black people?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The bottom line is, Democrats insert race into just about every issue wether it legitimately exists or not. In the effort to battle racism, they have largely become. become racists themselves in many cases like I outlined above. This ultimately perpetuates racism more than Republicans could ever hope to.

Because race IS in everything. This country was built on white supremacy and many of the structures are still in place. Black people have less wealth, less upward mobility in the job market, less access to quality education, less access to healthcare, and are punished more harshly by the justice system.

Imagine for a moment if I went into my office every day and took a shit everywhere. I shit on my coworkers' desks. I shit in the breakroom. I shit in the elevator. I shit in the boardroom. I shit in the front lobby. I just take huge shits everywhere, weekly. Now imagine if my coworkers  complained about this every day and my boss responded with, "why do you guys need to make everything about shitting?"

My coworkers are making everything about my shiting because I am subjecting them to it. It's not their fault for pointing out the shit problem every day. The problem is me, the person shitting everywhere.

Democrats are pointing out that there's shit everywhere. And they'll shut up when America stops shitting all over the office.
