Ah, yes, let's prioritize the "achievements" of racists, rapists, colonizers, and slave owners over the success and progress of civil and human rights which make the world a better place to live in.

Thank you for implying that my Navajo ancestors who were murdered, raped, and treated like cattle, herded across the wastes of the US in droves are less important than your European ancestors who murdered, raped, and treated the Navajo like cattle.

Thank you for implying that a day which celebrates the oppression of native peoples is more important than a month that celebrates life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Thank you for being so bigoted and ignorant that you can't see how the celebration of and fight for the furtherance of equal rights is more important than "Yay, we stole a bunch of land and made it our own while shoving its original inhabitants into the dirt!"
