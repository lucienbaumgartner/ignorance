YTA.  Big difference between not telling you something that is really none of your business or anyone else and hiding/lying about it.She was a prostitute before you guys were dating presumably before you met, unless she said something along the lines of "i'm a virgin"  she did not deceive you, unless she gave you an STD or cheated on you through the prostitution she in no way she fucked you over from prostitution like you  tried to tell her current BF. You fucked yourself over by ending a relationship you seemed to  have cared about a lot other really enjoyed by being so narrow minded and ignorant that you ended it over your insecurities no one else is to blame for your relationship ending but you, this can be plainly see by apparently you're stalking her and now you're completely to blame for you ruining another relationship, the silver lining is it seems like you saved her from another fucking douche bag. If you had any human decency you'd stay well away from her in the future.

Tl;DR: Don't stalk and try to ruin your EX life just because you're complete fuck up, move on with your life. Finally remember Karma is a bitch.
