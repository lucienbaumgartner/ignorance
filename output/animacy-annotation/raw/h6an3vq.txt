I mean, I wasn’t trying to brush off the statements but as a political movement or any movement without a command structure it’s hard to paint everyone with the same brush. So for example I’m aware that members of BLM movements in certain districts around there I believe said they’re all trained Marxists, but that is 3 out of I don’t even know anymore worldwide? So I’m inclined to agree with you, I don’t believe all people who support right wing policies are raging racists, a lot of people I know have a mixture of political leanings and right wing is one of them. I just find it silly and ignorant that everyone is painting everyone with one brush when it’s more than that.
