you seem very dismissive, but actually, yes precisely. different countries clearly have different culture regarding the virus.

in new zealend and Taiwan for instance, i think you would be insane to suggest that no one should have public meetings.

britan is not nearly as good as taiwan in this case, but their covid restrictions are in such a way that op's "even my 7 year old sister would know better than you" seems so incredibly dismissive and ignorant of the reality of the situation.

so yes, it is a culture thing. culture is actually an incredibly important thing regarding a pandemic.
