It honestly depends on the doctor and how you look overall. Some recommendations for subliclinical hypothyroidism include rechecking until you are frankly hypothyroid, meaning your TSH is above 20 and T4 is below normal. These recommendations are meant to prevent treating people with thyroid hormone who don't actually have a thyroid disorder, which is completely possible when the only evidence is a mildly elevated TSH. There are several other causes of hypothyroid symptoms and unfortunately that creates the potential for physicians to prescribe T4 replacement when the patient doesnt have a thyroid disorder. That would put people at risk of side effects related to hyperthyroidism which can be very severe, including osteoporosis, cardiac arrythmia, and even dementia. That's why most recommendations are more conservative than most patients would like, I promise it isn't that any one physician is just stupid and ignorant.

That said, there's also evidence that leaving people, especially younger people, at an elevated TSH puts them at risk of cardiovascular events (a heart attack) later in life. That evidence is leading some physicians to buck the standard recommendations of waiting for overt hypothyroidism. Thus, different providers are gonna make different decisions on exactly when to treat, and if you feel like your current doctor isn't addressing the problems you sought them out for you should definitely consider a second opinion.

TL-DR: there's a lot of conflicting considerations that your doctor is making, and if the end result isnt what you need feel free to seek a second opinion.
