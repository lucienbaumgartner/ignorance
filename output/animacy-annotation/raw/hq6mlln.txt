TLDR - You are both absolutely correct. People use ignorant as an insult in current nomenclature.  They are, however, ignorant of the dictionary definition and original usage of the word.


Nowadays, it for sure is used as an insult.  The meaning of words seems to depend on the understanding within the current cultural context.  Following the definition the word could be an insult in the context of calling out someone who is speaking on something they know nothing about or acting in a manner that ignores the negative impact on those around you... but in most circumstances it's misused as an insult.  People use it instead of calling someone an asshole or stupid... but the reality is just as a few people have already said... it's OK to be ignorant and healthy to admit when you are ignorant on a topic, as we all lack knowledge/awareness on certain topics.  Without admitting this how would we ever learn.  "Baby's are the most ignorant humans in existence", this sounds like an insult and some may even call me "ignorant" for saying it.  Definitionally (is this a word?) speaking they actually probably mean to call me an jerk... which I really technically wouldn't be in this scenario because saying a baby lacks knowledge/awareness is a fact of life rather than an insult.  The word is so often misused that it's meaning has shifted in public culture, so technically I'm not even sure if using it as an insult really would be "misusing" it nowadays given that most people view it as an insult.  Words are confusing.  I talk to much.
