I am always amused by people like you who use such extreme language ("some of the most ignorant and stupid people on the planet") to describe others on a matter such as this, as if the matter is completely closed--a done deal. In reality, the issue of natural immunity, vs vaccinated immunity, vs those with hybrid immunity (both) is a lot more nuanced and interesting than you assert. [You can watch a recent overview of the large study from Israel if you are amenable to opening your mind just a bit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22jcRsw--xg&amp;ab_channel=MedicinewithDr.Moran).
