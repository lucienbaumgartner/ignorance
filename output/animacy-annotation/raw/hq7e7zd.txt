I think the game is really solid if you experience it in the following way: You go in totally blind and unaware of any mechanics. You see that Hypermode drains your health and say "fuck that", never using it except to pass progression gates. Then you decide to jump straight from Normal to Hypermode (the difficulty) for your second playthrough, get your ass wrecked by minor encounters, and decide to try actually using Hypermode in battle since you figure you'd lose less health that way instead of having longer fights where you keep dying, and then have fun blasting through the hard mode with less difficulty than you had with the easy mode when you realize how good Hypermode is.

Failing that, I can see how the difficulty would be too low for some people.
