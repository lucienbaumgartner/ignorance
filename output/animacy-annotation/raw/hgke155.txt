My hope is that in that moment he was still just anxious and unaware of how the performance went. But knowing that when he watches it now he doesn’t see the nervousness makes me think he was happy with the end result. It can’t be easy to “immortalize something he’s been working on for 3 years.” He had toured that whole year and then had 2 times to get it absolutely right. It’s a lot of pressure to put on someone. I get it, completely. But I hope he’s proud of it at the end of the day because he should be.
