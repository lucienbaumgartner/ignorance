Interesting take. I’d go back to my original point, however, that people are more divided now than they were 10 years ago.

If influencing culture using entertainment has always been a goal, then at least before, it was more subtle. Now it’s obvious enough that many people have noticed, and actively reject and mock this type of media based on its on-the-nose messaging.

Additionally, it didn’t seem to matter before because people were making the best product possible, and ignorant of social issues or not, didn’t make that the priority. The only real issue I have with any of this is when the entertainment I consume is eye-rollingly compromised by shallow attempts at diversity. Attempts that reduce people to their most basic traits, like sexuality and skin colour.

If Lost was created now, I personally don’t think it would be a fraction as good, because a huge priority would be placed on diversifying the cast before anything else, especially on a large ensemble piece.

Even if I have been blissfully ignorant of the forces at play behind the scenes, I feel like that’s better than being actively hateful, or divisive like the aggressive, targeted activism of a lot of today’s films/shows.
