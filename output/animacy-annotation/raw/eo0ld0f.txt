??? are you that retarded or trolling? What does the price have to do with it having blue switches? You can buy a 150 dollar board with blue switches and it will still be loud. Because thats what blue switches are maybe? And for no reason? Or maybe cause they are properly tactile unlike browns that are just linears with a tactile bump  that serves no purpose? That is a pretty valid reason. Your comment is so unintelligent and ignorant that i want to just think that you are trolling.
