yeah see you don’t understand the concept either.
an “imaginary friend”is maybe the most ignorant and confidently incorrect term i’ve heard yet.
and the general concept of god is both subjetive and objective,that is why the agnostic belief exists and just because there’s multiple existing religions,doesnt mean that either should be disrespected because if you really understood what religion and god was,you wouldn’t be a sas sob portraying god as “an imaginary friend” or some guy who sits on clouds,if you really understood and if you were respectful towards it and not a complete and utter asshole,you’d at least have come off as a respectful atheist,but for some reason you only associate the belief of a being beyond our understanding with negativity and you combat it with even more negativity.
