100% accurate, but a good amount of the time, even the lowest level management is so lumpen and ignorant that they legitimately perceive themselves as part of the "non-proletarian" classes, just because there are some people working "under" them. Even though 99% of the time they have no real control and are a glorified goon/functionary flunky whose only real distinction is a salary and longer working hours, or a $1/hr pay raise and a special shirt. 

If they're not totally propagandized into lumpen consciousness though, lower and middle managers are 100% proles like the rest of us.
