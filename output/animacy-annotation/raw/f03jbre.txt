Well, the problem isn't the fact that we allowed the "common man" or "woman" to vote.

The problem is that the leftist have conspired to keep the electorate uninformed.

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.  The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.

The counter to the idiocy is to INFORM the idiots.
