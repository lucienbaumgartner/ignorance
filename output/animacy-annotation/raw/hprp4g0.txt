You’re understanding of nazism, republican values, owning firearms, and the entire political spectrum is so incredibly weak. 

You demonstrated a clear lack of understanding with such an ignorant and uneducated statement.

The dude made a joke, and you called him a nazi (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) because he DISAGREES with you ideologically. You’re explicitly and objectively, an asshole. He didn’t say shit to you. 

But I’m not like you, I understand that most liberals aren’t like you at all. There’s a lot of reasonable ones that I like to talk to.

You are stifling any sort of discourse and progress that could be achieved when you start a conversation. Hmmm I’ll call you a “Regressive.” Stay in the past, bigot.
