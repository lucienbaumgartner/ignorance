I haven't flipped my opinion on Rachael, but Chris, a 50 year old man, condescendingly berated a black woman about what is or is not racist on national television and saw no error in his ways. He even said he thought the interview went well immediately following it. 

I have no desire to see Rachael pics or posts here, but I would say that her privileged ignorance and his privileged anger are different. What Rachael did really sucked, a lot. As a black woman, it felt all too familiar to watch Chris use his position of power to talk down to a black woman when discussing racism towards black people and I see no reason he deserves any forgiveness.

Rachael did something ignorant and racist as a college student. Chris did it as a 50 year old to someone he considered a friend on national television and until people called him on it, he went about his merry way like nothing was wrong. If one of them is going to redeem or improve themselves, it seems much likelier to be her than him.
