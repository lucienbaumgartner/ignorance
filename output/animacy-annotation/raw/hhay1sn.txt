Wow…this is the most disconnected I’ve seen a rich kid from reality in a long time. 

I get that some people will be raised rich but damn, parents need to do a better job of teaching their kids about the real world and not just spoil them. I’ve met some down to earth rich people, and then people whose parents raised them completely sheltered and unaware of the real world who are like “I’m 23 and bought my bf a car and a ton of expensive electronics. But it was an *old* model so no biggie. Awwwww why is he mad at me when I keep ignoring his feelings and stomping on his boundaries.”

I know it’s a late lesson when you’ve been raised given everything you want, but *other people’s feelings matter too*. If someone tells you a behavior is bothering them, *you stop*. Sorry buddy, but you don’t actually always get what you want in life.
