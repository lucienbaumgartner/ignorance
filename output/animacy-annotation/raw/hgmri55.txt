&gt;Wokeness and political correctness

Because if they disappeared, you'd basically just have a lot more people being openly racist and ignorant of other perspectives. Which is...not ideal.

Edit: To fully answer the question, you'd have a world where it's more difficult for people without resources to have a voice, and you'd have a lot more people openly being ignorant assholes.
