This makes sense for conservatives because they're right (in my opinion). I think Warren would be more effective than Sanders, and that has influenced my support. 

However this doesn't make sense for liberals because even if Pence *is* worse in that he's more effective, Trump is so incompetent and ignorant that he's an actual danger. This is like trying to avoid cancer from secondhand smoke by wearing a mask while playing in traffic. The exhaust is not your main problem.
