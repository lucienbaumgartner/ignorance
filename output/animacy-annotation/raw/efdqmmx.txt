&gt;Right wing extremists aren't the same thing as Republicans

This belief is the fundamental flaw in contemporary centrism. The Republican Party is unified in its anti-intellectualism and denial of science, to say nothing about how they treat their fellow man.

&gt; I also find it hilarious, arrogant, and ignorant that you're dictating what my actions would be in a situation

You said that compromise is "always a goal." If you have some kind of limit of how insane one side can get before you stop compromising with them, go ahead and give me that limit.

&gt;I find your comment to be absolutely disgusting and/or reprehensible

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. And/or, though? That's hilarious.
