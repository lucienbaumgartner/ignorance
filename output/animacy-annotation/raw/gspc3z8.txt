That in no way fixes the causes of why people commit various drugs offences and the general criminality that surrounds that lifestyle. There are economic reasons, sociological reasons, psychological reasons etc., and methods to combat it should seek to address these issues that propel the processes that keep the black market profitable and viable. Killing them would actually make the problem worse, as it would put a premium on the product, providing programs that distribute the decriminalised drugs, however, non-violently challenges the hegemony of criminal organisations in the drug trade on international and national levels. 

As well as being uneducated and ignorant of the issues involved, your opinion on how to solve it would also not be viable in a country that is not authoritarian. I think your plan is not a good one, and I'm glad it is not possible for you to actualise it.
