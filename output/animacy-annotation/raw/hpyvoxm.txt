I’m sure there will be no shortage of these this week but here goes. This morning when my husband and I were opening presents I was so excited to give him his gift (wireless headphones for his two hobbies - running and drumming). He was excited about his gift and I tried not to mind that he printed mine off this morning and put it in the bag of a gift from some friends we had opened yesterday. It was an idea I had given him - a gift card to my local yoga place. He then excitedly put another box in my lap and told me to “open this one next! It’s from my mom!” 

I opened it and immediately said, “oh I think you gave me the wrong box, this must be for you.” Inside was a recipe book of gluten free cooking. Here’s the thing - I am not gluten free. He is. I looked at him confused and he, still happy and unaware of the shit storm of emotions about to rain upon him, told me he that he suggested this gift to his mom. I was incredulous, and let him know that this was a gift for him, not for me. This is basically like giving a mom a vacuum for Christmas - here’s a gift so that you can serve me! 

I promptly burst into tears and we had a fight about this gift and then Christmas in general. We’ve both been miffed all day, and he thinks I should see that “it’s a gift for both of us” because I like to cook and bake. AITA?
