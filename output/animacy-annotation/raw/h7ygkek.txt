&gt;&gt;It is a school of thought that outright rejects empiricism and the scientific method.
&gt;
&gt;Looks like you know all the cool buzz phrases. This is false though. They reject the idea that economic laws can be empirically discovered.

Dismissing fundamentals of analysis like "empiricism" and "the scientific method" as "buzzwords" really illustrates what I'm talking about here. 

The wall of text you linked really speaks for itself as far as my accusation of methodological insanity goes. It's total nonsense; It's unfalsifiable by design. Its comments about statistics not being a part of establishing theory or having any predictive value is just ludicrous and ignorant of modern statistical methods. It's a transparent effort to shield a baseless theory from any possible critical analysis. Any time someone presents evidence contradicting any of their claims they can simply deflect with, "Oh, we don't accept these empirical claims or statistics, as our ideas are based on logical axioms and the unrestrained spirit of human ingenuity (or whatever)".  

Anyway, yes I learned something - that every conversation with an Austrian econ person is exactly the same bundle of nonsense every time.
