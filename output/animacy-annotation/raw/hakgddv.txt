Oh man. I have *so much* to say about Del Rio:

He's not necessarily dumb, but he's designed to be a naive cunt. He holds his position in high authority even though no one actually listens to him when it counts. He looks onto his actions as superior even though they countlessly fail.

From a metaphorical standpoint, Del Rio is an embodiment of Id: reckless, spontaneous, emotional and unaware of the bigger picture. He could never defeat the Didact and will flail around trying until everyone around him dies. If the Infinity succeeded against the Prometheans within Requiem, it would be a direct challenge towards the player's projection onto Chief.

Del Rio suffers from a lack of control over his own ego. He's flawed as hell because, in a way, he represents an extreme reflection of a mentally imbalanced Chief.
