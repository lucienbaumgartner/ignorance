1) Not a woman.

2) I didn't buy my Uggs, I inherited them from a roommate who left them when he moved out.

3) I have bought shoes from Goodwill, some people have budgets which they can spend on more expensive shoes.

4) There is something you spend money on that "could go to a better cause, instead of lining the pockets of already multi-millionaires cashing in on a ridiculous trend."

5) Fuck is a sexy word. There's not much of a correlation between a person's intelligence and using the word fuck. Fucker.

6) You're words make you sound extremely pretentious and unaware that there are other people out there who enjoy things differently than you; who enjoy spending money differently than you; who enjoy wearing things that are different than you wear.

7) You're entire judgement of the situation is resting on an argument of, "you should spend you're money on more better things". Which I'll just respond with, instead of spending so much time formulating arguments on the internet which have no impact on the world, humanity, or even the person you're arguing with, you could be doing something better with your time. It's not your place to judge and you have no reason to.

8) What the fuck ever. Who cares. Get off your high horse.

9) People wearing crocs - "ugly shoes but it doesn't affect my judgement of the person."

People wearing wife-beaters in public - is this really an issue?

People wearing Affliction t-shirts in nightclubs - I don't go to nightclubs, but would judge them on other criteria before I judge them on their shirt.

10) You probably have a neck beard. 

11) Don't call girls cunts.
