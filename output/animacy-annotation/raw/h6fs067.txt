It’s extremely reckless and ignorant that everybody is telling a stranger to leave his girlfriend after reading a few sentences about their debates. I see this time and time again on Reddit. Only God knows his girlfriend’s heart. Only God knows the nature of their debate. We give up so easily on relationships. I’m glad at least you spoke up against the popular opinion.
