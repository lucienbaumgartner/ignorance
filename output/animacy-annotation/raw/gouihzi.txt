I guess it depends on what you mean by young.... Younger people definitely have less to lose by become revolutionaries, sure, that's how most radical shifts in society happen by some young revolutionaries with very little to lose in the current status quo.

But those same young, hot headed revolutionaries often have less experience, insight, and knowledge.... which often make then arrogant and ignorant of history and cause them to repeat the same mistake over and over again that their predecessors (other young revolutionaries of history) have already made. Or they just cant control their own desires or lust for power and glory and then fail just as miserably...

I don't think that's a better alternative than what we have right now though...
