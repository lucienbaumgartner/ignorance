First, don't use OTC chemical. It's almost always a 'repellent' which will kill some but the rest just move to other places to avoid it. You need 'non-repellent' chemical for ants so they just keep marching through it unaware and more are killed. Unfortunately you will likely need a professional for that. 

However, when you say traps aren't working, I assume you mean ant bait stations. (Usually a packet of clear gel.) They are not designed to trap, they are more like a buffet and the idea is that the ants will take the bait home and share it. Unfortunately if you have used OTC (repellent) pesticide, it will taint the bait, or taint the pheromone trail that lead all the other ants to it, which defeats the purpose.

If it were I, I would scrub everything down with simple soapy water and let it dry. Put out new bait stations where you see activity indoors and just let the scouts leave a new pheromone trail to the stations and let the ant super highway form. They will take it back to the nest and you will kill more in the long run.

If you can afford it get a professional firm to come in and treat for you. Ants can be very difficult and even in the pest control business they generally require more call backs than other pests because they're simply that well-suited to survive.
