Nobody is “forced” to do things under feudalism either. There’s other ways besides the government to manufacture consent.  Having to work 80 hours a week until you’re 80 years old because of medical debt, or work 3 jobs to afford rent and not starve is an example of forcing more people to do things they don’t want if we remove social safety nets.  That’s the reality for millions of people even with government assistance. You people were all opposed to social security once upon a time too.

Selfish and ignorant of factors outside of personal control.  Literal baby brain incapable of complex thought. Meritocracy doesn’t exist.  Go to the gym you fat loser.
