Kindred is Harry, but it’s the AI version. Seems it was the clone body of Sarah Stacy, controlled by the Harry AI, using the chameleon serum to look like Harry. The skeleton is the dead body of the original Harry who passed away in Spectacular #200. The Harry who has been around since Brand New Day is, unless I missed something, still unexplained. But he is innocent and unaware of the Harry AI’s actions. My guess, he’s connected to the Mephisto of it all.

At least that’s how I interpreted it all. Maybe there was something I missed or misinterpreted.
