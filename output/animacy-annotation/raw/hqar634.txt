I am half-indian (ABCD) female and honestly the amount of Indian girls I knew in college (specifically from India) tended to sleep with white men as FWB while acting as if they were chaste, untouched women to their family and Indian circle was pretty normal. They also would turn around and get into a serious relationship with an Indian man and pretend they were this virtuous and holier than thou.

As an American born Indian, I never subscribed to this mentality because I found it ignorant, judgmental, and ingenuous. If you want to sleep around that's your business, but to turn around and dress conservative in the day time and present yourself as some beacon of virtue while calling other women Indian and white dirty.


Honestly I would break it off, you deserve better. This mentality of 'settling' for an Indian man and making ignorant comments that white men don't want to settle down until they are old demonstrates what kind of ignorant and prejudiced mentality she has.
