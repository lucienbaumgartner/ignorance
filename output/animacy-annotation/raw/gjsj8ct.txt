1) I think the Buffalo in the room has been addressed. 

2 &amp; 5) I can't speak for the show's resources, but outside of the mentions that a lot of the gods have been forgotten and there by killed off, I have to make one thing clear, and this shouldn't really be a spoiler: Odin is *not* the good guy. Our pro-tag is Shadow Moon, and while he is connected to Odin, and him and the other European gods are front and center they are **nobody's** savior, not the least of which humanity. They are selfish, arrogant and ignorant. That the remaining Native American gods want nothing to do with them or the coming war isn't necessarily a statement of their lack of existence or consideration. It could just be excused as them not wanting to get in to this mess.

4) I'd have to re-read the book, but I think, big emphasis on **think** they're the same person in the book, too, but it's a lot less clear. So it's less the issue with the showrunners, and more the source.

3 &amp; 6) Don't hold your breath. I can tell you there probably won't be any of those outside of brief mentions. Because that isn't the story they're telling here. Sorry.
