&gt;It's all you.

The ancients weren't wrong. 

I remember when I was a kid and I was so innocent and ignorant that I thought that every person and every animal felt the same way about me that I felt about them (I've always loved people and animals) so it was a great shock to me when I kept getting deceived by and hurt by others. For the longest time I always thought there was something wrong with me because of it. 

As I got older I realized my error. You can't really know others, but you can know yourself. Sure, there are traces of intentions in others that are recognizable as sincere or insincere, deceptive or honest, but what are you to discern them by if not by your own discernment? If you measure it by other peoples measures, you deceive yourself. If you measure it by your own, you deceive others. *Tricky*...
