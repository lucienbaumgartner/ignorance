I believe that under such "enlightened" circumstances we would most likely as a collective just kind of "know" as you so put it through a highly significant majority, similar to a mutually agreeable meeting of the minds amongst people who peacibly assemble. To further qualify this rather philosophical thought, I feel as though that inorder to reach the point of such an evolutionary step as a collective, this "jump" if you will - is accomplished as a matter of the natural progression and order of things; there is little to no chaos attached to it... meaning that the "intellectual fights/debates" of today would have already been cleared if that makes any sense; that we can all see that we can and will grow and better ourselves through these scientific discoveries only if we each are willing to take personal responsibility without hesitation, question or tolorance for nothing less than its highest responsible use to do good in this world. 



I don't think this process is connected to any "signal" (no alien beams, close encounters and/or second, third, fourth comings, etc)... I just think at some point the stark reality has to set in for those who remain blissfully ignorant and unaware that the world cannot continue on the path that it is currently on; that we can gain nothing out of our time and experience here if we continue to prevent progress by means of suppressing people and ideas which have positive scientific merit which stands to become both a gain and benefit for all peoples, solely on the basis of such an idea failing to align with religious, philosophical and or societal mores. I say this, because I think that at such point in time, perhaps akin to a point of critical mass where such an environment exists (and in no way am I describing a state of some "Utopia"), we will have long since moved into what can best be described as a higher plane of understanding and our minds will have already expanded as such that where for the consideration of such vital discoveries, we've reached a point in society where no longer is any value is placed on competition and outcompeting those with whom we do not agree with on the basis of religion and/or philosophies; the materialism and capitalism profound in our society today will have since lost its seductive and captivating appeal, and science will no longer be held captive to the same. Furthermore, that we at that defining moment in time have and will have reached a point where the very highest majority of individuals are capable of the highest thinking without prejudice, to view and see possibilities for what they truly are and how the same becoming a reality can truly achieve a greater good for a higher purpose. 



While this may seem totally out there, I believe the vast problem that exists today with scientific discovery, its progression (and quite honestly the world in general) is the fact that disputes exist out of ignorance, hatred and greed; where so many are willing to so easily dismiss scientific concepts and areas of promise sheerly because of their relationship to beliefs that do not necessarily match or reflect the reality in existance. This thought process is in no way atheistic, anti-religion or anti-God... it is simply stated to illustrate that until we learn to operate from our highest minds instead of our egos and/or through the constraints of many modern day religions, we will largely be stuck exactly where we are at right now; where someone ends up having to go to all the way to Israel for stem cells in efforts to give their child the ability to walk and speak again after traumatic brain injury (deep in the comments from the OP found [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1bc2gu/my_oldest_son_hasnt_said_a_word_to_his_little/) ) to the many individuals who refuse the gift of life through blood donation and/or transfusions and to those who refuse to become organ donors where a single body in death has the capacity to save 8 lives and improve the life of over 50 other individuals simply because of stated political and/or religious convictions that are supposed to hold life in the utmost and highest regard yet allows for many needless deaths to occur... if this makes any sense. It is my deepest wish for such things to stop and to not be in occurrence in the name of politics, religion or God. Science exists to help us and if anything to bring us closer to an understanding of a higher power and its relation to the Universe we know; not to divide us further and further into the semantics of divisiveness, exclusion and/or intolorence. If there is any "signal" to be had or rather sent - it would seem that the more of us who come to appreciate this simple fact and shine the candlelight on this very simple universal truth - the closer we come to achieving greater and greater things in this world in the name of science.



For the record considering I am aware that there has been particular "undertones" in my writing which one may easily confuse, I thought I would clarify for purely statistical purposes that I am not Atheist; I was raised and observant in the Roman Catholic Church and was also raised cognizant and observant of Jewish faith/traditions as both coexisted in my household growing up. As an adult, I honor both traditions in my household for what they are in terms of moral guidance (each respectively a different lens through which to view the world and apply its lessons) and where I engage in my own understandings of both God, Spirituality and my ultimate purpose here on Earth in this lifetime. While long and perhaps confusing to some, I hope this sheds some insight for you.
