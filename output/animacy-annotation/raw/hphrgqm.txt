&gt;Iâ€™m sorry, where in my post did you see me making any of those claims?

Nowhere, I apologise if that came across as personal, but it was a general response as to why the unvaccinated often receive a negative reaction. Unfortunately for every person that has a reasonable and open minded objection to being forced to take a vaccine, there's someone else pushing glaringly ignorant and outlandish claims as to why people shouldn't get it, and especially on this sub they run in the same circles. It's obviously not fair to jump everyone in the same category but that's life.
