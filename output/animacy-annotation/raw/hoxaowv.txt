&gt; But they're saying racists should be banned from a platform that revolves around a personalized experience.

Streaming on Twitch is taking a personalized experience and broadcasting it to the world. As mentioned before, a digital platform is no different than a shop that rents tables. You act shitty in their business and they have the right to ban you, because in allowing you to be there they are approving of whatever you. I don't see how that's so hard to understand. 

&gt;"I disagree with what you're saying, but I'll defend your right to say it"

As someone who loves to play devils advocate, this quote is just plain lazy and ignorant of what motivates a statement. People say and do things because they are motivated by the ideas behind them. People need to suffer the consequences and realize there are many "statements" that are not accepted because of the ideologies and actions they may promote. Racist, bigoted, ignorant, or hateful people don't just "say" things, their world is dictated by it.
