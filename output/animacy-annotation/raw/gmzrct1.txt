You really ask everyone you meet if they know what that word is?  I guarantee you there are TONS of people who don't know, but you just don't talk to em or don't talk to them about that.  And it's not surprising that people in construction would know what that word means given that is an urban planning term.  You said you hear it every day and its one of the most common words you hear -- trust me, you are absolutely in the minority there.  Most people don't even come close to hearing it daily.  

My whole point is that it's really arrogant and ignorant of you to assume everyone would know the word that you know.  I don't know how else to convince you.  There are a ton of people who don't know what that word means.  I don't think Raekwon is lying, that's a super weird assumption.
