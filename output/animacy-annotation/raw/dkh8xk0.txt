There is no "basic human nature" that prevents Communism. It's an ancient argument that has been repeatedly obliterated. The fact you choose to remain uneducated in this matter is just more absurdity and demonstrates your enormous amount of ignorance.

In Communism people can still succeed. In fact, one of the greatest aspects of Communism is giving more people a greater chance to succeed in life.

And 'wanting stuff' is not an argument either. People can still have "stuff". It's a non argument and further demonstrates you are fully and completely unaware and oblivious to what Communism actually is.

I'm not going to address any of your other arguments as they are simply repetitive nonsense and you're just moving goalposts in order to pretend your earlier arguments weren't completely annihilated. Which they were.
