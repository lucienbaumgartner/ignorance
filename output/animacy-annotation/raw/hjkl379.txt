Lol! This is so laughable and ignorant of what China is doing. 

China may do a lot of manufacting, but it is farrrr from providing the vast majority of manufactured goods.

Not to mention, China skirts the western world's environmental standards on what is being discharged to atmosphere.

All you are doing is proving my point that China is just as hypocritical as the rest of the world in pointing fingers. China will soon lead the world in emissions and dragging its feet on resolving its global problems.

Case and point, China still grows its military complex and expanding its military influence and hostility across Asia pacific. It doesn't want to lead in renewable growth, just political pandering.
