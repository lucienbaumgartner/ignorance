Each trip is different. You will never have 2 similar trips EVER! 
With that being said, psychedelics are teachers.  They open your eyes and your mind to thoughts and emotions youre both aware and unaware of. 
Im more of a mushroomer and ive had trips that were the most amazing time of my life and ones where i just wanted it to end cause i was over it.
What are you depressed about? Why are you depressed? 
Those are the questions you have to ask yourself to better hone in on where to focus on evolving that area to one of contment or happiness. 
Also youre a different person than you were during that first trip. Im very happy you were able to wrestle out of your first depression with that trip, but i know for myself i wouldn't solely rely on acid or shrooms as the crutch to aid in helping depression. They definitely can! 
But theres clearly things going on in your mind about your current overall outlook that need fixing. 
I wish you the best of luck in getting back to happy my fellow earthling!
