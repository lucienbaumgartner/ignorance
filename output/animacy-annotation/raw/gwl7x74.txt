This is going to sound really cheesy, but seriously, consider therapy.  


The more you analyze yourself, the more you can find the chinks in your own armor, and shore it up. Or even better, gain strengths that mean that weakness is no longer an issue.  


It's SO MUCH EASIER to tear people apart and get them to do what you want, when they're damaged, insecure, and unaware of their own hangups.  


So I guess not illegal, but unethical, would be "study psychology" on top of "go to counseling." So you can learn the tricks.  "Never Split The Difference" is a book that I REALLY like on that subject. It's from a guy who used to be a hostage negotiator.
