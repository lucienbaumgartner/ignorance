For as much as NTs can be annoyingly oblivious and ignorant of things, I think it's still worth broaching the conversation with them. You're right, it isn't our repressibility to rectify their knowledge short-comings. But if we do want to connect/live with them well, then unfortunately the weight of "enlightenment" as you put it, falls to us. Is that fair? No, and if you have little interest in connecting to NTs, then don't bother. But for someone like me who has NT friends and relatives I want to love and be loved by, I'm willing to heft the baton to bridge the gap. It's awkward, difficult, and frustrating, but what else is new about autistic life.
