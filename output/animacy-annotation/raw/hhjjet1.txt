Yes, I've since discoverd something called the Macon Water Authority Storm Credit manual that the good people at MWA either haven't a clue that it exists or don't want you to know.   I would venture to guess that more than half the county does not have storm drains, the farther out you get.   The MWA is banking on people not knowing this.   

They don't seem to list a form to fill out to apply for this exemption.  I think I will create one.   I think I would be justified in prefacing it as Macon Water Authority is so arrogant and ignorant that they don't even know or follow their own manuals.  Both times I've called, I've been told straight up lies.     Time to get the state and federal senators in on this.   But, it's not a tax, it's a fee, an unregulated, forever, whatever we say fee and you like it or take one for the team.
