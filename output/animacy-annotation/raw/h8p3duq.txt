**THIS IS MY JAM!**

----

What if Mimi stayed with Palmon - without much else to do in this peaceful and healing Digiworld, Mimi and Palmon go traveling to take her mind off being separated from her parents.

Their first destination is Baihumon's domain, where they find â€‹a surprise in the form of Zagamon's shop - a store managed by the Digital World's chief "artifact smith", maker of dragon-slaying swords and certain evolution item prototypes. As they lack any barter, they leave empty-handed.

Eventually, the Millenniummon fight. They've unlocked Rosemon by now, and manage to defeat MetalSeadramon before Ryo can. No different from there. For Tag Tamers, Mimi becomes Ken's elder-sister-figure and helping to train Wormmon, but nothing really changes. D1 Tamers is also unchanged.

Come 2002, Rosemon is now Palmon's base form, circumventing the Control Spires. Mimi and Rose are busy in Ebonwumon's land when the Emperor strikes, returning to the East circa episode 12 and utterly wrecking his stuff. No Kimeramon or Michael.

Ken seeing his old friend amid his defeat begins to stir memories, leading to the same reality-check. Mimi and Rose are both furious and unaware of this being the sweet boy they know. Only Davis stepping in to defend Ken saves the former Emperor. The end (because outta ideas).
