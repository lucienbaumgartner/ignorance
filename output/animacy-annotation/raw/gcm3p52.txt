Thank you for sharing, and congratulations on your victories in your personal mental health journey. You should be proud of yourself.

I had a similar experience. I played FF7 first as a child and didn't appreciate many of the nuances of Cloud's character. But in my teenage years, and especially my young adulthood, were heavily shaped by major depression and generalized anxiety, to the point that it profoundly impacted my life and my ability to function. It was when replaying the game multiple times over these years that I fully grew to understand and appreciate Cloud's struggles with himself, his identity, who he believed he was, and who he actually wanted be.

I also find Cloud truly inspiring -- to have a hero begin the game so truly broken and unaware of the extent of his brokenness, only to have him grow and confront himself, reject the falsehoods that have clouded *(pun intended)* his vision, accept his mistakes and his losses and his failures for what they are, and become a better, stronger, healthier, truer version of himself brings me to the verge of tears just thinking about it.

If Cloud could do it, I could do it. And it was hard -- therapy, medication, more therapy, a major change of life circumstances, a lot of self-reflection, and a lot of help from my friends later, and I am better and stronger and happier and more at peace than I ever was before. And it's not like my problems are magically gone. It's still hard sometimes. I think it always will be. But I know that I can do it. And I know you can too.

So when life seems tough, when the world seems hopeless and bleak, I remind myself that even Cloud and his friends weren't sure they wanted to venture into that final cavern -- but they did anyway. So can we.

Life can't contain us. Let's mosey!
