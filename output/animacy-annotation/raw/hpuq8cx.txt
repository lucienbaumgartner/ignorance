This Sub is for Illinois Legal cannabis market. What you’re looking for is a subreddit about growing so go find one. I agree that people get over priced a lot but you sound ignorant and childish for trying to insult people over what they decide to spend THIER  money on and to be honest you sound like you’re salty that you’re broke and cannot afford to pay the Illinois price. 

Btw, I’m a grower and don’t shop at Illinois dispo.
