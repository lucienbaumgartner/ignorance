I too have struggled with the self and this present experience as a personality. You can't deny that there is presently an experience of duality. Which I believe will always be the case so long as we are alive in the world with a body/mind. 

The self is playing hide and seek. When there are moments of awareness all  that remains is experiencing - a merging of experience (object) and experiencer (subject).  In these moments, I am in pure bliss like nothing in this world.  I use to chase this bliss but now I know that it's not needed . 

 As a body/mind you can try to remain aware between experiencer and experience.... But I am starting accept the perfection in all moments of my life - even when I am seemingly unaware and involved in the drama. 

I guess my point is to not over think this whole thing too much.
