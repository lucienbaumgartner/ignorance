I did try minoxidil didn't work out tho, I stopped using it because I have blood pressure problems. Started dutasteride injections but it took a huge toll on me mentally and my scalp,neck and shoulders were in pain for a week. I might get back to the injections but I am so afraid of being misdiagnosed especially that the dermatologists don't agree on a diagnosis. I did read about rosemary oil too so I started applying it 2 days ago but I really dislike feeling so lost and unaware of what I have and if what I lost will grow back.
