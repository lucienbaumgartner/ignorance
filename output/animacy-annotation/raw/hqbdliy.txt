Absolutely true.

I’ve also had this opinion that hasn’t really come up before, but is there really much reason to be upset by this? If someone is white, then they’re most likely from a white family and because of the way American racism has molded the country, they’re also more likely to live surrounded by loads of white people (more than the national %).

Obviously it comes off as ignorant and micro aggressions build on the very real racial issues in the country, but isn’t it just natural human behavior to speak from your perspective - where you are the baseline and you provide details that deviate from your baseline? Even here, I’m speaking completely from an American perspective because it’s the only perspective I know.

I know it can get mixed into dog whistles, and I’m pretty sure that’s why there’s this idea of a no tolerance policy for any phrase or concept that racist people could use to further push their beliefs.. it’s just kind of strange I guess.

TL;DR - Would this be wrong if racism ceased to exist, or is it that it’s a symptom of a racist culture that centers a specific race? Because at the individual level, it really just feels.. natural?
