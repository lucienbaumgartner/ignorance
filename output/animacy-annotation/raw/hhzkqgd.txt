In 1924, the company paid independent researchers to look into it and they ignored their findings that it was harmful. They ended up paying off another company to state radium was harmless. 

They absolutely knew it wasn’t harmless by that point but the CEO of the company was the one who invented radium paint. Surely he didn’t know at the beginning how dangerous it was to begin with but they definitely knew after that research. 

(Him dying of cancer actually helped the Radium Girl’s case though! The company couldn’t keep writing off their illnesses and paying doctors to call it syphilis or other diseases.)

Even then, they still told the girls to lick the brushes so the company’s management aren’t completely innocent and unaware of the dangers. They still kept the women in the dark while scientists and management worked carefully with radium.
