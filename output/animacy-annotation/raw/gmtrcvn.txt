Bro... You are so incorrect and ignorant that it’s laughable. Straight people will always exist. Always. Just like gay people. And even if for some reason all straights went extinct, babies can still be made scientifically. Sexual intercourse doesn’t need to physically happen to make a baby anymore. 

Out of all the things that could cause human extinction, gay rights is literally like the last thing.
