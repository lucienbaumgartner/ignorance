Kids are (usually) woefully unaware of the horrors of real life, this includes death.

Think of it this way, most kids think the world revolves around them almost like they're the main character of something, this put the possibility of any real defeat out of their heads until they've lived long-enough to have understood life or have had a dream crushed. 

That woman understood that death was 1 second away and instead of reacting to the fear she was overwhelmed by it and froze. Her son, a combination of blissfully unaware and brave didn't even consider the possibility of death. 

Obviously I'm not a mind reader, this is just speculation from my anecdotal experience, just adding to the conversation.
