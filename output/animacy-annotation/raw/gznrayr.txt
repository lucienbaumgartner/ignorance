NAH - if he was unaware and shocked that the kid he thinks of as a daughter refers to him outside the house as her stepfather, it seems like a normal question to ask - and he certainly has the right to ask for clarification when he hears himself being referred to in a way that he was not expecting.  It probably hurt his feelings.  Telling him he shouldn’t ask you for clarification does seem a bit rude - saying that’s how your stepdaughter refers to you is a perfectly reasonable explanation.
