This is actually just way more efficient. I try to coast and keep and much speed as possible without accelerating to catch the green without braking. Engine braking with a manual/manual mode can add a lot of control to this as well (braking more slowly and not lighting up brake lights). Doesn’t always work out but when it does time out really well for me there’s usually some dick that pulls out from the adjacent lane at the last second to take 1/2 a mile to pass the 4 cars ahead of him when I could have been hundreds of yards past them all in the same amount of time while using less gas if he just wasn’t a dick...Ugh. 

Sorry... I hate unaware and inconsiderate drivers
