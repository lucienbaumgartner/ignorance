I think it's really situational, in the instance of this video no behavior change happened with the creeper until the guy started to acknowledge him, that's when the creeper started to leave. I'm not saying this is always the best route. I think you're right that the ratio of risk is way too high for a individual or group to confront a creeper. At the same time I think in this instance the creeper wasn't going to leave unless he was confronted. Thats just my thoughts on it. 

I'm sorry you seem to deal with so many creepers in your personal life. Makes me sad to be a guy when so many are so unaware and so awful toward women. I hope you carry some pepper spray or something. I carry some personally but really just for all the crazy homeless people trying to rob me in my area.
