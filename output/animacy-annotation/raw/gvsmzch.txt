Vietnam would like to have a word with you. They literally pushed out the US that were using apaches equipped with mounted machine guns and napalm.... And yet they still lost. And these are simple rice farmers.  So when you say a single heli. You actually sound really stupid and ignorant of the History of wars 

Nice strawman arguments though, no was even was talking about masculinity, god you have a agenda that's so easy to read.
