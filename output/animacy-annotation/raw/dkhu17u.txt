I assume you would know most of this but here are some things to keep in mind.

1. try to attack unaware and vulnerable enemies, prioritize the healers and damage dealers.
2. don't put yourself into a situation where multiple people are focused on you without teammate support
3. utilize your mobility to mess with the enemy team's aim by wall jumping, double jumping, etc. You should always be moving.
4. Remember your swift strike resets on an elimination and when beginning your ultimate.
