Comparing being called a Russian to being called the n word is a specious comparison and completely ignores the history if that word in this country.  So, your attempt to compare the stories is ineffective on its face.  

And I really think that anyone who tries to compare being called a dirty Russian in America to being called the n-word is so lost and ignorant that there can really not be any saving or helping them.  If you want to become less ignorant, there are resources but you do not want to become better educated so instead you'll attempt to equate two completely different things to make a point that is nonsensical on its face.  

Given the differences your story isn't even similar.  I don't even think Russian is a race?  It's an ethnicity, but most Russians would be considered white.
