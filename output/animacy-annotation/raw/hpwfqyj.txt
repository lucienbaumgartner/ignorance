Your reply is the most ignorant mis informed opinion. I think you are in your own bubble of facing colour issues:




1. Why didn't you mention to ask short people who would have heard numerous hurtful comments from friends families and even strangers.And are reminded of it on dating apps. Whereas dusky people are not discriminated on dating apps. 

&gt;Colourism affects more people. Short height disproportionately affects men whereas colourism is more of an equal opportunity offender and men are not spared either

2. God you are so naive. So have you heard "tall dark handsome"? The sentence itself says heightism and colourism doesn't affect men because dark is preferred. So colourism is not equal opportunity. Also there are so many solutions in market to look fair. you need to spend money and there are no to little sife effects of using those products or surgery available. Dermatology deals with it. Where as no surgery or products or medicine available to change height and whatever is available is painful and has so many side effects and is rarely advisable. Only in case of some genetic bone or muscle disease.

&gt; There have been multiple campaigns, advertisements etc.

3. This is because of feminism. Feminist only talk about issues women have and fight for it. Heightism is not an issues for women but men. Men don't fight for it or dont care.  Since there is no movement such as feminism for men they keep suffering.

I think you are really young , ignorant and unintellectual that you have given the worst possible wrong reasons to support one's point one could ever come up with. You are also just looking this at one point of view because you have probably faced issues due to colourism and not height so you are tunnrl vissioned and have no empathy to other people's problem.
