My apologies. I must have completely misunderstood and forgive me but I didn't just learn about this topic yesterday. For the most part I am unconvinced that these orders are mere *policy vehicles*. My lens is the National Security State theory. I assert we are completely unaware and unadvised as to the far-reaching powers that executive orders engender. I fear many take these far too politically and far less investigate the long-term implications. Perhaps we aren't that far apart on sensing alarm on the issue but coming from different perspectives.
