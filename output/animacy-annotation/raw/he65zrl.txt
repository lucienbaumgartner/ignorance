Not the person you've been debating with but I really have never heard that the RP itself is what becomes complex about high level d20 tabletop. I think he has a point. Sure, they have more options but those options are generally laid out by their choices.

There is absolutely no 'difference' between

Location A -&gt; Walk to town -&gt; Location B

and

Location A -&gt; Teleport -&gt; Location B

I don't think I've ever heard of players just teleporting randomly without some communique with the GM. 

&gt; At level 1, if they find a ring from the princess a hundred miles north, they'll likely ask around, see if there are rumors about what she did on her visit.

I don't, personally, like this argument because it can be used the other way around. If the players are at level 14 (teleport level) and find the ring you can say they'll "likely" find a way to teleport to the princess. They have as many choices to be random and ignorant of the likely path at level 1 (hey I heard there's a haunted swamp let's ignore this quest and go there!) as they do at level 14. 

Does combat get more complex? Undoubtedly so, and CR begins to fall apart in 5e really fast as a GM tool. But... come on, the RP? It's still a technically open world, the players just go around it a little faster.
