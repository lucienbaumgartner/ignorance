Congratulations on you journey towards wellness, watch those triggers, I was adding contrast to your story as to bpd that are not treated or receiving treatment as to add emphasis to how well your doing from treatment , I did not say you did those things but surly you can understand that being remanded in custody for 2 years on false charges with the threat of 20 years in jail because one wants out of a toxic relationship would make anyone sour. You did mention relationship issues , how is that going for you ? I hope you can share more details of what your challenges are and what your going through,  this is a psychological disorder , it is learned behaviour so can be cured , it can run in families I’m aware. To what extent some people with bpd will go to to set up a traumatic event in someone they say they love’s life is what really shocked me . Sorry for you if you took offence or were caused anguish by these comments . I hope some one else desires to get therapy by reading these discussions , you may actually be surprised to realise your not alone and that the statistics are low when it comes to how widespread this personality disorder is , More transparency is essential to stop the traumatic events that play a cyclical roll. Some seem blameless and unaware that they are doing anything wrong to anyone but themselves.
