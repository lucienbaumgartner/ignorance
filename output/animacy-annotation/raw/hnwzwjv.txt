This isn't just unpopular, it's wrong and ignorant.

"That money has already been taxed!"

Well... no shit. ALL money has already been taxed. You buy gum, taxes get paid. The store clerk gets the money and guess what, he pays fucking taxes. He buys a car next week, and guess what? TAXES. You pull a salary from the auto manufacturer? Taxes. You take that salary down to buy gum? Taxed again.

Every time any money changes hands it is taxed. Why should inheritance be different?
