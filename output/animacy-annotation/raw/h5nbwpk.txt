My articles are “cherry picked” but yours are “solid facts”? Lmao keep tripling down on being ignorant and unaware of reality.

What was the point of posting that article? I already said above that countries are underreporting their death numbers. Proof that you’re not even reading what I’ve been saying in my previous comments lmfao.

&gt; Peru has a population of 32 million, their overall death toll in no way comes close to beating the US lol.

Oh yes, there’s definitely *no way* 600,000+ people can die in a country of 32 million…A poor country who doesn’t even have accurate tracking systems 🤣 Definitely impossible!! /s

Seriously though; this is the funniest and most illogical argument I’ve ever had with anyone on Reddit. When did this website become full of teenagers who think they know better? Smdh
