So let me put it to you....I could say "you've never been one, so you don't know" or gush about excellent teachers I've had, or tell you no one gives a shit about your unqualified opinion that only math and science matter and how short sighted and ignorant that is, or that your experience is just your experience but instead I'll ask you, what do you do for a living? What magnificent thing do you do? How much do you get paid? See, i know you've had bad teachers so I get you want to paint them all the same, but i want to know what you do so i can see if I've had a shitty version of your job in my life and maybe then i can whine about them and how they're all the same, or don't deserve their pay-hey maybe you are shitty at whatever it is you do. But before i did that (actually i can do it now) is realize that there are shitty people in every job, and that most jobs are important even if you don't understand why. Yes there are martyr teachers, but there are the self important in every job-again perhaps you think your job is soooo much more important than others. So yourself a favor-find a teacher and see if you can follow them for a week. It may change your mind...
