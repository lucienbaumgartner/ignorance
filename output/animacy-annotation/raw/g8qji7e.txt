That was when I was 11 years old. My father wanted me to attend big,good schools and I had chance to get in one. It was very far from my house like an hour ride in top speed. So in 2012, I was just going there for few days. I didn't know my way properly since I never really had to before. There was a fucking political campaign and a lot of public transportation was called off that day. It was real struggle to find a bus to get home. So I was waiting,dumb and unaware of my surroundings. A old man in a old bike came up to me and asked if he could give me a ride. It wasn't a good offer for anyone back in those days. Kidnappers, hijackers were so prevailing that time that my mom warned all the fucking time. I declined. He insisted saying things aren't gonna get better and at this rate I might not get home until nightfall. Yet I declined saying I don't have problems and I'm just waiting for my car to arrive. And he left off looking disappointed. I have had old fuckers harass me twice later in my life. In 2013 and 2014 and my old fucking man didn't do anything to help me  the first time even though he was 5 feet far from me in the bus.
