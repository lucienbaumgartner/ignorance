He's clearly trying to explain how the laws work, and you are too dense to realize it. /u/striatedglutes is right, you don't owe taxes until you sell. If you don't sell, you don't owe taxes. Yet.

In this case, what people are complaining about is that Elon is following the law? Should we tell him, no sir, you are a billionaire, you should not follow the law, you should do what you know is right? HAH, IMAGINE YOUR FUCKING PANTALOONS THEN, ALL TWISTED UP AND SQUEEZING YOUR PRIVATES UNCOMFORTABLY. Please, you'd have a fit.

There's no problem here, except people are stupid and ignorant of how things work. Someone throws a torch at someone else and says, "THAT"S THE GUY&lt; GET HIM!" Except it's not Elon, or Jeff, or any of these rich as fuck people that are the problem. 

It's you mr, "WHY ISNT EL0N P4YING TAXES????//??", being ignorant and making noise about the wrong shit, factually incorrect shit, and logically flawed arguments. Whatever, like you will even read past the first paragraph... It's the system that's setup to favor the rich, and favor the investor class. It's the government for not fixing it for the people.
