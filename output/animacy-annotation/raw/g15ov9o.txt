..Kay. You've listed out two things that you have no evidence for, and which are also basically irrelevant, given that our PMCs and scavs aren't exactly walking around unaware and unprepared, and a third thing that's just... ..The bit that you're saying you weren't saying. Except you're specifically saying it, *again*.

You're pretty clearly not equipped to handle any sort of discussion (Unsurprisingly. That's usually the case with someone who'll instantly downvote every comment that replies theirs that they disagree with), so I'm dipping out. Good luck.
