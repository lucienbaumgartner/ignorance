FULL STOP NO. Absolutely NO. DO not encourage this behavior. Do not encourage people to go get catfished on Snapchat where they can have money stolen from them or scammed in other ways. Do not encourage this off-topic spam that pollutes this subreddit and ruins its purpose. Do not encourage people to be mindless and clueless and ignorant of the fact that they're being scammed. Do not encourage theft of other people's property. FULL STOP NO.

Although I can't be shocked someone named Android is defending bots.
