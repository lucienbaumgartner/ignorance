Definitely don’t apologize! You’re right, it IS a meaningful and large event - but who is it meaningful *for*? The bride and groom! It’s them who will be looking back at this event years from now and hopefully have some great memories from it, so it’s *their* opinions that matter here, not your parent’s or some random guest’s. This day is not going to matter to anyone else, even other family members, nearly as much as it’s going to matter to your sister and her husband. If anyone’s uncomfortable, it’s due to their own bigotry, and neither you or your sister should worry about that. If they can’t accept a *cake*, how are they going to accept the actual trans person in their lives? Best to put your foot down and make it clear now that neither you or your sister will enable their ignorant and childish behavior. If they want to be part of her special day, they can either get over it, or they can stay home.
