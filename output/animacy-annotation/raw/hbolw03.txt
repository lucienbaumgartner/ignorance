I usted to go on alot of rants about being enlisted and this topic was one of my favorites.
So typically a sailor that gets to their 1st duty station  (usually a ship) gets there all bright eyed and unaware of the drudgery to come. They come to the end of wrapping up that tour and have been bombarded by the retention folks (the career counselor, their chief and who ever else took the time to ask the sailor about their future plans). Usually a good pitch is something along the lines of... you just did 4 yrs on this old rusty pos ship. You earned a break. Go get in on some of the laid back time on shore duty. Hell, take a general duty bullet. I know a guy who handed out basketballs at a gym in (insert enticing duty station here) for 3 years and he had so much liberty.... dnt get me started on the beautiful ladies, the food, the house he rented for next to nothing.

They entice the young sailor and next thing you know they are on shore duty in I dunno.... Pascagoula,MS bc it's all the detailer had at the time or some shit. 
That sailor makes the beat of it bc that's what we do then they start to forget all those long days out to sea and how they got put on Class C liberty for being 3 minutes late from liberty in Arhus Denmark and  the OOD isnt giving 2 shits about how you were making out with that FHM model that was here for a photo shoot.
(Not MY story but I was witness to it). So they feel like sea duty wasn't too bad and get in on another hitch back out to the USS Ain'tnevergonnabeinhomeport. 

The vicious cycle starts again. They make rank, more money, some perks (no more being the low man on the totem pole) and before they know it the CC is asking g about their retirement package.
