I can think of one instance. SPOILER ALERT


When Dell goes to the Snells' house, he comes in with ONE henchman, who isn't even ready or aware enough to see the wife grab a shotgun and blow his head off? A guy who made it to the top of the cartel, who is known for being extremely precise and prepared, is going to be so reckless and unaware that he lets a backwoods crazy lady get the best of him? His guy couldn't be on top of that? I had to suspend disbelief for that one.
