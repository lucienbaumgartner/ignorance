So my comment was sarcastic and obviously would trigger end less ethical concerns. With that said the replies are missing the point. Smoking, obesity and other “self chosen” issues are typically the result of other underlying issues that have led to the addiction (smoking) or issues of obesity. To suggest people who are obese have “chosen” to be that way is an incredibly ignorant and lazy take.  Now back to the unvaccinated. Unlike obesity or other “self chosen” afflictions, these people aren’t causing massive societal disruption as a result of their own individual choice. My kids have never been forced to stay home from school because to many smokers are in ICU, my elderly mother has never had to isolate from us because a rash of obese patients have suddenly surged into ICU’s, my company hasn’t had to lay off good people because the community is overwhelmed with patients seeking dialysis. We have a semi clear path out of this once in 4 generation existential crisis yet the selfish decisions of a small group of conspiracy obsessed, Facebook users keeps holding us back. I get that the sarcastic solution I proposed is loaded with moral challenges, but please don’t equate these selfish morons with some poor soul who has underlying health issues that manifests itself in obesity.
