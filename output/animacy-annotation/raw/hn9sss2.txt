&gt;Maybe people who are afraid and ignorant of firearms and want to take away responsible owners’ right to own them are the assholes? Maybe if they’re offended it’s a personal problem. 

Dude I've always had guns in my house, anywhere from a .308 to a .30-06, a 20 gage, 12 gage, a (terrible) 10 gage at one point. Different plinker rifles mostly in .22, many more i couldnt even remember. There is no reason someone needs a fucking m60, I'm sorry but it just needs to be said. That toxic "yeah, look at MY GUNS libs, how do you like that I can have this and you can't do anything" is the mentality behind owning and operating a gun like that unless you are in a very niche group like a military historian or veteran involved in heritage preservation. It's also the same mentality that separates our country from other gun loving, responsible first world countries like Switzerland and Finland where they don't have rampant gun crime.

And yes, it is common, you know what isn't common, taking pictures like this. The only time it is done is to show off your guns, and that's not what a gun is for or the mentality that should be behind operating it. When it leaks in and becomes part of your families and your own identity its no longer a tool with a purpose, it's an issue
