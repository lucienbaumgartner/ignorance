As a child of divorce I’ll give my 2 cents. I’m 23 and my parents have been divorced for 10 years. My dad is my rock and he is moving out of state in 2 weeks. My life will not be the same without him here, however I’m 23 and life will go on. If I was younger and unaware of the toxic traits of my mother like I am now I can say without a shadow of a doubt him I wouldn’t be who I am, I would still have a screwed view of him, and we would never have developed the closeness we have. We have this closeness because all my life I knew I could call and he would answer to come help with anything. Whether it be getting too drunk at a party in highschool, or a broken down car on the freeway he answers at 3am. With him gone, the worry of who I can call upon for help is scary. 

Basically, what I am getting at is you have to evaluate the closeness you have now, could it be stronger and would they benefit from that? This probably depends on their age and the stability of their family unit on their hometown. Also, depending on their age it might be worth while to ask them how they feel about the arrangement, would they like it you’re closer or do they feel ok about coming to visit. Don’t feel guilty for wondering about this. If you know you put the time in to make the right decision in the first place then you’re just checking in with yourself and making sure it still sits right with you, which is a good thing!
