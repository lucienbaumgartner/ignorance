I understand #2, #3 and #4 but #1 just sounds like you're trying to find an excuse to justify the return at this point. Price? You were aware of how much those things cost before you purchased the AirPods. It wasn't like you found out how expensive the Max is AFTER Apple swiped your card. 

Regarding the accessories in the box, again, you should already be aware of what to expect before you spend so much money on a pair of headphones. You make it sound like you had no clue what you'd find in the box and are surprised that the box doesn't contain the things that you've mentioned as if Apple is obliged to provide all those things. 

So, to sum up your 1st point, it sounds like you went into the purchase completely blind and unaware of how much the headphones would cost or what the headphones would include and honestly it just sounds like you're nitpicking at that point.

I agree with your other points even though I'm not a Max user since they seem to be more logical.
