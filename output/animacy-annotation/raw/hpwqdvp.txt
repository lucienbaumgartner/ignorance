&gt;Apparently idiots can make it into med school too.

I have met too many idiots during med school, I just cannot trust the junior medical doctors anymore in the country where I live in. It's a very weird feeling because I'm sure these doctors have scored higher marks than I did in med school (I was borderline failing med school, because I was very confused with the inconsistency in medical education).

I didn't even continue with my clinical practice, partly also because I have seen many misinformed and arrogant doctors, and I don't want to work with those type of people. Now when I bring my family to see a doctor, I make sure I double check my facts beforehand, and I will choose to see a specialist from a teaching hospital, or a private hospital with good reputation.

I also know some medical doctors who are involved in MLM and selling these "herbs" or "supplements" to people. It's downright ignorant and unethical. I really don't understand people.
