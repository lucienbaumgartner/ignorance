I'm not buying that your friend earns "near to" your partner on a minimum wage job. EVEN with WFF that seems highly unlikely. You say he works part time only? What evidence do you have to prove this?   
So let's say he actually worked 40hrs a week for $21phr..that's 35k take home a YEAR.   
And with the maximum WFF...they might get another 200 per week approx...so 45k a year.  But he earns less than that, as he is part time only. So many benefits you say? What ones precisely?  


So your husband earns less than 45k  a year but you have a mortgage that you can afford, and you can stay home with your family? How?  Is he self -employed?   


It's really shit to see people who are also doing their best, while you are clearly in a position of privilege and say that you "deserve" more.   


Why? You sound very selfish and unaware of your on luxuries.
