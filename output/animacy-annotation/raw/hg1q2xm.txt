I did not say you chose to be a victim. I said you can choose not to be one. 

I stay by that statement and I’m not interested in an argument - since you have already decided that I’m not worthy of your time or attention due to me being amoral and ignorant of your condition. 

I empathise with you and I beleive that it is indeed very hard for you not to take offense here. 

I do refuse to feel sorry for you however as I do not see you as miserable. 

At the end, you can either take this as another offense or try and realize what’s the difference between living with a condition and being a victim of it. That is the choice you can make.
