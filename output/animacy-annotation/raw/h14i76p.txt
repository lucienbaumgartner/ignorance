I am mentally disabled myself, autistic specifically. So many of the specialists I’ve seen and dealt with are like this. Just totally dismissive and ignorant of my agency as a human being!

I remember in school once they pulled me out of class to meet with this new therapist or whatever, I shook her hand cause I was a polite kid and then she just didn’t let go of my hand. She walked me out of the classroom in front of all my classmates holding my hand like I was a toddler. So embarrassing! I was too embarrassed to even ask her to let go.

I can’t remember all the experiences I’ve had like this but the fact that it happened in front of my entire class makes this stand out in my memory.
