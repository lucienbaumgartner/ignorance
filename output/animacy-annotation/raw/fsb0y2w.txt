You shouldnt be sorry for getting worked up. This guys pulling the "B-b-but y-youre b-being racist t-too" argument. Like no, I can guaran-fucking-tee a white man that forgot to put his turn signal on wouldnt have a cop come up to the car already gun drawn. This guy is an ignorant piece of shit, he said "but theres no evidence of a gun being drawn" the cop doesnt refute it, so it obviously means that the gun was drawn. This dude is sitting in his own shit pile of ignorance and racism. If he believes that this is right and this is what should happen, WHEN SOMEONE FORGETS TO TURN ON A TURN SIGNAL, hes not a patriot, hes a racist. That word gets thrown around on reddit a lot, but come on dude, hes so utterly racist and ignorant that it hurts. Literally, it pains me
