Lol you seem to be getting emotional. Quick tip, hoarding and investing don’t mean the same thing, in fact they mean opposite things. And I am an economist, you poorly informed, conspiracy theory believing retard. That you are so poorly informed and ignorant of economics is why you’re now trying to categorise me to dismiss me rather than try to defend the conspiratorial nonsense which you believe, because the conspiratorial nonsense which you believe doesn’t stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. Don’t use words you don’t understand and don’t talk about things of which you are clearly ignorant.
