This is very true. I recently started A2G farming and I will hard nope out as soon as my ESF gets to around 75% or I take a big hit because at that point I can be bursted down quickly enough that I wont have time to get away in open terrain. MBTs and AP Lightnings are still a scary thought if they catch you unaware and hoverpodding.
