I feel like Michael's kids wouldn't be the shy weirdness that is Michael Cera. Having Holly and Michael as parents would probably make you embarrassingly unaware and outgoing, as both of them are. Either that or they'd be similar to Stanley, in their teenage years, being fed up with their parents constant shenanigans
