Most people on jobseeker have experience with them.

You will still need to meet your mutual obligations (20 jobs a month, not allowed to refuse a reasonable job etc..).

You will have to got their office once a month ( every 3 weeks if their assholes). Where they will give you "Advice" and tick a box that means you keep getting paid. 

It's unlikely you will see the same one more than a few times, as they are regularly fired, quit and promoted. Even if you do, it's unlikely they will ever look at your resume, let alone remember your name.

There performance varies wildly, the best you can hope for is one that doesn't want to waste your time any more than there own time. As even the well intentioned JSPs are generally woefully incompetent and ignorant of how to get a job and how to use a computer for more than Facebook.
