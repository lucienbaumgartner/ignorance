Yes I second this the first session should be a group session with op her son, husband and daughters. They need to air all of there thoughts and feelings in a sage environment make sure jayden knows nothings changed for you, your still his mother and you still love him. His whole worlds been turned upside down and it will affect everything from now on. Honestly it's a shame you weren't a more convincing liar he could have been innocent and ignorant of all of this but it is what it is I guess.
