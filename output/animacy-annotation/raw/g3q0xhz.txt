How so? what users need is apps and games, no just build in features, which is why windows phone failed despite having all the the feature you would've expected and OS to have at its time, it was the lack of apps that killed it.

Same as the firephone from Amazon, no play store = failed and that phone was ridiculously cheap.

But the average mobile user will notice when they buy, for example, a Huawei phone and discovers the play store is not there so he can't download the YouTube app
