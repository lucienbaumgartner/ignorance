Have you read the book? Honestly? I'll buy you a copy if you haven't. If you want to ban a book, I think it is imperative you actually read it for yourself. Otherwise you are making an ignorant and dangerous recommendation. Same thing when we have ancient technophobes legislating on our behalf that don't understand how basic internet works.

I understand the desire to shield kids from questionable material, but I agree with /u/TexasITdude71 on this one in intent and who should be doing this.

I actually have read this book. It is not what you think it is. It's an auto-biography that is written to help kids who need it understand what they are going through, and to offer perspective for hetero normative folks understand others' better.

The biggest issue with the book is that it is teaching people to be more open minded about sexuality and coming to terms with who you are.
