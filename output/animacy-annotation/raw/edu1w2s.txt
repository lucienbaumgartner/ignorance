Someone said this further up on this thread: Trudeau was trying to calm things down. The questioner as respectful as he probably knew how to and Trudeau responded in a way that didn't say "you're stupid and ignorant." That strategy probably makes more of an impression than making people defensive. There were no raised voices or disrespect.
