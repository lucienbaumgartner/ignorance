I agree mostly because pokemon showdown exists. Temtem takes so fing long to get to pvp, especially because breeding is insanely expensive. This game would benefit from just straight up copying pokemon showdown for an island. Otherwise the combat in temtem is superior for pvp as it is far better balanced. The 2v2 as default makes things a little more strategic just by multiplying choices where as 1v1 is default limits turn 1 potential making stall teams ridiculous. The variety op is talking about is sorta there but you go grab a lvl 1 magnemite (think thats the one) w/ sturdy and recycle for berry juice and toxic spikes somewhere on a team and you'll never lose. Maybe drop a poke with unaware and cosmic power. Shit is ridiculous.
