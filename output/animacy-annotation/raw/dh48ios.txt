Nobody is paying me to spread the truth, I regard it as a public service to try and inform unaware and uninformed people (in the probably futile hope of improving Western governance and governments).

I like to stay up to date with current affairs and politics. I post out far more articles and truth on twitter than I do on Reddit.

Reddit is very heavily censored, controlled and vote brigaded by paid Establishment trolls and their ignorant Useful Idiots, but you can't be down voted or deleted on twitter.

Here's my twitter account https://twitter.com/Ian56789

I compile a lot of the most useful information on the Neocon Wars, Establishment corruption, the destruction of free society and civil liberties, Geopolitics, and Corporate controlled media propaganda, in articles on my blog http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/?view=magazine
