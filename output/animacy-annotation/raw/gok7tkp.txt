I’d like to refute these points, if I may.

*USTR is now too difficult*

The solution to USTR wasn’t to just make it extremely hard for the playerbase as well as nerfing all rewards, literally no one asked for this. When people asked for a USTR, the majority expected it to be more of a challenge, yes, but with good rewards and items to come from it, as well as possibly making it weekly. Just because people auto’d the old one doesn’t mean ramping up the difficulty to the max is a solution, it means actually fixing the game and planning a good difficulty for the majority of players. (and fixing the AI, but that’s a different problem.)

*500 CC has been removed*

That should’ve never been removed. It was a great event that gave out a consistent 500 CC, and something the majority of the player base looked towards to, even on those extremely garbage reset weeks. Sure, “Zenkais” in the shop is a great thing for some PvP players, but removing the 500 CC, one of the ONLY consistent ways of getting CC is extremely stupid and ignorant of the playerbase. Zenkais should’ve been added alongside the new rewards, not replace them. Not only that, what about the people who don’t give a damn about zenkais? At least with the 500 CC, PvP and Casual players can at least use them equally, with zenkais casual players who don’t care about zenkais have no reason to try this revamped USTR.

*The new banner is good*

I somewhat agree with this one, although I hate the fact that zenkais are being shoved down everyone’s throat now. Nothing wrong with the banner since it is a “zenkai” revamp, but everyone mostly expected a new banner with recent new units, not super old ass units that are just a zenkai training board.
