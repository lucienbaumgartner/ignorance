I guess we have different experiences. 

Anyway, after living in NYC for so long then moving here, the lack of regard for personal space is painfully noticeable, bags or standing in front of escalators or sudden stops in major walkways without looking or anything.

Most things I have adjusted to, but this one I just cannot. I donâ€™t understand how one can be so unaware and careless about other humans around them.
