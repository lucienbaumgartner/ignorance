I personally fall victim to the second point. I've got to the point where I wont run ACT myself anymore, because even though I would never be toxic to people or bring up numbers in party, I did notice that I would look at the ranking and if people weren't performing to my standards, I would get angrier a lot quicker, and leave a lot quicker(In PF for extremes/savage)

Running without it, when I am confident in my class and don't need it to know I'm doing OK, leads to me being more forgiving and unaware of any issues like a healer mainly healing instead of dps a lot. If I clear, that's more important, as finding a new party would take a lot longer than working out the issues in the current party.
