I think there are brexiters who can give you a cogent reason, no doubt. I fully respect anyone who voted to leave based on the way that the EU has shifted Labour markets from the UK to European countries. Or even those who mistakenly believe that the EU is undemocratic (look at the turnout in European elections! Nobody cared to participate in the democracy)

And I’ll even accept that the EU and the UK government did a terrible job over the intervening years of highlighting the benefits of membership whilst the right wing media attacked it. Even Cameron’s going to get a new deal was a mistake that served to accept the sold narrative of the EU as a bad thing. 

But I live in a 67% leave voting area. And most people here just say immigration.

People with no prior interest in politics or understanding how things work living in area with incredibly low immigration. 

It’s the misinformed and ignorant that _decided_ this. Something Farage and co knew all along and played for from the outset.
