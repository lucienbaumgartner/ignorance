Tell me you don’t understand taxes without telling me you don’t understand taxes. You’re right, it’s the percentage, you pay a percentage of your income. Not your net worth. He also pays a percentage of his income at an even higher rate. The reason you’re complaining is because he makes more money than you. And to say he didn’t earn his money because no one can earn that much just makes you sound ignorant and jealous. He came to this country with nothing and co-created PayPal and then sold it then used that money to create Tesla and all his other companies. What company have you created?
