I agree with your points in general but I’m still lost on calling the Capitol event a “coup attempt” or Trump and MAGA fascists.  

When thousands descended on the Capitol and occupied the Hart Building, refusing to leave or keep from offices in protest of Kavanaugh, that wasn’t a coup.  CHAZ/CHOP wasn’t a coup.  Burning or occupying police stations and federal court building, also not a coup.  This failed protest/riot/trump ego hour event, also not a coup.

People cheerleading heavy-handed federal law enforcement response against their political opponents are just sad, and ignorant of how this plays out in the state taking advantage of their useful idiocy.  Of course, arrest and charge the worse offenders like with the other events and move on.  It’s hilarious, all the pearl clutching: “oh muh sacred grounds of endless war and insider trading, how could these fascist dare commit this vandalism?!”  We are just going to talk past the violence this summer and the Democrats excusing it or blatantly encouraging it apparently.  And all of that is bad, but pretending Trump is a fascist and this sort of incitement is unique to him lacks historical perspective and factual basis. 

I’m not religious but I had no problem defending Muslims after the 9/11 backlash.  Religions have their extremists and some of their leaders incite anger with their words, too, but thats not everyone involved, or the totality of adhering to a religion or supporting a specific leader.  Same principle applies here.  75 million people are not fascists or supporters of fascists.  Apparently no one learned anything about cheerleading the police state either.
