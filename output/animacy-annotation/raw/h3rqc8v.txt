Josh is just a wreck and being a recovering addict i should have hope or feel a shred of empathy for him. But, I can't he's so smug and ignorant that he thinks he knows it all and no matter what type of direction, advice or tough love you give that moron he will either take it as a personal attack or do his whole no, no, no, no thing to it. So, piss on him and let him continue to completely piss his already sad life away with booze and God only knows whatelse. Idk whatelse it could be, but I'm certain he's using some other mind altering chemical other than booze. He's his own worse enemy and unfortunately the only person who can convince him he has a problem or ever needs help is himself and well.... Josh only listens to himself well and Watson and Popp.
