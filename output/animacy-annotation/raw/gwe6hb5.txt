You just provoked an interesting thought; maybe Jens relationship wth Bentley is reflective of the one she maybe never had with Rhine. The whole "Bentley sleeps in the bed with her" comment/discussion reminded me of my MIL who would exercise the same level of "controlling love" (result of her being a narcissist) over her granddaughter, because this granddaughter (unlike her others) was the youngest and unaware of all the drama &amp; victim complex'n MIL carries &amp; causes. I'm getting a similar vibe from Jen in terms of Bentley being a "fresh start" for to try to enstill her/their ideals into his head. 🤷‍♀️

I'm stoned &amp; over here  thinking I'm Dr.Drew or some shit 😂😂😂
