Attributing these pedophilic behaviors to simply "some men" is just ignorant and harmful to everyone. "Some men" aren't the problem, it's a very specific type of man that reasonable men reject. This man being talked about in the original post is fucking foul, but oh some men are disgusting animals. Yes, I guess that is an objective fact. But there is a much bigger and precise issue at hand than just "some men," so why not just call em whatever they are: pedos, pervs, whatever, and not simply as a part of "some men" because how does that help anything? 

I've heard enough true crime via my wife's podcasts to last a couple lifetimes, but thanks for the suggestion.
