Thanks for the link. It’s a good read. It’s almost as if the first strike set off some chemical, some ‘lightening rod’ in his body. What I’m curious about is apparently there must be different strengths of lightening hits. Because some are fatal, some, from Roy’s story, are barely noticeable. I sound ignorant and naive, but it’s not something that’s occurred to me before. We tend to think people are ‘lucky’ and unusual if they survive a lightening strike. But apparently, it’s just whether the power is amped up.
