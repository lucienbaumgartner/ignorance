&gt;Bracken,  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not threaten me, Bracken. I was uninvolved and unaware of any attack, but I am led to believe the land you so claim was raided is under control of Reed and the North. Should you wish to avoid any further tension and hostilities, I would leave you with this:  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not step foot in the Neck.  
&gt;  
&gt;King Jorah Stark.
