I'm happy to read that you're on your way to full recovery.

I'm just over 15 month in my taper - lots of mistakes along the way.

I don't blame general practioners for being ignorant - they are taught to script, it seems to me. 

I do take issue with "specialists" who haven't a clue but believe they do.

The single "specialist" (a psychiatrist) I had was ignorant and arrogant; a dangerous combination.
