It's literally called 'Black Lives Matter'. Maybe it needs a rebrand to 'Cops and Crackers suck?'

There is no European alive who engaged in colonialism abroad. Therefore Europeans alive today won't be picking up any weird tab that exists in your head. Your generalisation is also extremely ignorant. Much of Eastern Europe did not partake in colonialism but was victim to the invasion of the Ottoman Empire, and the same goes for practically all of England's closest neighbour and England. 

Again, keep your defamatory strawmen to yourself creep. I never expressed a single dislike for middle easterners; in my country, they have done nothing but live quietly. I literally lack any cause. But no non-European gets to enter a European country and tell them they need to change an aspect of their culture. 

I'm the opposite of intolerant. You're simple ignorant and regressive. Neo-colonial apologist.
