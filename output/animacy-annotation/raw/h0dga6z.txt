I've lived all across the country, but Spokane wins for worst drivers ever... They're slow and incredibly inconsiderate who are incapable of merging. Roundabouts? Don't bother. I've seen 4 wrecks in the roundabout by my house in under a year and I've almost been ran off the road by people who just can't stay in their lane more time's since I've been here then my entire life combined. 

I've never had road rage until here. I can't believe anyone can be so stupid and unaware of their surroundings.
