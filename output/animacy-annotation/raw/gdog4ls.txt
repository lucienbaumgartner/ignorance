wanna 1v1? can you back that talk up? listen, they changed the system mid season in s4. WHY? to make it impossible to solo climb or to make half my friends go to another game??

That's not how they say ranked works! They say "compete against teams of similar skill" so NO im not supposed to face higher tier players before i get there and ONLY then should i face a new skillset of players and from there keep climbing! How can you be so dumb and ignorant that you cant even understand my point?! I WONDER WHY THEY CHANGED THE SYSTEM YOU FUCKING BOT!
