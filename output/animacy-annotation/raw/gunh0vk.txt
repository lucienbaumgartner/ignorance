&gt;If saying the word “reparations” causes racial tensions then there a bigger problem as well. All admit, not all lefty catchphrase are that good (lookin at you defund the police) but reparations should not invoke “racial tensions” unless they’re already thinking dubious things. 

No, it's just really really maddening to think that since you were born black now my taxes have to go to you because of past things my grandpa did.

&gt;What brainlet out there hears “the government owes us money” and thinks “they think every white person owes them money”? That’s a problem with the people listening, not the speaker. 

No, this is literally "the governmemt gets money through my taxes and now a sizeable chunk of it has to go toward people for no reason". 13% of 360 milion people is roughly 18 milion people to which I should allocate a couple thousand dollars through my tax money to each one of them. This is an astronomical cost that no one wants to take because it's really fucking stupid that I need to spend so much money for this.

&gt;The problem is that when I say you, they think myself and not the government. Why are they self identifying with the government just because they collect your money to use on shit like the military? It really isn’t about you personally in the slightest, your only correlation is that it’s some of your tax.

You already have contracts with the military industry that you can't ignore so you either raise taxes to pay for this or you create inflation by creating new money for this and both options suck a lot.

&gt;Said money which would have probably uselessly gone to the military or police. It’s not a punishment at all really unless you just don’t want it to end up with black people. 

Point above.

&gt;I don’t think that makes it not a lifestyle, it just makes them indoctrinated and ignorant of all others. 

They still create a shit ton of problems and I would just want them to either find a fucking job or just light those camps on fire.
