The president is quite literally unaware and clueless about anything going on. He seems to be suffering from some kind of dementia, while the cabal runs the country by straight up syphooning funds directly into their pockets.

We still struggle with amenities from decades ago (no maintenance or improvement).

God blessed us with crude oil for decades now and all we did with it was loot and fill the pockets of the elite few. We had little to no natural disasters of any kind. Now oil is less desirable and no one is buying, so the government has come up with ridiculous taxes on the most mundane things to fill the gap. What's worse is that we the citizens know that money from those taxes would simply be put into the pockets of the thieves again. It's like God himself is saying "I can't help y'all anymore."

Human life has no value here. Terrorist organizations law waste to entire villages at night leaving corpses of men, women and even babies lying around in their wake. The government has refused to even name them a terrorist organization.

Don't get me started. The US is quite literally heaven.
