&gt;You are a typical example of right wing incel who thinks he is intelligent becouse he once read a book and possibly a few hundreds posts of other incels as well. In reality you are speaking out of your arse and any attempt of arguing with you would be as efficient as arguing with your inflatable girlfriend,

You can write whatever you want, but it doesn't change anything - the reality is that you have no idea what you're talking about and the views you're presenting are simply stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;so just to address your point re European funds:  
&gt;  
&gt;You are invited to the golf club. Most members contribute 1000 euros per month as it is very elite. Since you are very poor, they decide to pay you 2k per month to join, to fund your equipment until you get better. Then you go to the club bar and you shit all over the counter, just to play hurt innocence when they tell you to stop.

That comparison is wrong on many levels.

You make it sound like it's charity, which it isn't. The enlarged common market benefits the old EU members as well. Especially in the case of Germany, which is also the biggest net contributor to the EU budget. 

Presenting this as a form of charity is ignorant and stupid - which fits the general characteristic of what you're writing. You obviously have no idea about the subject you're talking about.

As for "shit all over the counter" - actually, our rule of law problems do not affect other countries. Our rule of law problems shouldn't be happening, but the EU bureaucracy's pushing of the federalist agenda by methods purposely avoiding direct democratic process also shouldn't be happening. 

BTW This article is not about Poland, but it says a lot of accurate things about the negative side of the EU and it's elites: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/joseph-stiglitz-the-problem-with-europe-is-the-euro](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/joseph-stiglitz-the-problem-with-europe-is-the-euro)

Read it, maybe you will become less ignorant about the EU and it's elites.
