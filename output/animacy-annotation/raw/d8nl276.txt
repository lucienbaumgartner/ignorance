Here's the [link](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) to the actual Wikileaks email....they aren't kidding...how sad. They really don't care about anyone other than themselves.

Here is the exact quote:

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

Pretty disgusting.
