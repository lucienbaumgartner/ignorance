You're totally, absolutely, incontrovertibly incorrect.  

Planter's Punch is a drink with no "set" recipe, and it varies remarkably.  

The version I posted is the Donn the Beach 1934 version - he is the father of tiki drinks and one of the 3 most important bartenders in US history.  This is not the authoritative version of this drink (because no such thing exists), but it is one of the most popular and common.   

Other notable versions I've seen also lack mint and allspice (like in the 12 bottle bar book which is lemon/lime, or Shannon Mustipher's Tiki book which is grenadine/ango).   Smugglers' Cove's version has all spice, but no mint.  (I don't count a garnish as an ingredient IN a drink)

Smuggler's Cove itself, states "there were nearly as many recipes as there were planters to enjoy them." and says to "play with the formula" (which is one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak, NOT rum, sugar, mint, allspice).  (Cate, 258)

In short, no.  

I can't possibly fathom someone being so arrogant and ignorant that they would tell Donn the Beach he doesn't know what a Planter's Punch is.  

lol.
