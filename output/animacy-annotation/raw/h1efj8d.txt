No I agree, and I do always call them out on this but at this point it usually gets to hypothetical what-if debates that question morality. 

IF they did, it’s still wrong because it’s exploiting a sentient being‘s life right? Even if they are happy and unaware of what’s happening when they’ve been killed? I usually equate it to the example that just because r*pists use date r*pe drugs to make their victims unaware, it doesn’t lessen the severity of the crime at all.

I guess I just don’t really know what to say beyond that if someone really believes that it’s okay to kill an animal if it’s hypothetically happy and “painlessly” killed.

^ although we all know in reality that never happens and there’s not enough land in the world to support that even if factory farms didn’t exist.
