&gt; No I would shame them and then tell them they deserve the bullying and they shouldnt have kids right? Oh no that's you.

Ah still making my argument for me? Very mature lol

&gt; Sorry but if your point is "kids will be kids " we are done here. That is not an adult argument.

That youre this naive and ignorant of how kids act indicates to me that you were either home schooled or that you really are a feminist. 
But yes, kids being kids will be kids, as theyre kids/children as and as such are prone to hysteria and wild levels of cruelty, them being...kids and all
