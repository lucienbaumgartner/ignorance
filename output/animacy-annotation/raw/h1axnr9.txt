seriously, you see this big story and you admit you have no clue how these walls work and you can't see how stupid and ignorant that is ?  Nobody ever leaves space for others on these walls, you just do what you want. Here you are on your high horse imposing your ideals on something you  admit you dont know about. And what a bummer you have to be to bring some negative correctness into this. What a freaking bummer, let me guess you post on your friends waterskiining photo something about fuel consumption.. Karen 100% bummer... you never leave room on the wall for others you just jealous
