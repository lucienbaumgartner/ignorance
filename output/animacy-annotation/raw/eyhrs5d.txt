It's sad and ignorant that you think it's okay for me to be discriminated against and justify it because of my poor Korean, but do the exact opposite and act appalled that a Korean received slow service, not even "no service," in Madrid when he couldn't speak Spanish.  

Your racism is blatant.  

It takes me weeks to respond to you because I have a life outside of reddit.  You'll probably reply to me today since you live your life on the computer.
