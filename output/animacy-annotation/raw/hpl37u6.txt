I always side with the victims and I understand why the show is problematic because it is and there’s no denying it but...

I do feel iffy about heavy accusations thrown at the cast. The producers, writers and etc. definitely deserve what’s already coming and what’s gonna come to them because everything about this is just messed up but I just don’t want to conclude that everyone involved is either a right wing supporter or very ignorant and greedy.

I hope you understand that as a fan, it’s hard to accept the possibility of the artist you admire as someone who has the capability to be the kind of person.

Let me reiterate, I’m a 100% with the victims because there are no holes at all when it comes to them but with the cast members being okay with everything, I’m not sure.
