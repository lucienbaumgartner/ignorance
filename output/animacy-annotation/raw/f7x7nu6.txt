Damn... people really do that?! I always wonder if those people on TV that say “I get threats all the time” are telling the truth. Not cause I think they’re liars; but because I can’t visualize just what kind of people are that dumb and ignorant that they would take the limited time in their lives to call or private message people with nothing but hatred and anger. That sucks, sorry to hear that. Just do like I do and think of it as them openly advertising exactly who is most worth blocking on Reddit. Lol
