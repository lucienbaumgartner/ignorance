&gt;Choosing to not be vaccinated means you're malevontly careless, selfish, and ignorant. That doesn't make you a bad person, per se,but those aren't exactly admirable traits.

I disagree with the use of the word "malevolent."

Upwards of 78% of unvaccinated Americans are concerned that the vaccine isn't as safe as it's said to be. I think they are wrong. But this just shows that people aren't doing it as a "fuck you" to society. We are deeply divided and we need to have empathy for those who are unvaccinated.

This does not mean condoning their actions, but if you want them to change their mind, you cannot approach the conversation as a debate in which, if your case is presented with sufficient evidence, your opponent loses and is sentenced to mandatory vaccination. You are having a discussion and trying to meet the other person where they are, understand their position, and talk with them (not at them!) about their concerns.

It has to come from a place of love, not hostility.
