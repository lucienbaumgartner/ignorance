most people on set were unaware and Shane Black did not disclose this information to Olivia who had the scene with him, and should have the right to decide if she wants to work with a sex offender. 
She was the only actor who had scenes with him and her image and association could be linked to him. The production employed this person and pays him and everyone on set unknowingly supported the profiteering of someone of this character. They should have a right to know and decide if they want to work on a set with a criminal. If any of the actors brought their nieces, nephews, kids to visit the set for example they would be exposing children to a convicted child molester. It’s a touchy subject and it doesn’t matter if he hasn’t been caught again.

most workplaces do not hire anyone with a criminal record. that’s the consequence of committing a crime. If I turned up to work and found out my coworker had gone to jail for child molestation I would be deeply disturbed to say the least. Director is protecting someone who is a grown adult grooming a 14 yo into sex, and giving him employment opportunities while being ignorant to the cast. Do the crime do the time doesn’t apply when you get out of jail and have a Hollywood director backing you. Other people who molest and groom children into sex would be shunned by society for the rest of their lives.
