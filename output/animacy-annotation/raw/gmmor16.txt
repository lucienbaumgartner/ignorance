Lol... okay. I am dumb and ignorant of a lot of things. How is this a insult? If I claimed to know everything, I'd be a liar. That is worse than being dumb. 

But I do know what I am talking about. Reality. 

You are talking about your perception of ideal government/society. Taxes, no matter what they go to, are a theft on the working class. The fact that taxes dont go to their designated "cause" further illustrates the fallibility of ever increasing government intervention. 

People are barely responsible with their own finances (see your large loan debt). How responsible do you think your neighbor will be with YOUR money??? What about me? Do you think I'll care if YOU go bankrupt because I spend your money? This IS our current tax situation. Legislating our grandchildren into unpayable debt because [insert altruistic cause here]... 

But judging by your claims of "dumping all our money into the military", I can guess you dont really understand how the federal government budgets and allocates funding or what the bulk of that funding goes to (tricare, infrastructure, training, food, energy, emergancy management capabilities etc as opposed to weapons and ammunition). 

Yes, the elite have advantages in this crony-corporate world... but guess who empowers them??? That's right, big government that would need to be much much bigger (with a bigger army) to implement and enforce the "humanitarian" socialist nation many claim as "supeior" to capitalism or their misrepresentations thereof. 

Also, I've worked and broke bread with real immigrants, both legal and illegal.

But I'm dumb and ignorant and wrong
