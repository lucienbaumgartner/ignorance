Interesting.

I'm in my 50's and not usually tuned it to rap music or other contemporary pop culture stuff.

And I'm very liberal and ignorant of right-wing websites and forums.

All of the above is to explain that, basically, I've never seen the word 'based' used that way and had no idea.

Thanks for the education. Take care.
