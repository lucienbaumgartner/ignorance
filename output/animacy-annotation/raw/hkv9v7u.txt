&gt;the problem is that one's decision not to take the vaccine affect others

It really doesn't. Covid-19 is here to stay and vaccinated or not most everyone will get it. It's basically the new flu. It mutates and spreads to quickly to be eradicated by vaccination. We even have variants affecting animals now. Even if everyone wanted to get a vaccine since this virus is in the same family as the cold or flu we wouldn't be able to eradicate it. The vaccine will do more to lessen symptoms than prevent the spread anyway. 

&gt;most people are so fucking dumb and ignorant that u can't just expect them to make a good decision

Agreed. But you and I don't have the right to make that decision for them and neither should a government by any circumstances. As far as the decision for getting a vaccine goes frankly it's not our business if our friends or neighbors have gotten a covid-19 vaccine, flu vaccine or anything else really. It's their choice to make. Obviously I'd recommend getting them but it isn't my choice to make. 

I may not agree with someone's choice but at the same time I don't want to live in a country where the government controls what's injected into the population under any circumstances.
