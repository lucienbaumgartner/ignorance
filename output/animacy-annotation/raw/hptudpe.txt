People are not inherently spiritual, people are inherently ignorant and curious. This ignorance and curiosity at birth make for easy indoctrination into falsehoods that often go unchallenged into adulthood, resulting in brainwashed adults who feel intensely attached to their delusion. If we for critical thinking, expose youth to hard science, and encourage a scientific mindset, the common delusion of spirituality can be replaced with an empathetic curiosity that allows for all the humanism, without any of the self-centeredness of spirituality.
