I thought the same thing. It’s her gait and seemingly smaller head. I’ve worked with youth for many years and have had special needs kids in the centers sometimes. Also the way she just walked away unafraid and unaware that she could or would be hit back is odd. Maybe she is an entitled libber who didn’t think she could be hit by a male because she’s a female?
