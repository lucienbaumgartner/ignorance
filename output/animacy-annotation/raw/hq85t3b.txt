Arguing with these ignorant and stubborn science denying people would be comical if not for the fact that their ignorance is dragging the pandemic out longer and worse than it ever had to be.

But many of these people you engage are just trolls impersonating Americans and Brits.  You can usually tell when you look at their posting history and you see nothing but far right wing posts &amp; comments and the only other subjects they participate in is video games and sports to bulk up their karma points so they seem like real people.   Without the video game and sports karma they'd be identified easily by their very low or negative karma record.

In 1917 and 1918 when the deadly influenza outbreak hammered the USA and the rest of the world, people understood and mitigated the pandemic effectivly.   There was unity because it wasn't politicized and there was no FOX NEWS and social media putting out deadly disinformation for political gain.   Also social media did not exist and other adversarial countries who wished to USA harm had no way to easily reach Americans so easily with harmful disinformation like today.   Social media has been weaponized like a brutal WMD.

Hard to believe how 40% of Americans have been so severely brain damaged by right-wing media and how little they understand the history of conservative propaganda and disinformation.  For centuries it's always been conservatives that denied science and it never changed.
