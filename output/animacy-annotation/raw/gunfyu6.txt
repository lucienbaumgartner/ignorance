when predictions like these dont come true its usualy one of these reasons A) there was some mistake in prediction (input data, computing,...) and it was simply wrong  B) steps were made to avoid the outcome predicted C) predition was not made by any credible research team but some blogger/politician/reporter/.... who dont understand whats he talking about  


Why are people screaming about the end of world? Because they are scared and ignorant of facts and probabilities of potential outcomes
