I think you might be misreading Mr. Clemens' intentions here, friend.

[Your point is valid, don't get me wrong.] My read on it is this: While kind, loving, generous people can be *either* homebodies or travelers, those who are close-minded, ignorant, and hateful are usually only one of the two. You can probably guess which one.

Honestly, reading it that way, even with my limited traveling experience in the United States because I don't have a passport yet... He's pretty spot on. Even if you only get to move away from your hometown long enough to go to college or take a job, as soon as you go back and start talking to some of the "folks back home" about the differences you saw, you figure out pretty quick which people have never left home or have never had their preconceived notions or religious beliefs/moral judgements challenged.
