Ask one of your commanders if there would be some problem with you popping out and popping back in. If they ask why, tell'em. Be honest. They shouldn't have an issue with it.

If they have some issue with it, it may  be a sign you're outgrowing the alliance. A lot of people play these games very casually, aren't aware of all the metastructures surrounding them. If your alliance commanders are unaware and casual, but you're interested in being more involved in the community ... you won't be on the same page for long and likely start feeling held back.

Anyway I hope it works out. PM Daiches for help finding a buy.
