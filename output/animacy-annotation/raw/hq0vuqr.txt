You’re wrong. The only reason a behavioral health unit will contact the police is if you’re a minor or you are registered to possess a firearm. At least in the US. Not for addiction, though. Your story is either full of holes or you think what you went through is what everyone goes through. You’re deterring someone from getting help because you had a bad experience and that’s selfish, ignorant, and dangerous. I’d suggest you deal with your own shit before dragging others down with you.
