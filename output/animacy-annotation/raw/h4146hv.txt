Wow... All it took was the idea of women getting something they aren't to have all these incel edgelords jumping out of the woodwork.

Imagine being so jaded and ignorant that you think you're entitled to something in return even though you've never experienced a period in your life.

"Well then men should be able to take days for stress and depression".
Everyone should be able to you fucking troglodytes!  Do you seriously think that mental problems are exclusively a male thing?
I mean, judging by all these whiny hatemongers here, there are a TON of men with very serious mental illnesses, but that's a whole other level of sickness to assume you're the only gender who deals with mental health issues.
