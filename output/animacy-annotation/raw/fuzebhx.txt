I kind of screwed up. I financed my auto loan with the dealer by accident - (it was around 4.49 percent - don't remember off the top of my head exactly), but I knew I could probably get a better deal with the credit union probably, but thought I needed to know the amount of what the car would cost first. (I was foolish and unaware that they could pre-approve up to a certain amount.)

Is it too late to refinance? Credit score is roughly 735 (was 749 but has tanked a bit after taking out the auto loan).
