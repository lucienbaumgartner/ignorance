I'd pretty much guarantee that's a man.  The person supports calling things the wrong name for ease even tho it totally confuses women about their own bodies and puts them at a disadvantage.  I don't think many woman would support misogynistic terms as much as this person does unless they were a man and completely unaware and unconcerned of the damage it does to women.

'It's easier for the commoners to use improper slang, and I don't care if degrades and confuses women!  Screw them!  They don't need to understand the tampon goes in a different hole than they pee from... how's that useful? They're just being uppity!'
