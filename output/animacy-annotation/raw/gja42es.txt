&gt; by "the government" you mean "the fed", which aren't the same thing

Anyone who genuinely believes the Fed is in any way independent from the US government is mindbogglingly naive and ignorant of how it actually works.

&gt;and by "putting it in their pockets" you mean "purchasing securities and creating commercial bank reserves" - which is to say, giving the money to private entities

The vast majority of bonds purchased by the fed are US Treasury bills.
