&gt;Do you not see the inconsistency in this statement?

No.  Claiming that a negative review of a season is equivalent to wishing harm upon someone is asinine.  The former is an evaluation of a product; evaluations are subjective in the world of art and entertainment and not all will be positive.  The latter is actually toxic (and irrelevant to the show) and should not be tolerated.  

&gt;Are you defending the people who harass Torian

No.  Read my comment again.

&gt;insisting that the term "toxic" doesn't apply to the people who committed the actions OP listed is ignorant and blatantly wrong.

I didn't.  Read my comment again.
