This email is not alarming in any way, other than it shows your employer is maybe a little disorganized and ignorant of how certain things work- neither of which is uncommon. In fact, I think it’s rather encouraging that he’s asking good questions of you, the employee, and getting your input to help to create a formal leave policy that could affect you and others in the future. Put this man in for an ESGR award.
