i’m not dismissing anything. i’m stating that mistakes are part of human nature and in a job where you are mandated to intervene in violent situations, the potential for a lethal mistake is high. again i’m for accountability, justice, fairness, and striving to minimize death at the hands of the state. Cops have murdered people and they should be held to the same judicial standards as you and I. the reality is that setting the expectation of “there needs to be 0 mistakes or else that’s evidence the whole system is fucked” is unrealistic. you must have a fundamental misunderstanding of policing, life or death situations, or conflict if you can’t understand that. your “with us or against us” attitude is so un-educated and ignorant that your never going to be satisfied no matter what you do. and that’s part of how you’re being manipulated.
