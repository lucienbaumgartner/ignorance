This kind of families exist where I live since the Portuguese got here(it also extended to black with the slavery). Now in Brazil I hard to see someone with prejudice with Blended families cause the chances are that you are in one:

Mine for example have Indian on my grand grand gramma side(I know this cause I somehow manage to look like one I wanted to know where it came from) Portuguese and Spanish names show our European lineage, my dad is white as hell but some close cousins and aunts have brown to black skintone.
My mother's godmother's child showed even more of the Japanese side of the family on her appearance than the German side of her father's and her HER BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER have brown skin.

So this kind of racism is strange to me, is impossible to ignore that it still exists here to but st the same time is so illogical and ignorant that I can't stop being suprised when I see it, even if happened in other country.
