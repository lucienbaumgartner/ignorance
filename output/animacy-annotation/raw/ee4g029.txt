Not even mentioning the fact that sense when does sharing a demographic make me responsible for what everyone in my demographic does?


Where’s the commercial telling women to hold those rapist teachers accountable (and to make sure the news calls them RAPISTS and not “sexual relationships)

Or telling women to stop assaulting their spouses and then playing victim when the cops come, going as far as hurting themselves for evidence.

What about those women who use their children as pawns in the divorce game? Putting the father through hell just because he wants to see his children.

Telling women to stop with the false rape allegations, because it always is guilty until proven innocent, not the other way around. As soon as someone accuses them, their career and social life are over.

Telling young girls to stop joining dating apps and to stop lying about their age or even going as far as getting a fake ID, convincing a spouse that you are of age and having the chance and power to ruin their life.


The list goes on


I live in Chicago, is it my responsibility to take action for ever crime that happens here? What about everything a black person does?


Do you see how stupid and ignorant that sounds?
