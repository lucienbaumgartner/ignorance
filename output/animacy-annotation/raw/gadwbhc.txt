When we are an infant we learn that it is good to feel good and bad to feel bad.

As a young teen was there and that it is good to look good and it is bad to look bad.

As a young adult you start to learn that it is good to be wise and aware and it is bad to be unwise and unaware.

And we spend our entire lives trying to make sure that we cling to the good and avoid the bad as which as possible.

This is a mechanism of the body covered by scripture and 1 John 2:16, and you can thank you're amygdala for this mechanism.
