Try to stick with data that has legit sources. There are a lot of areas where "we don't know" is more appropriate that any absolute known.

What are you trying to convey? There is so much to it, it's hard to focus on one thing. I would try to have a simplified approach, maybe three points, then build on each of those. Also a good idea to not get too extreme, an example being: rather than say masks are useless and ineffective, you say that there are not many scenarios where masks will prevent infection. They are only being recommended to prevent direct transmission of droplets [directly] from mouth or nose to another person's eyes, nose, mouth hands, clothing, etc. They have no other purpose. But.. If the wearer is not infected, it does nothing. If the wearer is infected, but asymptomatic and unaware of infection, this is the only use-case, and it only applies to direct transmission within 6 feet. If a person is aware of their infection, they are advised to stay home and isolate/quarantine, masks are no longer recommended. Viruses are much smaller than most masks can filter. Water vapor is aerosolized through the mask, and will also take the path of least resistance (i.e. *around* the mask or via gaps). Even when a mask is tightly fitted to one's face, a person can still fog up their glasses (water vapor) through the mask. This is an airborne virus, so the direct transmission via "droplets" prevention is not going to reduce spread by *much*.
