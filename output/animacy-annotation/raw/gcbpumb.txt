A bit more Manitoba history: In July, we had had 250 or so cases. Total. 1.2 milllion people. There was zero new cases for almost 2 weeks.

And then we basically did what everyone else did: got cocky. The government decided to promote tourism, opened everything up, no one wore a mask, etc, and we just straight up went off a cliff from best in class to worst in about a month.

And it's become apparent to me that no one has learned a damn thing. The medical system managed to buy expired masks, the government is completely shocked and unaware that for-profit personal care homes might be straight up lying about staffing levels, people who should know how to use PPE seem to have all forgotten, we found our anti-maskers, etc...
