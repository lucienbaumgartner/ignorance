As a Native American myself, with a mom who grew up with stories like deer woman and little people; we don't necessarily think drawing or even creating different depictions of the wendigo is inherently cultural appropriation and/or racist. It's folklore, there is no one actual depiction(s) of the wendigo that can definitively be labeled as an official picture of the Wendigo. Even looking up images of the creature, there are similarities that remain the same, such as the head and antlers. Personally, I find the dedication to draw and the time to create their own version of a Native American folklore rather flattering, they show how they think it may look. My mother, who lived with Native Folklore, thinks it is alright, no one is taking it and claiming the creature as their own personal creation or that it belongs to their, non-native, folklores. So calling it racist, is bold and ignorant that shouldn't be tossed about when someone wishes to show their take on a creature of myth. So in conclusion, a Native American family says this is alright, so long as it is acknowledged that the creature belongs to Native American Folklore.

Also, as a side note, depending on which Native American tribe you search or lookup, can depend on how the creature looks.
