You really shouldn’t take it so persaonlly when someone has a different opinion than you. And calling me stupid and ignorant? That makes you a fucking asshole. I’ve watched all the fucking games. I’ve read the articles and I’ve formed an informed decision that I think we could let him go. 

If you disagree that’s fine, but to attack me makes you an immature little dick. Go fuck yourself
