That's crazy! It was pretty exciting in the sense of its shape and color. I wouldn't have minded if they wanted to continue watching!! 

The weird part is, as I was looking at it in the mirror, it seemed.. unaware and unphased that it was seen and being watched. It wasn't until I turned around and looked with my eyes that it seemed to be aware that it had been seen. Rationally, I can't believe that could possibly be the case but, who knows anymore when it comes to anything in the sky these days.
