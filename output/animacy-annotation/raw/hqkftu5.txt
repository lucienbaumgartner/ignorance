Testosterone is one of the most effective treatments for relieving dysphoria. While it's not a magic bullet for everyone, it has helped me quite a lot and proven through trial that it was the right choice for me. The sentence is inaccurate and ignorant of my situation because a massive amount of my gender dysphoria *has* already been resolved by testosterone.
