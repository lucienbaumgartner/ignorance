Before I found this sub and the cantina, I'd post sporadically on the main sub and my god, those people are insufferable. I met a guy that called his opinions "objective" facts and saw every one of his ultimatums as a celebration of critical thinking, even if they were wilfully ignorant and uneducated, he even accused me of "whataboutisms" for acting like all nine movies should be seen through the same critical lens when pointing out plot holes.  The weird part is, he claimed to be an authority on the franchise, yet he didn't really watch the OT and only focused on the PT and games, which is fine, but he acted like he was the no.1 superfan.
