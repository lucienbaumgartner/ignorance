Yeah, I think it would be bad. Health care workers can only handle so many hospitalizations, and the long term effects of even asymptomatic cases are believed to have the potential to be pretty severe. It’s not like everyone who could’ve died from it has died, there’s still plenty of vulnerable people left. Only 10% of the US has actually gotten the disease so we’re nowhere remotely close to herd immunity. Your whole post seems cold and ignorant of the consequences to millions—if not tens or hundreds of millions—of Americans.
