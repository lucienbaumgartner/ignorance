You’re all good! If anything I just wanted to clarify my position on that because you’re absolutely right that the whole “both sides suck stance” is ignorant and annoying, ESPECIALLY coming from people who do believe in leftist policy, because no matter how disillusioned I or anyone else may become with the Democratic Party, saying it is the same amount of bad as the Republican Party takes a healthy helping of willful ignorance and it’s a shame that form of propaganda works as well as it does. Sadly my parents vote staunchly conservative, they espouse much of the same two party bullshit but somehow concluded the Repub’s are the lesser of the two evils? Truly is a shame. All that said no need to apologize, we’re definitely on the same page. Happy Holidays btw! :)
