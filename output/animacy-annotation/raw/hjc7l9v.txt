That's because it is one of the least effective benzos, way down towards the bottom of the list of the ones if I had to rank the 12 or so I've tried. Phenazepam is the only one I'd put below it as an overall "experience". Phenazepam had literally NOTHING good to offer at low doses, and high doses you're blacked out for like 2 days straight, dangerous... And not gonna sleep it away either, very much so lacks hypnotic effects, as does lorazepam, hence why I think both suck, the more hypnotic of effects a benzo has, the better it is.

Funnily enough, it is one of the most widely prescribed, probably because abuse of it results in nothing, nothing, nothing, and then black out.

It just kind of sucks all around. Such better benzos for abuse that are way cleaner. Xanax (proper pharma, not pressed, lord knows what's in a press but it is rarely what they'll tell you and very rarely real alprazolam, luckiest you'll get is flualprazolam, which, to me, is close enough to the real thing), Midazolam, Temazepam, even clonazepam are far superior benzos, all with very different "use cases". Like, Xanax and Temazepam, longer acting "highs" even at therapeutic doses of 2mg or 30mg respectively. Midazolam as the king of benzo euphoria, especially IV'd (one of the few that is water soluble, add some vitamin C for increased solubility for a larger mg/ml concentration shot), but very short acting. Clonazepam as a daily driver, extremely clean, anxiety treatment, not the best high, unless totally benzo naive and unaware of how bad your anxiety is. That first time lifting your anxiety with a clean drug (not fucking alcohol..) felt heavenly when I took 2mg the first time, I was blown away by how good I felt just from feeling "normal" for fucking once in 18 years of life. That magic dissipates fairly quick for clonazepam, but as a daily benzo, IMO it can't be beat.

Lorazepam sucks, both occasionally, and daily. It is just a really odd, ineffective benzo.
