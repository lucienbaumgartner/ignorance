The idea is if the whole party has backed someone who's eventually proved to be criminal, it could taint everyone who's endorsed her as either a) complicit, or b) so ignorant and unaware that we should no longer trust them. 

Again, its completely reasonable that we normals didn't know who to believe, whether a given attack is republican FUD or has a basis in reality.  But politicians are supposed to know better. 

Look at it this way:  imagine you put all your money with The Wonka Fund...   and The Wonka fund decides to put 40% of its money into Madoff's fund.  The only real conclusions that can be made are either that Wonka Fund was complicit in the scheme and helping Madoff get new customers, or that Wonka Fund was duped, and has lost their authority to manage our money or advise us where is good to put it.
