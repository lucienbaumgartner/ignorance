YTA My son had night terrors. They're deeply horrific and he was a mess the next day, every time. You punished your daughter for having a terrifying, traumatic experience. YOU KEPT YOUR DAUGHTER FROM SLEEPING after having night terrors. You punished and essentially tortured your child for something that's terribly upsetting and that she has no control over. It's taking every cell in my body to stay civil. You are profoundly ignorant and actually abusive. Go speak to a doctor about night terrors. And apologize to your daughter.
