I still don't fully understand why Rumsfeld chose that moment to reveal the Pentagon's missing trillions. Given that it was only Bush's 2nd year in office, it seems he may have been trying to blame the Clinton administration for it. Many of [Edward Snowden's leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-5MMTbSlA) revealed a lot of the secret programs and weapons development earmarked by the black budget and the Pentagon's accounting black hole after two more decades of endless war is [now around $35 trillion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/pentagon-35-trillion-accounting-black-231154593.html). It's just undeniable by now that US empire uses war as a money laundering scheme.

There were [a lot of reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_intelligence_before_the_attacks) that the US and British intelligence community was [warned about a major homeland terrorist attack months before 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US).

Once the attack happened, I think the Neocons and other war profiteers in the military industrial complex saw the opportunity to create the greatest money laundering scheme of the upward transfer of wealth to the oligarchical class ever once the Pentagon's black budget was no longer even getting mentioned in the media. So after that the state department owned corporate media played the American public like a damn fiddle and told them the terrorists "hate us because of our freedom" and the American people's bipartisan unhinged bloodlust and lack of self-awareness of how brainwashed and ignorant of the rest of the world they are was their undoing.
