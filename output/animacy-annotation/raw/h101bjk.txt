Both articles you linked specifically address individuals receiving drug therapy to combat HIV. And they’re completely accurate and something we’ve understood about HIV drug therapies and PrEP as that’s the entire point of these therapies. My point about being able to transmit HIV while testing negative is still accurate. Unfortunately HIV testing does generate a substantial amount of false negatives for a test for a viral infection. This is particularly true among recently infected individuals. These false negatives are the reason why it is recommended that when tested for HIV you have one test and then another at least three months after the exposure. This is known as the window period and is very well understood. It takes time for the body to produce the anti-bodies that are routinely tested for in an HIV test, about a month in most people. Tests that detect the virus itself have been developed but they still have a window period of 2+ weeks.

In my comment I am not referring to people receiving medical treatment for HIV who would be banned from donating blood anyway because a positive HIV test disqualifies you. I am instead referring to the 25%+ of people who are estimated to be HIV positive and unaware of it.
