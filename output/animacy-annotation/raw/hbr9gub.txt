I’m so confused by this post. This has nothing to do with wedding planning, ideas, engagement, etc. 

I appreciate that you are from Vietnam and customs and culture are different from the large majority of posters on Reddit. I pride myself in being understanding and thoughtful about other cultures and differences in people around the world. I’ve traveled to many places and many places that Americans would feel are “scary” are at the top of my list of places to see. I’m sorry you feel attacked about your beliefs but the items you list here are incredibly disrespectful and ignorant of people as well. 

I’m a white woman from the US, I make more money than my male partner and I had my fair share of sexual experiences before I met him. None of that makes me less of a “quality woman” or will make me less of a wife to my wonderful partner. I could go into how the “facts” you list are incorrect and also the generalizations you’re making based on your life experience. I think that will only upset you more. 

I would ask that you please stick to the rules of the sub. If you want to discuss wedding planning, photographers, flowers, etc., I think many of us will be happy to oblige. If you want to voice very misogynistic and hurtful opinions, I think you’re in the wrong sub.
