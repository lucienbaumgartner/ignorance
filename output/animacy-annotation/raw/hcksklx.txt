&gt; Also a genocide doesn't require to have a purpose, for ages genocide

By definition, a genocide *does* have a purpose. The word has not even existed "for ages." 

So, you've proven my point. You're ignorant and unaware of anything that you're talking about, and unfit to have an opinion or call someone else a "sheep." 

Bleat away, hypocrite.
