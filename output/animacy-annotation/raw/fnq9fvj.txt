Well, there's a couple things here, first and foremost it's Republicans that are the rich that are the tax evaders, and there are just as many poor Democrats. The disdain and pity you're detecting is that of all Democrats towards people so gullible and ignorant that they vote against their own interests simply because they can't vote for anything liberal. Not because they disagree, but because it came from liberals. As the same time being unaware that so very many things they take for granted (workplace insurance, weekends, 40hr work week, safety regulations, sick leave) came from liberals. Finally, conservatives attempted to leave the union because they wanted slavery so bad, and in fact the only difference between the US Constitution and the Articles of Confederacy is that states weren't allowed to interfere with slavery(so much for state's rights), and caused thousands of deaths trying to get their own way. Since the majority of people in the US are in fact liberal, this is our country and we welcome all who wish to abide by the law and the Constitution. If you don't like that, sucks to be you, but as long as you don't break laws or cause harm to others we don't care. That's the difference between Republicans and Democrats. One wants everyone and everything they don't like to either die or go somewhere else, the other welcomes diversity and aims to reach a more perfect union together.
