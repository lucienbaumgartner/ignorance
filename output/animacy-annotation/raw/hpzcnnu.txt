&gt;I encourage you to listen to survivors' stories. To reduce genocide to a political means to an end ignores the torture, death marches, rape and other crimes against humanity.

&gt;You arrogance demonstrates your insensitivity, ignorance and disrespect.

&gt;Don't claim you know anything about comparisons between genocide and animal exploitation.

Absolutely! 

Your fellow Vegans, PETA and Joey Armstrong should heed your well meaning advice and stop being arrogant, insensitive, ignorant and disrespectful!

We are in Agreement here. 

&gt;You can start by reading the following Isaac Bashevis Singer—a survivor of genocide—quote: "What do they know—all these scholars, all these philosophers, all the leaders of the world—about such as you? They have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka."

I respect Isaac's view, but he doesn't represent all holocaust survivors' view. I'm still sure most of the other holocaust survivors aren't vegan. 

Good Talk, thanks for clarifying your position. 

&gt;I have never endorsed comparisons between human suffering and other animals' exploitation. - Suspicious_Tap4109

I apologize to you if I misunderstood your position initially. I see you are against those other vegans that make the false comparison between Jewish Holocaust and Animal Slaughter. 

Happy Holidays and Have a Happy New Year. Good luck on your Vegan Journey!
