&gt; Everyone (except some idiots ofc) behaves right at traffic lights already.

That's the whole point of the video, that a single car dictates the pace for dozens of others. How many stoplights have you seen where the car four rows back behind a suv can see the light? 

Or when one car in the right lane starts slowly and someone aggressively changes lanes to the left, causing the person they cut off to brake suddenly.

Assisted driving won't necessarily improve on the skills of the good driver, but it eliminates all of the tiny little things unaware and bad drivers do.
