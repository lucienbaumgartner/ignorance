I just saw a video talking about this the other day. Wish I could remember where and who so I could share it with you but the gist was that this isn't common sense or common courtesy. This is your "love language". Doing those things so you don't have to worry about it is showing they care and when they don't do these things you feel like it means they don't care about you. She said she sat her partner down and explained that and they explained what makes them feel loved by her. Her partner made more of an effort to do things that she would recognize as appreciation and she tries to remember, when she sees things that her partner could have done but didn't, that they don't see the world exactly like she does. Ask him how he feels loved by you. Maybe he only feels it with gifts or a romantic date or maybe in a completely different way altogether and you may have been falling short and unaware of it, too. 

And sometimes, even with all of that in mind, you just have to ask. Seems obvious that if you're working a 12hr shift you're going to be exhausted at the end of that and he should take care of the house and dinner so you don't have to, especially since you got a sitter but it's...well, obviously not obvious.
