Please don't take offense for me questioning this, but how is there any sex shaming going on? From reading the article it doesn't sound like anyone interviewed was disgusted by it, more confused and unaware that the space was being used as a sex club.

This quote actually makes it clear what the issue is about:

&gt; According to Metro Codes,  itâ€™s not illegal for a sex club to be here. This is an industrial district; zoning allows it. But the business has to have a sex club license, Herbert said.

&gt;The Mark doesn't have a sex club permit. Their permitted use is for a storage warehouse, not an assembly space for a lot of people.

It also says they haven't had a proper inspection done to verify that the building is up to code. My takeaway from this is that once these things are handled, there won't be any problem with the club being there.
