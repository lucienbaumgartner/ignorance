No you're the ignorant one. The OP posts a picture of something that's an issue, and there's benefit from post for a number of reasons. !) it helps make people aware of an issue that mostly Beltline people are aware of, and second make people aware that they need to be careful when in the area.

Your answer. ' If your area is an area that has something you don't like. Fucking move ' How fucking lame and ignorant. That ignorant and stupid mentality is what caused places like East Village and Vic Park into turn into graveyards 30 years ago. Also ever consider the OP may have been living in the hood before the site was there?

Check your votes and go check the OP's, then do the math. It'll be obvious who's ignorant.
