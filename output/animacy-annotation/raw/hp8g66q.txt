You say that sarcastically, but in many places *we don't*, and many more are insufficient or poorly designed in North America.  

Raised crosswalks and roundabouts, for example, make intersections vastly safer and more accessible to both car and pedestrian traffic than painted lines at a stop light. But mention changing literally anything about our infrastructure at local government meetings and get met with a chorus of ignorant and stubborn excuses why it could never work here.  

Public infrastructure needs to accommodate more that private vehicles exclusively.
