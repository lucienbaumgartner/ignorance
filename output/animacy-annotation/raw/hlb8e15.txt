Way to miss the point my dude. 

As a leftist in America, I'd say you legitimately have more reasons to be concerned about it than a right winger does. The US establishment is *not* friendly to socialism or socialist aligned groups.

If you don't think the media colludes with establishment powers to misrepresent and mislabel dissenting voices for exactly this reason, then you are simply naive and ignorant of history.
