Yes, my first relationship. My ex was much older than me, I was unaware and naive. Didn’t pay much attention to who I was interacting with online because I didn’t desire any long-term commitment anyway. He ended up manipulating me into being in an intimate relationship with him online. I subconsciously fell for it, got bored within the first week and all of his true colors started to show. I ended up avoiding as much contact with him as possible. It may sound easy, but I was dealing with a narcissistic-married predator. I tried to break things off two months into the relationship, didn't work. Secretly fantasized about him leaving me, didn't happen. I felt helpless at that point and just said, “He might as well control my decisions!” because I was tired. Finally, three months go by, he doesn’t care to trap me anymore and found another girl to go abuse. I believe his baby mother was going into labor around the time we mutually broke things off, and it’s a girl! So maybe he’ll act on his sexual desires with his daughter because that was one of many other fantasies he had.
