I had hoped that's all it was, and I appreciate your making a calm reply. On reddit, I'm used to a lot of argumentative behaviour. I considered simply canceling my comment and moving on because I didn't want to get into another argument.

I'd like to think that we can all agree that cat calling, approaching women walking alone at night, and similar behaviour is inappropriate. Not sure the word "inappropriate" goes far enough.  I'm a dude and I don't want people doing either of those things to me, either.

I see two kinds of problematic behaviour involved, though. In OP's case it was probably someone that is socially awkward and unaware that it was inappropriate. In the case of the guys approaching girls at night... I tend to think those guys are self-centered jerks -- the guys that think women "owe" them a response. As for the other scenario "alone at the bus stop"... I'm not sure. I've never done it, but unless she's reading a book, listening to headphones, or other signal that she wants to be left alone, I wouldn't have thought anything was wrong with starting a conversation. That said, thinking about it now,  I can see how the dynamic could be interpreted poorly. You're both getting on the bus. He saw where you got on, and where you got off. Is he going to try to sit next to you? Is he going to bother you the whole way to your destination while you can't escape?

I used to teach English in Japan. There was a common character I and other instuctors would run into on the bus/subway or just out and about: the "eigo bandit". They're well-meaning.. sort of. They just want to practice their English. But they'd often approach you while commuting, and the fact that you were reading a book or listening to music is generally ignored. It struck me as very selfish behaviour on their part. I just left my job, and want to get home.
