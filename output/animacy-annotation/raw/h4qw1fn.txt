Couldn't convince your ignorant ass otherwise, so why try? "War Criminal" is a stupid thing to accuse someone of when you're blissfully unaware of the Geneva IV, Laws of Land Warfare or the UCMJ. 

I know it's hard, when you live with the constant knowledge that you will never measure up to even the loosest societal standards of integrity or acceptable behavior. When you are so feckless and ignorant that all you can do is lash out with your pitiful slogans. That the simple act of doing research taxes your meager intelligence. Even though you live in a world where all you need to become educated is in the palm of your hand.

Remember your shitty behavior called this down on you.
