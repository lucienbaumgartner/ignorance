Your demon function is the one that contradicts your hero function in every way imaginable.

Your dominant (1st) function will have some overlap with both your 4th &amp; 5th functions, but almost zero overlap with your 8th (demon) function other than some rare coincidental results of using each.

The most important thing to understand that two functions on the same axis can not exist without each other and they are just extroverted 

Let's take me as an example. When I was less mature and didn't know about MBTI, I naturally hated when people overused my 5th, but I hated it even more when people based their decision on using what I now know is my demon function.

As a demonic function, it seems like using it would be the most backwards way you could imagine yourself doing things, you'd have to go against the very essence of yourself (hero, 1st function) to adhere to it.

As a specific example, me as an ISTP, when I was younger, immature and ignorant of MBTI and cognitive functions would see Fi Dom's as super judgemental, unable to give chances to people, and very stringent in how they see themselves and how they see others. It seemed a bit obnoxious to me, and I'm sure the immature IxFPs would have said the same of me.

But now, learning about MBTI, I respect that some people focus on Fi and there are actually some benefits to it. Still, if I tried to rule my own life via Fi, it would be destructive.

Likewise, INTJs hate people sticking to tradition for the sake of it or for the sake of safety, the INTJ must do the experiments necessary to change their own life for the better. Even if it's trial and error
