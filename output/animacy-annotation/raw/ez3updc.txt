I get it. You just weren't reading carefully, forcing your shallow "advice" (or should I be more precise, judgment) on strangers, even when nobody asked you to.  
Judge people who want to be judged of excuses. I am not one, as you give that kind of advice so generic and ignorant that I can't work with.
