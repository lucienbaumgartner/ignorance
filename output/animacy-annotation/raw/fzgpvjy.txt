As **Copycatch**, James Deacon had a simple job. His Thinker power enhanced the speed and efficacy at which he learned things, being ideal for skill acquisition and information synthesis, with a twist: Copycatch always learned more than he should. This effect was insidiously subtle, as James wouldn’t realise he hadn’t been taught what he’d learned until someone pointed it out to him. For example, after several hours of martial arts practice, James was asked to perform “that really difficult kick,” the testers referring to nothing in particular. He then proceeded to attempt a 720\* flying spin kick, which he absolutely whiffed, but nevertheless had never actually seen, practiced or heard of. Previously undated events would be given timestamps, suspect lists would narrow down or appear ex nihilo, and James would be none the wiser until someone said “I never told you that.” 

And so, Copycatch’s job was simple. He would be given material to read, memorise and synthesise, then be asked to deliver a presentation or report on the topic. Copycatch would deliver- straight-faced and unaware that his information was anything out of the ordinary- _case-defining_ information that his Watchdog compatriots would leap at. 

So that report, where St Louis was determined as 5 years away from HOSV status? _Didn’t actually contain that information._ Perhaps if there’d been a little more detail as to the gangs’ infiltration of the PRT there, or more accurate ratings of the villains and the threat posed by their plans, you could infer that the situation was that bad. But where others saw the reported fours and fives, James got the real eights and tens. 

Due to bureaucratic chaos only partially unrelated to a Simurgh attack that year, James never got the chance to deliver his adjusted report on St Louis. No one asked him about it. And so he stewed in the information that the PRT would be doing _nothing_ to help the city. He never considered that they didn’t know what he knew. Why? Because he _couldn’t._ That insidious fragment of his power functioned as a self-Stranger effect. Until someone pointed out that what he knew was out of the ordinary, he would never, ever consider that it was.

This made **Double Diamond** a dangerous and effective man. Now that he didn’t have to confide in anyone what he thought they already knew, the man was off to the races for discovering and defining weird shit. By always learning more about the current events of the city, by bantering with villains and heroes each chance he got, and by keeping a solid working relationship with his employees, DD was both absurdistly competent in what he did and preternaturally aware of goings on. His crew would be sent out to catch a rival drug run as though it had always been the plan. People were “fired” (via gun,) even if their subordination went unreported. Combined with that heroic lilt that he never quite lost- keeping civilians out of the fire fights, making sure real heroes were given their due and that the bad ones never got far- St Louis certainly benefited from his rise to prominence. 

Then the Simurgh hit.

I’ll reply to this comment with the repercussions of that and his second trigger when I get the chance.
