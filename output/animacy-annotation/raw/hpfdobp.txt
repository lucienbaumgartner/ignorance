I DNF-ed the Children of the Gods series by I.T. Lucas. I had high hopes for the series, and was excited to get into a long series again. Scraped my way to the third book before I rage quit the book and the rest of the series. It was based on a LOT of stereotypes and misconceptions about the Middle East. The bad guys were from the Middle East, which had been in "darkness" for "thousands of years." ðŸ¤¨ It was horrendous and just grew more intolerant as the series went on. The author should have picked up a history book. How can the birthplace of civilization be in darkness for thousands of years? ðŸ™„ It was extremely ignorant and unbearable to read.
