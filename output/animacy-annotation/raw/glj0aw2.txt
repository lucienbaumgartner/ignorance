That's the tricky part, I am not sure if there is anything I want as much as I want to get high (which makes me feel miserable and want to blaze even more). I used to think there were things I 'd rather do but weed just robbed me out of those desires. I am not sure what I want. I feel like the only reward and motivation I have in my life is to get high and I don't know where to start..

And of course, I know that isn't true. I have professional aspirations at least, I know I want to get good in my job but besides that....not really much motivates me. So i work and blaze and that's about it. When I do well during the weekend I just want to reward myself with a nice joint and then I realize I don't want anything as much as I want that feeling of being high and unaware of anything. 

What motivated you, not only to quit, but to stay "sober"? What was your "internal monologue" when you were fightung the urge to get high?
