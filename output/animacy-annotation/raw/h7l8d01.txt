Exactly! People will try to tell you, "same-sex love isn't love, it's just lust," and what they're implying is that "only opposite-sex couples can have true love" - which is just wrong. Same-sex and opposite-sex couples can both be based on love as much as they can be based on lust. And anybody who claims you should ignore your same-sex love because it's just lust that causes you to want that is wrong and ignorant of the reality of love in gay and bi people.
