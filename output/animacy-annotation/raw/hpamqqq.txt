How he hasn't been at least semi-canceled for his "jokes" literally advocating for child abuse is beyond me. I know it was very cool in some circles to be like "of course you better spank your kids", sort of the George Lopez deal, but Cannon took it even further and is 20 years younger.

Don't get me wrong, I used to find some pretty inappropriate shit funny too, when I was younger and more ignorant, and I'm far from perfect now but at least I genuinely try. Nick seems to avoid any kind of growth like he's allergic, and manages to slip through the cracks based on charisma + hustle (which is another huge red flag).
