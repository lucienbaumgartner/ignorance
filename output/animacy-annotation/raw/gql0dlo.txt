What do you mean by "born as a biological male"? I have provided you studies that trans women don't seem to be the typical biological male to begin with. Additionally, "born as biological male" does not per se provide you performance advantages. Compare cis boys and girls. There is virtually no strength difference between them. The differences come with puberty. The evidence does seem to point out that advantages trans women might have because of puberty seem to vanish if they go through HRT through a substantial time (usually 2 years).

There is also the problem that losing the advantages of male puberty can put you into a serious disadvantage. If trans women have a bigger skeleton you need more muscles to move them around. If you lose those muscles, then you need more energy to move your body around (also calles "big car, slow engine"). If hemoglobin levels drop due to HRT then you VO2max drops as well. So even if trans women have larger lungs than cis women they cannot use them appropriately. If trans women go through SRS then their testosterone levels drop far below cis womens standards, because trans women then only have one source of androgene production (adrenal glands) while cis women produce androgenes additionally through their ovaries.

As I said, the whole issue is not clear cut and to say that "being born a biological male provides trans women with serious advantages" is just utterly false and ignorant of any data.
