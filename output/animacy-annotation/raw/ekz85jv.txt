&gt; You're kidding right? We are giving Amazon money to come here.

I am unaware and possible ignorant here, i suppose. I am under the understanding that it is an incentives package on future tax revenue. 

&gt;That is the criticism of the incentive package, yes. This is why it's a stupid idea.

not if we get nothing and they go somewhere else, which is a possibility. 

&gt;This is actually incoherent.

its pretty clear, you just refuse to respond, but to dumb it down even more...would you rather have 6$ or 10$ more tomorrow than you have today. If you choose 10$ there is a chance you get nothing...if you choose 6$ its guaranteed. you are choosing 10$ with a chance at nothing.
