Reading all the comments and replies it sounds like you had a genuine (not insecure) reaction to the idea, and she has also has a genuine ability to start to rethink it from your perspective. In which case it’s a testament to the health of your connection that she felt comfortable expressing this thought to you and a testament to both of you if you can think about it from the others side and work through all the feelings. I don’t think there is an objective right or wrong here, this is all about how you both as individuals would ascribe meaning to a deceased ex remaining special in someone’s mind and memory and being expressed in that way... for me love is infinite and there is room in the heart for a lot of it, someone loving a deceased person from their past be it ex or family or friend would never be a threat to me, in fact I would love that they continued to hold their memory close, because isn’t that what all of us would want from those we leave behind? Isn’t that a sign of her loving nature and big heart? Whether I would agree to the name would literally depend on the name itself and whether I liked it. But that’s just me. You have a right to want to name your child in a way that you want. It’s a big deal. And she wasn’t wrong to suggest something that was on her mind. You both sound committed to each other (I think the other comments on here suggesting she is not committed to you are overly simplistic and ignorant of life experience with these things) and planning a future together. Ultimately being able to be honest and really know each other is more important than the misunderstandings along the way. She didn’t do anything abusive or similar that would make you need to question things. It’s also normal for people who grieve to remember the deceased at certain major life milestones. Nothing can replace the role you have in her heart and life. Y’all will find a solution to this, and just don’t forget to love each other while you do.
