I don't think Lovecraft should be judged too harshly for his ignorance. If you look into his life story he really could not have turned out as anything but racist and ignorant of others. He often said that he regretted his racism later on in his life though. That said, his dad named his childhood cat. Lovecraft decided to name his next cat after the cat his father named, not the same as his dad naming it.
