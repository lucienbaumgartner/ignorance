Your history teacher severely failed you in so many ways. And while I am worried about the fact that you seem to be willfully ignorant your ability to say you don't care about others and callous attitude to real victims of violence is infinitely more depressing.

Conspiring to overthrow the government and cededing from the union by declaration of war is not "joining a group I don't like" and the men honored as confederate hero's were treasonous enemies of their country, our country. They didn't just join a group, they trained and armed soldiers (poorly) to kill Americans. The definition of a terrorist is someone who through the use of violence or of the threat of violence in the pursuit of political, religious, ideological or social objectives. Acts committed by non-state actors. Sure the 9/11 terrorist were religious terrorist, but the confederate generals were political terrorist. The only people who see the confederates as nobel and not wholly treasonous are xenophobic and racist.

Columbus was an idiotic barbarian who disagreed with accepted scientific evidence and accidentally ended up in Haiti where he raped the women and murdered pretty much everyone. If he's your example of someone worthy of recognition, you are uneducated about the actual facts or are more likely refusing to acknowledge the truth because it would hurt you arguments.

Your last statement is so racist and ignorant that it honestly makes me physically sick to think another human could be so callous and hateful. But in case you want to educate yourself here's a resource to start, an article that statistically tells a story of how much more likely a POC is to face lethal assault from the police. https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/
