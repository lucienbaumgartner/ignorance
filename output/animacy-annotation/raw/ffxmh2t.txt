It's very difficult to misunderstand the word "NO". 

Stop being a rape apologist.

You're dying on a hill composed entirely of immoral and unethical acts. I understand that at your core, you're advocating for some measure of compassion and empathy directed toward the guy's girlfriend. That's not the point of the subreddit.

The point of a post like this is not "Advocate for my rapist". This should not be very difficult to pick up on, but, I wrote that to help you figure it out.

You can disagree with OP but are you so socially unaware and empathetically dead as to not comprehend these things? Are you guilty of something yourself and defending her in effigy of yourself?
