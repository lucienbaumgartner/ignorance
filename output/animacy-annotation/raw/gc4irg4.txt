Imagine being so close minded and ignorant that you think all farmers are retarded people who only farm because they couldn't have a "real job" when every single meal you've eaten was because these people decided they would be the ones putting food on your table. I stg some leftists have no perspective on life and how shit works in a highly cooperative economic market.
