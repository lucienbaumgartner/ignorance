1. Traffic, general driving skills, lack of concern for other road users. Drivers here are insanely dangerous, unaware, and selfish. As a cyclist (I don't even own a scooter any more) it drives me insane. Nearly got hit by a bus yet again today.

2. Air pollution. Admittedly it seems better recently but that's better compared to an atrocious baseline. Lots of people like to blame or on China, but the massive improvement during the level 3 'lockdown' pretty much conclusively proved that it's mostly is, and it's mostly from vehicles.

3. Banks. The at about the same state of progress that banks back in Scotland reached in the early 80s. And that's it generous.

4. The lack of sidewalks in almost all of Taichung. A major reason behind our plans to move elsewhere soon.

5. The education system. Children are robbed of their childhoods through insane school hours for no tangible benefit, although the massive harm is easily demonstrable. The Elementary and High school systems need to be radically overhauled and IMO the vast majority of cram schools should be either closed or be repurposed as spaces for kids to relax and have fun while their parents work, with no 'educational' component.

6. The KMT. Just go die a dignified death so we can get a real opposition party in place. On that note, let all taxpayers vote.

7. Make-up working days. Whoever thought of this should be jailed for life. And then some more.

That said, I love Taiwan to pieces and have no plans to ever leave. No country is perfect, and if you really love a place you have to be honest about its faults and try to address them, instead of pretending they don't exist. Taiwan has fewer faults than anywhere else I've lived, and the list of things I like would be ten times longer than this one.
