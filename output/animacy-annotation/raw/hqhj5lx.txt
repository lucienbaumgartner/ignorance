I've been out to my psychologist varios times through the years, and they haven't invalidated my ace not one, I feel very confortable with them. but just because they are psychiatrist validates or invalidates their OPINION, some people don't understand or just choose to forget the libido is not the same amount for everyone, and that sex is not something everyone enjoys or finds entertaining, some of us even find it disgusting, but thats us, not them, so I don't see how it affects them with us being ace, for real, this got on my nerves. YOU ARE VALID, please don't think about your psychiatrist, since what they did was very ignorant and unprofessional.
