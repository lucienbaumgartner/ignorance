Going back to the Korean war.  It was China which was fighting against the south to try and make all of Korea like the North.  

Chinese students are so brainwashed and ignorant.  That they go to South Korea, a country that wouldn't exist if it was up to China and do things like this.  I'm sure they would be more than happy to see all of Korea look like the North.  Since it's the support of the CCP that has allowed the North to become the shining example to the world it is today.  

North and South Korea are the perfect examples of what happens to a place that has help from the CCP and what happens to a place with US help.  Anyone with eyes knows which place is better.  

Except apparently students from mainland China.  Who seem to want the whole world to look like North Korea and the mainland.  A truly evil and disgusting view for the future of the world...
