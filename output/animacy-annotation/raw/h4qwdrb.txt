Years ago, I was coming round a bend near where I live and a woman reversed out of her drive, right into the middle of the road, then sat there as she proceeded to do her make up in the mirror.

I didn't even beep her. I was too gobsmacked that someone could be that incredibly unaware and inconsiderate.
