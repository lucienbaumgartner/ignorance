I think this discussion about how the setting is or isn't post-apocalypse kind of points out one of the things I love about the setting of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (and its inspiration, Roadside Picnic, really good book) is that the Zone is sort of a living thing.  It's like an event that keeps happening; the C-Con and the emissions and such result in an area with its own hazardous sort of ecosystem that has a sort of mind of its own.  Between lab experiments, radiation, mutation, and the political layer of the Zone, it's like a self contained world inside the outside world, a world that is in an ongoing state of apocalypse.  It's like the outside world, nervous and ignorant of what the Zone could be, is in a perpetual pre-apocalypse, with the Zone being an ongoing apocalypse that is ever changing, never predictable, never tamed, and so it is always dangerous but at the same time always bountiful, a place of true opportunity and chance; it's a paradox unto itself.  One could say that it's also the genesis of many things, such as strange artifacts that can do the impossible, leaps and bounds for science, wealth for those willing to take risks, and so on.  So maybe "half apocalyptic" is more appropriate when you think of it that way.  Someone's life in the Zone may end one day while another's fortune is made the next.  The Zone itself kind of reflects this, given it seems to be in some sort of equilibrium, not growing but not going away either, the fear (depending on your faction) being that it might one day be gone forever or go the other way and consume the world.  


Just some thoughts, very interesting themes and unique atmosphere, love these games, mostly played a ton of Anomaly so I'm going to try to go back and play through the main story of all three games soon.  I was surprised reading Roadside Picnic how much S.TA.L.K.E.R. really captured how that book made me feel, in its own way, so I recommend it to any stalker fans.
