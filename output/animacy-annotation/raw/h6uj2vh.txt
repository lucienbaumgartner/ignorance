If free will means you can do something other than what you're actually going to do, then it's just a nonsensical fantasy.

That doesn't mean you don't still have to make choices in the present, or that your choices don't matter. Even though the material processes that determine your choices are controlled by chemistry and physics, that's ultimately irrelevant to your personal experience as a conscious, rational, decision-making entity whose thoughts are a manifestation of those chemical processes.

Total tangent here, but it reminds me of the movie/short story "Arrival" in which thinking in a different (alien) language allows you to see the future, but prevents you from changing it or acting on it. It posits that there are two modes of thinking: linear human thought which is free and ignorant of fate, and circular alien thought which is precognizant but bound to follow the course of fate.
