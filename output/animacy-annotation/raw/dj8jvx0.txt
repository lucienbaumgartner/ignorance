I think that the media, and public in general, are so stunned by all the winning that they didn't even notice that ISIS doesn't exist anymore. It's possible that it's because the PC media and their global warming fearmongering combined to make the media reliant on solar energy and Trump's wall with Mexico is so high that it blocks the sun to 78% of the US, keeping the media in the dark and unaware that ISIS is gone.
