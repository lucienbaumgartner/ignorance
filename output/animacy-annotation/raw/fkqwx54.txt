First off, not defending the Ka-50 I state multiple times it's the most braindead heli. Second off, no shit, no tank in the game is a "skill-less tank" that's not how it works. If you dont know what you're doing at all you wont do anything at all for your team whether it be in a helicopter, plane, tank, ship, whatever you want. If you take immobilizing damage smoke grenades wont save you as you are sitting still and will just be shot again. It might buy you another 10 seconds but its delaying the inevitable. You are just so fucking arrogant and ignorant that you wanna complain about a helicopter while refusing to acknowledge america gets the easiest top tier premium load out of any other country by a mile. In my opinion almost every helicopter is pretty fucking braindead when you sit miles away from battlefield and spam atgms, you know how fucking happy I am with this nerf?
