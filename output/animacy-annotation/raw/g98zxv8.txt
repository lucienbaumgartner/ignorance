I think there's still something to be said for having cultural wisdom, though I'd say it comes as a function of experience rather than time.

I was born and raised in Europe and now live in North America, and I often feel like I can really see that America did not go through what Europe did in the 20th century.  So many people here view totalitarianism as something that can only happen to other countries, not the US, so they're blind to it's obvious presence in the GOP.

There's an almost naive idealism here and a kind of belief that democracy will always just be there or that things like the SC will actually protect it against a population that supports a despot like Trump.   In contrast, I think the grinding horror of the 20th century taught many Europeans that liberty is an extremely fragile thing, and that in order to not have a society be overrun by fascism you need to provide for everyone.  To me, European social democracy is a direct consequence of a society going through that horror and exists in stark contract to the ruthless, shortsighted capitalism that has torn the US apart.

In a lot of ways the US now looks like Europe before WW1.  Boisterous, militaristic, naive and unaware of its own fragility.
