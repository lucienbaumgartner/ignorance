Parasites might be the reasoning behind it but we don't itch because we're worried about parasites, we itch because it feels good, which is what causes attachment.

Do you shit in your pants as soon as you feel the urge? No you don't, you observe the urge, it may guide your actions in going to the toilet, but you don't immediately shit.

Do you itch as soon as you feel the urge? Yes because you have no control of it because you're unaware and unobservant of the urge to itch. How many parasites have you itched off in your lifetime? I'm willing to bet 0. How many times have you itched? At the very least hundreds of times. Why itch? Because you are unaware and blindly following your desire.

I'm not claiming to never itch btw, this all applies to me as well. But acting like meditation doesn't lessen attachment to desires such as itching is incorrect.
