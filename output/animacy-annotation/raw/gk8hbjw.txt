Any business involves sales and marketing, to try to devolve all of REI to two aspects is both naive and ignorant of the business itself. Is there a fair amount of sales and marketing involved? Yes. Are there many other aspects involved?  Yes. Can investor succeed by being really good at sales and marketing and ignoring other important factors? Yes. Can an investor also succeed by being worse at sales and marketing but better at market knowledge, local rules/regulations/how to navigate the local permitting process? Yes. Nuance is a fickle beast. You should always be wary of sweeping generalizations. And location, Location, location.
