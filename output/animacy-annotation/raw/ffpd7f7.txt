Innately assuming the man is not only Chinese, but is the driver of the crash that recently occurred that you were referring to, is a pretty racist assumption to make with no evidence or reason behind it and shows you read literally nothing but the headline.

On top of that, immediately going straight to "Wuhan" simply based on the fact that he is of Asian descent is also pretty racist, considering he has no relation or reason to remotely be associated with it. 


*Best case* scenario you're being so insensitive and ignorant that it isn't even funny.
