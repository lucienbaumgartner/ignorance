I ***LOVE*** Lariett, she's just so much more *real* than most regression FLs. She's weak and ignorant and doesn't magically turn into a different, wiser person because she went back in time, so she has no other choice but to try to suck up to the person who killed her, but that doesn't stop her from secretly hating her.

As she learns more about him and the actual situation in their country her struggle with her previous black-and-white thinking and her immense character growth is just \**chef's kiss**

Because the author resists the temptation to start her off as a badass, you get to go on the full journey with her of growing as a person and unraveling the truth she never knew in her first life, and I love how you see that not only despite her weakness but *because* of it she's actually a very strong person; she has to pretend to be friendly, innocent, and loyal to this person she loathes with every fiber of her being, the monster who murdered her entire family and destroyed her life before killing her too.
