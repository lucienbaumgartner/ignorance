Not everyone is Christian here. Even if they say they are. Some people are just ignorant and worse. That's the nature of the beast. It's not easy trying to look at scripture through the eyes of modern man but we're to at least recognize the times. It is biblical. When you start to push your will on others, and when you get people playing psychological games then it's evil

Now we might think of evil as extremes. But even the most subtle thing is evil because it leads to something bigger. It's like a crack in a dam. Unless you fix it, it can't fix itself and can only ever stay as bad or eventually (in time) get worse.
