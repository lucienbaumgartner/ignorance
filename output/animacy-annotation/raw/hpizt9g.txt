&gt; Its believing I have the right to decide what I put into my body

No, you ignorant idiot. It's believing you *know* better, and are willing to make your stupid dangerous decisions based on your falsely-self-inflated sense of discernment.

You don't have the ability to make the choice because you clearly don't have the ability to comprehend the information. That's why you're clinging to your conspiracy crap - you're scared and ignorant and willing to take answers that fit your presumptions rather than looking into the facts.

Your body is your choice if your choice is to keep it the hell away from everybody else. The moment you want to be a part of a society you accept that you and your choices are supposed to be based on the safety of those around you just as much as yourself.

If you're going to be this selfish and this stupid then you should be isolated.
