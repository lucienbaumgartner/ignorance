Well, for starters, I'm sure the extremely strong-feeling Aries Sun and Cancer Ascendant definitely have some impact.

I have Virgo in a different placement, but it is certainly the more offbeat Earth sign. I've heard myself described as "organized chaos" by both people aware and unaware of my Virgo aspects. Other than that, Virgos are less analytical in your placement and more... fastidious? Anxious? Like in order to feel orderly and structured as you describe, surroundings and circumstances have to provide that for you. So you may feel the drive to change things to feel more comfortable rather than naturally feeling that kind of comfort if that makes sense.
