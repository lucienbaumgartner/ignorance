Until we can turn yards into points we won’t win.  It’s the same shit every time.  Enough yards to score 35-42 points but no ability to move the ball consistently.  No push on the interior OL.  No goal line or short yardage specialists.  Generally a bad running game.  Either we are so unaware and bad at evaluating our team as a coaching staff or we are unable to figure out a cogent strategy.  Trying to run the ball as much as we are when we’re plan awful at it doesn’t make a lot of sense.
