You don't think something 50 years ago effects things today? 
Owning property is one of the biggest ways of wealth being passed to family. 
A woman finally gets a credit card and can own a home 50 years ago and in your mind you're like "yep it's even now" 
I bet every woman ran out that day to buy a home.. They all could afford it because we all know work was so equal then and today.. 
ROFL 
They are hundreds of years behind men and that's only talking about 1 thing compared to everything else I named. How pathetic and ignorant of you to not see it..what other ignorance would you like to spew in the thread as we all down vote your stupidity?
