Some guys will definitely be into it. I've had a schizophrenic boyfriend and it was great. Something about taking care of him, protecting him and comforting him through hard times felt really sweet. Also, foreplay was great because he was ridiculously sensitive.

All our close friends knew, and no one really stigmatized him for it. They saw him out, they knew he was normal. I would definitely advise not bringing it up before the first date just in case. Once you've gotten to know the guy for a bit, tell him, explain that you're not dangerous and ask him if he's ok with it.

Many will be. Some guys just don't have a very strong sense of self-preservation and would date you even if you said you were schizophrenic from the get go. Others have had neuro-atypical boyfriends before and figure it's probably the same. Others will accept your explanation. The only people who wouldn't date you because of it, once they got to know you and you explained the reality are people who are both extremely fearful and extremely ignorant - so fearful and ignorant that they won't believe you even though they've done no research on this topic (and if they did research it they would realize you were right). Why would you want to date them anyway?
