It kills me how people seem to think it's this "bad far off thing I don't need to worry about". Like, I was born in 1981. I can *very clearly* remember a number of environmental things that have completely changed.

Now I'm not necessarily talking about the obvious ones, like how I can see with my own goddamned eyes how much worse storms have gotten and I can feel how temperatures are significantly high ever overall, and the summers are far hotter.

But my biggest thing? The bugs.

When was the last time you saw more than a few fireflies here and there? I visited my home in VA over the summer (I moved further north), and there were hardly any, anywhere. When I was growing up every damned evening had swarms of them everywhere. I remember caterpillars filling the trees and crawling across the road in legions when I'd walk to/from the bus stop. Hundreds of large beetles flitting around the yard on a humid summer day. Bees and butterflies everywhere. Take a ride on the interstate and your car would be covered in bug splatters.

Sure, you might be thinking "Ew bugs!" but they're an important part of every ecosystem, and their numbers are at *a slim fraction* of what they once were. Pair that with the increase in air pollution, increase in water pollution, huge increase of CO2 in the air, the changing weather, and we're staring at a crisis that's all but unseen by most.

I don't understand how someone could be my age or older, and just...deny that we're fucking up our own environment? I can't understand how people can completely shut out reality, forget their own personal history, and fervently defend (often to their own deaths these days) a fabricated reality. Are we so poisoned by the rich that we can't even connect with our own memories anymore? Or each other? That we're incapable of thinking critically on a large scale? How can you bring yourself to be so willfully ignorant and blind?
