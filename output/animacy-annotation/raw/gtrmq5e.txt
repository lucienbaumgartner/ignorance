Solas is much worse in my opinion, like sure he's a fun character or whatever 
But if you dont conform to his ideas of the fade, spirits and elves wanting to know their history, he disapproves the f**k out of you 

At least with Vivi, shes talking out of opinions that not everyone might share. With Solas, his opinion is 100% fact and everyone else is wrong and ignorant 

Of you couldn't romance the egg, I doubt people would like him as much
