You hold and mine bch but promote Nano?  That seems odd to me, especially given the investment required for mining.

As for Shib etc, that remains to be seen - just because they pumped doesn't mean they have long term value, they will drop like a rock when the next meme comes along (what is their valuation based on other than hype?).  Remember crypto is super young. People may not care now, but that's because people are ignorant and greedy (and that won't change).  However, if you intend to truly function as a medium of exchange and attract widespread adoption, then actually the people who truly matter in that adoption, the gatekeepers and decision makers, the businesses, the exchanges.... they will begin to care more and more as the space matures.

I'm sure Nano works well, but without a requirement to invest energy into it there's zero to stop someone issuing "NanoDoge" (just fork the Nano GitHub repo) and  issuing all the coins to their pals (think politician, music star etc with PR clout - or Mr Musk).

Bitcoin Cash can be cloned, but to do so would require a huge investment of time and energy (which are much rarer than just another open source clone token issue).

This is why I refuse to back any proof of stake chain - and I expect to see that opinion spread as the industry continues to get burned with rug pulls etc.
