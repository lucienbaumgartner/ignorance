All awesome points.

I avoided sex in HS, half because of a Christian upbringing and half because I was judgemental and ignorant of what the world looked like outside of my home.  Even still I'm not sure if I'm ready to pursue sexual relationships, but i have a feeling that would change if I found the right person I could share it with.

And thanks for sharing your experience, I hadn't considered how much sexual development would happen after that choice is made. I've a long way to go yet.

Thanks for the thought provoking discussion! Those can happen in the most bizarre places on Reddit. Best of luck in whatever this strange November meme might bring
