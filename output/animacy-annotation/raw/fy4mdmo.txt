Disrespectful culturally and the guy is using a philosophical take to avoid apologising. It's just stupid to go to another person's country and do things like this, either he's unaware and ignorant or aware and being a dick.

However, on a philosophical level having a shrine to Buddha is already a bit counter-buddhism, and having a bunch of potentially violent drunk guys defend it is pretty cringe too.
