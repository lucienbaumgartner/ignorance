&gt;You can't send me a wikipedia article about racism and act as if it proves your point. The reality is that prejudice+power cannot explain every act of racism, and not every acts of racism can be exclusively systematic.

Every  hateful views  has ideologcal backing it up.  Racism isn't just discrimination but the ideas behind it. 

&gt;Take asian hate crimes during COVID for example. Wealthy asians have significantly more societal power than black people. Nevertheless, there were numerous instances where black people specifically targeted and attacked asians because of the color of their skin. Are you really going to tell me that those were not acts of racism because asians have more power?

Those hate crimes  had root  anti Chinese  rhetoric  from Trump  and other far right politicians.  

It was just done by only black but also white people to.

Sure it was act of racism  based what behind  it. Not based  on black people doing hate crime.

&gt;Furthermore, you saying "I know people who experience racism" is the same as bigots who say "I am friends with black people" when they try to defend their use of the N-word.

Fallacy. It's  definitely between using black friends as justifying using racist language  and listening to  different people  to lean about racism. 

&gt;Calling someone a cracker because they are white is by definition, racist. If you are too stupid to admit that, because you're ignorant and racist, at least acknowledge that it is prejudiced and wrong.


Cracker  was original a classist slur used by rich white people against  poor white people.    Then later used against  slave owner  and today used against racist  white people.  
Not really  racist slur but  it can be used discriminatory  in some contexts of course like with every other  slur.
