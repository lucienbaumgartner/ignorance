I suppose it's possible. if 2 objects dropped after killing the boss. I grabbed the skull, and I had a teammate who is pretty stoned and unaware that I assumed would grab the key. If he didn't then I guess that's possible that he's lying to protect his ego or whatever. I dont know. 

guess i'll delete the thread
