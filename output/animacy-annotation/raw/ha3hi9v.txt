You mean when he said that both Japan and Howard Stern are radioactive? A slightly clever play on words, but really not his most offensive work.

Now if your friend wants to honestly listen to the comedians' opinion on the matter Dave Chappelle, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld, and Chris Rock have all spoken extensively about this issue. Lenny Bruce lived it. You have 2 clear and high profile examples of it happening in the last decade. It exists and its not up for debate.

Here's another example. Roseanne. I've never been a fan, and what she said was pretty effing oblivious. It was also racist as hell, but is it any more racist that some of the shit Amy Schumer has said in her routines. "I used to have sex with Mexicans but now I prefer consensual." That's both racist and ignorant of the fact that rape is not sex... but it was a joke. A set up followed by an exaggerated and unexpected punchline. Is it ok to tell that joke at dinner in front of your daughter's Hispanic partner? Probably not, but at the same time I probably wouldn't say to a former Catholic alter boy "What does caviar have in common with Michael Jackson? They both come on little crackers." Some things are just tastless, you know?
