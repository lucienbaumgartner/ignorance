Uh... I think your assessment is highly biased and ignorant of tournament play. Yes, tournament players have narrowed the scope of the game considerably, much of which may be for the worse, but almost all teams run a sniper and most kills are from primaries. Tournament play seldom features much "aping" because the skill level within punishes that style of play.

The issue isn't countering aping, which, with all the shottie nerfs over the recent seasons, if you're still getting aped I don't know what to say, but the issue is how easy it is to literally kill anything in the game. You push two buttons. No other class comes close which means it is more than "not an outlier", it is "the outlier".
