Democrat Williams Jennings Bryan, considered the origin of "trickle down economics" name calling.  But you are an economics expert so you knew that? Hmmmm.

You literally stated that supply side economics "gives the wealthy their money which is a lie.  We are discussing how they should be taxed and their wealth redistributed.  Some liberals would like a 75% tax of the wealthy.  Nobody with an intelligent understanding of economics would argue for the term trickle-down economics, it an ignorant and meaningless term.
