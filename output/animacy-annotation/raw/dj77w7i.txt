*What if I was so mentally ill and unaware that I went around manipulating people thinking that I loved them.*

God, I feel you, that's the fucking worst feeling in the world. I haven't found an answer to that, but I understand. I think I do. There are so many times where I tell myself the exact same thing, and it's so harmful to my mental health. Never knowing if I'm doing something *good* and *helpeful* for someone.

I'm so sorry you're going through all of this. I wish I could help more.
