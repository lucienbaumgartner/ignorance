My reasoning for a lot of my mistakes was simply that I was young and dumb. Arrogant and unaware that our relationship would become what it has, but so much time and split ups have happened like I said, I can see where she's coming from.

My concern is his fight to be with you. How do you feel he is feeling about everything and do you think there's genuine sincerity in his voice when apologizes?

I'm at a place where relationships like this come to die. I've been a terrible husband and have overlooked so many of the signs, and if I were to have the opportunity to prove to her how much I truly care I'd jump at it in a heartbeat. If he feels anyway like I do regarding my situation,  be open minded but also be stern that you are not to be disrespected and walked over.
