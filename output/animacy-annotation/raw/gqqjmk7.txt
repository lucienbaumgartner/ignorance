It literally is lol, because now you're no longer the first listed person and you're still waiting to sell, but at a slightly lower price. If say 50 people list after you, most of them will match the lowest price, so you'd sell as 51st in both scenarios, but if you undercut, you're selling at a lower price.  


Idk why these comments are getting downvoted when that's literally how the system works, being salty and ignorant of how the new system works won't make your items sell faster lol
