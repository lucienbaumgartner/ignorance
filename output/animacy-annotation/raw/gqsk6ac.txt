Just like there are ranges in orientation and sex drive there are scales within preferences, there are no fixed rules – what you like and what you enjoy is unique to you, that is true for everything in life sexual and otherwise.  

I’m a bottom, as a kid I learned for myself that playing with my hole was my favourite activity and for me the primal sex drive has always been anal-centric – needing to be penetrated, fucked and getting bred seems to be the way I’m wired psychologically or even instinctual – for me it is much a mental and emotional experience as it is a physical one.

I do enjoy my penis and masturbate as secondary stimulation or when alone.  I can take or leave receiving a blowjob but love sucking cock. I have tried topping because I thought I should and it was OK but more a chore than a pleasure.

We are who we are and no one should criticise or shame anyone for knowing what they like, need and acting on it. There are many guys who are similar to you who have no interest in any penile stimulation, it is not a flaw, it a characteristic. People and their sexuality and preferences are incredibly varied and as long as no one gets hurt all the better for that. If people won’t accept you for yourself it is they that have a problem and you should ignore the uniformed and ignorant that won’t.
