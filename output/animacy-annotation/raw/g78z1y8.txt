What?

Bruh, ignorant people said the *exact same shit* about the new deal. They have said the same thing about every single major public works campaign and regulation to protect things like the environment and employees. The fearmongers have only been consistently wrong. Over and over. I for one enjoy the interstate highway system and would prefer the town I grew up in not disappearing under water in south Florida.

History shows that people like you have been wrong every time. You are in a sad state of ignorant denial. You are completely uneducated and unaware of the human impact on climate. 

Also, data from every state that has undergone similar sorts of changes is positive. It stimulates the economy, creates entire new sectors to it as well as permanent jobs.
