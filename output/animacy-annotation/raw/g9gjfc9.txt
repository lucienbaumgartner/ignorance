I was 12 years old and unaware that I had been having panic attacks almost every day for two months. Twice they were so bad that I made my parents drive to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attackâ€” and I was 12!!! Nobody ever recommended me mental health resources or asked themselves, " Gee why is this 12 year old having panic attacks that are so bad she thinks she's having a heart attack?"
