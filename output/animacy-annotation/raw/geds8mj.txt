Yeah, I doubt he's crusading this because he personally feels the need to, it's likely he's doing it because she told him to. Making him fully aware of what happened should at least get him to realise there's no need to bother OP about it.

&gt;Side note: she should not have clients if sheâ€™s that insensitive and unaware of boundaries when it comes to weight loss?

Yup, I can see her causing some serious damage to clients with any kind of mental health issues.
