It’s people like you that are the reason I haven’t seen my niece and nephews in two years.   Oh, and the reason why why my aunt is dead.   Stay home.  You sound horribly ignorant and selfish.    Re-read that first paragraph.   “...staying with a different friend every night, seeing lots of people, going to restaurants and museums and just generally being very social”.   And then you go on to say “we will only have mild cases” like you plan to get sick and spread it.   And your quarantine would be an inconvenience.  Fuck you.
