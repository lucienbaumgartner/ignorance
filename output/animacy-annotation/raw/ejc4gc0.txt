Weirdly, humans have evolved to a point where social cues and nuance in language are incredibly important. 

Is it *TeChNicAlly* correct to say it isn't normal? Sure.

Is it socially unaware and dehumanising? Yes.

*Insert Ben Shapiro "definitions don't care about your feelings" monologue.

Just because something is technically correct doesn't make it right to say or use. If I met you and your partner and you introduced us by name but I constantly referred to your wife as "your wife" whilst she was stood right in front of me that'd be incredibly rude. Yes I could say "but she is your wife, the dictionary defines wife as. blablablabla" it wouldn't change the fact that it's not socially correct to refer to her by the term.
