Gender is a social construct informed by our biology. That’s what you don’t seem to understand. Traditional gender rolls and the way we dress and behave is 100% based on sexual selection and what traits the opposite sex finds desirable in a mate. It’s not purely social, divorced from biology, that is absurd and ignorant of the history and biology of mankind. Men behave in masculine ways because that’s what women find attractive. Women behave in feminine ways because that is what men biologically find attractive. It’s social and biological simultaneously.

There’s also significant differences in the way men and women think and behave based on the way the brain is structured. Male brains have more bandwidth within hemispheres and women have more numerous ones across hemispheres. What this leads to is women being much more intuitive, creative, compassionate, agreeable. While men are more perceptive and logical. Our different brain structures inform how we perceive the world and develop growing up which leads to differently behaving animals post-puberty.

There are people who don’t fit inside the box. That’s fine. There’s also people born with 6 fingers. However you wouldn’t try to rewrite my anatomy textbook that states humans have 5 digits on each hand just to placate an incredible minority.

And yet that’s what we are doing on a societal level.
