By your name I can see you're talking about America, I'm talking about an empire far greater and in that population control will be needed.

Also there are many people having many kids who shouldn't, those single mothers living off the state with a string of neglected children sired from multiple father's, those who raise their children in poor fashion contrary to good values, those that are genetically sickly or feeble minded.

The problem is poor, ignorant and stupid breed away whilst smart, dignified and strong know to wait.

When those filthy undesirables are allowed to run without check....well, just look at the world we live in.
