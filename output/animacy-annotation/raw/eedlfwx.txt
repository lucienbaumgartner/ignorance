&gt;They are both skimming off the top of my labor 

No, that's incorrect for a whole long list of reasons. Here's a couple:

 \- Voluntary vs Involuntary.  I willingly agreed to be paid X, and was paid X.  There's nothing else to it.

\- Assuming that the 'capitalist' pocketing a premium or markup on your labour is 'skimming' implies that the capitalist adds no value to the situation.  Naive, obtuse, are terms that don't even begin to describe how stupid and ignorant that position is.
