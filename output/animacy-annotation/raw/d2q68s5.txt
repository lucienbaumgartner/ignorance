That, IMHO, is a matter of personal belief.  I'm all for recycling and repurposing things, but to me, that doesn't extend to animal products.  It's easier for me to just say "no more animal products, at all".  Finding loopholes in my belief system doesn't really say much about the integrity of my belief.

Here's how it's different:  My wife purchased these boots for me in Christmas 2014, before I went veg.  I was unaware and oblivious to the atrocities committed by the leather, meat, dairy and egg industries, so I didn't think anything of it.  But, now that we've changed our lifestyle, we've committed to reducing our footprint, and to avoid contributing to anything that causes pain and suffering to animals.  So, no more animal skin or fur for us.  At all.  But, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and I don't knock anyone for purchasing used animal skin.
