Americans need to learn to get a fucking grip and learn how to pay attention to a news story for more than 3 days. Im honestly shocked at just how cavalier and clueless some people are about this whole affair. The fucking president is currently and actively being IMPEACHED and people cant be bothered to even read a single story about it? Its honestly baffling to me. Our education is so fucked that we are spawning these ignorant, short attention spanned people who couldnt be bothered to read a book, let alone a couple paragraph news stories. For gods sake people, our democracy is at stake here, i think now is a good a time as ever to pay attention. Im honestly angrier at the general public for being so stupid and ignorant that the guiltiest president in history is scamming them and they cant even be bothered to pay attention or even care.
