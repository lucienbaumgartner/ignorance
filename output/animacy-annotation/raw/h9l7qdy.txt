No one even said that, stop conflating. We’re talking about someone who could be able bodied and able to give up the seat to someone who could use it *more*. Thats just like saying the guy who is fine in health not givng up his seat to the immigrant (lmao which has nothing to do with needing a seat) not giving it up to her. 😂

My issue is you and other’s pretending like being pregnant isnt a health situation where that person could use the seat more. 

Youre out here saying “pregnant women dont need it! There’s nothing wrong with them!” Is astoundingly uneducated and ignorant of you. Yet here you sit still missing the damn point. Youre a troll. Blocked, because tbh its clear youre waaaaaay too mentally challenged to see why youre wrong.
