I agree that regulations were way too lax around passing the covid vaccines we have and that the companies should never have been made immune to prosecution as frankly that encourages shady behavior. BUT. To say this is medical apartheid or nazi level tyranny is just absolutely idiotic and ignorant of the absolute atrocities against humanity that were those historical events. 

No one is coming to your home and dragging you/your family into the streets and forcing vaccination or labeling you with stickers about your 'status' or political affiliation. You are still going about your life, free to post absolute BS bile on the internet, still allowed to speak out without repercussion, still living/eating/acting however you want (clearly). So in reality this is nothing even remotely similar, you are just being made to feel a little uncomfy with your choices... as you should be.  Which, again, is NOTHING like having all your possessions seized and being shipped in a cargo container to a death camp. Stop being a dramatic baby.
