Andywarski is exceptionally stupid. If that's what you mean by "he did nothing wrong", then I agree. Being stupid is not something he should be blamed for. His approach to serious social issues is incredibly uneducated, unaware and shallow, but I don't hate him, I just feel bad for him. I feel like he's a decent, vulnerable guy with very low intelligence. Although I gotta admit, that whole bragging about stealthing shit that went down a few months ago really made me lose a lot of empathy for the guy. 

He's also very easily manipulated by horrible people like JF. No, I don't know the story behind it, are you referring to a specific event?

What I was trying to say in my previous comment is that some youtubers take the whole anti-sjw crusade A LITTLE BIT too far to the point that they start sympathizing with WS. When "sjws" get on the show they usually get screamed at, but white supremacists? Mmh well, their views are a little extreme but, you know, freedom of speech and shit. Oh please andy.
