No, he never was alone with her after he was realized what was going on. Had he fought us on this, we would have had to call the police or her attorney, but he didn't.
I imagine at this trial, we'll find there was a lot more evidence than is being reported to the public due to health privacy laws. Would it make a difference to you if she was non-ambulatory and unaware- that is, if she was in a semi-vegetative state?
I have an adult disabled son and I can't even get legal "custody" of him, or power of attorney, even though he doesn't know his birthday, phone number or address. The standard in Iowa to get POA is very high. They would automatically default to the spouse, and the daughters would have to show overwhelming evidence that he not only did not have her best interest at heart, but that leaving him as her custodian would be detrimental to her well being.
