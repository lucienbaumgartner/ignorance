I can appreciate your points and that's a perspective (ending up devils advocate) I've been in many a time. From my time with English people (and being in England and being married into an English by descent family) discussing contemporary affairs, I find there are two gears, the type a) yobs who glorify entirely the wrong parts of imperialism and type b)  ashamed and ignorant of their country's great achievements ("I don't want to be English, I want to be British, Scotland leaving ruins that for me" - my old boss) , a view which I ironically wholly disagree with.

I would even agree the hate on Reddit against the British is disproportionate.. But that's just Reddit. 😁
