Im not a xhaka hater, but if i want to nitpick, his slowness almost cost us a goal when he went casual and unaware that westham player was behind him.

Other than that, 3 points earned.

Anthony taylor sucks though and he gonna steal the headline despite us suffocating westham for majority part of the game.
