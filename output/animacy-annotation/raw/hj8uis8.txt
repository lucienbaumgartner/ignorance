The problem with Dave’s words are that he advocates for a mindset that says they aren’t worthy of a life of dignity, respect and happiness.

People don’t hate Dave. They hate the attitude that he advocates for. But, nuance is dead. Many of those that love this special would absolutely hate the shit he used to say in the past about them. 

You can’t spend 30 minutes ranting about hating prime and then say “I want peace and love for all.” It’s like calling a black person the n-word and then saying you love them. Hilariously tone-deaf and ignorant of the irony.
