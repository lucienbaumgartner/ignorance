Ong I lived in South Philly for most of my life surrounded by all types of cultures and races that had one thing in common: they all got some evil ass gangsters and killers 😂 when I moved down here to the burbs people are so fuckin dumb and ignorant that “stuff like that doesn’t happen” type shit even when there gang violence and shit in the small town I’m in rn nobody even acknowledges it 🤦🏻‍♂️ kinda dangerous if u ask me it’s finna get civilians killed for no reason
