Thats not true. MOST healthy under 50 people don't suffer severe or long-term complications. 

But there are plenty of high profile cases of athletes (20s and 30s adults in the peak of physical conditioning relative to the general population) contracting serious cases. Eduardo Rodriguez of the red Sox had to sit out the year because he had heart inflammation/scarring, Freddie Freeman of the Atlanta Braves talked about how he felt like he was gonna die, Profesional Wrestler Kieth Lee (who is admittedly a VERY large man who is quite heavy, though his line of work/style does require him to be in shape) also had heart inflammation that kept him out. 

Now to my knowledge there hasn't been any high-profile cases of younger athletes/celebrities in good health who have died. But given what we know in the general population regardless Long covid is a concern that people seem to ignore and disregarding it now is just kicking the can down the road and leaving a VERY expensive problem for future us. Loss of productivity in the economy due to a hamstrung workforce, Lower population in general due to death, reduced birth rate,etc.

It's just a very ignorant and uninformed claim overall.
