About amagi, that's the point of the story. She decided not to make a big deal of  her sickness until it's too late to do anything about it. That's her flaw, she loves her sisters too much it clouded her judgment, and she realized that.To some people, that actually give depth to her character, and they like that.

About KGV, again, you didn't read the story. Hood offhandedly tell her it going to cause problems  to QE if she didn't keep a low profile.

The whole shebang about akagi having full authority over SE navy force was already explained in previous events, read it. Nagato gave her permission to lead the SE girls, mikasa wasn't  around to do anything, and Mutsu follows Nagato orders. Justified or not , akagi was given the authority. Kaga was her right-hand man because I assume she wants the same thing as akagi.

I don't really like any of the fox sisters that much, and I can't be arsed to care what you or others favourite, people like what they like. It's when you act dismissive and ignorant, that I get miffed. 

Half of the community ( great exaggeration there) likes amagi, but you don't ? "Lol, probably they're all have sick-people fetish, right? It couldn't possibly for any other reason, like her design, voice, personality, or whatever else? No way. They're all fanatics with shit taste." *do you not see any problems with that kind of perspective?*. 

Also,let me be clear here, even if they like something for asinine reasons, who gives a shit? Let them .
