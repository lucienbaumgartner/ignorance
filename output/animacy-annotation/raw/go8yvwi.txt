The people currently making the MCU are some of the biggest superhero/comic nerds around. The amount of research they have put into developing the MCU correctly and in a manor that works on the big screen can’t be matched. It’s pompous and ignorant of you to think Hollywood doesn’t know what they’re doing at this point and not taking comics into consideration. Sorry, but you knowing the comics doesn’t make you unique or special anymore. Get off it.
