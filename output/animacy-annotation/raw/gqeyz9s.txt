I wish greyhound racing had been done right the first go around. I completely understand why it is defunct now but I remember going when I was young and unaware of how terrible the industry was. It was awesome to see a beautiful breed running faster than you could imagine dogs being able to run. A childhood friend had a rescued greyhound and it was an awesome
pet. 

You would have hoped people wouldn’t have been pieces of shit and abuse the dogs and get rid of them the second they get three bumps. You don’t hear about obstacle course dogs getting treated like shit and dumped off at shelters. I’ve heard the breeding of greyhounds has all severely halted too which is a shame. I feel like I hardly ever see them anymore.
