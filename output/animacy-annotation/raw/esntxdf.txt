I hear you man but too much time has passed. He couldn't be any further in his box. He's had three years of consistently strong warnings from every financial institution from the BoE all the way down, every business that trades with Europe, the health service, the agriculture industry, the science industry, the security services...god I can't even list them all.
And still there's people like him handwaving off the smoke as if there's not a huge fire burning underneath them.
I know appearing salty like I did isn't helpful. I get you. It's wrong. 
At the same time I'm not sure it's possible to be helpful to someone like this. You can try the softly softly approach, you can try patting him on the back or even just ignoring him. It won't change a thing. They'll still come on here, try to gaslight, obstruct, project, every single thing they're faced with.
So what's left to do? Shame them? Ridicule? I don't know. I'm sick of the whole issue and this was reflected in my slightly over-passionate response. 
The country is fucked, and it's people like him - willfully or naturally stupid and ignorant - that has driven us towards a cliff. To me, they are just as cretinous as their masters, because they have failed at every turn to learn how to think critically. 
But I concede, you're absolutely right.
