Your doctor will make that decision, book in for a phone call with them ASAP. They’re well versed in your situation. 

Also just to say that your parents are probably just scared, and ignorant of mental health. Medication is really important, particularly if you need a boost to get you to the talking therapies. 

I hope you get the help you want! And move on with life. Even asking for the help shows that you’re going to be just fine. Xx
