Yes I am a kid, no I'm not nine. What I meant was when people do and or say ignorant and offensive things on the internet, some people just assume that they're nine years old. Like younger kids aren't the only ones capable of doing stupid things. Adults can too, everyone makes mistakes. Or when people only see the bad sides of younger kids and not the good sides, or when people think being childish is the worst possible thing to be. 

I don't see being childish as a bad thing. I was just saying that it really bothers me when I see people on the internet assuming others are little kids based on their actions. There are also probably nine-year-olds that are smarter and more mature than the adults who are making fun of them.
