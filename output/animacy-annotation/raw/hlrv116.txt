Lol great story haha. See what I mean though? You managed to identify the East Midlands accent but only because you’ve actually spent time there. No one else ever gets it right. People just don’t know the accent, and are ignorant and unaware of the East Midlands in general. Like, I’ve never been to Newcastle, but I know what a Geordie accent sounds like. That doesn’t happen for East Midlands English. Unless you’re from there or spent a lot of time there, nobody knows about it. It’s as if our accent doesn’t even exist.
