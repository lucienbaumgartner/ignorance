okay but he meant that if you're for example extremely chaotic but youre so unaware and unconscious of it you think you're a controlling person (not because you're actually controlling but because you desire control in your life so much) then the world will be the one who will tell you "hey you're so chaotic, stop" and this happens when you for example get constantly fired because of constant chaos from you that causes problems to other people and mostly yourself

the world will tell you who you are while you dont know who you are

think of your relative that is so selfish and they think they're martyrs

or the so controlling but think they're chill

or the one that always put their intuition over facts but thinks they "do the research"

not everyone is as unconscious as this, specially in this sub, but it's funny that there are whole communities built with only unconscious people like this like anti-vaxxers or people against masks or flat earthers
