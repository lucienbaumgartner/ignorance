The goal of being alive is not necessarily been happy. There is a marked correlation between ppl I know who are blissfully unaware and happy and highly functional but highly tortured. 

Happiness does not need to be the only life goal. There is way more to life than just been happy. 

Also, in a sense, we are all men without legs to certain degree. Yes, we should all be grateful that we still have our arms. Life is not a competition of who has lost the most number of legs because life does not care. Take what you have and go for it.
