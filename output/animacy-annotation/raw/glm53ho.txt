The rapid tests are not as effective as these people believe, unfortunately. The rates of false negatives is far too high to take it as it is. It's why a lot of places send for PCR after a negative rapid test, we just can not rely on it to be a true indicator of COVID status. Not only that but it's wasteful! All these tests going to people who do not need them, compared to those who are at a higher risk of contracting or COVID likely being more sever to their population. Influencers are ridiculously wasteful and unaware of what it is to be a regular person. The pandemic had made it abundantly clear that they care little beyond their income, we're just numbers to them and COVID is just an inconvenient thing that keeps them from vacations, brand trips, and collabs.
