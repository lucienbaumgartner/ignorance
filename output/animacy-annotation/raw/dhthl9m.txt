Everything you said is true, but it's not Trump's fault. The DNC is going through a lawsuit right now claiming that Bernie supporters had no right to think the primary election ought to be free and fair.

The ones trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes are the elites. To quote a Democratic supporter writing to Podesta: 

&gt;*["And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)*
