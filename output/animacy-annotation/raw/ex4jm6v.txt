Yep, all of this. They're used to small town income and that's how they measure themselves. They think that by doing better than the upper class of Parowan, that they're rolling in it. Not the case at all but they're so narrow-minded and ignorant that they have no freaking idea what real money is. The people cashing out on tech IPOs, now that's self-made. We're talking base salaries of 400k not incl stocks and bonuses. The Tripps are flush with liquid influencer cash. It's inconsistent at best. It's gonna suck when they have to sell all their luxury shit to pay for diapers.
