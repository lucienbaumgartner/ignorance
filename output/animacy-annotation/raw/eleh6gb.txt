Yeah. They have different ideologies but they’re both IMPERIALISTS. They’re not apple and oranges. They’re the same fruit. It’s just unfortunate that we’re on the receiving end of China’s aggressive expansionism. The truth is, we’re within the sphere of US hegemonic influence. We’re just their pawns to advance their interests. I just want to say that we should all be wary of the world superpowers’ advancements towards us and aim for a true independent foreign policy.

I think it should start from our way of thinking. We should not love and trust Americans too much. Unfortunately, some users here are blindly embracing America to the point that it’s okay for them to be under the influence of US. I can see it as being weak and ignorant. That kind of thinking for me is wrong. We don’t have to run always to Uncle Sam every time we are in trouble. We can seek help from them, as a friend, but not as overlords.
