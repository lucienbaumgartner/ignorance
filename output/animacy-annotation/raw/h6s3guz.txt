The point of masks, social distancing, self isolating, and vaccination, is to protect the community. "I got mine" is selfish, and ignorant of those who may not have a choice in getting vaccinated, like children and cancer patients. There's still a pandemic. You're still an asshole if you don't care that you could give it to someone, even if that someone just doesn't believe in vaccines.
