I believe you are not indian and unaware of Sikhism. The knife you see him wearing is called kirpan. A quick google search will tell you all about it. In brief it's similar to hijab for muslims, kippah by jews, clerical collar by catholic fathers. It is allowed to wear in parliament(white house of india) even.
As i couldn't identify any swords in the video i assume you are referring to sticks they are holding. They are flags of the farmer unions and one or two you see is of police. They were left/dropped by by them at earlier barriers they put up to stop them but failed.
