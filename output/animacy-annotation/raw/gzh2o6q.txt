I don't know Sherlock, but I do think that having another player who has THE SAME problems Timo is having is a total downgrade. 

We need solutions, no more problems. 

We have one HUGE Problem mate, we don't have a world class finisher who can show up in the big moments and change the game, and is CLEAR that Lukaku is not that player. 

We need an intelligent striker who is aware of position. Lukaku is dumb and unaware of position. He never shows up in the big games. He is still as bad as he was with Chelsea and M. United. Did you watch every single minute of all Inter matches during the season? I did and I can tell you that there is ZERO ZERO improvement. He still making the same dumb mistakes he used to in the PL. The only difference is that he is playing in an easier league where he can score more goals. 

What is the reason Inter got eliminated from CL? He is the reason, not the whole team, only him for missing chances and secure results. Who is guilty of losing in the most important match he ever played in his life?.. As long as I know Inter didn't win the europe league. who scored against his own team? (Not only once)...

At least Timo put everything on the pitch. LUKAKU is mentally weak. After few mistakes he loses confidence and becomes a ghost on the field. We need an experienced, confident striker, we need a leader.
