I'm not sure about INFJs as a whole, but most of my friend groups over the years have been toxic/bullying/using me/dependent in some way, so for me yes, I suppose its because of the combination of my inner therapist in me, love to help people and possibly being naive and unaware that the people around me where benefiting off me in some way
