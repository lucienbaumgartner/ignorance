It's funny how this guy talks about censorship being bad, but is totally unaware of the amount of censorship Bitcoin has had historically in regard to the blocksize debates. His blindspot is literarily that all he does is listen to Bitcoin maximalists. Like the fact that he implies Bitcoin is the only PoW blockchain, and makes claims that all other blockchains have been messed with, just shows how unaware and delusional he is.
