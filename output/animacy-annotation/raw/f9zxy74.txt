Lmao regardless of you being religious or not the joke isn't that God put you, a gay man, in a religious family, the joke imo would be that God made your family so hateful and ignorant that they see your sexuality before your service. The situation sucks for sure but I will say that sometimes your life is better without those people in it. It's obviously not easy and coming from the military background I'm sure youre used to conforming to fit standards and follow orders but when youre outside of that realm this life is yours. Would you rather feel like shit or take some of that power into your own hands. Fuck you went to Afghanistan and came back you don't deserve any shit from anyone least of all about who you like
