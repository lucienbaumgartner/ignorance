The most common distinction would be: vore if the takodachi inside the bag is alive/self-aware at least until the moment it gets eaten, and cannibalism if it is dead and unaware (and of the same species, naturally). I was surprised when she talked about vore in that situation since it did not really make sense in a context of a takodachi-based snack.
