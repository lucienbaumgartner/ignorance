More and more, with every failure in only six months of this adminisration, they are proving that Trump's perspective on matters was outstanding (illegal immigration, Hamas, Iran, energy independence, jobs, law enforcement, military, etc.)

They set out to undo Trump, like little spoiled babies, and are breaking everything they touch, telling me they literally are clueless, inept, and ignorant of how to govern.

Trump should open a school of government.  The law school path will do us in.
