No chance. Zero.  At least not enough to make a difference. Someone came into my business last fucking week with no mask. I still require them as me and my workers are face to face with people for hours. I asked him to put on a mask and he said “you know there’s no virus, right?”  After a second request to mask up, he said he’d rather leave. I’m glad he beat me to the next step. 

These people are either so stupid and ignorant that they think this is still fake, in JULY OF 2021 or they’re too proud to break from their ranks of “Patriotism”.
