This sentiment is all over Reddit, too.  Hearing it from other Americans annoys me the most.  Our country has some serious issues, obviously.  Corruption is a major problem in all levels of our government, and most of our societal problems stem from that.  But to compare a problematic 1st world nation to a developing country where children are working in dangerous factories just so their families can eat strikes me as extremely spoiled and ignorant of what others in the world are going through.
