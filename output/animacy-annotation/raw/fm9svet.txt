I grew up in and out of fostercare I moved through 27 elementary schools and was fairly illiterate till 8th grade. I fought hard to try and stay in the same high school I still moved through three. 

Your so very lucky and ignorant that you got to grow up in a stable enough environment that school work was your biggest worry. 

The world I grew up in I had alot more to worry about. I'm lucky just to have survived. Not everyone gets the same start in life and jailing people because they can't cross an arbitrary line when their not starting in the same place is just cruel. 

Unfortunately it's very true that a lack of stability in early life has a life long consequences.
