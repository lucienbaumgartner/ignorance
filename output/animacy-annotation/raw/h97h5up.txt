The big quote that I hear thrown around in regard to the famines in India during Churchill’s time as leader is “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion. The famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.” 

The attitude this quote shows is hard to construe as anything besides grossly negligent and ignorant of the Indians’ plight, even if it is out of context. I mean, in what context is this not a horrendous thing to say about a group of people who you rule?
