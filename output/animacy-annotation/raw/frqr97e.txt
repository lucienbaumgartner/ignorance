What is really wrong with people is that most people just don't care at all about anything, and most of the ones that do and want to fight (in any way) to make a better world are so incredibly lost and ignorant that they end only doing harm. There is no worst enemy to any cause than people with good intentions that just actually doesn't understand a single damn thing.

A "simple" little example taken from the website of the last link.

&gt; There is an ancient war between the Soul of Humanity (nobility, honesty, integrity, open mindedness, courage, curiosity, progress, independent thought) and the Soul Of Animals (conformity, dominance hierarchy, and tribalism).

Just only one single little paragraph is enough for a rant that could go on and on and on for quite a long time about all the things that are incredibly wrong with what is wrote in there.

Same applies to practically 99% of everything.
