I should state that I'm not broadly attacking EVERY attack against the Book of Mormon (indeed, In these comments I have given the other side some really, really good ammunition.)

I am specifically attacking THIS PARTICULAR argument, which I find silly and ignorant. That is, SPECIFICALLY, that the View of the Hebrews and the Late War are similar to the Book of Mormon, so much so that it calls into question the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

There are many OTHER reasons to doubt the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, but these particular ones are NOT good ones.

To call this a strawman -- when it is the entire point -- is silly. I set out to debate *a particular point someone made*, and we're debating that particular point, and leaving everything else alone. What would be a strawman is to argue about my views of science while we are arguing about these points, or to somehow cast aspersions on my academic achievements because I happen to disagree with you on the nature of science.

Search my comments. At NO time did I ever state that this proves the Book of Mormon to be true, or this casts a shadow on all the other arguments against it. I have remained focus on THIS PARTICULAR POINT.

If you're going to use VotH and TLW as an argument that the BoM is not true, then you need to do the following:

1. Show how these books are similar to the Book of Mormon.
2. Show how these similarities call into question the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

Otherwise, mentioning these books and whatever similarities you have found is simply a Chewbacca defense.
