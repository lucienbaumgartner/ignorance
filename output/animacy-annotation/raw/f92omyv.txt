&gt; Just admit it, you didn’t read Ayn Rand. And I have yet to come across a single liberal who has. 

Ok no joking or snark; don’t say stuff like this in real life. If you are having a conversation with the type of person who enjoys talking about philosophy and political theories and you say this, they will assume you are stupid and/or a jerk.

I don’t doubt that there’s lots of people you meet who have not read her. There’s lots of reasons for that. First, if not for things like the Koch Brothers network and Alan Greenspan being part of her entourage for a while, she would be considered a relatively minor thinker. Second, both in her fiction and nonfiction, she is an almost unbelievably terrible writer and so most of what she writes is very inaccessible. A normal person does not want to waste their time reading through her terrible dialogue and endless monologues. Third, Most people don’t as part of their personal lives or their majors in college study philosophy or political theory. If they are going to cover this material they’re going to cover the major thinkers. You’re going to read Adam Smith, Marx, Hume, Kant, Rousseau and more.

Given the amount of subject matter to cover, who has time to include someone whose great insight is that reality exists outside of consciousness and that man’s highest purpose is the pursuit of their own personal happiness.

&gt; Nobody can demonstrate an understanding of her here. And it’s not hard lol. One Objectivist to another, one or two sentences. That’s all it takes. Convince me you understand Objectivism. If it’s so childish and ignorant, that means you understood it. So show me that.

It’s probably more that nobody feels like giving you a book report about a minor thinker who is generally a source of embarrassment for anybody over 25 years old. She is only important because though she is someone we should totally ignore, we don’t because her philosophy helps justify the worst aspects of our warped version of capitalism.
