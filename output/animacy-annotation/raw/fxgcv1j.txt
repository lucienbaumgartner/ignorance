Right but let's pretend there's a few hundred of these predators/rapists out there.  That's a LOT and I'm not arguing it isn't.

But compared to the hundreds of thousands of people that work in the industry, that's not widespread.  That's a concentrated minority.

There is a very real problem of Hollywood not speaking up about it, but that's just a matter of cynicism vs optimism, I suppose.  I think the vast majority of people (editors, wardrobe designers, set designers, writers, producers, directors, stunt people, set hands, special effects departments, etc) are unaware and uninvolved with this kind of thing, and if they were they'd speak up.

I think the problem here is one of semantics.  I don't think we disagree with each other but when I talk about Hollywood, I mean the entire film making industry in America.  I think you mean it as a select group of celebrities, in which case, I can see where you're coming from.
