Insignificant if the church was the past. However it remains present. 

I agree with your thoughts and would add that **we** here are aware of that insignificance at the world scale but our families, friends, colleagues and collective culture is suffering at the stupendous amount of manipulative control and power of this "the lords corporation". It is not innocuous. It is not endearingly old fashioned. It is being wielded as a weapon against marginalized groups. Against millions who are unable and unaware of how to recover from generations of indoctrination. Who in my estimation were never given a fair dealing of the facts from the start. Which is exactly the reason that the church sends missionaries. Fear that lost souls might not be aware of the "truth" of the gospel. They are aware the playing field is uneven and are doing everything in the power of the church to keep it that way. This documentary does more for the church than against it. Enough vitriol is contained in the documentary to make any believer double down. It was not meant to be a documentary to "clear the misconceptions" it was to look pretty and obfuscate the facts in order to distract from the foundational claims. 

In simpler terms the narrative of any of the truth issues will now "whenever possible" be referenced to this new narrative rather than where they ought to be which is further down the rabbit hole at it's core. More emphasis on the foundation. New material only blocks the deeper truth. 

The church has documents un revealed still to this day. If they have nothing to hide let them prove it. Let God guide them out of their own transparency.
