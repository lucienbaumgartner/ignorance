This isn't about Europe. This the Americans (as a continent) vs the rest of the world. Acting surprised that the rest of the world has different attitudes about immigration is useless, and ignorant of most basic history. What is exactly your suggestion? 

&gt; Don't they know that Europe is a post-racist wonderland full of tolerance for everyone except the stupid, thieving, subhuman Gypsies, Muslims, and Americans!

Literally no one believes or says this. But sure, continue with the circejerk, I'm sure it make you feel grand. Fighting starman sure is easy. The fact that you're saying this to me, a half-roma from the edge of the Balkans, makes this really funny too.
