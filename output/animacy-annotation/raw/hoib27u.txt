I know it’s been often praised but basically I got into retinol thinking that I’d done proper research but foolishly didn’t realise how potent and active the ingredient is (basically just unaware and uninformed). I have a habit of being impatient - worst decision ever. So I upped the quantity of retinol used AND at one point used in every night. On top of that, I was also using a new face wash - just a recipe for disaster. I don’t have a photo but my skin (which I didn’t realised then but after everything I’ve realised it now) was actually SO CLEAR. I didn’t NEED to use new products whatsoever (no acne, just occasional pimples). Sorry if it sounds annoying but I grieve the lost of my great skin now because I ate a lot of cucumbers and drank so much water to get to where it was. Now a few impulsive decisions later I’ve ruined it. How can I heal my skin from overusing retinol (Ordinary 0.5 in squalene and make it clear? It’s so clogged and there are just pimple heads and red scars everywhere :((
