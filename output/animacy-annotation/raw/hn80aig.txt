You have to be really dumb and unaware of strategy to pull off something like this attack, absurd to blame it on rushing.

And if you rush, you’ll spend longer practicing viable strategies. Staying at TH9 or 10 a long time practicing attacks will not prepare you very well for attacking at TH13 or 14. Yeah you can figure out fundamentals like how to deal with inferno towers, how to Queen charge, how to funnel, etc. but you can practice those things alongside using warden, Royal champ, siege machines, etc. if you rush

Some players are dumb and/or don’t research how to attack, rushing or maxing isn’t going to change that.
