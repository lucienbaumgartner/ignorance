I was gonna pick Zen because his narcissism is crazy but he’s also really caring about MC, Jaehee, and Yoosung. &gt;! In V’s route I think, Zen tries really hard to cheer Yoosung up and made sure he wasn’t lonely but he’s never appreciated Zen for that (from what I remember) !&lt; so it makes Yoosung seem really inconsiderate and unaware of other’s feelings. 

I don’t think his route is bad but just the more bland out of all the other’s routes (but I will never vote my girl Jaehee for worst character so she doesn’t count for that) I actually really like Yoosung and can relate immensely to him but I just think it’s his immature quality where he falls a little short
