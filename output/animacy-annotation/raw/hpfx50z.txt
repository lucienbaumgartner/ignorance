My problem is that when I hear this negative harmony, it just sounds bland. It does not sound at all inventive. And I take issue that after a conversion to negative harmony, the process requires "tweaking." It is being tweaked back into a conventional form that "sounds right." Why not just leave it *au natural* and accept a truly different sound that sounds really horrible? You could then just claim that the ignorant and uneducated are "behind the times." You could call it Avant Garde.
