&gt; As someone living in Sweden where unions do have quite some power, I must say how disheartening it is to read so many people scared for others unionizing in America.

Americans are like dogs in their total subservience to the state.   Americans are stupid - they like to think of themselves as free thinkers; the freest people on the planet.   But the reality is sad - they are 100% subservient to the state and even most people who consider themselves "left" are so hopelessly propagandized and ignorant that they couldn't even begin to comprehend how good we could have it.  The capitalists won the nation long ago and have done a very good job ensuring that this power remains with them.

The richest nation in the world shouldn't be a patchwork of decaying McDonalds and pothole-filled roads; it should be fucking *nice*.
