I often think about this. My entire teenage life went by depressed and unaware and I struggle even now. I turn 24 coming October. But I've learnt a lot and as I get better, I try new things and I feel like a young guy experiencing the same things I would have earlier. Also, I can empathize with so many people and I know what helps. It's like I now have the knowledge to spread happiness coz I kinda know what goes on in their heads, not assuming everyone goes through the same feelings but still. Also, I feel like everyone has their ups and downs in life. Mine just happened to face the downs earlier and I've grown stronger, so I feel like later in life, when I'm faced with tougher things in a bigger picture, I know I'll know to handle things better while some people maybe going through the same things for the first time and the consequences of not making it out might be bigger. Also, trust me it gets better. You just gotta keep going and most importantly, learn to love yourself. Know that you can make a change and you wanna live a story that you're proud of. Love
