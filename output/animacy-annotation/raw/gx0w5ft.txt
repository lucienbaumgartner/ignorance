I'm not looking to say there isn't a problem, I've said that repeatedly, but I do want to avoid an echo chamber that loses grasp on how others are doing because they lose the ability to adequately discuss the issue. 

REITs as a tradeable asset are not the problem or enemy in my opinion. They need to amend the legislation around them, but all the chatter on this sub this week is about the "corruption" of politics not caring about the common man and woman. 

To me, that's wrong and ignorant of reality. The permission if REITs was an objective recommendation to promote construction stabilise the property owning base to prevent/soften future crashes. None of that nuance is being acknowledged and so when I (and presumably our supreme overlords) see the manner in which folks are objecting to the two recent purchases, they dismiss it as ill informed. 

That's not fair on those who are suffering trying to buy right now, they have a right to complain, but if it's done ignorantly, it lands on deaf ears.

I've raised the issue of REITs with my local TD. I've spoken to or written to 5 TDs in the last 3 years on a range of issues and have had positive engagements in each case. I'm not saying there isn't a problem. I'm not saying we don't need massive changes. I am saying that the arguments and attacks I'm seeing are not going to help the cause or be of benefit to those struggling other than cathartically giving them someone to be angry at (rightly, or wrongly) but fixing nothing. 

We've got a supply side issue in this country that will take 4 or 5 years to resolve at a minimum and it's not gonna be solved with a meme of a housing minister in bed with fat cats or whatever.
