Far from it. As I see it we lack the insight and wisdom to look behind realities first curtain. 
Instead we are social animals just like all our fellow beings on earth. Its the natural course of birth and death. No cuteness could even stop that cycle. Our fate is determined from the beginning.

Yet, will not comprehend this and deliver the message to our offspring. Nope! The story will be that we overstepped a magical barrier and thus were punished by some supernatural power
For overstepping some rule. In a simile way that will be true. The understanding of people will not deliver the hidden meaning behind this and be unaware and ignorant about the demise of our world but look ate our ruins and wonder about the golden age we once were in.

The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the all that is not directly to see and ready to be imitated. Complex systems are completely out of our understanding. So we cannot learn from our experience.
