No, because the sum of human advancement has determined that. 

We've done a lot in the time we've been making things, and figuring out cinema is one of them. There's more to learn and experiment with, but more or less, we've got the basics down.

If you don't agree with that, respectfully, you're extremely ignorant and naive. 

What the hell do you think they teach at film school?
