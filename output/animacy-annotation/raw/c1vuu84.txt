Oh gosh. You would think that Rhode Island would be liberal, but no. 
Yes, unfortunately there was quite an experience I had in my technology class during 7th grade. I was very young and unaware that there were even people in the world who didn't believe in evolution. It was my first encounter with creationism.
My teacher was exposing us to something known as "OOPARTS." They were basically these (fake) out of place artifacts that proved God's existence by disproving the age of the Earth. I remember at one point he said "it makes you wonder how old the Earth REALLY is, doesn't it?" I was so curious, so excited, and so... naive. I came home that day giddy with anticipation to show my dad this awesome new thing I had discovered. He took one look and I saw disgust and horror wash over his face. He patiently explained to me what was going on.
I felt so violated and betrayed by one of my otherwise favorite teachers. My dad had quite a talk with him after that.
