Appreciate your post.

I think one of the problems is harvesting or not has always been looked at as “I” thing. If we could get to a point of agreement, looking at it as a “WE” thing would be far more beneficial for the resource. I guess that’s where the regs come in although I know in my state, there is very little decent science behind it and the practices from the state level are even worse. 

I think folks are harsh on harvesting because that’s where we all start, it’s square one, and that deep down is what everyone wants. Everyone wants a tasty meal. And that’s the problem, everyone WANTS for themselves. I guess it’s just a lowest common denominator thing? Not that C&amp;R is some holy mount in the sky but it does align better with selflessness, consciousness, and awareness. The thing is, hanging hats on “what the regs say” is such a weird hill to take a stand on for me. On one hand folks love talking about killing as much as they can and then talk about “conservation” out the other side of their mouth. Just be one way or the other(for me). 

Not that I really said this earlier but I guess the point is like to make is from your statement is 

It’s never just “a person who wants to keep their limit.” It’s tens of thousands of persons who “just want to keep their limits.” Day after day after day. 

That takes a toll. It just does. I mean I get it. Fish is tasty. But every fish taken is a fish that is never caught again. I think if the worldwide standard was C&amp;R and everyone then “occasionally” kept a limit it would be different. If I was motivated I’d take some screen shots from my local trout fishing FB pages. Guys are pissing and whining that the creeks near them haven’t been stocked yet and there’s NO FISH TO CATCH. It’s just so….I dunno…. Entitled unaware and selfish.
