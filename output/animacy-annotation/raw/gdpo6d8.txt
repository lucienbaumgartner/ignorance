There's no mixing, that would contradict itself. Think about your 4 positive functions:

Do you tinker just for fun? Do you like to focus on one thing only for long periods of time, digging in?

Are you a walking alarm system to others, predicting accidents way before anyone else? Does it feel like work? Like it's your responsibility to warn others?

Are you relaxed and unaware of your surroundings, do you see the same 'good old' youtube clips repeatedly?

Do you feel conflicted when helping other s, knowing you're being illogical but you still fear disappointing them? Do you get attacked rarely by an unknown feeling that's kinda invisible but still collapses your thought processes from an unknown angle?

Then you should be an INTP.
