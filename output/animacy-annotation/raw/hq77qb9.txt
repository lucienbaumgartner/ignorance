I live in a mid sized city in the south east, it’s not super bike-able but plenty of people make it work. I swear to god one of my clients said to me  when we were discussing how peoples 4 walls (food, housing, transportation, and utilities) are collapsing and how I believe it’s entirely ignorant and arrogant for me and her to speak for someone who lives in a more rural area, she says “that’s such an American thing to believe that you need a car to get around”.

I have never been so shocked at the absolute ignorance. I asked her if she has ever been anywhere besides our city? Like if you’re so intelligent and worldly please enlighten us on what you think people in between the coasts should be doing? I’m so glad to know that she knows exactly what’s best for millions of people and has solved the transportation death spiral. 

Privilege. Just plain spoiled privilege.
