Honestly? Just people trying to be fake woke and misusing terms like feminism, xenophobia, racism, cultural appropriation, sexualization, and the list goes on. I see this a lot nowadays with younger fans trying to become aware about social issues, but with kpop, it’s become a ruse or tactic to just cancel idols that they don’t like, or to infantilize the ones that they do.

Everything is just blown so out of proportion. People love to pick and choose which social issues to support, and it’s truly disgusting. They’ll hear a word (like listed above), and use it in the incorrect context, which completely devalues it. These kinds of terms have basically become word of mouth, and people don’t take the time to actually understand the root of some issues that pop up within kpop. Stans run around with a basic surface level understanding and then weaponize these issues to support their favs.

Quite frankly, it’s disgusting, and I’m tired of it. I wish people would pick up a freaking book or at least educate themselves before jumping onto these bandwagons. Or, if they choose to remain ignorant and uneducated, they should step away from the discussion and instead just *listen* to others.
