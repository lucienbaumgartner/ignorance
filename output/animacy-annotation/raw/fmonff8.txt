Control.  They already have money.  Taking money from you and everyone else gives them more control than if we had anything at all.  No defending ourselves and no way to support ourselves means we rely on them fully to survive. That is the ultimate way of control, take everything from someone and be the sole reason they survive and when they need anything, they will be completely dependent and unaware that all of their rights are gone.
