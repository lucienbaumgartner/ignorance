I do that a lot, think that I've tricked everybody, including myself. I try to cling on to the memories of the worst episodes, things I've experienced or done that I can't deny were based on delusion. So I know that I am at least prone to this. It is possible that I can be delusional, and I imagine you know that about yourself too.

But are you delusional right now? How would you know? Have you been delusional and unaware of it in the past? I have been, so I trust in the people I know want to help me, because they can see me better than I can see myself sometimes. I think you should do that too.
