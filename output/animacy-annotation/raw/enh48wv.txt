Did you read the last sentence before you laughed at it.

I said if you have anything that resembles real research that gives any indication that interdimensional beings exist I would like to read them...

You're right, if you can't present me something that has a method of study and way to test whether such things exist it is pointless to argue with me. Because I try not to believe in things unverifiable and based on faith.

My candor attitude in dismissing what you're saying isn't because I am completely unaware and oblivious of this type of thing(admittedly, I'm more knowledgable about the interdimensional beings/machine elves/psychedelic hyperspace which seems to be a bit different flavor of supernatural than you're talking about) it's because I'm well aware **nothing** in this area or the similar have any real evidence of existence.

Again if you have anything that resembles actual research that makes and tests a hypothesis and shows an inkling evidence for supernatural beings I'd love to see it. But again, I know no such thing exists. If you can provide such a thing I will gladly eat humble pie, apologize for being standoffish, and stfu.
