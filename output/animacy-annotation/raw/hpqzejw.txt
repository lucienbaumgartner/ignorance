&gt; Releasing a teaser for a game years before they even started working on it

to calm people down and say they are still making singleplayer games, because people freaked out when they heard 76 was online.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Literally ALL of the promotional items they sold for '76 being advertised as one thing, and then being absolutely the cheapest crap imaginable when you got it. 

this wasn't handled by the devs at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The constant re-release of the same game

skyrim only has 1 actual rerelease, special edition. anniversary edition is more a dlc, you can literally upgrade to it with special edition. legendary edition is just goty. ports don't count, i don't know why people count those.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;all while constantly complaining they "don't want to be just the elder scrolls and fallout studio."

they never complained about this and them creating a new ip is...them not being just the elder scrolls/fallout.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But they've pretty much been banking on one game for a decade and then throw a tantrum when people ask for either something more or something else.

yet since skyrim's release bethesda game studios has made

1. the elder scrolls blades
2. fallout 4
3. fallout shelter
4. fallout 76

and they're working on starfield.

saying they made skyrim and no other game is ignorant and disingenuous.
