If she won't go to counseling, maybe you go without her.  Make it clear to her that this is a serious enough issue for you that you will go without her and work through it with a counselor.  That counselor will help you take care of you and whatever the outcome is from that (you stay, you go), she has to live with the fact that you wanted to do this with her and she chose not to participate.  Going to a counselor on your own shows her you are serious about this and it should be a red flag to her.   


I'm sorry she thinks it is a joke.  That is very selfish and ignorant of her.  My husband at least knows it is serious, but he still won't do much about it.    : (
