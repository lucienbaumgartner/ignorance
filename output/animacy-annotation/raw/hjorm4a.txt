When I had quit an old job, I forgot all about my PTO saved up.

I was there for 6 years and only requested about a week off every year. Unpaid.

I quit without notice and when I got my final check I was floored to find it was over $8k.

I didn't get ALL my time paid out because I quit without notice, but it still gave me some relief because it definitely held me over for a while.

This was when the company I worked for was good. PTO was accrued FAST. We even had the option to cash out PTO at our leisure. Wish I had remembered that or I would have cashed it all out first, THEN quit.

I wish that company was still as great as it used to be. I ended up going back a few years later and my former boss rehired me on the spot. She also tried to warn me that "things have changed" 

Not long after that, I noticed the changes... And they were not good. Most of the people were new and unaware of the golden days of gumdrops and lollipops so it still seemed pretty decent to them.

Boss ended up quitting soon after I was rehired. I stayed on for a couple more years but things kept getting worse so I quit again. This time with notice.

A few months after I left, they merged with a conglomerate that may or may not be named after a river in South America.

That was the final nail in the coffin of what used to be the best job I ever had. I wouldn't go back unless I had no other options.
