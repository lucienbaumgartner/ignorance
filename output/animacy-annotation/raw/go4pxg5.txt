Texan here. Thatâ€™s really insensitive and ignorant of you to generalize all the people of the 2nd largest state in the country. You are a part of the problem and why this country is divided. 

All the major cities in Texas are Democratic. Houston, San Antonio and Dallas are all in the top 10 biggest cities in the US. These are the cities suffering from this storm. These cities carry the Texas economy and Texas is a major contributor to the US GDP. Sufficient to say the people you are generalizing contribute economically more than most in this country, 2nd only to California. 

Do not lump us all in with the corrupt republicans we are trapped under.
