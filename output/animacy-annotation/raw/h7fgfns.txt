Canadian player got to the ball first but was carelessly kicked and brought down by the American defender. It’s a clear foul and I feel like the penalty decision was justified. I don’t agree how some people are saying she just threw herself at the ball and went down softly. In my opinion she clearly would have gotten to the ball first and controlled it. The american defender was too casual and unaware of her surroundings
