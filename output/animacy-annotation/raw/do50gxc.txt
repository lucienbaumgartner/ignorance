Are you actually so fucking socially awkward and unaware that you cannot see the sarcasm, even when he is laying it on *SO THICK*?

Just like the guy you're replying to... Both of you need to go out more, meet actual people that aren't like yourself, sitting there nodding your head and agreeing about everything.

Just because someone isn't like you or share all your values or opinions doesn't mean they are bad people.

Likely the man in the OP is even old enough to be the father of both of you. Fucking stupid kids.
