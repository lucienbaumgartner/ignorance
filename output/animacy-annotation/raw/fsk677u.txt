Exactly. I told him once how uncomfortable I feel when they are talking and I am unable to communicate and he makes no effort to include me. That same night, he told his mother what I had said, and the next time I saw her she was quick to say that I shouldn't be uncomfortable, and I should practice my Spanish so that I would be included. I was so shocked and unaware that he had even told her that. He does not put boundaries in place.
