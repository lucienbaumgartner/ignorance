that's incorrect and ignorant of you.  I have basically spoon fed you the names and reasons, albeit in great summary, of the greatest barriers between what are current conditions and would be merely a step in the right direction.  The situation is not too hard, you are finding it too hard to understand.  Snowflake is a dumb term to signify.. what... uniqueness coupled with fragility? There is nothing fragile about the conditions that set the USA apart from all other nations with respect to gun ownership. Fragile is furthest away.  Uniqueness, yes; this is unique for this one nation, and here comes the stressed wording **the reasons behind it being unique are what is important to understand**

You know what would be really nice?

If you and others like you understood these bare basic minimal reasons.  Then you and others could focus your energy towards realistic change.  Because any pathway to alter gun ownership and usage in the USA must absolutely follow the underpinnings of their foundation of government, *unique to them*. To push in any other direction is useless and futile. When you, and others like you, push in this useless direction, the opposition you face is immovable. You, and others like you, see this as a reason to push harder.
