Pricing is also an incredibly cruel way of handling demand when it comes to healthcare. Everyone gets sick and everyone should have access to doctors, treatment and medication when needed. Every other western country that I'm aware of shows that it's possible. The US is the only exception.

&gt; Americans tend to prefer this setup

They don't. Some might, but it's not their fault, it's most likely because the ones who actually think that way are uneducated and unaware that better alternatives exist. I currently live in the US and everyone I talked to about this envies how health care works in Europe. The family of one person I met here is currently trying to raise a five figure amount to pay for health care for her sister who was in a bad car accident. This is unheard of in the rest of the western world. This is not a matter of opinion - the American health care system is worse than it's other western counterparts by pretty much every metric.
