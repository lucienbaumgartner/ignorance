My dad would have done something like this. He was so totally unaware and clueless about style. He once tried going to the mall with us in his knee-high striped party socks pulled exactly all the way up, paired with cutoff 70s-style jean shorts (Daisy Dukes for my fellow old heads), and a fishnet tank top he had since he was a teenager. My mom shut that shit down quickly lol. Thank God she did. He looked absolutely ridiculous. You could not convince him of why, though. He truly thought he looked good to go out like that. Some people just do not know how to dress well. Or care to. I myself give a whole lot of a shit due to being embarrassed from it so much as a kid with my dad. God love him. I myself now have been given compliments by my 14 year old sons girlfriend and friend about dressing cool lol. I'm 40 in February. I'd have NEVER complimented my friends' parents on their style as a kid lol. Never. Must be doing something right.
