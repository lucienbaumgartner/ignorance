Such an ignorant and false statement.

Community pressure does work. Not every time but it does let CIG know that not everyone is a white knight, sycophantic whale trying to suck up to them every chance you get.

CIG have listened to feedback in the past and at the very least it sends the signal to them we're not mindless whales just existing for them to milk us with predatory "sales".
