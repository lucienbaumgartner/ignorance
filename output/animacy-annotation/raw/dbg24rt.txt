Lol.  Who lost the election is not really the point I'm making here, but I'm not surprised that one of the unaware and compliant ones described in the podesta emails would miss it completely, that's the point of conspiring to make an ignorant uninformed citizenry so they will be easily fooled and controlled.

It's about the fact that this sub is filled with pieces that were discredited by the leaked emails as a massive propaganda machine for the Democrats. Virtually none of the articles can be believed, vox, salon, huffpo being among the fake news sites colluding with Democrats to mislead the public for power and gain.

I can't understand how some know the bubble exists and then try to climb back inside and pretend it doesn't exist. Good luck with that.
