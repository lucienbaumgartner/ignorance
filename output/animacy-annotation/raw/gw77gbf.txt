Sorry to offend you, I had no meaning of it.
I wasn't saying the trucks were a bad idea, I was saying you could integrate that into patrol units as a outreach method.
However, I agree the "Broken Windows" method of policing is an ineffective and outmoded method of policing. It truly does more harm than good. 

The point of the second was to address the inefficiency of the system, and that it probably wouldn't be feasible, or widely adopted.

The assumption that I am racist and ignorant of the problems our communities face is absurd and honestly offensive. What is racist about offering rehab clinics and food outreach? And about the alcohol thing, the US Native Heath Service has found that, quote: "Dependence on alcohol, tobacco, and drugs is one of the most serious threats to native americans". https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603686/#:~:text=Large%20scale%20U.S.%20epidemiological%20studies,-related%20disorders%20%5B3%5D.
Basically, instead of defending police, we use them as a vector for change. Additionally, I'm not racist, and please check you facts before calling someone that.
