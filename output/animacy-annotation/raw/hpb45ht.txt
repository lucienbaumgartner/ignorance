It's nearly impossible to help someone wake up. It's a choice they have to make, they have to want to dig deeper. Some people like being ignorant and clueless. The idea that there's a group of elites out there running everything is just too much for some people's brain to handle. Also a lot of people in my experience have a hard time admitting that they were wrong, have to stick to the narrative that they were told otherwise they'll be able to conspiracy theorists too. In my experience with my older sister she is almost 40 years old grew up with a father that never vaccinated her, they were Jehovah's witness. Never thought I'd have to tell her about the dangers of this vaccine because she's never had a vaccine before. This is where it gets weird for me, we weren't talking when she got her first vaccine but after that she's so pro vaccine now it's kind of weird. She spews these talking points almost robotically. I've given her many examples of how this whole thing is a planned effort for depopulation, she's a smart woman but still sticks to her guns of the narrative of what the news and media says. She doesn't watch the news, loves bragging about that. But she's on all the popular social media sites and I'm sure that's where she gets her "news" from. It's sad I've given up on trying to convince anyone about the real plan of what's going on. They have to admit they were wrong, and most people will never do that. So as of today I'm the conspiracy theorist, I told my sister I hope I'm wrong about what's going on currently in the world. But only time will tell.... Stay strong everyone.
