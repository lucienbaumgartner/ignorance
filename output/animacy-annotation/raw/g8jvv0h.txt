IDK if you've finished RD, but Soren is &gt;!literally the legitimate heir to the Daein Throne (he is the true prince to Pelleas' false prince, and the kerfuffle over the Prince of Daein is why RD starts at all), and he's the grandchild of debatably the most powerful character still living at the start of RD (Dheginsea).!&lt; He actually is probably lore wise, not gameplay wise, one of the most powerful people living in Tellius himself, he just happens to still be quite young and unaware of his specific lineage. (Micaiah herself basically says Soren is just as strong as her and that's saying a lot.) In PoR, he is also the reason the plot got started, and has quite a few ongoing plotlines himself. The thing is that with PoR's weird structure, it doesn't feel like that if you don't get Ike and Soren's supports because they're what eventually explains his numerous strange and focused on moments in PoR's story proper (His hatred of the laguz, what Nasir was blackmailing him with, why he's so upset and high strung once you get to Begnion, among other moments which the game draws consistent attention to) so it can feel really weird and out of place, and it's easy to forget about them because PoR decided to be fucking weird with it's supports. But no other side character really has anything like that going for them in Tellius that I can think of.

I'd argue no other side character in Tellius has as much importance to the plot and an excuse to be very powerful as Soren. I'd argue he's even more relevant to the overall plots of RD and PoR as Ryoma is to Fates, to be honest.
