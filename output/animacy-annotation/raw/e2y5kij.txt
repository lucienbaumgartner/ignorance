‘little people’ is correct. midget is offensive and little people do not want to be called that at all. I’m not trying to argue, just trying to educate those who genuinely care to not be ignorant assholes. 

some LP will understand that people are just ignorant and unaware that midget is offensive, and they’ll be a little forgiving. but it’s obvious when someone knows that it’s wrong and continues to say it. like the person who responded to me. and then the OP’s post is worded in a pretty offensive way when using the word ‘midget’ so most LP would be offended by this post. 

just trying to to spread knowledge
