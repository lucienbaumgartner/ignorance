You stated:

&gt;Not really especially when those disagreements are based in ignorance

And you argue that that comparing gender dysphoria to other mental illnessess is silly? 

So what are they ignorant about? And what is so silly?

It would have to be about the conception of gender and gender identity. Because that is where we have had all of the arguments about. How people view gender.

And ignorance implies an intentional willingness to avoid new information and facts â€” but when I asked you to produce any evidence of gender the best source you gave was nearly old enough to vote and locked behind a paywall.

That is not an open source and definitely not widely available. To call those people ignorant when the best info isnt even available sounds asinine.

You would have to assume that these people dont need to see hard evidence and just need to understand and accept that internal gender identity is a real thing and that is seperate from sex.

You never said that directly, but by calling these people ignorant and silly for not immediately believing in a brand new science that does not have any physical evidence or biological evidence to support said science is really unfair.

And as for the second part, many people have beliefs that people born with penises are men and people born with vaginas are women, to accept transgender identities is to upheave many peoples societal views.

To expect people to upheave their own societal views without any firm evidence is seriously suspect, and to call them silly or ignorant if they dont is outrageous.
