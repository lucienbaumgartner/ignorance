i am sick to the back teeth of the anti-vegan hatred on this sub. 

EVERYONE brings up their children in their own lifestyle/belief system. It’s hateful to single out vegan parents for what literally every parent on the planet does. 

Meat-eater parents DO NOT give their children a choice to *not* be meat eaters. They don’t give them the information to make informed consent (in fact, they universally lie to their children). They don sit them down as preschoolers and say “we eat meat in this family, but it’s ok if you don’t want to”, like vegan parents are unfairly expected to do. Meat eaters are often extremely hostile when their children try to go vegetarian or vegan. Whereas vegan parents spend their time telling their children it’s their choice and to respect other people. 

ALL parents choose the lifestyle of their children until they are old enough to develop their own choices. This isn’t “forcing”. This is natural and an innate part of parenting. It’s disgusting and ignorant that you act like vegan families existing is a problem when they are doing the same thing that every other family in the world does. 

The same with cats actually. *Every single cat owner* makes the decision on their cat’s behalf on what they eat. Wait till you learn that most cheap cat food has a high proportion of plant matter. And that hardly any vegans feed their cats vegan food. Oh wait, you already know that, it’s just an excuse to justify your hatred of vegans.
