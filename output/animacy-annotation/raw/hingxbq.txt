So accepting a job that no one else is going or staying for is what will is an individual “stepping up” for society?   What a rotten business owner, so unaware and selfish.  Who wants to come in and apply?  It would be only someone is desperate, no wonder one worker was only there for 2 weeks.  There must be a toxic culture festering in this workplace.  That’s the conclusion that I’m jumping too.  

This is what the business owner gets for airing dirty laundry in her own Facebook, everyone seeing the skid marks!
