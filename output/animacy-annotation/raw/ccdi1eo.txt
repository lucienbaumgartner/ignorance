Approximately 80% of the population has it by age 50 (HSV-1, or traditionally oral herpes). But it's estimated that 1 in 5 people have HSV-2, aka genital herpes. The problem is that upwards of 85% of the people with HSV-2 are asymptomatic and unaware that they contracted the virus. Standard STD screenings don't test for HSV! Thus, they spread it unknowingly.
