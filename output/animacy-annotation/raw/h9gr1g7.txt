NTA. It's still your money and that was a shitty thing to do. 

However, I would have handled it differently. Kids are dumb and unaware of just how shitty the things they do can be. I've done some garbage things as a kid/teenanger and I'm very happy they didn't ruin a major aspect of my future. You're totally not an asshole for doing it, but I wouldn't.
