Your comment is assumption and ignorant. You seek change and respect while providing none yourself. Really convincing argument.

Let me ask you thus, would you want to open up and be vulnerable, figuratively,  if someone attacked ever good dead you did? 

These are people too. We are against the current police culture, not the people. 

Stop being so emotional and ignorant. That doesn't help rational change to come about.

Edit: removed the word "fool". Its is not productive and does nothing to promote my point.
