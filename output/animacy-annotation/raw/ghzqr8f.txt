Ah yes, the “yOuR bLoOdLiNe” argument. Really..... are your genes that special? 

I guarantee you that every “bloodline” has issues and ancestral trauma that, whether you buy all, part, or none of that, will impact you and others in your “bLoOdLinE” in the here and now. 

That being said, if you want to be a parent, have healed and fixed your own shit (which I doubt) then go for it. 

I know that every stage and chapter of adulthood has presented new problems, challenges and issues and it’s taken a fair amount of grit, money and grace to survive and heal through them all. 

Indeed, the aforementioned is what life is all about, but I can’t imagine being so arrogant and unaware that I’d try to raise another human (or several) without unintentionally f-ing them up too. I’ve seen so many people that have kids hoping to mask the pain of their own trauma and emotional dysfunction, and in turn end up with some of the most troubled, disturbed children.... that grow up to be troubled, disturbed adults.

It would be awfully presumptuous and selfish of ME to think I could do this and not traumatize an innocent soul in the process. 

If the “bloodline” ends with me, I’m okay with that. While on this earth I know I have done my best at being a productive member of society, tried diligently to harm no one, and in the process have made sacrifices to help others. Isn’t that why we are all here? I can’t think of many other reasons why.

Good luck to you and your “bLoOdLiNe.”
