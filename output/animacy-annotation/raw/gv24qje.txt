I hear ya. I've been trying to add to my circle of friends lately, and reddit tends not to be the best place for that. reddit encourages participation in the default/larger subreddits, and the culture there gets toxic, even above and beyond what one can already find in gaming communities. It's quite challenging to connect when your typical reddit user is conditioned to be on edge and defensive from that experience. 

Niche gaming communities can be insular and ignorant of outside perspectives--this subreddit is certainly no different in that regard--but this is one of those rare cases in which I think we'd be better off if we were more detached from all that.

However, I don't want to suggest I've never made meaningful connections through reddit; there's been a few over the years.
