I consider myself pretty liberal. I’m pro-BLM and have been to a few protests recently.

That being said, the amount of black people on Twitter defending Nick Cannon’s remarks by saying, “he can’t be anti-Semitic because we are the true Semites” is so preposterously obtuse and ignorant that I’m beginning to lose faith in humanity.
