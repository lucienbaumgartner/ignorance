I have to disagree on the KKKameron comparison. Sutton, a white southern woman is oblivious and unaware of what POC go through. As was Kyle for example in regards the stereotype Garcelle explained to her. I don’t believe they have malicious or vile intent, they are rich white women. This lack of knowledge and awareness leads Sutton to equate all stereotypes - those against southerners, people of color etc. In her mind a stereotype is a stereotype no matter who it’s against. KKKameron was a whole other ball game, it’s just not comparable. Sutton apologized and acknowledged her wrong doing and while many will say it’s damage control, she is doomed if she does and doomed if she doesn’t. KKKameron had NUMEROUS racist outbursts and the Westcots threatened Tiffany’s job.
