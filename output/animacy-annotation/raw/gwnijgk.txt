I worked at a very busy McDonald's with many foreign tourist customers many years ago. Tons of rude people as you would imagine. But you learn to cope with that and not take it personally. That's just working with people, no matter which place.

However, there was once a group of Indian tourists who showed a complete lack of understanding for the culture, customs and appropriate behaviour of the country they were visiting. They were on a whole new level when it came to rudeness and ignorance, even for a McDonald's restaurant with many international customers. After they had ordered a massive amount of vegetarian food items, they decided not to use the chairs and tables like everybody else around them. Instead, they spread out all of their food on the floor and proceeded to eat on the floor in the middle of the restaurant, totally ignoring the complaints of staff as well as other customers who then obviously had a hard time passing by to do their job/find their tables etc.

Apart from how rude and ignorant that was, it was very unsanitary on their part. They made a total mess, so that we had to apologise to other customers and ask them to clear the place and find a different table, so that we could clean the place.

Why would anybody choose to eat on the floor of a busy fast-food restaurant when there are enough unoccupied and perfectly fine tables?
