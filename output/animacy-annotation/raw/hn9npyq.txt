Maybe people who are afraid and ignorant of firearms and want to take away responsible owners’ right to own them are the assholes? Maybe if they’re offended it’s a personal problem. 

And how is “know gun owners” a source? Most of the people I know are gun owners.. same with a lot of people. It’s very common in the US.
