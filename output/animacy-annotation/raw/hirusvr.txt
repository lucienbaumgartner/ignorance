Even if he did shit his pants, I guess society is unaware and unsympathetic of the reality how well one can control their bowels with old age? Like, how is that a reason to shame someone??? Imagine how loosley the queen shits. There’s a good chance she’s definitely in diaper briefs now. We all likely will revert back to diaper briefs and shit ourselves when we reach our geriatric chapters. It’s really hard to see such an elederly person in power. And yeah, he and his administration suck really bad, but anyone who shames an old person for bodily functions that we all do is kinda ignorant. You’re just a hater finding a reason to hate. There’s many other reasons to hate our current administration and corrupt system. Potentially popping your pants whole traveling is no big thing. It could happen to a 40 year old with food poisoning. It’s definitely likely
to happen to an 80 year old.
