You can do it. Don’t kill yourself over this job, and there’s probably something out there that’s a better fit, but if you can figure this out you’ll be so prepared to handle anything else if you want to.  

Personal connection is really important to me as well. Sometimes it’s so hard to find - I try to look for positive moments throughout my day or even “not quite so negative moments” because that’s the only way not to hate it. Dwelling on the bad parts of my day makes them stick out in my mind, but one terrible experience shouldn’t ruin my whole day, so I try to review the good when it happens.

Sounds like you’re working in long term care. The beauty of that is that you get to see progress over weeks and months, so even if you have a resident that screams at you, maybe they’ll scream less as you get to know them and realize what sets them off. 

Plus, try hard to see it from their perspective. In their minds, they may be totally capable and unaware of their actual deficits. Then you show up and try to help them get dressed (for example), which they think they can do on their own. Even a rational person would get angry at this. You need to start slow and get to know them a little bit first so they trust you. It takes longer, but it’s worth it since they don’t hate you so much and you find the connection you’re looking for.
