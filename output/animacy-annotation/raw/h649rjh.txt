This is not likely considering the endemic nature of the virus worldwide. The vast majority of our population is partially vaccinated at least, and more than half will be fully protected by today. It's well documented that vaccinated patients would almost certainly be asymptomatic, and we know that a vaccinated carrier has a reduced, but nonzero chance of spreading the disease. What's likely happening today is that a very large proportion of our infections are asymptomatic and the carriers are completely unaffected and unaware of the virus. When the chain eventually reaches an unvaccinated person who goes to the doctor, the transmission may have gone through several generations of silent transmission. By the time the contact tracers try to link the case back, the carrier could have recovered naturally already, completely unaffected by the infection.

This is a good thing. It means that even if the virus is spreading within our population, almost every case won't even need a doctor visit, let alone a hospital or ICU bed. Through rapid vaccination, we have tamed the virus to a threat comparable to the seasonal flu among the majority who protected themselves. The only caveat is that our unvaccinated seniors are still at risk of this endemic disease. It's imperative they get vaccinated now or they will possibly die during our reopening process.
