I rarely see wokies talk about Christianity, the cancellation of Chris Pratt for him being a member of the Hillsong Church is the closest example of it that I've seen recently, the topic only came up when one of their MCU capeshit saints turned out to frequent an Evangelicope church that is homophobic, what a surprise, water is wet.

Hillsong are a bunch of prosperity gospel dumbfucks, but this doesn't justifies cancelling him because many members of these Evangelical churches are very naive and unaware of what occurs behind the scenes and often do not agree with all of their doctrines, almost all of my family members still attend these churches for longer than the average Twitter user has existed, and they're still very chill people.

Christianity has been so forgotten that they barely even talk about it except when things like atheism, Islam, same-sex marriagem and abortion comes up, and they'll only mention Southern Baptists and Catholics and their social and political positions, never actual theology that influence their worldviews, that's about it.
