Firstly, I'm not justifying his behaviour, it's ignorant and wrong. 

But, I could see where these guys would think that most gamer girls have OF and here's why. Girls aren't generally very vocal in games because of the hate we get. These guys, with there stunning personalities probably don't know any women by conventional means, and upon meeting one scares them away just as fast as he did you. That means the 95% of their experience with women are going to be the girls that are pushing their content because they have OF. So to him,most of the girls he's had any length of contact with that game have had an OF, cause those girls are the only ones willing to entertain them. 

I would bargain that most men believe it to some extent, because that is the world a lot of them have made and reinforced, either by attacking, harassing or simply by not doing anything about the harassment women face. Their own behaviour provides them with their false basis on which their faulty belief stands.
