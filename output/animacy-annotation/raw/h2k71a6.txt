&gt;Uneducated humans hunt animals to extinction. Recreational hunters in america aren't hunting anything to extinction

You really think there is zero overlap between uneducated humans and recreational hunters? I grew up in a rural area, I assure you many a recreational hunter is very uneducated and ignorant of most conservation efforts. Not all of course, but enough to make game wardens necessary.
