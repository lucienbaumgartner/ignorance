You’re emotional and ignorant of fact. Come to the Texas border if you feel so strongly. Obama, not Trump, set up the detention center you’re referring to. What do you expect? Just set folks free upon arrival?  Think about for once. If they were deterred from crossing the border illegally to begin with (WALL - hello!!) they would be forced to consider legally - as a family unit.  Instead, they’re sending a child across the border ALONE  in hopes of meeting up later. When the plan fails migrants are being apprehended and detained. The wall has protected children and kept families together while also helping keep all humans safer.
