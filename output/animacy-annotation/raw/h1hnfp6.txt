I am still wondering how a trillion dollar company is claiming that they were powerless and ignorant of everything about anything here. They sound like  Ivanka talking about Alan Weisselberg. It defies belief.

Who was going to go to jail here if Apple refused? I am thinking it would be "no one." The biggest fines in the world would a) be fought in court forever, and b) not affect Apple even a tiny bit in the unlikely event that any fines were paid
