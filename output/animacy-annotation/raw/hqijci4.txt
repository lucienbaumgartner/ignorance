As long as "Wokeism" runs counter to common sense and basic morals, that's gonna be a hard no from me dawg.

It almost looks like some kind of social engineering experiment to keep people as ignorant and biased as possible while giving them the sense of intellectual or moral high ground.

Okay, enough tinfoil hat.
