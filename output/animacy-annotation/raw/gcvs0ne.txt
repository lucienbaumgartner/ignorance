Say it with me: the current sitting president does not support lockdowns thus does not support any federal funding for aid. People and businesses cannot survive until Biden is in office -- they need something right now. If you are working from home and you are saying this, you are being extremely selfish and unaware of how privileged you are to still be pulling an income.
