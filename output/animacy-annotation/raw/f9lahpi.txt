I guess my point is that its tragic and ignorant that people compare NK and SK in these diametric ways when the reality is that they were a single, unified country until about 60 years ago. And that the main reason this tiny peninsula is arbitrarily split is because it happened to get caught up in Cold War bullshit, as someone else pointed out.
