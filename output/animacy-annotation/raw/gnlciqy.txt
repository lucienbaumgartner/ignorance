I don't have a **good** reason, but it's worth bearing in mind that China did make **some** effort to crack down on unsafe practices in wet markets after the SARS outbreak in 2003. (Though only after they'd gotten a lot of pressure from enough other countries.)

The main problem is that the CCP is just basically incompetent at governing the country, and even to the extent they manage some control, their methods and polices tend to engender a dangerous combination of resentment, illegality, and not giving a shit among the populace.

The main result of their earlier efforts was driving illegal wildlife markets underground, where they're much harder to monitor and mitigate. It was, to be polite, an incomplete success.

What China really needs is a massive, intensive, and prolonged nationwide educational programme bringing their people into the modern age. Even by backwards Asian standards, China is a remarkably backwards country. We see a certain view of the place that they **want** us to see, but it's very misleading. We're seeing the Potemkin Village view they like to show the rest of the world. But most of China is not like what they're showing us. And, it's worth pointing out, even most Chinese themselves don't know that. Because of the heavy restrictions their government imposes, they're as ignorant about their own country as most other people in the world are, are often unaware of its real problems, and often believe things that are not true. (As an example, many Chinese sincerely believe that dog is not eaten there. But you can find dog restaurants even in central Beijing.) By and large, the vast majority of China is living at least a century in the past, and often more. Primitive superstition and ancient mysticism are still very common. The bulk of traditional Chinese "medicine" is no better than the ignorant bullshit Western doctors were ladling out a few centuries ago. All of this can only be solved by massive education.

And very tragically, the CCP is very unlikely to accomplish that. Partly because they're not up to the challenge. And partly because it's not in their interests to have a populace who are well educated in forensics and epistemology, or else they'll inevitably start asking questions and raising challenges that threaten the state.

In short, the CCP has created and continues -- by necessity -- to reinforce a system that keeps most of their people ignorant and unaware, and therefore largely **unable** to change their ways for the better.

So yes, we should be angry at them. This is indeed their fault. But we also need to remember that there's not a lot they can do about it, without radically changing their entire system, and they're not going to do that. And we should be angry at them for that, too, but keep in mind that it's human nature to hold on to power once you have it.

It's extremely sad to say, but China might never get better unless they have another revolution.

All that said, most of **America's** problems attributable to this outbreak are **not** China's fault, but instead the result of gross incompetence and malfeasance by the Trump administration, including enabling the same by many state governments. And some of that was even intentional, which is doubly outrageous.

China gave this to the entire world, but the numbers make it very clear that our own nation did an absolutely shit job of dealing with it, much worse than most others. And China cannot be blamed for that.
