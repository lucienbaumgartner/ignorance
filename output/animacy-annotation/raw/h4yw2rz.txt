So is he no longer seeing your daughter? Or forfeiting regular contact in favour of a different arrangement?

I can kinda emphasize but with less drama. My sons(9) dad got into a new relationship 3 years ago, they live an hour away with her two kids. He went from seeing my son once a week to sporadically every few months for maybe 2 nights maximum. She clearly has issues with my son. 

As much as I know you'll want to explain and tell your daughter it all, I wouldn't. My son is 9 and as far as he is aware his dad loves him loads, they have a good time when they see each other and there is no bad blood between me and him.

This isn't because I think the way he is treated is okay, but because he is young and I just want him to be blissfully happy and unaware of adult issues. I want him to enjoy his childhood with as little worries or insecurities as possible. 

I know it's hard as the bio parent who is essentially being shafted and short changed, but that's the crappy burden we have to carry so that our kids can be happy. 

Your ex sounds like a massive ahole. To be honest your daughter sounds better without anyway, especially if the step mum doesnt want her there. You sound like an amazing mum who is dealing with a lot, but just know he will regret this when she is older and you'll be the one she comes too x
