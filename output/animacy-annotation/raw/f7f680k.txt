Congratulations, you've really outdone yourself this time. You've written something so incredibly vitriolic and ignorant that I don't even need to write counterarguments in an effort to reveal your subterfuge of hate, you've just put it all out there for everyone to see.

It wouldn't hurt for you to consider talking to someone more receptive about these feelings. Get a second opinion outside of reddit and 4chan. If you can't/won't do so in person and would rather stick to the internet, sites like [BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) are a great start. 

For anyone else reading, please seek professional counselling if you feel you have unresolved anger or depression.
