Can you imagine being so insecure and ignorant that the idea of a cold plastic (I remember the metal ones) speculum being uncomfortably inserted by a stranger to make sure you donâ€™t have cervical cancer is considered in ANY way sexual? 

This is absolute idiocy and we need to raise our boys right...hopefully we can reduce this in the future. Good gawd.
