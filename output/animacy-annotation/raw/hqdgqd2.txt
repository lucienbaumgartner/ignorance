My muscles/athletic frame. I identify as gender fluid but was born female. I’ve always had a very muscular body and broad frame— thin waist but with abs more reminiscent of the male frame than that of a female’s, with broad shoulders, muscular arms, and legs. You’d be surprised how many people hold this in scrutiny; many cis men are emasculated and criticize me for not having a more curvy figure commonly associated with the female body. Some cis women are insecure or just ignorant and also poke fun at this. All my strong, muscular, athletic women are gorgeous!!
