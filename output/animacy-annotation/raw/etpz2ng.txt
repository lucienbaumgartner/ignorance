Yep. Short story time!

One time, our family went on a vacation, and it was late, lots of layovers and flights etc so we grabbed wendys to eat on the way back. We went into Wendy's, and my step mom, without even checking the bathroom to see if there was a changing station (spoiler: there was, my sister had to go and she later asked my stepmom why she didn't even bother checking, to which she replied that "she didn't want to".) Yep, so while me my dad and my sister were up ordering completely oblivious, my stepmom was busy changing her on the table behind us, in the middle of the restaurant. Didn't even bother to wipe the table after she was done. When we left, she commented on how dirty the restaurant was. Me, and even my dad and my sister were embarrassed as fuck during the whole ordeal.

I used to laugh internally at people who were so socially unaware and such mombies/daddicts that they change their children's diapers in the middle of restaurants, then I realized that was my stepmom. :(
