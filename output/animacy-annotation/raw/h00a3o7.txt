The world will not end because of climate change. Human civilization will be what ends if things keep snowballing. But yes governments today are very short sided and ignorant.

Humanity often needs to be pushed past a tipping point for them to collectively do something. Looks very bleak short term for us but long term we’ll keep learning and doing what we can.
