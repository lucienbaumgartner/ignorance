I woke up my 16th birthday as a child of the 80s/90s expecting a red convertible in the driveway with a big red bow or something. Instead, I woke up to a state quarter map and no explanation. Teenager "anarchist" me was furious and unaware that this was a joke gift. However..the real gift was lost and my parents were so upset that they didn't share the backstory with me. So that's all I got. A piece of cardboard and no family member that would even make eye contact with me. Good times.
