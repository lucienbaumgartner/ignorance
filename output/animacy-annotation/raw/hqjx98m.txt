Well, you're assuming an awful lot. I've seen no one here say that he's a future abuser or having any mental illness. Mostly, I see he's very immature, careless, and unaware of the standards he should follow as an idol. Does stating this means they have no critical thinking skills ?

Furthermore, if you admit you don't want to have a constructive argument destined to change the perspective of readers here, you might want to question the effectiveness of such methods to teach critical thinking or validating your difference in opinion.
