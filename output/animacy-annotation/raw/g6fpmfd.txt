I think we fundamentally disagree. You seem too concerned about maintaining a minimum of civility, and I'm more about treating everyone fairly. It seems like you'd rather one person politely bully someone than someone lose their temper over being treated badly.

You also seem really socially inept and unaware of how power dynamics work even in a small thing like this. There's a reason most women streamers get talked over and left behind, and it's because if they ever got loud or maldy like the guys do they'd be treated like will was here, so they don't do it and just keep quiet to be civil.
