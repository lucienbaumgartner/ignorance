YTA. He is dumb and deserved consequences, but u would never kill a PC in their sleep with everyone else unaware and unable to intervene. It's lame and not really interesting or fun for anyone. You could have easily given him a disease, had him wake up poisoned the next day, or even given him a madness effect, but instead you gave a very unsatisfying death. The beginning also reads slightly like you have a vendetta against his character which isn't great
