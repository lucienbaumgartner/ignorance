I mean just go read all the studies on white collar crime. People actually study this kind of stuff.  Arthur Anderson, Eron, Mortgage Backed Security scandal, facebook, nothing I say is novel.  You're just unaware and biased and don't know who the real criminals are and how they got their from their well educated comfortable lives.
