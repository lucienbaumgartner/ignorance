What perfectly illustrates a small and rather vocal stain on the wider gaming community is the obsessive whiny, bitchy attitude a select group of people have toward changes in video games that don't 100% align with what they want.

Newsflash fuck-head, there are other people that play the same game as you and they want to be able to customise their character how they want. Your petty, insignificant point of view is simply and rather astonishingly simple minded and ignorant of what other people want and need.

Cry some more.
