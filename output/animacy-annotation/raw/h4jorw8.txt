Unbelievable disney fanboys in this thread. Jesus Christ. Criticize disney for overlong credits and apparently you are selfish and ignorant of disney's show budgets. 

Get off it. 

Lots of streaming services have big budgets now. Disney is the only exception when it comes to bloated credit length.
