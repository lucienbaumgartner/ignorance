I have a long post, but please read it to the end. I say some very important things here that most people won't ever consider, and you need to consider them before you take action in any way.

Depending on the severity of his autism, he might not understand boundaries or anything beyond wants/needs of his. He might not realize this hurts you. It could just be literally a sensory thing for him. Don't take it personally, but he's likely unable to process why he even does this, it's just pheromones and... well, basically primal instinct, and sensory overload a lot of times. He likely doesn't have impulse control because he doesn't know what impulse is. He also might not have taken them for the reasons you assume, which I will explain at the bottom of my post.

I've worked with people with autism who literally have ran into traffic and got hit by cars because they don't exist outside of their often very narrow focus.

You won't ever be able to separate the private nature of your boundaries being broken from the fact that he likely doesn't know what boundaries are, and be fully okay with it, but you can see from his perspective and forgive him for it, even if it won't ever feel not gross.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how true this is, he could have mild autism and just be a real creepy man and choose to break these boundaries, but the only thing that can be said for a certainty, is that it won't stop unless someone shows him it's wrong and breaks his behavior so that it is redirected in a healthy way or becomes a learned behavior to not touch or take things, which is not something you can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I'll leave you with this perspective. Your boyfriend, his brother, is non-autistic I assume, and is deemed "normal", right? Well, his brother has a girlfriend, who gets to come over and spend time with him and touch him and be intimate with him, and has a bunch of friends and close relationships where they can just sleep together in the living room and be people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does he get that? Has he ever hugged anyone who wasn't a family member, or held their hand, or gotten praise, or had them come over to watch TV with him or hangout with him, or do anything with him? Has a girl ever given him any attention? I doubt it, and if it is, it is very rare. But he sees his brother get everything while he gets nothing and he likely isn't aware that he is different, and he doesn't know why he can't have these things. I don't know why he can't have these things, he deserves them and desires them just as much as anyone else in the world, but people rarely prioritize making sure people like him get fulfilling relationships in their lives. He won't ever have a deep connection like his brother has, even if he has the same desires. He'll never be able to articulate any of this to anyone, and nobody cares enough about him, or understands his needs enough to take the time to make sure his life is fulfilling. This is more so true for people who are nonverbal, but it is also true for people who can't process their needs to verbalize them, and who often get overlooked for being creepy and weird and unaware of the boundaries "normal" people have.

You cared about his brother enough to take his underwear and pajamas, because that's something you can do without anyone batting an eye. He did the same thing, and it was wrong. He likely won't ever understand why you could take the clothes of someone you care about, but he couldn't. Think about this before you punish him thinking he doesn't understand, because it is likely you that doesn't understand. 

If you want to know what to do, be his friend. Welcome him into your life and be non-judgemental and don't ever assume that his behaviors are wrong in his world, and that he is doing these things knowing they are wrong. Politely tell him when he does something he shouldn't by saying "that's not okay" in the moment, and redirect him to something that is okay. Give him healthy outlets, without encouraging his bad behavior. Bring an old shirt over, something that belongs to you. Something you've worn, that he can also wear. A non-gendered shirt, if you don't have one buy one and wear it for a while. You can wash it after, it doesn't have to be dirty or anything, just something of yours. Find your underwear wherever he stashed it. Ask him for it. Bring a second pair of underwear if you don't think he will understand. Show him them and say you need yours back, that they are yours. Ask him to please return them, as you need them. If he does, tell him thank you. In a separate moment from that one, so he doesn't connect taking your things and giving them back to you as a reward, give him your old shirt and say he can keep it. Imagine this to be similar to your boyfriend giving you a hoodie or something. Ask his parents if this is okay before you try it, and try to explain the perspective I've shown you here, as that is likely what he is doing, and see if they agree.

If you have further questions or if his autism is very mild and I'm just wrong here, and you want to talk about that further, please don't hesitate to reply. I'll do my best to work through this with you, if it helps.
