&gt;Wanting to make a difference/giving back to the community (genuinely)

Mostly because I find it can make a difference to a lot of people and I do enjoy giving back to the community. I just don't buy into the tripe that it's a hero's calling or anything. It's just a job, an important one, but I'd say a plumber that turns up to fix a broken pipe is doing an important job as well. No one ever quibbles about their pay.

I never really went into it for the money since my parents were very upfront, they told us that while the pay is ok/good the amount of work required/length of period before you hit those levels makes medicine a poor choice if the financial incentive is the primary one.

My issues with medicine in the UK have a lot more to do with pisspoor governmental planning over the past decade (well, even longer I guess), a population that is seemingly both aware and unaware of how shit things are, and just the general attitudes of people in involved.
