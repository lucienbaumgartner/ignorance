I see what you’re getting at, and certainly agree in the BLM case, but isn’t it useful to separate the issues? Because I feel one could argue they are pretty different problems, as one involves an imbalanced power dynamic with a (potentially) consenting victim, and it’s a problem that might not even be “illegal” in a lot of cases while in the other the victim is usually unaware and helpless
