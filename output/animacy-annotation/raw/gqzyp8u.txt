&gt;Women are angry and scared about the state of things, and that anger and fear are valid.

Except that's a complete lie. What is it validated by? Stats? Stats consistently show that men are far more likely to be victims of  violent crime then women.

This whole thing is a sham and the reason  that bad ideas like this are spreading is because people refuse to say what these women are, which is irrational and ignorant of the facts of the issue at hand.
