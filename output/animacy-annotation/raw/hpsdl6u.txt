You don't claim to know anything? My dude you literally multiple times reinforced your belief that you somehow know that people can not possibly like godfather and only pretend. That's your opinion and it's bs. It's a statement of "I don't enjoy something so no one else possibly can.". I am the one calling you out on your bs. Your way of responding to other people who wanted to disagree isn't looking like you seeking to discuss this. 

I honestly never watched godfather. So i am pretty neural on this topic. I just thought that it is incredibly ignorant and arrogant to claim (and yes ofc you did claim - what else were you doing?) what you did. 

You quite possibly like something as well someone thinks of as extremely boring and someone might also think that you are just pretending to like it as he/ she can fathom the fact that you enjoy something he/ she can't understand. It's quite sure this someone exists. What would you say to this someone and how can you use this to reflect upon your own ignorance?
