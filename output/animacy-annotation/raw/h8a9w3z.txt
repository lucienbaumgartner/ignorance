I didn’t say anything about Canadian exceptionalism, or how the market is insulated against a housing collapse or any of the other lines about how ‘CaNAdA iS SpEciAl.’ 
I’m saying looking to Japan as a model for Canada in the future is foolish and ignorant of Japan’s political and economic history.

Canada isn’t an island; it doesn’t have a metropolis of 30+ million, or a population similar to Japan; it’s not as insular and hostile to immigration as Japan; foreign investment  rates in housing/ the economy are much higher than Japan; its political and economic structures are very different (especially in the time period of that graph.) 

In short make like-for-like comparisons, because anything else is trivia. Otherwise Why not compare Canada’s housing prices to Tokugawa era Japan? It’s as relevant.
