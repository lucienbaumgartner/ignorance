&gt; antifa = rioters ? Yes my dear anti -&gt; against and "fa is the synonym of fascist so yeah I guess saying that it is the results of socialism is not a big point here. It is pretty clear.

In what universe do you live? Anyone opposed to fascism is socialist? The result of socialism in Europe is riots? I really don't get your point there.

&gt; He is announcing that he would lower the taxe rate of French workers/companies ... Antifas are complaining about the high tax-rate right ? So that would be a positive thing for them ? Nah because they are retarted (as shown in the video)

Alright have you ever lived in France? Because I'm pretty sure you're confusing Gilets Jaunes and Antifa. Antifa isn't about fighting taxes or whatever. It's about fighting... fascism. You just explained that.

&gt; I would definitely trust someone who shares the same historical knowledge as me or others than another person puting the president status in disgrace (See. Macron, Hollande)

So if you're dumb and ignorant of history you trust others that are as dumb and ignorant... Well I guess that makes sense, it's exactly what happened with Trump. Pretty sad though. And honestly I'm completely opposed to Macron but to say that he put the president status in disgrace is wrong. Like, if there's one compliment I can give him, it's that.

&gt; How can you talk about someone loving his country ? Just because he is from another one ? Ohohoh is that racism ? Or xenophoebia ? Hey. Next time don't judge by the origins but by his values. He lived, worked, paid his taxes and always respected France. What can you say about that ?

Nah just pointing out the irony of crying about immigrants from North Africa when he himself is from Algeria. And the irony of defending Vichy France when he himself has a jewish family. It's almost like he's compensating all of this by being an absolute turd to all the others. Fuck you got mine mentality.
