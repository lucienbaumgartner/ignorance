Maybe you didn't intend to lead him on, and maybe you were even very clear with him. But agreeing to go to a hotel with a guy will tell them that it's on the table. You said no, but I can certainly see why he might assume that going to a hotel means "There's a chance", and that you're just being coy. As for the period stuff, well, a lot of people are fine with period sex. At the very least, you sent mixed signals. I'm sure you didn't mean to, but it seems like there's some naivet√© in play on your part in not understanding the social norms at play.  

That said, him getting all huffy about you not wanting to do anything should have been a signal that it was time to leave. At that point, you're kind of keeping yourself in a bad position. Thankfully nothing happened, but it could have easily ended poorly. And not only that, but even after he had gotten all pissy about it, you threw another curve ball by being very insistent about cuddling, which is a pretty close and intimate thing to do with someone.  

So, I think there's some wrong on both sides. His wrong comes from some immaturity and not being able to control his urges. Yours comes from being naive and unaware of how the average guy in today's society works.
