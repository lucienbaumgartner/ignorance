I'm Korean - they're so fucking white and ignorant that they know nothing about Korean food.  All that crap about diversity yet they don't know shit about us.

The pastes could've been used to make soup.  Sure it might smell a bit, but soup is soup.  Weren't these LARPers complaining that they don't have food?

Anyway, stay safe my man.
