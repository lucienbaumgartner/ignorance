&gt; measles should be one of the least of our concerns.

No, it shouldn't. Diseases don't just come back overnight. They come back slowly. 

The US has seen 300+ cases in 3 fuckin' months. It's currently seeing the worst outbreak in 20+ years. It's on pace to break its worst recent year for cases (2014 - 664).

Other diseases are also making a comeback. Whooping cough, TB. To say it's the least of our concerns is stupid and ignorant.

That or it's based on this ignorant assumption that it doesn't affect *you*. It does fam. Vaccines don't last forever. You're also protected by herd immunity and I'd be willing to bet you haven't had a booster for MMR or TB lately.
