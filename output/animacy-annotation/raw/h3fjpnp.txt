Being the creator of something isn't as important as you think it is. Being the keeper is just as important. One of my "favorite" examples of approporiation is Pharel wearing a Native American feathered head-dress. The head-dress has powerful spirirtual significance and should only be worn be chieftains. The head-dress wasn't just created one day by Native Americans' ancestors. A tradition like that evovles over time through each chieftan and generation. Present keepers of the tradition (not Pharel) have as much right to the tradition as the creators. Being the keeper of the tradition is just as important as being the creator. Traditions are built over generations with each generarion contributing its part. Trying to say the keeper of a tradition today does not have that validitiy is just shallow, weak and ignorant of how cultures and traditions work in the first place.
