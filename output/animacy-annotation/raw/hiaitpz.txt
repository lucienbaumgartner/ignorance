Unfortunately this and the Hex subreddit are full of what I refer to as Crypto Flat Earthers, people that are so hopelessly clueless and ignorant of the financial basics of crypto that they discard market cap as made up metric that has no meaning.  These people are going to wreck themselves and it's not going to be pretty.
