&gt; As you can clearly see, the rate of covid infections per 100k people is HIGHER IN THE VACCINATED. And it's getting worse every week!

you say that like its a gotcha rather than something super standard.

&gt;Please look at the data for yourselves, and don't listen to people like OP here who are deliberately spreading misinformation about the vaccines.

yes, let's look at it.

18-29 in your chart has roughly equal infection rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated. yet when one looks at the UK gov data about the 18-29 age group, you see the group is 65% vaccinated.

so why are the stats the same size? it's almost as if the vaccine is fucking working you waste of skin.

but yes let's continue looking at data.

40-49 age group, split the UK difference (its segmented by 5 years) and call it 78% vaccinated. if the vaccine did nothing, the vaccinated group would be about 5 times bigger than the unvaccinated group, instead its only about 2 times. huh. why's that? 

now let's look at hospitalizations.

_An analysis of UK data from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) and the Coronavirus Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN),1 endorsed by the UK Scientific and Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE),2 shows that of 40 000 patients with covid-19 who were admitted to hospital between December 2020 and July 2021 a total of 33 496 (84%) had not been vaccinated. It found that 5198 (13%) of these patients had received their first vaccine and 1274 (3%) their second. A total of 611 patients with previous covid-19 (reinfection) were not included in the analysis._

84% of hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated? huh. why's that, fucko?

_Data from the Office of National Statistics show that 256 (0.5%) of the 51 281 covid related deaths that occurred in England between 2 January and 2 July 2021 were breakthrough deaths._

whaaaaat? only 0.5% of the deaths are from the fully vaccinated?

GOSH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. LET'S GET TO WORK TEAM! I THINK WE CAN CRACK THE CASE.

but okay, let's keep looking at data. how about israel?

why are the vaccinated minority the overwhelming majority of hospitalizations?

huh. almost as if the vaccines fucking work. 

your post is the perfect example of being unskilled and unaware of it.
