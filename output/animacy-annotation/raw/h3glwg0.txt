I'm sorry you feel that way. But no, this isn't made up and I do it with genuine intentions of trying to wrap my head around it.

The Christian right attacked the homosexual movement on moral, traditional and spiritual grounds. Many claimed that homosexuality was perverse and even a prerequisite for pedophilia. That is not what I am doing *in the slightest* and I have punctuated my post and subsequent comments with a noted understanding of other people's backgrounds, struggles and trauma. So please, dont attempt to build a strawman in my place.

I know it's hard for you to accept, but many reasonable, accepting people are struggling to reconcile the inconsistencies with this movement despite historically doing what is right. That counts. And attempting to shoot down, undermine, reduce and downright silence them by reporting them everywhere they go, and slapping a "nasty, disgusting, terrible person" sticker on them only hurts the movement. I dont think you realise just how immature, conceited and ignorant that makes you look. It will turn genuinely curious people against you and further bolster the *genuinely* intolerant people's views and ideologies against you.

As for the comments about my sister. Theyre either wilfully ignorant or you've missed the point entirely. You're angry at the wrong person.
