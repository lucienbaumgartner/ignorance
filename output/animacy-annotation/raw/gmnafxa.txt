It is extremely arrogant and ignorant of you to claim that there 100% is no god, especially without evidence. The same can be said for christians who claim that there is 100% a god. The truth is none of us know for sure whether or not a god or goddess or multiple goddesses and God's do or do not exist. As of right now neither side has any concrete evidence. Either look for the answer; or believe what you believe and shut the fuck up about it just like everyone else. People can't be allowed to force there beliefs on other people. Religion was not at all the best analogy to use in regards to being misgendered and its way to political. If some one misgenders you handle it and leave. If they're family do whatever; I would cut them off. It's gonna be hard, especially if you're close with them but if its what's best for you then it is what it is. There are a few people in my family it would be hard for me to cut off too. nobody who's thoughts are worth your time is judging you for not cutting those people off. Luckily I've been blessed(by god or, the universe or, just random chance) with mostly supportive family.
