Idk I’m prepared to get downvoted but this whole he didn’t respect me is shifting the blame.
You got dumped. 
You weren’t his girlfriend
There was no label and no relationship 
Just because he was acting as he was earlier didn’t change that fact. 
He didn’t cheat or disrespect you. 
He’s a piece of shit for stringing you along. 
But you were being extremely naive and ignorant. That or you don’t respect yourself so why have an expectation to have an ex respect you. Also naive and ignorant. 

Dunno if you didn’t want to accept the reality or you didn’t want to start over and the ghost of your relationship was better to you than none at all. Whatever it was you tried to justify it. 

You left yourself to be used and taken advantage of and are blaming the piece of shit for being a piece of shit. 

You’re not going to learn if you’re shifting the blame. When you break up you break up. People who respect themselves don’t sit in this limbo with their exes and accept that. 

Find out what you deserve. Set the bar and don’t ever deviate from it.
