I've never done much street photography. I've always been too shy to do it. 

But, I feel like set photography lets me do that style of candid photography in a "safe" space, where people are aware and comfortable with me being there. At least, aware to a certain point, since I can still catch them unaware and completely candid.

Thanks for this article. You articulate the thoughts and feelings that I've had about the job way better than I ever could.
