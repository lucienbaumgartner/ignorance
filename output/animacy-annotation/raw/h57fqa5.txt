Yes, women knew about it.  Pregnancy exams at places of employment were *mandatory*, and there was a huge black market for birth control smuggled from other European nations.  Women weren't stupid, ignorant, sheltered, or misinformed.  It was a part of daily life.

You think if abortion was banned back alley procedures wouldn't skyrocket?  News flash, that hasn't just happened in Romania, it was also a huge contributor to maternal mortality in the US prior to Roe vs Wade.

A woman who wants an abortion is like a trapped animal trying to chew off its own leg.  It's naive and ignorant of history -- American AND international -- to think women won't opt out of motherhood by any means necessary.  

Fun fact- humans caused the herb silphium to **go extinct** in ancient Rome because it was an abortifacient.  Women have been ending pregnancies for thousands of years, regardless of laws.
