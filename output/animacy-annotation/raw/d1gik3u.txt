I'll just be one that has to say it: if you're the kind of person that's so socially unaware and thin skinned that somebody telling you to wash your stinky ass is "bullying" to you then you're also probably the kind of person that all the horrible, unpleasant opponent stories come from too. If the goal is truly to be welcoming to the most people possible, we shouldn't welcome that.

The game is better off without those types. Fuck those people.

Edit: I can't grammar
