I agree. Like I get that isolation is rough and it can get lonely no matter how much money you have. But there were (and still are) homeless people literally dying from covid in the middle of the fucking streets and to sit there and force yourself to cry because you had to lower your personal chefs to 2 instead of 12, is so ignorant and just insane.
