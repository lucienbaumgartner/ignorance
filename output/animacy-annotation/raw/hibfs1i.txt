I'm not defending racism, and I am fully aware racism goes more than one way. The saying "kill all whites" is very racist. I'm just saying it will never garner as much power as "kill all blacks" could, and there's less force behind it. 

I don't defend any racism, nowhere in my response did I defend racism. I was defending a joke, and this whole situation is hilarious honestly, because people can say over[my racist things and go "it was just a joke" and that's totally fine, but someone makes a joke about white chess pieces and suddenly shit goes down and I'm "what's wrong with the world."

And btw, I knew about systemic racism before a year ago. Just because you were uninformed and unaware of it doesn't mean other people were. Do you even know what it means, or do you just have a hair-trigger reaction to automatically go into berserk mode when someone brings up very real problems that people of color face? 

But you know what, going through some of your recent comment history has shown me you really aren't someone who can be reasoned with. You're going to hold to your beliefs (sometimes in spite of science itself), and I'm definitely not letting you change my mind, so I think this is it for me. I hope one day you realize there are definitely more things wrong with the world than someone who disagrees with you about what constitutes racism, but I doubt you will. 

Tl;dr: I'm not going to let an anti-masker convince me that I'm what's wrong with this world. Systemic racism is real and it existed well before last year (that's the essence of something being "systemic"). I never defended racism in any capacity and if you couldn't tell I was actively in opposition to racism you need to go back to first grade and learn how to read, and maybe pick up some basic science credits on the way.
