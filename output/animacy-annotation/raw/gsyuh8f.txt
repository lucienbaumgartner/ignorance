I'm going to be diplomatic and assume the best intentions I can from what you're saying and that maybe you're coming from a place of ignorance and you don't mean to insult anyone. You're being downvoted so heavily because abnormal implies bad, not just rare. This common facet of the word's usage is recorded in several prominent dictionaries:

[Source 1:](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/abnormal)
&gt;different from what is usual or average, especially in a way that is bad

[Source 2:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abnormal)
&gt;unusual in an unwelcome or problematic way 

[Source 3:](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abnormal)
&gt;Someone or something that is abnormal is unusual, especially in a way that is worrying.

Therefore you're either being very clumsy and ignorant of context in your use of language, or you believe there's a problem with being LGBTQ+. If the former, I would advise that you don't use "abnormal" to describe people as it has hurtful connotations. If the latter, then you're just an asshole.
