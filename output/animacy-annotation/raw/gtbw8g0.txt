Barking isn’t always a sign of aggression. In dog body language a low, wide stance and barking is a show of excitement and playfulness.

I used to have a huge german shepherd mix that never bit anything in his life except stuffed animals, but he could easily be seen as aggressive because he was talkative, overly friendly, and unaware of his size.

A lot of people misread dogs’ body language as aggressive when it’s not, and when people don’t recognize how a dog they’re approaching is feeling it can be really easy to make the dog uncomfortable or defensive. Even if the dog is friendly and playful, they can get riled up unintentionally and try to play too rough.
