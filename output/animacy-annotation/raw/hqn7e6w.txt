But it was developed by people who *do* speak and understand the language. It seems that some Latin Americans just decided that the neuter "Latino" wasn't adequate for all cases anymore. Languages evolve and are sometimes changed deliberately. So many people are offended over nothing.

English is my native language. If some people decided that they want to invent a new English word to describe themselves, something gender neutral, I wouldn't be offended or annoyed at all, even though we already have gender neutral terms to use. It's not disrespectful to English or anything like that. If people don't want to use the word, they won't use it, and it might become obsolete.


The appropriate response to somebody wanting to be referred to as "Latinx" or "Latine" is "sure thing", because that's basic decency and respect. At the least, the response shouldn't be like it always is in these threads. It's just uneducated, willfully ignorant and intolerant people, as usually, crying about anything that hints of leftism or inclusivity
