You shouldn't harass people or lie about them bfodder. The argument was over, no one was talking *to you* anymore. Yet apparently you are so ensconced by an initial reading of something, that was clarified and corrected... that you have proceeded to profile stalk me, lie about me, and try to harass me over it.

Which in a thread where you're mad about a guy harassing someone else, it makes you look both appallingly unaware and incredibly hypocritical.

These last two comments you've made can be reported right to reddit admins for harassment. Please grow up.
