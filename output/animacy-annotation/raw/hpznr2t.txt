I'm not religious nor passionate about Christmas but this is literally a couple saying "Merry Christmas." You have no proof THEY are destroying families. You're ignorant and elementary. 

You know how many times I've heard that dick joke? Enough times to have an idea of how young, inexperienced and naive you are. At least be more funny if you want to be an asshole.
