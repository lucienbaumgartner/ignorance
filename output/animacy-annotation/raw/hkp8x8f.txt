I agree. People suck most the time. Not speciall people, people I know because I like time a lot too.
But in general people suck at being good humans like every one thinks they should be.
They are full of fear and hate. They are selfish and dumb. They are extreme lazy and ignorant of others. They are annoying and I would always prefer to deal with dogs, cats or horses. And everytime I try not to suck as a human I'm hoping someone will try not to suck too, but I'm afraid in the end it's human to suck at being human.
