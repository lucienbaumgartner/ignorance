What a childish parody your comments are. -!: yes, if you spew hateful and dumb insults at someone, they will respond.

&gt; all the answers 

I’m not saying I have all the answers. You’ve read into the fact that I responded to your insults. 

&gt; Like most men

I would never generalise a whole gender, since most women are far more intelligent and less hateful than what your comments indicate you are. But like most people of the dogmatic, simplistic, bitter radical extremist variety you seem incapable of understanding how obvious it is that you’re spewing one-sided bullshit and defensively, unthinkingly,

&gt; guys like you

Who disagree with your simplistic hypocrisy and hate-spewing? I have only made comments that were completely balanced, nothing hateful or demeaning to women. But you can’t process that. You went from “women rule the world” to insults to lashing out at my gender. You’re the one who is the problem here. But you do have a communist of radical extremists to assure you that you must be right, simply because of what you are. 

I’m not saying anything that is against gender equality. Only you are, but seem too dumb and bitter to realise it could ever apply to you - only ‘Identify! Male identified who doesn’t agree that “women rule the world”! Spew spew spew.” 

Luckily, we are heading towards actual gender equality and empathy for each other, and your kind of worldview is dying. 

Your comments are so self-unaware and unreasonable there’s clearly no point here. But cheers, and please grow a brain.
