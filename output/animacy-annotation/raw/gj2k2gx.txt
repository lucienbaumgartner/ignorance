&gt;You’re saying...

No. No I’m not. Again you are trying to make my argument for me and that’s where you fail to understand it. 

What you think I mean to say is closer to what I am actually saying, but you inserted the false idea that I am saying that is the rights position, which I did not. 

I genuinely mean this with respect. Please stop misrepresenting views to bolster your own. You keep inserting views that you assume to be true without evidence of that. It makes you seem arrogant and ignorant of other people’s views and I am sure that is not the case. If you take the time to ask or at least try to understand what somebody’s actual views are you can have better conversations that can lead to changing peoples minds. Assuming you know somebody’s views better than themselves hurts only yourself.
