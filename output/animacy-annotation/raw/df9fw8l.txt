I'm a bit annoyed that you'd make such a generalization about an entire state on behalf of a poor governor. It isn't even true that half of the state works in Manhattan. Not surprised though, New Yorkers seem to be closed-minded and unaware that New Jersey is bigger than just the areas on the other side of the Hudson.
