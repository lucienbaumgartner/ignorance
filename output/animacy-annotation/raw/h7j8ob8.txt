Itâ€™s sad and ignorant that they called Illaoi a â€˜guyâ€™, but with regards to ageism, I think itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s personal choice how old they wish their partner to be as long as it is legal. 

Some people are into older people and others have a thing for younger (as long as itâ€™s legal). We canâ€™t choose who we are attracted towardsâ€¦ ðŸ˜­
