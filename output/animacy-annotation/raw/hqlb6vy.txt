Don’t listen to those dummies, you’re doing the right thing. I also have a chronic illness and it’s genetic so half my family has it as well and we’re all taking as many precautions as we can. A close family friend of ours is also immunecompromised due to her autoimmune condition and she unfortunately caught covid from work. Thankfully she was fully vaxxed and boosted so even though she feels terrible she will live.

Never feel like you need to compromise your boundaries to protect the feelings of these ignorant and inconsiderate people.
