Of course I distrust the government. It's a position of power that needs to constantly be checked. Our cabinets are nice, but that doesnt stop corruption. Our Amendments and supreme court keeps our government from over reaching.

Which is why we shouldnt change the first amendment. You say they dont take hate speech laws farther than their intended, that I'm the one condeluding hate speech and hot topics. I say it is the government, and both parties, that constantly condelude law for their gain. Let's look at how Europe's hate speech laws have aged.

[Illegal to meme](https://theoutline.com/post/4992/eu-votes-to-make-memes-illegal?zd=1&amp;zi=vy5eqwtv) They say it's for copy right infringement, but the EU (and china cough) abuse copy right laws as a means for censorship, a lot. That's another topic. But worth noting how laws can be twisted for gains by a government.

Even look at our own states passing laws.

Like New York wanting to [ban the word illegal immigrant?](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/new-york-city-will-fine-you-saying-illegal-alien-thats-assault-the)

It's easier to pass a law, than it is to abolish one. This law is a big grey area, waiting for burocratic loophole and abuse. A government uncheck becomes a tyrant. I think it's way too much power to give to a government, and I belive America's founding fathers felt the same way.

Remember, people are flawed and ignorant, that includes people in our government. No man should have power over others.
