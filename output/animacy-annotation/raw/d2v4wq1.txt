&gt;I think the whole point is that they do not "know" this, although the use of "know" seems to assume that they have correctly identified a fact. So, rather, the whole point is that they do not think this.

Okay? Even if they don't know/think/whatever else that doesn't mean they're not perpetuating harm, it just means that they're doing so unconsciously.

&gt;I'm not sure why you're asking me this, it definitely has no baring on the assertion you quoted. I'm scared you may be wanting to make a personal attack on either my gender or sexuality, so I decline to answer.

Because you're asserting your "friends" are welcoming to gay people and women despite using homophobic and misogynistic slurs. Unless you're gay or a woman, then you really have no way of knowing if that's true or not.

&gt;Plus, I'm not sure why if I were judging you, it would have any baring on the validity of that judgement as we can all distinguish between a good judgement, and a reckless, unaware and offensive judgement.

Just thought you'd appreciate the irony. Guess I was wrong.
