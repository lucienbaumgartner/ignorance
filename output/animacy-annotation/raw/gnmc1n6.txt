it isnt the rape victim that gets executed as that would be unfair and ignorant of the religion to do that basically in a situation that happened with the prophet peace be upon him (i'm gonna summarize the story) there was this woman that was raped she blamed it on another man who looked similar to the man who raped her and in court the man was gonna get a severe punishment but the man that raped her halted everything and stood up and said he was the one that raped her and so innocent man was forgiven and apologized to while the other man was sentenced to be executed with no questions asked; and before you say execution is too harsh let me ask you this, if you saw someone you hold dearly get raped in front of you would you not kill them right there and then?
