This whole comment sounds...... sus.
1. House music includes damn nesr every gender and sexuality every party. 

So if you're gay and unaware of the scene you're really out of the loop, if you're straight why do you care 

2. Are you looking for rehearsed salsa or bachata or something?

3. Would love to see you dance ðŸ¤£
