Yeah I love h3h3, I admire the crew and the podcast along with their old content. I’m here to support and admire people I’m interested in. You clearly aren’t a fan and came here just to be toxic and ignorant, that says enough about you lol.

You fit right in with the group of idiots plaguing the h3 comments thinking that saying someone’s a d!ck rider will automatically win any argument.

Goodnight and I’m blocking you, I’d like to avoid arguing with people who clearly have bigger issues to worry about.
