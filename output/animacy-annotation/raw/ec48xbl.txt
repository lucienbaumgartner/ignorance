Nope I disagree with his nationalism vs globalism argument.  I think his attempt to portray the OF as globalism is a stretch when TLM is arguably more so (one of the things people reiterate about Latin mass is that it should be the same everywhere).  

I also generally dislike this style of trying to portray anyone who isn't in your camp as asleep and ignorant.  That condescension of the sort you see among the New Atheist type.
