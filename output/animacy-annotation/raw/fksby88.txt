There is no reason why anyone should be out and about any more than absolutely necessary in most areas at this point, so you staying home would be protecting both yourself AND anyone else you come into any kind of contact with if you should happen to become infected and not realize it.  If your boss doesn't understand that, he is naive and ignorant -- that doesn't help you deal with his behavior, but I hope it helps to counteract him making you feel like you're overreacting.  If possible, simply tell your boss your plan to work from home and carry on.  If he thinks lesser of you, then he needs a reality check.  Speaking as someone who worries a lot about what my advisors think of me, I really understand, but you need to do what's best for your health (and the health of your community).  If he threatens your employment with him, definitely contact your disability services group or similar like someone else mentioned.

If people like him are "proved correct" in the future and it seems the quarantining was overkill, then that only means that it WORKED.  I don't know where you are, but my university started telling people to work from home when possible and moved to online classes when we had only a few cases in the state.  You are not overreacting, especially if you are in a high risk group.
