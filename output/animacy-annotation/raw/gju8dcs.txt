The science you are referring to has been perfected by the Muslims, Jews and Early Christians. To use Islam as an example: the concept of halal and the slaughtering of animals is rather humane as (to kill a cow for example) the jugular has to be cut which causes the animal to become unaware and confused of what's happening, but not stressed as it starves the brain of blood. All three of those religions at some point throughout their history has practiced humane methods of slaughtering animals. As opposed to corporations, that's a different matter as (I agree with you on this) that animals are slaughtered inhumanely
