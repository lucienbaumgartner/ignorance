Thanks as always for your thoughtful reply! ❤️ Those are great observations and as I know this person very well, I'd say they're pretty accurate. The self value comment is especially on point, I think. This person is still very much on a journey of self-discovery in their life and I think they're only now starting to realize how important it is to not only value oneself but to find or carve your own identity.

I can confirm that the relationship between the birth parents was (and, quite frankly, continues to be) strained, despite the fact they haven't been together for almost 34 years.

This person definitely struggles with most of their relationships and I would describe them as socially awkward and unaware of how socially awkward they are lol.
