When i was younger a few years ago, about 17/18 i took stoicism really serious and maybe misunderstood it.

I went to the extreme of not showing any emotion ever  even at critical moments. 

One time my little baby sister got shot into her left eye with a softair by accident from my little brother.

She cried like crazy and had to be taken to a hospital. She ended up having an operation and took permanent damage on that eye.

Everybody who was present was in panic. Some cried and others were furious. Angry and sad.

I didnt show any emotional reaction at all. I said: „That already happened, we cannot change that incident“ 

I tried to calm the others down and direct their attention to something else since there was nothing we could do after we brought her to the hospital.

I was called cold-hearted and ignorant of the feelings of others more often than i can remember. Older family members called me a robot without feelings.

That obviously hurt me but according to stoicism i didnt express it.

Do i think that it was the right thing to be and act? 

Seriously, i still dont know. 

What i know is that this behavior helped me solve problems others had to struggle alot for and gained me the respect of others in different aspects. People knew i am reliable and consistent.

On the other hand i had the feeling i was not a person to have alot of fun with hanging around.

Over a longer period of time that made me feel isolated, lonely and insufficient in certain social aspects of life.

Today i would probably prefer a middle-way that also enables emotional communication and connection to other people while still having your emotions under control.

Finding and especially maintaining that middle a hard task tho.
