I'm going to reply vaguely because I don't know how to censor on mobile but ...

I think alot of times in stories we as the reader have a wealth of knowledge that isn't within the purview of the characters and we need to take that into consideration, especially with the characters mentioned. 

More over, hustles/cons/scams/bluffs etc... work not necessarily because people are ignorant or naive (although it certainly helps) but because they want it or terrified of it. Those two characters were the perfect people to get hustled, excessively high stakes, naive and ignorant of their environment and way our of their perspective leagues.
