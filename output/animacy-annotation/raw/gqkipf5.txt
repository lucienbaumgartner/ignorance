How do you detoxify? I've played 2000+ tank games and got abused by MMs over the years, but the worst abuse just happened earlier. A Lesley locked in Mythic and gave me death threats all game for not babysitting her gold lane. She and Silvanna from enemy team sent horrible messages even after the game. 

I didn't mute because that time, I felt nothing, too focused on the match.  But afterwards, I think my peace of my just went down. I think on how people can be so horrible and ignorant of their stupidy at the same time.
