I always side with the victims and I understand why the show is problematic because it is and there’s no denying it but...

I do feel iffy about heavy accusations thrown at the cast. The producers, writers and etc. definitely deserve what’s already coming and what’s gonna come to them because everything about this is just messed up but I just don’t want to conclude that everyone involved is either a right wing supporter or very ignorant and greedy.

I hope you understand that as a fan, it’s hard to accept the possibility of the artist you admire as someone who has the capability to be the kind of person.

Let me reiterate, I’m a 100% with the victims because there are no holes at all when it comes to them but with the cast members being okay with everything, I’m not so sure.

I mean, is there any possibility that the cast members were given a less problematic script to bait them into auditioning and once they were in, and the real script was revealed, the contract made it near to impossible to back out so they had no choice?

I know this was never about Jisoo but I don’t think it’s right to throw heavy accusations left and right.

I guess this is just wishful thinking but does anybody feel the same?

Downvote me but at least converse with me because I really don’t know how to feel about this situation. Everybody does deserve the harshest backlash if they were right wing supporters or ignorant and greedy people but how are we so sure about that we’re treating it like it’s not a fact and not just an assumption?
