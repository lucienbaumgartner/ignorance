People who are schizophrenic are rarely even aware of the possibility. They are unaware of the things they hear/see/feel being delusional and unaware of the idea that it could be delusional. So by being so aware of the idea it could be, essentially means it's not schizophrenia.

Anxiety however? Very possible depending on case. Since I was put on BusPar my anxiety and tinnitus have gotten much better.
