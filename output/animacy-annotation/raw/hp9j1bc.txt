I have always felt like this in fact I didn't even somewhat fit in till I starting smoking pot then realized that I was still invisible the one person I was always invisible to my dad he introduced me to harder drugs as time went on I am a Virgo, PTSD, depression and anxiety I have analyzed all aspects of my life to realize that i have never been anyone nor  will I ever be anyone, and I don't want to see what I see anymore I want to be ignorant and happy lol you know what I mean
