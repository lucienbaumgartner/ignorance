If you actually think this is of ALL Republicans, this is the problem with our country. Making generalizations about millions of people is what causes more issues within our society. 

They aren't forced pregnancy, anti-voting rights, pro-school shootings, evangelical nationalists or insurrectionists. 

No one is pro school shootings. Thats a silly take on this. 

No one is forcing people to get pregnant. Maybe you meant forcing to remain pregnant?

I'm not sure how Rs are anti-voting rights. All the ones I know are pro-citizen only voting Maybe, but not anti-voting rights. 

Maybe some are evangelical, but thats a small subset. 

There are millions of Republicans in this country and a couple hundred are insurrectionists. Thats not even close to making an over arching generalization. Every R I know thinks Jan 6th was reprehensible. 


This as ridiculous as the alt-right saying all Dems are pro-violence, pro-rioting, pro-socialism, pro-complete open borders, pro-drug, pro-salvery in other countries, anti-religion, anti-national security and identity, anti-personal responsibility, anti-work etc.

Anyone who holds these types of ideologies are small sub groups within a larger group. Lumping them all together is short-sighted and ignorant of what people really think. Having discussions with those of differing view points is how people either solidify their own beliefs or how minds are changed. 

It's talk like this that turns moderates away.
