Be proud of who you are, sure. But it's important to realize that Pride month is meant as a celebration of orientations that have traditionally been oppressed, put down, and excluded. 

You don't show up at someone else's birthday party and make a point of telling everyone that your birthday is next week. You just celebrate that person's birthday with them. Or you don't show up. 

And typically people understand that it's, at minimum, rude to respond to Pride month with pride in the thing that has always been accepted, and its typically pretty fair to assume that the person doing it is, at best, rude and unaware, and at worst, homophobic and trying to make a point.
