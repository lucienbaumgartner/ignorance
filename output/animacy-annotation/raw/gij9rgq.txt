Staffords on course rules and courtesy signage featured a picture of Brodie, seemingly referring to/calling out those who joined the sport in his footsteps and are seen as loud, obnoxious, and unaware of the common courtesies of DG as they are primarily newcomers. Basically making a jab at Brodie or those that seem to personify his online personality. Very overblown and overgeneralized in both ends tbh, and McBeth and Brodie’s public reactions to it only further create drama where there really isn’t any. If that’s the first time someone has talked shit about Brodie, I’d be surprised. As if he hasnt endured worse in ultimate or just in life in general. While it is pretty far off base to call all disrespectful newcomers “Brodies,” it’s really not the worst thing I’ve seen in a dg course
