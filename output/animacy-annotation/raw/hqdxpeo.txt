&gt;Most feminists that i have spoke to have been against the type of KillAllMen ideology that seems to plague the actual feminists who are trying to make a real difference and find real change.

Most of the feminists are misandrists(man haters). Misandry is endemic in feminism.

When it comes to misandry, you can divide all feminists into four groups:

1. Feminists that claim misandry does not exist. These are the largest majority in feminism. They go out of their way to trivialise and dismiss sexism against men.
2. Feminists that claim misandry is good for society. These are the second largest majority in feminism. They are usually extremely, overtly misandric.
3. Feminists that discourage misandry for selfish reasons. They fear that it might alienate people from feminism. Most of these feminists hate men, but they lack the courage to  admit to their hate in public.
4. The noobs/ignorants. These are those that are new to feminism suckered into the movement by feminist euphemisms 'equality', 'choice', 'freedom' etc. and have yet to be totally corrupted by this ideology. They are rare to non-existent.

So the good majority of feminists are misandrists.

Feminist theorists have written many books promoting misandry, going so far as arguing its an essential part of feminism without which feminism can never achieve success. Take for example one of the most iconic feminist theorists of all time, **Joanna Russ**. In an article authored by herself in 1972 titled **The New Misandry** published in a leading, multi-Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper, she promotes misandry/man hatred and violence against men to feminists/women.

She writes:

**'Gee, isn't it awful for women to hate men?'**

'**People even talk as if hating men meant murdering all of them right away**…Man haters are people who feel a certain way (not even all the time, believe it or not); they aren’t instant murderesses'.

'**To condemn misandry is to have higher standards for women than for men'**

'**Feminists who want feminism to be respectable are afraid the “radicals” will go “too far.” That is, man-hating gives the show away** \- **we aren’t merely liberals; our complaints are drastic; we’re demanding not asking; we’re breaking the mould in the most thorough way possible; we really mean it**.’ Essentially, what she is saying here is that those in feminism who oppose misandry oppose it not because they think it's wrong, but because they are afraid it will expose the reality of feminism to the world. Additionally, she says that feminists really mean their misandry. She goes on in the article to celebrate Valerie Solanas' Society for Cutting Up Men Manifesto and for her attempt to murder men.

Joanna Russ wasn't just an average feminist. She was a mover and shaker in feminism and in this aforementioned article she not only promotes misandry but she actually promotes the murder of men.

The face behind the hate - Joanna Russ:

So yeah, misandry is a very serious and very real problem in feminism, a violent murderous ideology, a huge risk to all men, everywhere.

P.S. This is nothing. I am just touching the tip of the iceberg that is misandry in feminism.

&gt;I've learned that a lot of those types of people use a common strategy of saying very extreme thing just to get attention, just long enough to drag in victims. It's very similar to what a lot of cults use, and it can be devastating for a movement such as feminism.

I am anti-feminist. I have been researching feminism for close to fifteen years and I have been an anti-feminist for just over ten years now.

I am an anti-feminist because I oppose all of the core principles on which feminism is based as well as most of its peripheral concepts.

Most people are followers led in their beliefs like cattle by their instincts, instincts often disconnected from the reality of the ideology to which they subscribe. They all share one common characteristic, near total ignorance. So, I do not ever judge ideologies by the often ignorant and unreliable opinions and actions of their followers, but by their dogma as it is defined by its most celebrated and widely accepted theorists. It is these theorists in feminism and their ideas that I find highly flawed and destructive.

&gt;I have met plenty of "feminists" who subscribe to these hateful ideologies as well, but being that i consider myself a feminist as well, it makes me seem a lot less foreign, and despite all their hatred for men that they talk about on the internet, they see this as a reason to not hate me in particular, as if i am "one of the good ones."

To be honest, you're being used by them for their cause i.e female supremacy. They see you as an useful idiot.

&gt;I feel that this is the best possible way we can take back the feminist movement and drive it into a direction for equality.

There's nothing you can take back. The feminist movement was hateful since its inception.
