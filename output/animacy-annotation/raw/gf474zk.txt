yes! i agree tbh and i’m not offended because at the end of the day this is JUST a burger joint. it’s really not that deep but some people get wayyyy too into it. like most of us wouldn’t choose to go to work rather than staying home so let’s just make it a fun experience you know? i wouldn’t say they are being mean but they come off HELLA condescending. i’m new but i’m not stupid and unaware of social cues. it sucks :/
