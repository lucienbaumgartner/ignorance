There were girls in the boy scouts when I was a teenager, and a boy scout, I swear these idiots have all these hard line opinions about shit they know nothing about and have never researched or even googled. It's fucking stupid. 

If your totally unaware and unaffiliated with BSA, which is what it's been called for decades, why the fuck do you care what they do with thier organization.
