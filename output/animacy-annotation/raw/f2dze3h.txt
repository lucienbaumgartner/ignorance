The first bullet point of your "argument" is completely fake and has been debunked countless times. Think about it idiot - even if that were true, it would be impossible to know about cases that where the LEO wasn't convicted or at least charged, which is no where even remotely close to 40%. It's hilariously ironic that you commented this spam about "cop propoganda" on a post calling  you out for being irrational. How do you get so naive and ignorant that you can't see the irony?
