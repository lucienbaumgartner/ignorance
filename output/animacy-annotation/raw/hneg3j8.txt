You don’t lie but you don’t pick the dumbest possible language, you don’t pick academic language that assumes the people you are taking to already have years of built up understanding and you don’t scream at people that they are vile racists and/or idiots if they don’t immediately understand. 

You also realize that while some disturbing number of people are extremely racist and aware of it, some disturbing number of people are extremely racist and unaware of it, and some number of people can’t be bothered to care about racism … the small number of people left are all you need to start swinging not just elections but the way society works.
