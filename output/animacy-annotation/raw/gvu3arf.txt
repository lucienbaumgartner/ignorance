You’re really that dense? If they release the script of the movie before the movie then it would ruin the efforts of everyone they brought into it. You’re completely incompetent and ignorant of how films are made and the process to make them. Keeping up communications with fans is what they did but they’re not asking them what the fans want them to change in the middle of making the fucking movie. You don’t just get a budget and everything if you have no script or general plot concept. And you want them to uproot that all because the fans said so? 

You’re the worst part of the community. The people that are so quick to say things are bad but when you open your mouth to suggest solutions they’re so mindblowingly incompetent. 

Doubt yourself for once and try to see another perspective because you being this confident in your ignorance to film making is such a fucking tragedy.
