I'm posting this after hours of this text happening because I still wanted to make sure he was actually fine n not lying about it being an April fools joke to stop me from actually calling the police...

He's completely fine and he did do this as a late April fools joke with a few friends (atleast that I know personally... He probably did it to more)...

As a person who has gone through such thoughts and actual attempts I find it very offensive and ignorant of how sad suicide actually is... This is sheer ignorance and assholeness... I'd never wish suicide upon anyone ever because it's one of the most fucked up things... If any of you guys are having suicidal thoughts please reach out to either me, someone you trust, or a suicidal hotline in your region (it's one Google search away) and get some help and therapy... Your life is worth much much more than you think it actually is at this point in time... And don't waste your value and potential... Have a great day, take care ♥️
