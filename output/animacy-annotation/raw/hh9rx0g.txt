Health reasons were a part of my reason to get vaccinated, however I mostly did it because I understand that if I become infected there's a 48 hour window where I may be infectious and unaware of my symptoms.

In that 48 hours I may infect multiple people which will keep the virus growing and impact society through restrictions if everyone passes it on to more than 1 person.

It would be irrational not to do my part in helping society get back to normal by reducing my risk of becoming a viral vector. It's irrational not to take the minor medicine that reduces the risk of becoming a vector.
