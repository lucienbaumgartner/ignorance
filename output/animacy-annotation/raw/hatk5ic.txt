Try to find the tiniest thing to appreciate or be grateful for. For me, nature really helps. I’ve been depressed my whole life and just getting out of bed is a miserable endeavor. But when I’m feeling really hopeless, I go outside, and stand in the grass barefoot. Feel the earth on your feet. Look up to the sky and take a deep breath. It activates a primal feeling that’s very under appreciated in today’s artificial world. I looked down and saw an ant crawling through the grass. I squatted to get a closer look. I watched as this little guy climbed between the blades. It was so tiny and unaware of the world around it and all it’s problems, something about it was so beautiful I started to cry. I also have a dog and she’s my favorite thing in the universe. When I get home she runs to me, jumps on me, and cries with joy. It’s an amazing feeling, animals are so innocent and the bond between two different animals is one of the purest things in life. It makes me want to be here.
