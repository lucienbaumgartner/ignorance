What are you allowed in your yard? If you want something one step above a pit fire mound, I was able to use fire pit stones four feet high, and a heavy duty grill. I used flattened stovepipe and a BBQ lid to close off the top once I "loaded" it. I fired it with poplar, then slowly added birch, through a gap I left near the bottom. 

Fair warning I am completely novice and ignorant of what people expect from a kiln. All I can say is it exceeded my expectations for something I originally built to slow roast pork. I can't measure the temperature, etc. It's better than a pit dug in your lawn.
