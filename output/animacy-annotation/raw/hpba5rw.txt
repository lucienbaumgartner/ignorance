I'm gonna be honest, you people are so weird and your own comments are actually ignorant and xenophobic. This is from 2021.. "last year" therefore is literally last year: the coronavirus year 2020. You know, the year thar severely disrupted international travel...

Germany has a higher percentage of foreign born people than America. In fact, a lot of European countries [rank higher](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/foreign-born-population/indicator/english_5a368e1b-en).

It's the country that attracts most migrants right after America and more than America per capita. In some years, [Germany took more migrants than the US](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/10-countries-that-take-the-most-immigrants?slide=11) in total numbers.

You've probably never been to Germany or Europe and just making these things up because you don't like their politics or something stupid like that. If you think there's an anti-American sentiment out there: I guarantee you, it's because of your personality, not your nationality.
