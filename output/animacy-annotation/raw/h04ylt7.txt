That’s true to an extent, and especially at certain newspapers, but that’s not why you see clickbait inflammatory headlines and empty articles that just have 5 tweets in it and a little fluff around it. That’s what this conversation started with and what I was mainly talking about. 

But if you want to talk about bias in news media and lack of criticism of those they’re supposed to hold accountable, we can do that too. The first misconception people have about media is that there is such a thing as unbiased news, that doesn’t exist. Different outlets will have different biases, and will critique different people. A smart reader will recognize those biases and look at how different outlets cover the same topics, and there will always be somebody covering just about anything. Bias is not an inherently bad thing. To act as though this is something new or unusual is naive and unaware of the history of news. Certainly recently there has been an increase in the concentration of ownership, but this is nothing new. 

There are also plenty of small independent newspapers and journalists who are not beholden to a billionaire. 

Bottom line is that bias for or against anyone will always exist in any media and it will undoubtedly change who they will hold accountable, but to say that this is a huge problem seems to me to be a sign of laziness and lack of awareness.
