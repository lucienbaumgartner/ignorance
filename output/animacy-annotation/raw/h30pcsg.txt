It's nobody's business but mine tbh. Yes, I've smoked weed every day for nearly 7 years and agree it's changed my mental state, but if I DON'T smoke, I risk having a PTSD attack or panic attacks. I've also been diagnosed with depression at age 9, my life sucked and still continues to suck regardless of my mental state caused by weed smoking. I need to smoke weed if I'm going to contribute to society. Honestly can't do vaporizers or edibles and medications I've tried have made me want to kms. I also have OCD which in one area affects the way I do routines and the act of lighting up a bowl every hour or so is engraved into my daily routines so hard to the point where I think I'd need behavioral therapy or some sort of brain rewiring to be able to stop lol. I agree with everything this post says but sometimes it's not that bad of a thing,  I personally LIKE how different my brain became after smoking regularly. I used to be spastic and unaware of a lot of things, got made fun of and misunderstood constantly. Weed let me think about my life, my issues, myself, how I'm perceived, and be able to work out a way I can represent myself in a way thats more calming and enticing rather than loud and off-putting while also FORCING me to be more chill LOL. I dunno I'm wake-and-bake rambling I'll see myself out
