I posted in some other locations that I would consider a USA win Miracle on Ice II.  But that was base only watching the US team play.  They barely made it to the Gold game, they lost to Russia and Russia got destroyed by CAN.

As soon as that one hit the pipe, I knew it was over for the Canadians.  Those kids kept charging and it seemed like the Canadians just looked tired and unaware of what was happening.  The commentator even mentioned that sometimes the puck bounces the other way for the goalie.  Not last night.

I am proud of "our" boys.  I am embarrassed that I thought they had ZERO chance.
