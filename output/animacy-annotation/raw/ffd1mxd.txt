Inflation is important, but so is the rate of increase on that debt. The article even discusses how Bush and Obama both added more to the debt than Trump has. Even if we take a second term into account, Trump's debt increase is still less than the others. That's what's truly important. The rate at which the debt is increasing or decreasing. Nobody expected a debt to just suddenly start decreasing. That's not how things work. If the rate at which the debt is increasing starts to fall then that's the realistic first step in eliminating debt entirely. 

This article, knowingly or not, is reporting on a Trump accomplishment, not failure. And of course r/politics ignorantly eats it up, blissfully unaware and unable to discern for themselves what is actually going on. Not only that, but they do it *knowing* that Obama increased the debt more while defending his decision to do so. r/politics is really flip-flopping here.
