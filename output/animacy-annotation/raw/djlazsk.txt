There was once a site that you needed to get an interview to get in and once in you needed to seed. It was said everything was on there even old and not very popular stuff but it was shut down about 6 months ago.

The community may have made a new site or someone may have tried to replicate it like yify but I am unaware and other than that site there wasn't anything beyond the basic Piratebay style sites.
