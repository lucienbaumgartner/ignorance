I do, then I also see people who act selfish yet say that they are selfless people... ðŸ˜‘ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤” makes me wonder:
1. Am I really selfish, do I actually do enough for myself?
2. If I am selfish, does it matter if Iâ€™m not harming anyone?
3. Whatâ€™s the worst, not selfish but think youâ€™re selfish, selfish and aware of it, or selfish and unaware of it, or selfish and think that youâ€™re godâ€™s gift sent to help others? Or or, selfish and think that youâ€™re godâ€™s gift sent to help other and other people are not seeing through the bluff!
