&gt;Meanwhile your country is built upon liberalism, secularism, and democracy

What is wrong with them and why should we avoid them like they are awful things?

&gt;You live in a society where everyone speaks Turkish, looks Turkish, and dresses Turkish but pro-democracy, pro-liberalism, and pro-secularism. If you are ideologically Western (Turkey is) then by definition you are Westernized.

I kinda agree with that so how is it sucking western cock? 

&gt;Ataturk even chose the Latin alphabet for the language. I'm not saying that Turks should have kept the Arabic one, but you don't get to change from one foreign alphabet to another only to talk down to the one used prior when you don't ever use the original alphabet.

So changing to Latin script is no worse than staying in Arabic script by this logic am i right? If yes then why so much fuss about it? Staying Arabic script would be considered as sucking Arab cock with very same logic.


&gt;West's success is built off of its ideologies and not its conquest and subjugation of nations that continues on today is delusional and unaware of the historical truths surrounding this.

I completely agree with you but i don't understand what are you trying to tell me.

&gt;If you don't want to be Western then drop the democracy, liberalism, and secularism and either return to Tengriism or Islamic governance

See? You guys always do like this. Secularism, democracy=sucking western cock but Islamic governance=completely not sucking Arab cock.
You have to be consistent in your arguments to convince me. Apply your logic to both sides "equally" please.
