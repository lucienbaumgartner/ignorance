what if she's actually anti vegan and clowns herself around the internet, to give vegans a bad name? i just refuse to believe that people can be as genuinely tone deaf, toxic, and unaware of themselves as vegan teacher. 

if that's true, then she's doing a good job. I've never cared for vegans, but she makes me hate them.
