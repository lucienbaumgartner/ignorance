Holy shit no you're NTA and I'm sorry you're still going thru stupid stuff like this. They are being racist and ignorant of the experience of American black people. Not all the native Americans were exterminated. Many were enslaved and had children with African slaves. Along with a fun little piece of racist history called night time integration that I won't even explain you can look it up but promise you because of it many American black people have a high percentage of European dna as well. So yes everyone can be harmed by overexposure to the sun.
