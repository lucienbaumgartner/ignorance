Your suggested alternative is direct democracy. I'm going to ignore the fact that direct democracy is a poor political system, and just ask how you plan to establish this direct democracy. Do you expect a constitutional amendment? Is Congress going to overwhelming vote to fire themselves or something?

Your perspective on welfare is so childish and ignorant that I won't bother addressing it. Just look at other nations with far more robust welfare systems than ours that are doing just fine (actually better).
