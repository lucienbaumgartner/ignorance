here's one, in full (the writer is a Marine Todd who wants to give Julian protection and invite him to speak at a campus alt-right debate club), accompanied by a link to an article where Julian says he's not racist:

In case people actually care about what he has to say about the matter after the Butler incident. Right or wrong, this is the natural by-product of having overly educated young minds with little-to-no real world experience get intellectually subjugated to this post-modernist, identity politics based, nonsense many espouse on campus.

As a fellow Columbia student, I support his right to free speech. While I don’t agree with his actions wholly, I don’t condemn him for them. He deserves a voice too. Whether or not we agree with him. I don’t believe him to be a Racist. Just severely socially-unaware and less than prudent in this situation. Further, I believe him to be a part of a growing population of brilliant young minds that don’t believe in “righting the wrongs of the past” by admitting they have “privilege” anymore than one of their peers. We’re ALL privileged to be at Columbia University, lest not forget that.

“This movement of inquiry must be directed towards humanization—the people’s historical vocation. The pursuit of full humanity, however, cannot be carried out in isolation or individualism, but only in fellowship and solidarity; therefore it cannot unfold in the antagonistic relations between oppressors and oppressed. No one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so. Attempting to be more human, individualistically, leads to ­having more, egotistically, a form of dehumanization. Not that it is not ­fundamental to have in order to be human. Precisely because it is necessary, some men’s having must not be allowed to constitute an obstacle to others’ having, must not consolidate the power of the ­former to crush the latter.”
