I've been homeless, addicted, and mentally ill all at the same time. And absolutely none of it was a relief from anything. What you really need is to be gentle with and take care of yourself. Do you really want to be struggling for every meal? Dirty, tired and unaware of any safe places to sleep? Treated like garbage, with nothing to do all day because you're probably not working?

I understand where your question comes from, the emotions and probable mental exhaustion that makes you wonder these things. But please, take it from someone who's been down really bad: it's not the carefree lifestyle you're envisioning.
