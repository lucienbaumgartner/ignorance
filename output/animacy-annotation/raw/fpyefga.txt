Mostly along the lines of as a leader you want to get bad news before it becomes mega holy shit bad news. I'm sure it's happened with kings, emperors, and dictators in the past, but can't recall anything specific. If you kill the messenger, the only intel you get will be good news, so as war blazes around you and enemies are at your gates, you're blissfully unaware and unprepared because everyone who would normally tell you these things are busy flattering you instead.
