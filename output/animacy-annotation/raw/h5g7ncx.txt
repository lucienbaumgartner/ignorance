Wow that's a rollercoaster of events, sorry to hear about the situation you're in atm. 

Before I comment anything, I'll say that I've never been in anything like your situation and that I'm agnostic.

I 100% agree with your sister. Your husband deserved more than yelling. He openly joked about your declining health and claimed it might even be beneficial to him rather than worrying about you. Regardless of whatever religion such a person has, that kind of thinking is incredibly harmful in a relationship.

I get that praying for others can be a form of trying to make things better and I respect that. But I'd imagine you'd been praying for your life to get better ever since the pregnancies didn't work out. In that case I find it harmful and ignorant of your parents and church circle to expect you to not try and take control of your life and instead want you to return to your husband, who's clearly outed that he only cares about how you can be useful to him.

I'm not sure what your relationship with your sister is, but judging from what you typed she seems to be good to stick around. She seems to care about you and wanting to help you. Don't go back to your husband until you've got the divorce people and info with you.

I hope stuff will work out for you!
