At the top of my head, I recall 2 things that were cut:

1.  In one entry, I mentioned that I went to a local Asian shopping center.  I also mentioned that I dreaded going there because the drivers in the parking lot are so ridiculous and unaware.  That part was cut.  FWIW, I also am Asian.

2. In another, I mentioned that I was building a particular LEGO Star Wars set.  That set is the character Boba Fett's ship, named Slave 1.  That part was cut too.

Whoever edited my MD clearly had an extreme SJW agenda that day.
