Afghanistan citizens want the U.S there because leaving means the Taliban will take control of the country immediately. Abruptly leaving with no deal is like abandoning the Kurds on a larger scale. Millions of citizens will be left to be ruled over by the Taliban. I don’t know why people on this sub frame it as if the citizens aren’t welcoming the U.S, they are.

Edit: your view is so insanely reductionist and ignorant that I had to re-read it a few times. Surely people don’t actually think this way when it comes to foreign policy/geopolitics right?
