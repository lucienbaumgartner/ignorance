Maybe you can ask him about his hobbies and see if you share similar interests - if so, and if said interest is cooperative (video games, sports), ask him if he'd like to spend some time with you! Otherwise, I don't think there's much else... Knowing a 19 year-old mind (I'm 19 myself, haha ðŸ˜‚), he's probably unaware and blissfully oblivious of your interest and is mainly focused on his end of the relationship (being with you and stuff). 
I wish you the best of luck! (also, ask him about Dominican cuisine, believe me, it's good stuff ðŸ’—)
