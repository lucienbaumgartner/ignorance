I never thought she was a mean girl! I thought she was socially unaware and bratty/loud. I though Jessalyn was doing her a disservice by homeschooling her because she stuck out so strongly with the other girls (again, socially). Actually I think Dance Moms was a great decision for them, mostly to wear some of the edges off on Jojoâ€™s personality.
