I have had so many days constantly getting stuck behind a slow fast lane driver I get why people get so angry. 

What pisses me off is how unaware and inconsiderate they are to just block the road. I have seen some that will purposely block the fast lane then once someone tries to pass them on the right they then get in the right lane, slow down so they are now even with the person in the left lane and then keep speed with the person in the fast lane.

Even if you dont mean to do this you are still an asshole for be so unaware and inconsiderate. Just let people pass
