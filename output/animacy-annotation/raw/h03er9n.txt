I had some tires pushing 10 yrs old. They looked fine and when you drove it they felt fine. Until you hit the highway and those dam things chunked off so bad even the metal layer came up and started to work its way off. Luckily we were headed to a tire place for new ones but i was blown away at the way they just started to fall apart and still they looked new!! Very bad news to someone unsuspecting and unaware of the situation.  Had id been going 80 and it did that who knows what would of happened.
