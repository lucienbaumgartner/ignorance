"I would die for that country!" Keep avoiding masks/social distancing and then yes, yes you will. You'll die fighting against the very people trying to keep you and your family, and your friends safe. Not only will you die, but you will kill the very people closest to you because you are so selfish and ignorant that you can't even put on a mask and avoid large gatherings. This line of thinking is why tens of thousands of people are dying, and will continue to die because so many people in this country simply don't care. If they really loved this country they would help keep it safe from the pandemic. But they don't love this country. They only ever love themselves.
