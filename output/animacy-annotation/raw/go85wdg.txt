As a minor I wouldn’t challenge them or discuss anything of importance with them. Just let it roll and change the subject, they won’t listen and you’ll make yourself crazy. The more you fight them the harder they’ll be on you. So just agree and leave or change the subject. Get that education and recognize that’s what will save you. Get a part time job and start saving and get busy figuring a way out. I’m a parent and I can tell you that you need to protect yourself and keep your home life as harmonious as possible because your parents sound at best unaware and ignorant and they won’t thank you for disagreeing with them. Look at them and remember to fight for your education so you don’t end up like them.
