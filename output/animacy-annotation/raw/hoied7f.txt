You are very confused and ignorant of history. In soviet Russia they slaughtered orthodox priests for being Christian. This is a well established fact. Further, you have confused a stern rebuke with hatefulness. I have no hate in my heart for you, but I certainly think you’re dangerously misguided. 

You’re obviously OP’s finance, yes? It’s no mystery why OP’s parents do not respect your view. To earn respect you must be respectable.
