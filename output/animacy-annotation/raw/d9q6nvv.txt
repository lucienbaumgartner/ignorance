You are misinterpreting the quote.  He's not trying to fix the problem by making people more informed.  He wants to make sure the citizenry remains 'unaware and compliant'.  This person, the person he said this to, and everyone around them is actively trying to demean the democracy.

This person doesn't want you to have a real choice in democracy.  They want you to FEEL like you're making a choice...but you're really not.  Similar to what happened in the democratic primary.  There wasn't an actual choice.  Whether you voted for Hillary or Bernie, it didn't matter.  Hillary was selected to win a long time ago. 

Trump has exposed a massive amount of media collusion with the democratic party and specifically Hillary's campaign.  If the entire media is colluding to take the side of one candidate, guess who you're probably going to side with?  That candidate.  It's not a real choice because they are controlling the information you see.  So you feel informed, but you are only informed on what they show you.

They didn't show you that quote did they ;)

That is why Trump has traction, because people see this problem(among others) and want to fix it.
