The people of this thread are focused on war captives and thinking of torture when the word abuse is mentioned. IMO this event you provided doesn't compare to POW abuse. As a nurse, I agree that engraving a reminder of war into a fixture of an elderly man's mouth appears as both psychological and elder abuse. However, the article explains that the phrase not only was written in Morse code, but the subject was unaware and unaffected. Unethical? Yes. Falls into the category of psychological *abuse*?... the dude didn't even know it was there.
