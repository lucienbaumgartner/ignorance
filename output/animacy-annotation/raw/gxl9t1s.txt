&gt; Absolutely. 

[Guffaw](https://ballotpedia.org/Nondelegation_doctrine). Both our founding document and [SCOTUS](https://ballotpedia.org/Field_v._Clark) disagree with your extremely liberal understanding of constitutional law. 

&gt; or that the Secretaries of State that made the changes in question are so stupid and ignorant of their jobs that they would do something unconstitutional or illegal during an important election with national ramifications.

Your first mistake was assuming that politicians in general wouldn't violate the constitution, despite various unconstitutional laws having existed in our nation for nearly a hundred years (see: literally every law restricting the right to own arms). Politicians try and do get away with as much as they can at any given opportunity, all of which have "national ramifications".

Your second mistake was having an unwarranted sense of self-importance.
