Nope. Im afraid that really makes no sense as an explanation of that tweet. Theres an easy test, bearing in mind that the ratio of deaths between Palestinians and Israelis is about 10 to 1 ask yourself whether a similar sounding tweet about 'Jews' would be racist or just 'factual'? Personally I'd say racist. And for both versions,  generalised,  simplistic and unaware of nuanced details to the point of stupidity. Personally the only thing I know about B.S is his reputation for underhand debating practices and embarrassing himself on the BBC , I have no knowledge or opinion of whether he actually uses hate speech or not.
