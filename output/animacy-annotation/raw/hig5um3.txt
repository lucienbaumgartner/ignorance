He should be charged for the firearm

These were not normal circumstances when you have the leadership of the city bought and paid for

No Police intervention when they need the chaos to keep increasing so legislation passes

Anyone who stands up for communities they care about are vilified

Not saying he is innocent, but I would have protected my friends and family with a stick if I had to

Many of you keyboard warriors know nothing of loyalty to a community or even empathy, for that matter

Bunch of nihilistic sociopaths who want to convince the entire population the world is ending so we give everything over to the wealthiest among us so they SAVE US

Oh do please save us from the catastrophic event coming, while you all keep pouring money into making sure it happens

Heat it up to watch it all ice over

Would take much longer naturally, but those at the top want a reset of significant impact

Heinrich Event of 2022

Hope I'm wrong, but hey...better to be prepared than scared

How can all of you fight to give all power and resources to the very corporations who have destroyed societies around the world?

Disgusting and ignorant of reality
