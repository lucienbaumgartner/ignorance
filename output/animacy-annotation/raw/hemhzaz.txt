No worries for the "ramble," I appreciate you rambling (hah), I don't consider it rambling though of course.

It eases me to hear your perspective on the topic and how your point of view has changed over time.

I think my point of view changed when I was around the age of 16. Once I knew what it all entailed and that the animals being killed are literally conscious and sentient beings as we all are, the realization of how bad things are started becoming more apparent to me. I, at one point, had the same thought process many of these people do, when I was a child, and looking back at it, I genuinely feel embarrassed by how childish I was for being so selfish and ignorant of the severity of it all.

Anyways, everything aside, it's like arguing with children. They will ignore your points, use faulty reasoning, rely on beliefs (Maybe even religious ones) and say things that counter their own arguments unknowingly as means of justification for their harmful *desires,* it genuinely blows my mind how different some humans can be and yet we're the same species. Hah
