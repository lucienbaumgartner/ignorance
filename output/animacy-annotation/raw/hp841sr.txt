&gt; lol are you to believe that Respawn has not to answer to EA when doing stuff.

It's funny how you just keep repeating this same incorrect assertion over and over and over again, never once stopping to listen or learn or ask for genuine clarification regarding how it does actually work. 

&gt;Sad that apparently "older" and "matured" people need the use for rather disgracing words instead of having a solid and respectful discussion

How do you expect that respectful discussion to occur, exactly? You are *objectively* wrong about how the real world works. You are expressing beliefs based on pure ignorance that would be impossible to hold if you properly educated yourself. I am willing to explain these things to you but you are not willing to listen. You want only to believe that your ignorant and wrong assumptions are somehow true, but they're not. In short: you are the only disrespectful one here. If you'd shut the fuck up for a moment, acknowledge your misconceptions, and be open to learning something new, this would've been a very brief and very polite conversation.

Redditors always do this. They always say the dumbest shit on the planet, repeatedly double down on it, argue with anyone who tries to teach them anything, then freak out when someone is anything less than infinitely nice. Why? What makes you this way? Why do you think this is an acceptable way to behave?

Answer me this: who taught you that a company in EA's position has day-to-day oversight of Respawn? Who taught you that every decision Respawn makes has to be approved by EA? Hm? Where did you get this information from? Why do you believe it so strongly?
