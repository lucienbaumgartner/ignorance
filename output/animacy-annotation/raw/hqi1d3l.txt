i'm replying to a comment that i only just saw... there is nothing out of the ordinary about that? i don't use reddit everyday and only just checked my notifications. if you are autistic then why did you just make an ableist comment to me? there are so many things wrong with the way you think but you are too ignorant and closed minded to listen so i can only hope that you'll come to your senses on your own, just like i did. your feelings of frustration with self diagnosers is totally valid and i had the same ones a little while ago so no hard feelings here, but i am asking you to please think before invalidating and excluding other people that haven't been lucky enough to receive diagnosis (mostly women)- and before making ableist comments to other autistic people who weren't as privileged as you are to have had a suitable school environment.
