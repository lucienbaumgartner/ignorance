I just don't think you realize the difference in scope between the problems here. To fix the problem in Seattle, just... make it easier to build more houses and denser housing. Gasp, you might even be forced to live in a building with other people! 

That's what my first cousins do in literally the most expensive city in the world (Zurich). Family of 6 lives in a fourplex. Sure, they had to pay close to 400k, but that's reasonably affordable. Every kid has their own room. It's not a mansion, but it's plenty big enough to raise a family in. And they get great schools, public transportation, and public parks. 

Contrast that with the problems in the rural south. Poor education. No high paying jobs. Terrible infrastructure. Hell, some places don't even get internet. Oh ya, and a significant portion of the population is so racist and ignorant that they prefer things this way. Oh but you can buy a mansion for 300k! So I guess it's worth it.
