So basically you’re saying she should’ve gotten over the very traumatic experience she just went through and any lingering feelings she’s having and just told you ASAP that she was raped because in the long run your feelings/trust matters more than her mental health? Matters more than her trauma? Wow. How utterly insensitive and ignorant of you. That’s not even an insult, it’s just fact, because you’re ignoring literally loads of empirical evidence that rape victims are traumatized far past the act itself. Rape victims often blame themselves for the assault, even though it’s not a rational thought, because they literally have no other way of dealing with the trauma. People have killed themselves after being raped. But yeah, she should’ve just gotten over it and told you right away. 

You’re invalidating literally thousands of rape victims by assuming it’s just easy as pie to tell their loved ones they were raped. With your reasoning, why do kids who are sexually abused by their family members not tell a family member they do trust and feel safe with? So the kids being raped by their sick family member are somehow betraying the trust of the family members who do love them? 

And it’s not an equal comparison to say rape and a family member dying are the same. They’re not. Rape is a very singular experience. Only the victim knows what they truly went through. Whereas with a family member dying quite almost anyone can related to losing a loved one. You cannot compare the two whatsoever. Can you say what it’s like to lose your family member? Probably. Can you say what it was like to be raped? No, not until you go through it yourself, so how about you don’t go assuming what mental state a victim is in in the days following the assault?
