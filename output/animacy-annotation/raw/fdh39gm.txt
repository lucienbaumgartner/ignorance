Lol. Actually I’m not married, no children, live on my own, and I’m in a healthy relationship with a partner who values me as an equal. I’m also someone with a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in psychology. I’ve worked as an LMFT for almost 5 years, mostly as a couples’ therapist, and now I’m working on a doctorate, also in psychology. I’ve worked with many many many couples that have highly similar dynamics to the one the OP described. And I can assure you that the majority of the time, a parent does not take their child and leave the other spouse at first provocation. This sounds like a classic case of a spouse who has put up with awful behavior from the other spouse for years and finally decided to do something about it after a “final straw” type of event. The flippant and dismissive way the OP describes the whole thing is the reason I suspect this. He sounds to be unaware, and oblivious. And not that it matters all that much, but the overwhelming majority of other commenters on here agree that this guy sounds like a lazy, entitled AH.
There is no information in what the OP said that would suggest the wife is entitled. Or a STAHM. Or lazy. My “judgement” of the OP was based on what he said, and my years of experience as a professional in the field of couples’ therapy told me there was far more at play here. So no, not fiction pulled from thin air or however you described it, just to vilify the husband and put the wife on a pedestal. It was conjecture posted in a non-professional, Internet forum, just for fun, like everyone else, but that conjecture was formed from my academic and professional experience. There are many tell-tale behavioral patterns in relationship dynamics that are observable in marriages, particularly those that yield children, and there’s clearly a potential pattern from years of poor behavior in the OP’s part present here.
Anyway, I won’t be responding to you if you choose to reply to this. Good bye.
