I do not agree with a single thing that is coming out of your mouth. You claim this scenario of yours will ‘correct’ the mother’s behaviour, in the sense of punishing her into not, what, having dementia? That’s cruel and ignorant of you. The idea of ‘corrective’ treatment is used as a cover for abuse of all kinds. 

You are arguing for elder abuse. 

I am clearly arguing against elder abuse.
