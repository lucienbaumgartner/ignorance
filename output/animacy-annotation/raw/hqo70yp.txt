Just ignoring the whole concept of science as a discipline that seeks truth. Science seeks facts, it seeks answers, and it only comes to a conclusion through the unbiased analyzing of facts/data. 

Science deniers would rather put their faith in pseudoscience bs that’s nearly always got ulterior political motives. Annoying that they also seem to be under the impression that science is inherently liberal or left leaning. They deny the truth by denying good, peer reviewed science  - which is literally based on nothing but data. 

So basically I’m led to believe they don’t care about the truth and at that point I’m led to believe that they are the most annoying bozo on the face of the planet. Ignorant and proud of it. It’s pathetic. And annoying!!!
