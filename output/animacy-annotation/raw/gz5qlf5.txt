Lol, you don't get to decide what opinions people can have. I can decide people are being petty and ignorant of all she did for people who were untouchables in that area. Her not giving painkillers to people who would have never gotten them doesn't take away their clothes, bed or food. She was only a net positive to them and it's only out of our extreme first world luxury that we can look down on the few things they didn't provide as though that negates everything they did.
