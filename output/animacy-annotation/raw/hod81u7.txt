It's highly debateable that even some people have 'no choice', especially in the context of the environment they are in, *but even supposing that were true* how does it legitimize or at least reasonably call into doubt the immorality of the action?  If you have to shoot an innocent person in the head in order to save yourself from a madman the choice to shoot that person would still be immoral, understanding the motivations behind the decision doesn't change that.

Don't call them needs, call them "wants", and especially call thieves what they are - they can then explain for themselves what they've done, defaulting to an assumption of need is foolish and ignorant of the reality behind the vast majority of thievery.
