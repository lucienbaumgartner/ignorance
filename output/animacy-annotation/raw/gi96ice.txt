&gt;I think the point is that if the Christian god exists, as described, he is good. I.e, the apple is yellow.

Perhaps I just don't understand the whole argument, but to me, this seems insufficient to conclude that I am talking about a different apple

It may in fact be yellow objectively, but I may have come to the conclusion that it was green using rational means such as comparing it's hue with that of grass or leaves, but I simply came to the wrong conclusion for whatever reason. Perhaps I am partially color-blind and unaware of that fact, but even though I am wrong in my belief about the qualities of the apple, I am still describing the same apple as you. Similarly, it would still be the same apple if you falsely claimed it was a pear. Just because we disagree about what someone or something is, doesn't mean we are talking about different people or objects.
