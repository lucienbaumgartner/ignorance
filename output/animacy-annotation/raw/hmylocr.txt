i think most people are extremely pro this, but i really wonder how likely this is to pass and be successful. it's very clear that most politicians are too old and ignorant of technology to really understand this issue. and then i wonder exactly how enforceable something like this is.

definitely hoping for the best, but when it comes to tech related issues such as these i'm not always too confident in their ability to enact real, meaningful, change.
