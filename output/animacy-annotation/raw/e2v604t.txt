I partly agree, but as a black person I also have to say that the proportions of people who do or say something racist and people who truly are racist are not as favorable as you make it sound. Nearly every white person I know (friends included) do racist things even when I would not consider the people themselves racist. For example, always explicitly mentioning the race of non-white people when they are telling a story about something even if that fact is irrelevant to the story (it's minor, but get's quite irritating after a while). But even the proportion of people who I would consider to *be* actually racist, not just blissfully unaware and mildly ignorant, is not that small. It's super subjective, but I'd say it's between one in three or maybe one in two.

I am not a women and my sense of what the proportions are with respect to misogyny are probably off, but I'd assume it's similar to racism? Please let me know if I'm wrong.

To be clear, I don't want people who say racist things or who even are racist to be vilified. Or at least apart from some small, really hardcore portion of white supremacists.  I don't need them to apologize or make amends. I only want them to grow, and learn, and become more thoughtful people over time. Nobody is perfect. I don't expect that. There needs to be room to make (small) mistakes, but then we also have to learn from them.

I'm still waiting for a #metoo type catalyst in relation to racism. That women had this moment makes me hopeful that, eventually, it will come for us as well.
