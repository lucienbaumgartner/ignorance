YTA. Your grandmother had a disease which caused her confusion and memory loss. To suggest that your cousin that your grandmother excluded her deliberately is unhelpful at best, and ignorant of her medical condition.

If your grandmother was showing signs of dementia then was she really in a position to make decisions regarding her property? I can’t help but feel that your father took advantage of the situation. I’m also trying to wrap my head around why the transfer of titles was necessary.

If it was to do with property management, couldn’t your father just have had lasting power of attorney to act on grandmother’s behalf? No transfer of titles and your father could have acted as required.

The only other thing I can think of is inheritance tax, by reducing the value of grandmother’s estate less tax has to be paid when it is settled. I can understand that it would be unwise to transfer a property to your underage cousin, as she would have been at the time. However, I can’t see that there was no sensible way to do this. For example, could the property not have been held in a living trust with your cousin as a beneficiary and your father/a responsible adult as the trustee? Then the property could have been transferred to the cousin at the age of 18/whatever.
