dude, of course it's okay to be mad -- she was ignorant and shitty to you and she thinks she knows how to navigate life as a fat person better than, like, an actual fat person. as fat people we are actually not required to wear burlap sacks and stick to fucking people our own size. this might be shocking news to skinny girls but there are actually guys out there that like fat women and their bodies. tell your sister that she doesn't have any input in what size your body is -- she can't diet you skinnier and she can't tell you what to do with your body. how fucking RUDE is it to tell someone that a guy they matched with is too hot for them???
