The only reason it’s acceptable to ask a question like “why don’t you believe in god” is because of generations of brainwashing and being raised that you have to believe it. People like that are so oblivious and ignorant that they truly believe something is wrong with people who have resisted the brainwashing. Everyone is so quick to accept you when you find Jesus. But as soon as you ask even the simplest questions you’re hit with. “Well you just have to believe” or “but we do have proof. It’s the Bible. It’s all in there you just have to read it.” More than likely no answer you give will be satisfactory.
