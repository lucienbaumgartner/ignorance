Man, I so wish I was doing better. My partner was in false reconciliation for 6 weeks, I caught him still talking to AP, and then uncovered 4 other affairs. :(

He's been reconciliatory since DDay #2, but also just so grossly unhealthy and unaware of self that he did things that kept hurting me. I'd say HEALTHY reconciliation started around November 2020 (a year after DDAY 1). While he is doing a TON to show genuine health and repair - my nervous system struggles to accept it and return to feeling safe. I am constantly scanning for danger - waiting to uncover yet another betrayal in his past, waiting for yet another dose of unhealthy unconscious behavior.
