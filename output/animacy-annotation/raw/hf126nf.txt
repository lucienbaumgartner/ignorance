And what science would you be talking about? ONLY the since that fits the left’s crooked agendas? Because that is the ONLY science that matters to them and their supporters. Because any time science debunks any of their views, they won’t listen or accept it. So the whole science argument is moot when you only accept the parts that benefit you and not the rest! So you can drop the science argument. It doesn’t support your side either. As for common sense, I guarantee you I have more than you. And she does as well. 

And writing someone off and judging them based solely on an opinion or someone they follow is completely foolish and ignorant. That would be like me saying the same thing about you. I could easily say , the fact that you support the left or any of their views tells me all I need to know about you. But it doesn’t, because I don’t know you at all. I DO know Brooke better than a lot of others though. I know that she happens to be quite intelligent. And that’s a fact. 

And to close this, no one is saying you have to follow who she does or believe what she says and posts. Just stop judging people and spreading negative crap about them just because they have a different opinion than you. That’s childish and ignorant honestly.
