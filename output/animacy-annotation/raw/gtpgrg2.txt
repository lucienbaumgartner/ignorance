&gt; That’s exactly what I said. Something can be alive and unaware of the current situation it’s in.

Yeah, that isn't what I'm arguing against.

&gt; It’s by instinct everything wants to survive.

Again, having an instinct to survive is not the same thing as having a desire for continued life.  The former does not warrant any kind of right to life.

When an animal demonstrates self-preserving behavior they likely are not thinking about or protecting their continued existence.  They're concerned with the threat of pain.

If it is by instinctual behavior that we can classify a desire to live then plants, bacteria, etc. would also have a desire to live.  That would be an absurd claim.
