Hi!
I'm a woman who has sent nudes so I'm full aware that I've had people masturbate to the sight of me at least. In this situation I relish in the fact that I am causing their arousal-it's an confidence booster about my sexuality and physicality. Otherwise, I am unaware and therefore unbothered. If someone who I don't want to be sexually involved with is fantasizing about me, what I don't know will not kill me.
