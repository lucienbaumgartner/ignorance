It's pretty amazing. It also has separate sides for big dogs and small dogs. If you have a small dog I'd look for one that has separate areas. My big dog (65 lbs but tall and lanky) is friendly but clumsy and unaware of his own body size. I'd be worried about him playing with under 15 lbs dogs. Separating dogs by size is safer for everyone and keeps the dogs safer.
