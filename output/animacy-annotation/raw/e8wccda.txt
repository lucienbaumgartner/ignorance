What entitles the people born first to a better life than those born second?

Also, China has a very dark history using "the ends justify the means" as an excuse to treat some of its people shitty, so your point is at least a little insensitive and ignorant. That exist justified the Great Leap Forward, one of the worst examples of a government sacrificing huge numbers of people so that some privileged ones could have a better quality of life.

I'm going to stop here before I get preachy.
