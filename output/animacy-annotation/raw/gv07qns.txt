I used to live and go to school in Aledo. You're totally correct; the place is a cesspool. The amount of "holier than thou" bullshit I had to endure from kids who have never been told "no" was staggering. I literally heard a 16 year old kid wish his parents dead because they didn't get him the proper color on his brand new Porsche.

 I watched a class full of kids hang a make a shoestring noose and hang water bottle from a projector. Then, when a specific kid walked in, they all said, "Look, it's your dad!" (The kid's dad hung himself shortly before that).

Those kids are far worse than any I have ever encountered, and the parents of those kids don't deserve a pass, either. I am in no way surprised that Aledo HS **hosted** this incident, because the faculty will let the more affluent kids do as they please and act surprised and unaware of this type of stuff when it gets attention.

I have no doubt that the faculty was fully aware of this going on. That place is literal hell if you're an "outsider".
