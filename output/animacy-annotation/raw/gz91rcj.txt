Thank you fact checker! For people who don't want to click the link:
Section III—By Screening A player  who  sets  a  screen  shall  not  (1)  assume a  position nearer  than  a  normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or  (3) assume a position  so  near to  a  moving  opponent  that he  is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an  opponent  being  screened,  after  having  assumed  a  legal  position.  The  screener  may  move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened. In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be.  This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.
