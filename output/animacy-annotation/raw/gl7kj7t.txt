I mean considering nearly your entire diatribe is devoted to one 'Gotcha' that you ***think*** you've found on me. 

I'd clarify and ask you to re-read. ***I didn't say there was "only one horrible person" in the crowd***.   I can't speak for the entirety of the crowd (and frankly neither can you).  I do know that "one" horrible person definitely did commit an act with the intent to harm/kill (and ultimately succeeded) which is why it was mentioned.

As far as different individuals actions?  I'm sure there's people who did a variety of criminal things ( though not as heinous as murder) but criminal things nonetheless and said they should be punished accordingly.   But again -- contextually that also happened all summer long.  If we really want to dive into 'individuals' actions,  I have plenty of ammunition to make that comparison too.

(e.g.  [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2183212/Video-Horrific-moment-business-owners-couple-attacked-looters.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2183212/Video-Horrific-moment-business-owners-couple-attacked-looters.html))

And to be quite frank ---- I really don't care that a guy had a stupid fucking Auschwitz shirt any more than I care that Liberals wear stupid fucking 'Mao' shirts.  Both are dumb and ignorant of history in my eyes, but both have their RIGHT to express themselves as they see fit even if I disagree. 

Did you really just bring up Russia ? FFS.  Russia. Russia. Russia.  Stop -- you're embarrassing yourself.  I'm sure "Cletus" from Alabama was going to get in touch with his buddy Alexei and they would get in touch with Putin and the Kremlin would be drafting up war plans by the evening -- right?     You guys always talk about conspiracy theorists -- this Russian one is a fucking doozy from none other than dumb ass Hilary Clinton.

They weren't there to "halt" the election -- FFS. I'd wager probably 7/10 of those people at that protest -- actually own and operate their firearms.  If they were REALLY going to take down the government -- those would have been there.  Get real -- they were there because Trump said to show up, and they thought Trump may have had some big reveal or secret information. So they wanted to be there to revel in it and worst case make their voices heard.
