I deleted fb, and rarely post on insta. The short version is I don’t care about social media. I don’t get joy or validation from it. If anything it’s stressful. You see the only the version of people they want you to see and usually it isn’t even real, yet here I am comparing and being unsettled when just a few minutes ago I was completely happy and unaware that I want the complexion of such and such influencer, or I wish I could afford this cool trendy item. So I rather not dwell on things that will only give me temporary happiness. Plus who’s life is that interesting?! Even when I scroll my feed I’m only mildly interested.
