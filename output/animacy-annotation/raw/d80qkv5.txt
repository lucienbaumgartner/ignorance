I'm really sorry. In 2003 I was a 14 year old who had something of a "relationship" with an adult I met online. He hitchhiked across the country to get to me. Within months, I went from straight edge vegan virgin to homeless and being groomed for prostitution in exchange for drugs from an abusive man. I really can't find the words to explain how that's possible. When you feel isolated, insecure, and alone, sometimes you'll do anything to feel like you're wanted as a friend or girlfriend or part of a group. When the police pulled me off of a greyhound bound for California. I finally got the support I needed through a victims' crisis center. They helped convince me to file a police report. He simply vanished to another state, and nothing was ever done, even with physical evidence. Years later I was contacted by a girl on MySpace who he stayed with after me. She had the same story, and added that he left her to volunteer at an at-risk youth camp where he was a counselor for 12-15 year old girls. He would write to her occasionally to brag about all of the 13 year old pussy he was getting. 

I wish people could understand that sometimes, even if you think the girl should get some blame for being so easily talked into bed, it's the work of a predator who can pick out easy prey to manipulate. People who jump you on the street aren't doing so indiscriminately, they're looking for people who are in a good area, looking unaware and fairly weak, with an outfit that gives the impression that they have money on them. It's just as simple to find a girl who appears to want attention, love, and acceptance, when she isn't receiving that from friends and family. It's so sad to say these girls should have known a better way to fulfill basic human needs that weren't provided for them, as a counter to "guys should know that it's never acceptable to coerce girls into sex if they display any hesitance."
