I'm genuinely sorry that you think a button to switch on face unlock that would be implemented and designed by Google themselves is bloat. Must be a horrid life.

Yes they switched because it was not good and a giant waste of space and even with their radar it was still slower than the OP8 Pro among others. It was useless.

Your definition of bloat is priceless and literal wrong. You already have a pattern and a Pin. Adding a fingerprint scanner is just ReDuNdAnCy. Why add the fingerprint scanner when you have a perfectly secure pin? That's just BlOaT. 

"Redundancy is bad". Just listen to how silly and ignorant that sounds.
