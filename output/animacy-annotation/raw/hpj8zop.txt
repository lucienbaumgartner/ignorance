I don't talk to my parents if it's not really needed because I was raised as you need to study and smart. Well now I kinda am, I realised that they are dumb and ignorant that I cannot even deal with it (I basically ended up having bias growing up I should understand the smart group / it's better to be the dumbest one in the smart group than being the smartest in the dumb group).  
  
They got offended that I look at them lowly because they can't keep up with me. My dad says shit like "even if I'm not smart I brought you to Australia" which I kinda want to retort with "and yet you still have broken English after 18 years in it". Like, how can you stigmatised dumbness to your kids and now you can't keep up you get angry about it.
