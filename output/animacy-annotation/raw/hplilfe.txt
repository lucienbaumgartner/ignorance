I haven't. You literally cannot speak for me. I know myself better than you. Again, try searching demisexuality. I don't feel sexually attracted to anyone unless I have a strong emotional connection. Also that's not what asexually is lmao. Libido isn't the same as attraction. You're so ignorant and closed-minded.
