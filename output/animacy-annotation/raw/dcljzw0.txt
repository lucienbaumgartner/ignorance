Try to talk about Obama with young liberals and they idolize the guy. Totally don't care about the drone strike programs, doubling the nation's debt, the extreme expansion of food service jobs falsifying an economic recovery that didn't happen, the extreme rise in cost of living, food stamps, government debt, money printing, healthcare costs, black income inequality; the extreme fall in home ownership and labor participation and median family income. 

As far as I can see it Obama had two significant legislative and policy moves in 8 fucking years (repealing don't ask don't tell and working the supreme court to legalize gay marriage).

Obama was an absolute disaster in every way shape and form. He had the highest favorability of any president in modern history and the legacy he leaves behind is Trump undoing his crown jewel of a failed healthcare plan, a destroyed middle east thanks to giving Clinton Sec. Of State job that she botched miserably, a DNC in total disarray, a [Democrat elite who are shunning Sanders and his supporters and real change](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/tom-perez-dnc/), and an entire government in republican control and what looks to end up a supermajority in 2018.

Anyone who calls themselves liberal or democrat and doesn't consider Obama an absolute failure is a liar or brainwashed. The DNC elite, especially Obama, are evil. 

The best part of all this, Obama's ruthless abuse of Executive Orders was truly despicable and stretched the power of what a president can do so far! And now people fear Trump will do exactly what Obama has set the precedent for. Hilarious. 

Just look at how they talk:

["And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

["we need to better utilize these networks to drive the content of politics through a strong “echo chamber” and message delivery system."](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

If that doesn't convince you that Obama is a cretinous liar - just ask yourself one honest question. Obama campaigned on a platform of HOPE and CHANGE. How much change have we seen?
