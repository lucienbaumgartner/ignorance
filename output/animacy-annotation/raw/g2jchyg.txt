&gt; I've seen good friends die from the effects of hard drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. I've also seen the relief they get from being able to relax with a drink on the weekend, or pop out for a cigarette and a few minutes of peace and quiet when it's all getting to be too much. 

And you don't see any relationship between people dying because of their addictions and supporting their addictions as a coping mechanism for stress?

&gt; Perhaps holding some left wing views and campaigning for things like mental health services and addiction treatment would be better, no? 

So weird and ignorant that you think that right-wing people don't believe in healthcare and rehab.
