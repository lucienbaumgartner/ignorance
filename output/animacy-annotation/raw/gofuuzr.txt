Hey everybody!

So, in my next session, my players plan on talking to this dragon in its cave. They know next to nothing about the dragon, save its name. The players have been tasked with parting a crystal bowl from the dragon as part of a hostage exchange (bowl for civilians). The bowl itself is minorly magic: it produces light when filled with water. 

The dragon itself is uninvolved and unaware of the hostage situation: it spends most of its time sleeping in the light of the bowl, dreaming placid dreams to distract itself from its long untended wounds. It's eaten its entire horde in its isolation, save a smattering of gems (I'm working off of E.E Knight's interpretation, dragons convert metal into scales), and it has lost one of its wings due to lack of care.

So what I'm looking for help with is its reaction to the players' request for the bowl. For a lot of reasons, from personal pride to a desperate need to escape its current situation, it doesn't want to just give the thing up. But neither can it just spew fire and crush them; it's scaleless, missing a wing, and emaciated. 

While I can't control players' actions, I'd like a second opinion on possible avenues of resolution from the dragon's perspective. 

If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them!
