If the enemy is just standing there looting unaware then you can kill them reliably with any weapon but sure.

In that one scenario where the enemy is clueless and unaware of their surroundings for an extended period of time while you third party them or just happen to be behind them when they find a deathbox then yes in that specific scenario TT can kill pretty fast
