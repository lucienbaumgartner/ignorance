The taxi industry is fucked in Vancouver. Just last week my friend from the island was charged $75 from gastown to the west end. I was sick so I couldn’t pick her up but she was drunk and unaware that the 45 min cab ride should have taken 10 minutes at 2:30am on a Saturday. 

About a year ago I had a taxi driver cut me off on Terminal. He ran a stop sign on an intersecting road and I had to slam on my brakes to let him in. He decided to finger me then pulled into the gas station at main and 2nd. I followed and confronted him and he decided to get in my face. I pushed him away as he was way too close to me, moving forward in a threatening way and screaming what I would assume profanities in another language. I dropped his ass on the pavement and offered to wait for police to which he declined. 

The monopoly in this city controlled by the taxi industry is a joke and I can’t wait for their companies to burn in a Prius/Tire fire. Or, embrace the changes and model your business to operate legally; stop preying on Vancouver residents, your only source of revenue. 

Fuck.
