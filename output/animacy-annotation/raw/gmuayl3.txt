It seems like your teacher was worried, and unaware of your home situation. Lots of people deal with Ed’s and the long term effects are troubling. He was probably just trying to help. You shouldn’t have to, but maybe have your grandparents reach out to this teacher and explain the situation. Honestly a lot of teachers get burnt out and don’t try and help, this probably came from a good place. But yeah fuck your mom lol.
