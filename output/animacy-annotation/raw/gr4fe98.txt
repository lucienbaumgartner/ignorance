You might not dislike getting touched if your brother or someone else touches you slowly and softly like i usually really hate guys touching me but sometimes women are okay since they dont touch me roughly possibly because they usually have half the strength of an average man so they are more prone to touching me less roughly compared to men. But since my dad wanted to touch me but was super rough and ignorant of it since always complain when i touched/slapped him the same way he did me (non sexual just a physical touch type of person) i grew up and did the mature thing and i just gave him an 1000 word essay in SMS about my complaints against him touching me roughly and that he should touch me more softly, less rough, if he wants to touch me without me retaliating and returning the favour/impactful pats literally just slaps xd. He does have bad memory so occasionally he forgets but when he doesnt i honestly like his pats better than my mom especially since she smacks me lol depression...luckily she weak af... 

I think my family and I are too bony to make me comfortable with hugs. 

No idea what cuddles are seems cute tho.
