[Mother of Learning](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/) is pretty close. A guy gets caught in a time loop that resets every month, the last day of which involves a catastrophic magical invasion of his city and the release of a malevolent primordial Lovecraftian proto-deity. The series is complete at 107 chapters, but is missing overtly dystopian elements.

[Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/) is also very close. A superhero themed series where not all powers are particularly good and death is a merciful fate. Heavy themes of mental illness and PTSD. Dystopian elements exist, but in more of a background dawning horror way than anything overt from the get-go. Apocalyptic elements also steadily grow, but much much more overtly. Can’t recommend this one enough.

[Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/) is one of the more trippy and disturbing things I’ve ever read. The unaware and unprepared main character inherits a terrible legacy of demon binding, for which just about everyone in the supernatural community wants him dead. Things rapidly spiral out of his control, resulting in an utter deconstruction of the main character, and I mean that entirely literally.

[The Iron Teeth](http://www.ironteethserial.com/dark-fantasy-story/story-interlude/prologue/) is a much more comical series taking place in a fantasy setting. The main character is a Goblin struggling to live in the collapsed ruins of a frontier kingdom, overgrown with dark forests, overrun with monsters, and overpowered by powerful bandit lords. Something lurks in the Deep Green... plotting.

Ummm... that’s all I got.
