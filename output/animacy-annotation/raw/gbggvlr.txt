Sorry but I want to say that you are a loser for supporting this edgy and offensive streamer. He is so insensitive and unaware of the real world. You and that streamer you support so much know what part of his name I'm talking that is vulgar and offensive. I'm talking about the word "p\*ece". That word refers to a gun and guns are dangerous and kill people. Guns cause violence and killing and there are a lot of traumatizing events involving guns so the fact that he has that disgusting word in his name is more than enough to validate a permanent ban and end to his career.
