The fact that you used an example that's not even about theft is surprising and makes no sense because walking into a bedroom without knocking first, doesn't equate to being a pervert because you as a parent know that it's your child in the house. It just shows that she's rude for not knocking first and that's learned behavior. 

It is stealing because she took it when he was asleep and unaware of the fact. OP already stated no and that he would help her and mentioned "not to use his main card". 

The weird thing is how you're so nonchalant about the action is slightly disturbing because you're okay with kids stealing from parents without parent's consent. You're teaching kids that stealing from your parents "isn't really stealing" when it is. Doesn't matter who it is. It teaches kids that you can treat you own family like garbage and it's okay because you won't get in trouble.
