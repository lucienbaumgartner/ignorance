So what if the show means way more to him??? He wanted the show? Shouldn't have decided to take a massive dump on a bandmate's house then. What a jackass. Bands have to mediate conflicts like this all the time and Henry is literally being a dick for the sake of being a dick.

Sure, Denny's holding the ultimatum, but Henry is the one who instigated it and is playing dumb and ignorant of why she might be mad at his behavior. You can't just do something like that and be all "Why is everyone mad at me?". That's some real 'fuck you, got mine' attitude right there.

No, Henry is \*that\* guy in every band or group project or dnd party. Had enough of them in school and in my frat. People like that can go fuck themselves.
