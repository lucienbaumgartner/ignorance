That sounds about right. I took a full 6 months no online news, no local news sabbatical one time and realized after 6 months I was more depressed, more agitated, more ignorant of what was going on in the world. I genuinely believe most of us are getting beneficial positive things from being online.  I think for people that grew up with it, it's a powerful positive aspect of their lives.

As with any tool though, if you misuse it then of course you're gonna end up distracted and ignorant of your place in the world.
