So outrageously smug and ignorant that you can't even feel sorry for her as her dad is dying. Way before covid, I've heard plenty of people say a hospital didn't do enough for a dying relative. Even if you know it's not true, you can usually excuse what they say because of what they've just been through. We all wanted a miracle that didn't happen and are looking to blame somebody to rationalize it all. But in this case, she's so insane it's impossible to sympathize. What a dumb cunt!
