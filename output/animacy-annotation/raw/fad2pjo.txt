&gt; I already know it's highly unlikely you're \[the reader\] a member of the Shadow Confederation, or if you are, you're not a high ranking member and certainly not a Permanent Chief like me. I know you're probably so delusional and ignorant that you entirely deny or trivially dismiss the existence of the Shadow Confederation and its significance in this world, precisely as the vast majority of its members desire. 

holy smokes boys we got a permanent chief of the shadow realm on our hands!
