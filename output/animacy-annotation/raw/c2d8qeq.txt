As somebody who has undergone some plastic surgery for aesthetic reasons (though not in the genitals ), my feeling is that what is most important about these things is that information about risks, possible alternatives and so on is available to people. 

A lot of people have very condemning attitudes to cosmetic procedures, and this ironically makes it harder for those who choose to undergo it. I don't like being victimised or described as having a mental problem just because I preferred a different shape for my nose. I wasn't taken advantage of. I wasn't pressured into it. I'm not mentally ill or unable to make my own decisions. 

Is it irresponsible to perform surgery like this on people who are very young and unaware that their bodies are perfectly normal? Sure. Is it bad if fashion industry or cultural stigma pressures people into surgery they don't really need? Yep. Is it important to make sure people understand the issues with having surgery in such an intimate and sensitive area? Absolutely. 

However, if you know the consequences and risks, then why is it justified to stigmatise people and assume we must be tormented, pressured or shallow if we want to do something like this? I wanted a different appearance. I got it. It's my body, and I bloody don't appreciate having a lot of degrading assumptions made about me when I decide what to do with it.
