You have every right to not want to wrap the presents. 

However, if you feel like that would cause an unnecessary, unpleasant argument between you and your mom I would just suck it up and do it. Don't think of it as your abuser's kids, but simply as little, cute kids, who are unaware and unrelated to their father's history. 

If you feel like you would be betraying yourself if you did so, I would not do it. 

It's a judgment call. Do you think it's worth having the argument or not?
