HERE'S A SCENARIO:

imagine you are an out of shape slob. you walk into Gold's Gym. Walk up to the counter:

"I realize that I'm a below average slob. I'm also so lazy and ignorant that I can't be bothered to do any research on fitness. Given that information, can you tell me how long it will take for me to build muscles like Arnold Schwarzenegger? "
