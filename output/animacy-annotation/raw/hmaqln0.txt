&gt; To be honest if they had made what they called "medium" high, maxed out the density sliders at 50 instead of 100 - and locked anything higher behind .INI changes people would have been a lot less angry.

Bingo. Alex from Digital Foundry goes deep into this subject when he talks about ports and how casual users refer to some ports as being "optimized" and others as being "unoptimized." The basic jist of it is that the games people claim to be unoptimized are the ones that have extremely high scaling of demanding settings like draw distance, which when dialed to the max will nuke performance, while the games that people considered to be "optimized" really didn't offer much in the way of future hardware scaling settings, so "max settings" was really a joke and ran well for everyone.

GTA IV's port has been wonderful basically since a few weeks after release. I too had a Q6600 overclocked to 3.2, sometimes 3.6Ghz, and a GTX 9800. It ran great for me when I was just playing the game. I have a video here of me playing it back then with an FPS mod (which I believe eventually lead to GTA V and RDR2 having native FPS modes, since the video went viral): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1Hm4K5_Pr0

In that video my frames are a bit low thanks to FRAPS nuking my CPU, and I have traffic density set to 100 which when walking around Time's Square is a foolish endeavor, but yeah it ran great when I wasn't recording and if I set traffic to 33/100. People are just ignorant and unaware of what it actually means to have a proper, optimized game vs one that offers options with the expectation of scaling into the future. Let's also not forget that like Crysis, it came out at a time when PC graphics APIs had horrible performance efficiency so they were horribly CPU bottlenecked.
