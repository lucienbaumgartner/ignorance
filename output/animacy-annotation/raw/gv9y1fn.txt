&gt;Itâ€™s the same reason why some kids now think their best bet is socialism/communism.

I can see it. The dumb vocal ones are the ones who think society under that kind of rule will be work optional and egalitarian, and they can just be a chief sculpture or some shit, and tankies. I hate both because they're entirely unrealistic and ignorant of history and human nature.

The other kind I see I have sympathy for even if I don't agree with their solution. They've been told for most of their lives that the world is going to hell and they stand no chance. Some people (like myself) ignore that and are fortunate enough to grab a decent job and have hope in the future. But others see no light at the end of the tunnel. Whether it be via school debt, crappy jobs, or the overall inability to find one, they've somehow fulfilled that prophecy and don't see a way out, other than to install a system that guarantees them their needs are met and *a* job doing anything, whatever that may be.

I do think we need massive operational overhauls, but I think they should serve not to move towards a future deep into socialism or early communism, but instead to help re-ignite the sense of can-do optimism from the 20th century.
