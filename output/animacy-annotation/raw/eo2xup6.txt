Life can end in control or chaos. When everything becomes too ordered, life dies under the control of "one". One conformist mindset that picks every value and life works like a clock (unaware and dead) with the "one" dead from not having a feedback mechanic for its self-awareness. A random variable will evolve and life is "awake". 

When everything goes into chaos, all that dissolved stuff is another type of "one" and life may or may not die (chaos picks the next order). It can change direction, transition, evolve, split, etc. Chaos is unable to exist until it picks an order to make.

I find that the system seems to try and use the fake concepts and good and evil to carry out reaching "one". To have a beginning, middle, and end, with new beginning. 

Since humanity isn't evolved enough, it shouldn't be trying to achieve "one". All the selfish problems in the world make for a problematic entity to remain wise.
