Well, normally it's because we don't want to talk over people or interrupt someone, and that eventually transitions into us just really not paying attention. You'll know we're there because we stop looking *at* you and start looking *through* you.

But do you wanna have some real fun? Wait till we get to the point we arent really paying attention, then turn to us and say "What do *you* think?"

Catches us unaware and unprepared.
