The thing is, Quan was just a Prince, whose father hold the real power of Leonster and Munster alliance. He spent years of his young life at the Granvelle Officer academy. So he was obnoxious, ignorant, and unaware of the common people's life, even slightly more than his best friends Sigurd and Eldigan. He had huge prejudice against Southern Thracians, and didn't have much personal  experience with them. The only times he encountered Southern Thracians was probably the Papillio's mercenary squad, who served the tyrant who executed his best friend. So even though I agreed with you that Travant was a better human being than him, I won't blame Quan about his stand against Southern Thracian. He's just the result of a centuries long corrupted system. The true villain was the one who practically operate the system: King Calf. He not only decided to continue oppressive system based on moral high ground, he was the one who put a sanction of South Thracia because of their amoral mecenary works. But also accidentally, or actively made his son ignorant about the whole situation while fortify his belief of Leonster moral high ground, just by sent him to some luxurious  Officer academy on another country.
