He fought a “valiant” fight? Nope. He frightened himself about the efforts of medical researchers who have only tried to protect him, reasoning that because he was ignorant and selfish, doctors and researchers must be ignorant and selfish themselves. They are not. Dying by drowning in your own fluids prone on a hospital bed with 6 iv’s and tubes into your lungs and out of your anus is no one’s idea of valiant. He threw away the great gift God gave him-his own life. I wouldn’t count on a round of applause when he gets where he’s going.
