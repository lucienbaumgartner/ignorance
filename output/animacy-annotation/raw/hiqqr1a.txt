Exactly. To make it seem as though the only issue has ever been White vs Black is so simplistic and ignorant that we end up with the kind of silly Twitter hot takes that just set us back socially. Colourism is a legitimate issue and I think it’s worth discussing in the public forum but we too easily deny people’s unique and interesting heritages. Hope that changes.
