It’s all about recognition and awareness on both ends. 

The asker needs to have the self awareness to recognize that this is an issue and help curb that jump to feeling ignored and disrespected. That’s on them (me). 

The person who is answering needs to recognize that the asker is genuinely confused and unaware that it has already been answered, and be self aware enough to curb their own frustration and simply answer again (my own partner)

Neutrally letting them know that it was already answered can be helpful for reinforcing the awareness and recognition on both ends.

Really, though, it helps a lot if the two of you can have a conversation about this phenomenon during a neutral moment so you can both acknowledge it and get a sense for how each would prefer it be handled. 

(This basically applies to every frustration that can come up in healthy long term relationships)
