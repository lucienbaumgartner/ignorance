That was not a very good analogy.
Making a conjecture about a court case and compare it to a state that a country is in (people living in misery) due to historical and cultural events is absurd.
Like I said to many people here u keep discussing against it using historical and wild suppositions and all it proves is how incredibly cynical and ignorant of reality people can be. all you have to do is go there a look at what's going on, they need the help they need the money. But u keep up , keep enjoying the wealth ur country has generated over its history due to oppression. Surely other people don't need it. Maybe u wasn't there when it happens but for sure the people living there now are still suffering from the consequences of European countries actions in the past. Make ur country take responsibility for it, wether u like it or not it reflects on you.
