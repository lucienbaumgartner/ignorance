I guess it really depends on the person. I would rather it be told by a stranger tbh because then it means they didn't suffer for long, and said stranger isn't trying to hurt me. It's more awkward from friends that have been suffering foreverâ€”then you think "why didn't you tell me before?". Btw personal experience: I was told by a boss that I was unhygienic when I asked for a raise, and I went around asking everyone for answers (it's likely because my oily bangs btw. Apparently Japanese people can smell oil in bangs, or otherwise think they can) because I wanted to know and I'm just really lazy and unaware of how people perceive me as I decline into lazier and lazier habits.

I Googled it and there's actually quite a lot of articles on it. It's apparently a common problem for managers. Try to read a few articles and see what feels right.

That said, it might hurt him at first rather than leaving his in ignorant bliss, and it may not change anything. It might be genetic or cultural. Just be gentle and let him know. The ball is in your court and you should have nothing to feel AH-ish about.
