Utterly and woefully wrong.

There's been absolutely no demonstration an outdoor cat is any more happy than an indoor cat from an educated cat owner

The vast majority of the actual experts are strong advocates of indoor only cats and some actually argue allowing your cat to go outdoors is immoral and can actually make them less happy overall. (Cat fights, diseases, dangers, predators, and so many other factors inherit to cat and their psychology)

If anyone is a "shitty fuck" it is you as you're horribly misinformed and ignorant of the experts advice. Read Total Cat Mojo, or Cat Sense, or even Think like a cat, etc to actually learn about what you think you know so much about naturally...
