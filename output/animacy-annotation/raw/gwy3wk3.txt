Ummm... No we don't. Anti work loves to lump meal prep, commuting and literally any other non pleasurable activity into "work," so let's play their game.

You work at a job for probably pretty similar hours they did so that everything else in your life can be taken care of. You don't have to go fetch water, it's piped directly to your house. Chopping and burning wood? No need, your home is almost certainly heated and well lit. Not only that, you literally eat better than kings used to, and you don't have to harvest or hunt for anything, you just go to a building, take what you want and leave. Travelling by foot or cart? You probably have a car or a bike.

Life these days is so much easier and more comfortable than even 200 years ago. Believing you have it worse than a medieval farmer because you have to work 40 hours a week is so fucking entitled and ignorant that I can't even.
