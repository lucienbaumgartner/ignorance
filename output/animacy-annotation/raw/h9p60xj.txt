I’ve definitely picked up on it, I’m British born and raised (northern England) with a German grandmother. 

The vast majority of it isn’t intended to be offensive. The football rivalry thing seems to be perpetuated more by the media than everyday people, at least the ones I know. 

As for nazi jokes, I have heard quite a few, both from people who were aware and unaware of my grandmother being German. I try to ignore it mostly as it sort of feels like mild xenophobia is just part of English culture at this point (sad, I know). Having said that, it does feel like there is different treatment of different nationalities. My other grandmother is Irish and I can’t recall a single negative comment about that. I grew up with an Italian friend and I don’t remember anyone making any mean jokes about it. 

None of this is to say that the majority of English people think like this, most don’t have a dislike of Germans, but I suppose the negative experiences tend to stand out the most. For every ignorant comment I’ve heard, I’ve heard about 10 indifferent or positive responses.
