Because there is a difference between the words in the Koran and the lived experiences of Muslim women around the world. Those women have shared their experiences, as women, as Muslims, with you, and you are telling them that they are wrong and ignorant. That is not the kind of women-uplifting I wish to see on this sub. 

For the record, I upvoted your original post. I donâ€™t agree with Islam. But Islamophobia makes me nauseous.
