&gt;who had an awkward date with a woman who went to the media about it

He didn't have "an awkward date", he was incredibly pushy, persistent, and ignorant of her boundaries. If that's the sort of behaviour you'd consider "an awkward date" you might need to have a sit down and think about your own behaviour with women. 

All for distinguishing his behaviour from the likes of Weinstein or Cosby, but you can do that without completely misrepresenting it.
