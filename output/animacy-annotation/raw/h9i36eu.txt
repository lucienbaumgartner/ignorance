The amount of brainless articles on Reddit that are “ hey guys the taliban is so similar to republicans the love god and they’re conservatives”. People are writing pages and pages.  Think about the mental bandwidth spent on taking the worst people in the world and saying they’re basically just like republicans.  Not one person sayin uh I’ve never seen the republicans decapitating or stoning people.  Then I reminded of the interview with on of the highest members he was asked if you lived in America would you vote Republican or Democrat.  Instantly said we vote Democrat bc they are stupid and unaware of reality.  Also in these comparisons to nazis and taliban they’re really implying that they’re basically just like those oppressed victims.
