Low level arguments:

“This game is The Witcher”. Check
“You don’t play as an assassin 🥲” Check
“Parkour is bad” Check
“Combat is a button masher\repetitive” Check.

Nothing the op is saying is new or original or indicative that they’ve played the game. They’re just regurgitating tired low effort arguments made against that game since it released. That’s i called the ops arguments ignorant and low effort.
