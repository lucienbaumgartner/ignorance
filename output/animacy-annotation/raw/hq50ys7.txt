Simply grow up and open your eyes to the world around you. Women are repressed in all societies across the world that even a blind man would see it. 

Either you are ignorant and immature or just being disingenuous to peddle your arguments. I hope it is the former and that you can at least learn something. Maybe actually ask the women in your family about their experiences in society whether at work or at home with issues like harassment and curb that ignorance early lest you embarrass yourself in the future in real life.
