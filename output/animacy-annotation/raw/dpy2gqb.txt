&gt;  Has anyone experienced this with the game?

Yes.  Most winning players go through a phase where they get irrationally angry over bad beats.  It's the random element of the game...they know that they are a winning player, but they can't win every hand/session/week/month.  It fucks with your head because people who aren't as good as you are are making money while you are losing money.

That isn't to say that this behavior is good.  It obviously isn't.  

&gt; Can anyone suggest a way I can help him?

Yes but it's unlikely that it'll take.  A lot of people are too dumb to realize they are being dumb, and much like telling your friend that his girl is cheating on him, it'll more than likely cause him to lash out at you instead of confronting the real issue.

But, you can tell him that being that angry isn't healthy, and is only going to perpetuate a negative head space that's going to cause him to spiral which is going to be bad for his game and life.  Explain to him that poker, while both fun and profitable, should be a component of living, not life itself.  He needs to structure time to play and time to do other things.  He needs to approach poker as "Did I play as well as I could" instead of "Did I win money/this hand".  If he can't realize that people playing poorly is good for him in the long run, and the results of any one hand are irrelevant, he's not going to last in the game.  Like I said, a lot of people go through this because of the nature of playing the game at a high level.  The good ones realize what is going on, adapt, and grow.  The bad ones don't and eventually end up working at Walmart.  

But you should probably try to find another place to live.  If someone is so selfish and unaware that his screaming is making you uncomfortable...even after you've confronted him about it...then he's, at best, an asshole.  No need for you to be around that long term.
