Stop Money laundering Maybe? Putting tax money to to good use like education, water, health care, infrastructure, creating jobs or maybe in defense. If our tax money will be laundered into Swiss bank accounts then yes everyone will be reluctant to give taxes and also educate people when they need to give taxes lot of Pakistanis are unaware and last thing is use of force no one powerful person will just give tax because government say so and also change should be started from parliament if people in government doesn't pay taxes why you expect citizens to pay?
