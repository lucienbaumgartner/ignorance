I disagree. I’m sure some people are trying to be transphobic. I’d wage even *more* people are trying to defend the right to use a definition they’ve grown up being taught, who are afraid or even sick of being labelled transphobic. I’d wage that most people on both sides are completely confused and unaware that it actually means both things in different contexts.

Most people don’t care about how other people chose to live their lives. It’s only a minority that has hateful views.
