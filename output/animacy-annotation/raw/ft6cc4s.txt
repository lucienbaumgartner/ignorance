I mean that’s fine. If the dudes so racist and ignorant that he’s let it take over his identity to the point where it’s all he talks about, sure. There’s people in every corner of the ideological spectrum that just go 100% and make it everything they are and that’s annoying, to anyone. Trump supports and liberals alike both do this in droves. 

If you just know the guys racist but he just goes on regularly like every other person, occasionally spouting some mad ignorant shit on Facebook, and then choose to reduce him to his ideology. Then that just says a lot about you as a person.
