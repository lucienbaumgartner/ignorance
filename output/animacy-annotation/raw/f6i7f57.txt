People are stupid. American schools dont teach these things (especially in the past). There are huge amounts of infomation out there. But unless you purposefully look, you will never come across them. 

Again. People are stupid and ignorant. That doesnt make them racist, it makes them stupid and racist.

Also judging from that one sentence the OP wouldnt be racist. The arrogant judgement came from the overall tone of the post.
