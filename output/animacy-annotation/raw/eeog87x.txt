&gt;Okay so it could be argued that the "pests" are only killed once they "attack" the crops. If I take my field and plant a crop of vegetables there is not intent to kill inherent in that. If animals attack my crop and its viability it is not immoral for me to protect what is mine, in this case the vegetable crop.

The insects/rodents are doing what comes naturally. They don't understand the crop is 'yours', they simply smell food and go towards it as is their instinct.

Doesn't it seem off to punish with death animals only following their nature, unaware and incapable of grasping concepts of crop ownership?

I don't think there is a problem with killing pests, but I don't think the reasoning here is a great defense or justification for killing them.

I would assume we have the technology to have pest free crops, by isolating them in greenhouses and controlling climate, giving food and water and completely sealing them from outside. That is more expensive, but certainly possible and practicable to accomplish (I assume). Why are more vegans not pushing for something like that, and why do so many seem to skip over the issue of pest deaths?
