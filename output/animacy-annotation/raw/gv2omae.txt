Yeah, I love cats and dogs(excluding pit bulls) I have no problem with the r/catfree r/dog or r/petfree subreddits. 

I do see why some people get upset about the thought of a pit bull ban, but they're uneducated and unaware of the dangerous pit bulls pose to society and/or more concerned about being able to keep their rights to own one.
