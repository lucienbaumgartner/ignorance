Let them it's their right. The reality is the represent 30% of the country only. This is the number of people who thought the country was going in the right direction. Thanksgiving and Christmas are between now and then. Hopefully families will talk through this and common sense will prevail. They're misinformed, they are still name calling. I guess the exit polls which prove their narrative false don't matter. History will remember them in the same way their party sees them. These people are the "unaware and compliant citizenry". Useful idiots.
