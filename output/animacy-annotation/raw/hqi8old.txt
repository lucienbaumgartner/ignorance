Honestly? You told him you were vegan. For him to assume you were suddenly eating meat dishes is completely stupid. 

If you went to his house, you would assume he would be making things with meat because he *isn’t* vegan, and unless you requested, I doubt he would change how he cooked the entire meal, because he’s so “opposed” to faux meat. I think he was being willfully ignorant and rude. 

I don’t think you should break up but he needs to own his part in this and y’all need to come up with a compromise on how you plan to handle meals.
