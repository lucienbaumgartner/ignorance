In short, he compared people calling him a vampire (am I mistaken or does he not call himself that as well?) to black people being called gorillas. It was entirely tone-deaf and ignorant of the ways that comparisons to animals have been used to dehumanize black people for centuries. I’m not sure if he’s had other controversies but that one really stuck out to me for how ignorant and self-victimizing it was.
