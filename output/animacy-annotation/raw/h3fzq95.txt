It costs more than feeding those same homeless. At the restaurants the food comes from.

If a restaurant 

- More efficient to ship components

- Cook on-site

- Feed homeless using subsidy in cash

Than

- Transporting practically unedible waste products

- To homeless 

**After** requiring the restaurant

- To store the "almost waste" neatly

- To even allow for transit 

- At the end of a business period

Costing massively in refrigeration. Plus premium floor space. 

All of the kitchen is used, all of the storage section is used. 

If a restaurant requires a mid-period delivery. To meet expected demand. 

It cannot store "almost waste". 

Not to *allow* for **human consumption**. 

Humans have allergies. Easier to aquire paid for food. Each accommodating themselves according to need. 

Instead of being fed "Days Mush #10000". Untested and unaware of its contents.

How much of the mush is

- Shellfish? ðŸ¤”

- Lactose Proteins? ðŸ¤”

- Nuts? ðŸ¤”

- Gluten? ðŸ¤”

- Eggshells? ðŸ¤”

&gt; But there isn't much profit in it, so they don't bother.

There isn't profit in death. 

I'd rather the homeless **live**. Even if without a roof. 

A future of a roof. Is still a future, and a life.

Personally, that's worth any resources.
