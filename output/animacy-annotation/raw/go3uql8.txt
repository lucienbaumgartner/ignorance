Christy omg youâ€™re so sweet ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜…ðŸ¥°

1. I didnâ€™t think I was funny at all, so I really appreciate you saying so ðŸ˜‚ With regard to the humour, it sort of comes naturally within the first draft. Itâ€™s one of the few things I donâ€™t change. 

2. I try to write Bobby similar to a friend I have. I see him as the meme kid of the group, and someone whoâ€™s a little self conscious and unaware of how much people love him, so he uses humour to mask how he really feels. Because I have a friend with such a similar personality, I suppose I find it difficult to see him romantically, but still think heâ€™s a wonderful character to have play a larger role than some of the others. 

3. Thank you so much ðŸ¥º I wanted Noah to feel like Genâ€™s safest space like her own home, so Iâ€™m glad something like that comes across.

4. I hate writing angst. It feel like I canâ€™t do it well at all, and everything feels underwhelming when I try to build it. Give me fluff any day (why did I choose to write slow burn?) 

Iâ€™m so sorry for my late reply! Life got busy ðŸ’œ
