Damage Reduction frame aka the Boring Bullet Sponge

* Passive - Atlas or "new passive: enemies within 25m consider this frame a priority threat - stacks aggro range w/ Guardian Derision"
* Mesa's Shatter Shield
* Gara's Splinter Storm
* Mirage's Eclipse
* Trinity's Blessing

That's up to 4 forms of damage reduction, one being 95% to all damage, another being 95% again to all when in the dark and can be a great self buff in the light, another being 95% to ranged attacks and the last being 75% plus an instant heal.

DnD Mage

* Passive - Limbo or Octavia
* Ember's Fireball
* Volt's Shock
* Oberon's Smite
* Frost's Freeze or Saryn's Venom Dose

I can hear "Fireball", "Lightning Bolt" and "Magic Missile" in the distance already. Plus stick all their respective augments onto the same frame and you got one hell of a buffer. Sucks you can't buff yourself with these abilities. Another funny thing to imagine is if this frame had no cast delay between ability casts.

Stealth the frame aka "How the fuck can the game stop this monstrosity?"

* Passive - Banshee/Limbo
* Loki's Invisibility
* Rhino's Roar or any other consistent weapon buff ability.
* Banshee's Silence
* Mesa's Peacemaker

I'd say this is the epitome of stealth and stealth kills/farming with extra damage potential. Passive selection gives you a choice: be ultimate stealth or be silent killer. Invis is self explanatory and pairs well with Silence. Silence makes everything unaware and unable to hear, which is good primarily for the stun and can help muffle Peacemaker if not using Banshee's passive. Roar, or anything else that buffs your weapon damage, will buff Peacemaker and whatever melee weapon you use for Adaro and make getting those OHKOs happen even easier. Peacemaker is just a good damage ability, but it can rack up the stealth bonus super quickly with this set up and you're pretty much an untouchable killing machine if using Limbo's passive though Invis also does this.
