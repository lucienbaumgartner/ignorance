&gt; anti-conservative

possibly because the current US "conservative" model left actual conservatism behind a long time ago as it moved further and further towards the extreme right wing. US used to have many moderate conservatives and a few extremists, whereas now those moderates have been drowned out by the loudest, most ignorant and most extreme of the party.

Nowadays the current Republican party leadership and main representatives seem to be a mixture of religious bigots, neo-nazis, white supremacists, secessionists and anti-education.

And if you think its exhausting to read it, then think how exhausting it is for the rest of us putting up with that right-wing extremism and ignorance all the time.
