hehe is that you bragging about not caring about child rape? or the fact that you get triggered about micro aggressions instead of actual violence against kids? lol, I don't know because getting triggered is your thing - you know, since this is a "enough whatever" style subreddit, clearly you're triggered.

Lol, imagine being so defensive about being unaware and unconcerned about child rape that you have to try and mock people for caring about it.

AMAZING! Thanks for this.
