Thats a nice sister you have

And heres a guide to subs:

Subliminals are affirmations hidden in songs/rain sounds or any sounds so you cant hear the affirmations but your subconscious mind does

You can either find good subs on youtube like grow taller subliminal by KOTTIE(a great sub maker with great music taste)

Or make your own

1)Visualize your desires

Just because theres affirmations doesnt mean it works unless you know how your desires look

You also gotta 'fake it till u make it'. Basically act as if you have your desires

Don't obssess and always check in the mirror and be like "my results arent coming they dont work"

No they do, its because theres doubts and obssession with the desire, then your telling yr  subconscious mind that ur not tall

So you gotta do Visualization and Detach and just go with the flow and enjoy life!

2) Most recommended time of listening is before sleep or overnight

Because thats when yr conscious mind is not active and unaware and your subconscious mind takes over

Btw not all submakers are good, some make bad subs. Disclaimer when yr finding subs on youtube, check the description on the vid to see if you want the affirmations like

Grow taller and gain weight but u dont wnt to gain weight so find another one

Grow taller and thin then listen to that!

Or ask for advice

Some submakers wont put the affs but its like good so the conscious mind doesnt know and be aware and the subconscious mind does better

Cherry subs for example is trustworthy

You can ask on Reddit or anyone or yr sis which submaker is gud or not

Sry if this is rlly long

You can DM me if u still wnt to learn more

Btw just saying but yr usernames a bit disturbing unless its a joke, cause being negative doesnt rlly help a lot and its better when yr being positive
