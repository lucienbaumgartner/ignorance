&gt; Everybody should receive a sentence that is appropriate for the crime they committed.

&gt; So black men get harsher sentences than white. I wonder if that might factor in somewhere.

These two things are not mutually exclusive. You do know that, right? Black men being punished more severely than white men doesn't prove black men receive harsher penalties than are appropriate for the crime they committed, so I don't really get why you would single that part of the comment out (probably because you have no rebuttal to the rest of the comment).

Also, this comment chain is actually about racial bias in *policing*. The statistics up above relate solely to stopping, detaining, and arresting individuals, not what sentences they later receive, if any. 

But in any case, the difference between the sentences of black men and white men (19%) is significantly smaller than the difference between the sentences of white men and black women (30-35%), yet you only ever hear and talk about the racial disparity. You can't get upset when people point out how hypocritical and ignorant that is.
