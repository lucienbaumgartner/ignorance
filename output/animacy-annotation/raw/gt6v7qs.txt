Honestly the best way to keep shit like the last four years from happening again long-term is probably to push hard for better quality public education. Americans being broke, sick, stupid and ignorant of history/unable to think critically is what led people to vote for trump. That and voter suppression. Georgia is showing the gop tipping their hand for their future plans.
