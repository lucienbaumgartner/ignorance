It's difficult to think deeply about things when you're working as much as a lot of people have to, and when all your free time is taken up with trying to decide which utility payment to skip this month.

And then the ruling class doesn't make it any easier with their divisive propaganda, and media doesn't give a shit about anything other than advertising dollars.

The system is designed to keep the proletariat at odds with each other and unaware of class dynamics, it's functioning as intended.

I mean, the answer to that is kinda in your question, kinda dialectical...

I get it though, for quite some time I was like "Nah, fuck that shit, that's for people that don't have to really struggle," then I realized that's the entire point of socialism.
