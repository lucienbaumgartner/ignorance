same happened to my friend,he actualy had a half of g of coke in his wallet, quite hidden but he was not aware and he flew like 4 or 5 times to locations like thailand, malaysia etc which is extremely dangerous, he found out when he came back to europe half a year later.

I told him he is a first class idiot, but guess what, because you are not aware you are trafficking, you are perfectly calm and unaware of any danger, meaning you fly under the radar, they spot the suspects by nervous behaviour ,weird looks, anxiety, shaking, sweat etc. so that being said, you were quite lucky just as my friend, ignorance is bliss in this case, but please be careful next time :D
