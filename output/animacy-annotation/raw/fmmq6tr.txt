With all due respect, how the hell do you know what their grievances are? 
 
People use this exact framing to talk about "ghettos" and I hope you recognize how limited and ignorant that is. I mean, how did Marion Barry get reelected, and all that stuff. 

And no, West Virginia is not shown deferential treatment by "white America". Your attitudes and stereotypes come from somewhere and they're widely held and go back centuries.

Did you know that West Virginia split off from Virginia to stay in the Union rather that join the Confederacy? Did you know miners have been some of the biggest and militant labor organizers in the US (google Harlan County coal war)? Did you know that Henry Louis Gates, Jr was born in West Virginia, the descendant of Melungeons, who were/are communities throughout Appalachia of free multi-racial going back to around 1700? Or that the United Mine Workers were some of the fiercest defenders against the KKK?

Did you know that most Trump voters have higher than average incomes? Or are you not holding the oligarchs of New York and San Francisco responsible for anything that happens in the world? Because the last time I checked, Mark Zucker and Peter Theil and Steve Bannon had a lot more to do with Trump's election than people in West Virginia. 

And I won't even mention coastal racism here.
