It’s not 400 years ago, it’s 233. I think it’s interesting how quickly people want to put things wayyyy back in history, nearly doubling the preceding years. 

I would also say that not caring about ‘some event’ that occurred 233 years ago is quite dismissive and ignorant of the genocide that has resulted from that event. It’s no good thing to be deliberately ignorant of the history of the country you’re living in.
