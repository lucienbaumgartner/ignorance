“I don’t know why the hell people are upvoting someone who claims such a thing.” That was unnecessary, as I tried to make it clear I was confused and unaware of how people have been affected by each of the words discussed. There have been many people who responded to me, and I thank all of them for their insight. I understand your point, too, so thank you for your opinion.
