NTA to the fullest extent. You are the most non-AH I’ve ever seen, except to yourself. You shouldn’t be so hard on yourself for something you did when you were 5. I’ve had two 5 year olds, and they were so fearless and unaware of the consequences to dangerous behavior. You had no idea you would get hurt jumping off the stairs. You also didn’t know going to the hospital would cause an accident causing you to lose your father.

Your mother on the other hand sounds like one of the biggest AHs ever. She’s the one who chose to marry someone who wouldn’t treat you with love and kindness. When I remarried, I made sure my husband would treat my kids like his own, and he does. She’s even more awful for blaming you for the past 12 years for the death of your father. She has failed you as a mother. 

I truly hope you get into therapy. I can’t imagine the guilt you feel on top of your mother treating you so poorly. I sincerely hope you can get some peace of mind about the accident.

Also, please make sure for at least the time being you block your mother and step-father. Have your grandparents run interference since they seem to have your best interests at heart. You don’t need the extra stress on top of everything else that’s going on.

Good luck dear. Please remember, you were a small child, there’s reasons why we don’t let them make most of their decisions for them at that age. You deserve so much better than how you’ve been treated.
