OP: I was at the concert for two out of the four days (couldn't go on Friday due to work, next concert is on Tuesday). This is a feature of the show but I was completely unaware and shocked so I didn't film anything on the Saturday. Sunday I was in a better position and I knew it was coming so I was ready. I am sorry I missed the beginning of Jae's singing though!
