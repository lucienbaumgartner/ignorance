&gt; Just because you're repeating it doesn't make it a fact. It's 100% speculative,

To what degree? See, this is you actually denying the lived experiences of POC so you can insert your ideology over actual reality.

 &gt;nor do you have any idea what my ideology is comprised of beyond stating that's illegal for a 13 year-old to possess a handgun - which is a fact.

I know enough based on your arguments here in this thread. If you had a view you weren't afraid of being called out for, and especially that I was wrong about (especially that) you'd state it. So, I'm right, again. 

&gt;That's myopic, ignorant, and hilariously racist. "

OMG LOL. Talking about white racism is racist. Fucking lol. 

Whiteness in the US is so gatekept that my Italian-Brazilian friend (who is considered white in Brazil, as he is) is constantly clocked as not-white here in the US because he's tan (moorish looking). In Europe (where I've also been with him) he is also white, nobody confuses him for a non-European there. If you are any shade of not paper white you are BROWN in the USA due to how color-obsessed we are here (and ignorant). That kid is BROWN. You are totally fucking imagining a full on lie of existence to state there was any chance that kid would'be been perceived as white by the MNPD, and that's why they shot him...that it had nothing to do with racism! Talk about "speculation".

FOH.
