Their complaints are hardly "little mistakes" and phrasing it that way displays obvious bias, as does pretending they were the only two contestants who had these issues.  She owed them regular meals, sleep, and hydration while they were under her/the producers care. She owed them some semblance of concern for their mental well being, and not to exploit their issues/problems for good tv. None of which seemed to happen with any regulatory, nor were "little mistakes". Also, particularly in early cycles, girls thought they would receive mentoring/have a career from this show bc the show 100% presented it as such and they were young and unaware of the shady side of modeling and reality tv. Pretending Tyra is armored from any and all criticism bc she smiled and acted well intentioned is super gluing the rise tinted glasses to ones face.
