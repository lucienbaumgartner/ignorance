I believe they’re referring to 1488, a common nazi dog whistle. 14 represents “The 14 words” a nazi slogan that says “We secure the existence of our people and a future for white children”. Whereas 88 represents the 8th letter of the alphabet so 88 stands for HH or heil Hitler.

Sometimes nazis will just post 88 on its own which is embarrassing for me since I was born in 1988, and back when I was young and ignorant of this fact I would put 88 in all of my usernames 😑.
