He refers to it as ''my curse'' which implies he was the one who reactivated it, and if he didn't, then it suggests he is unaware and incompetent about who reactivated it, which is just sad for the final villain.

Even if it was Merlin, it's still honest shit she even was allowed to tamper with the curse, since it breaks the whole rule of only someone on the equal level of the Gods being able to break or manipulate it.

Just another case of another important plot point/rule of the story being broken so the plot can move forward and the author can introduce further conflict, suggesting he can't write a decent story without resorting to cheap shit.
