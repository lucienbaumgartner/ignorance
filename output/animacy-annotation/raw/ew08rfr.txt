 I know. It’s really sad. Because this is truly so beautiful. It makes me so angry that people make photo shopped images like this, because there are so many real trees like this! It takes away from the wonder and beauty that exists that really is true. And it makes the skeptics who are unaware and cynical, joke even more, and think that the truth is even more silly than they already think. Breaks my heart.  It is very disrespectful to these beautiful spirits, as well. People making Photoshop pictures like this. Because there are so many real ones like this. I wish people didn’t do that
