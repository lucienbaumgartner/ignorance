You are so dumb. The house made the bill, but stripped the $15 min wage. It was originally in the bill in the house. It's a well reported fact, idiot.

Then Bernie, being the chair of the budget committee, tried to add it in through a vote in the senate. Then **DEMS** didn't vote for it.

You are screaming that it's the republicans, but everytime it's the Dems. You are just so dumb and ignorant of how government works. You keep crying the republicans are mean, but it's the Dems.

If Biden doesn't hold his party responsible then it's on him to force them to vote for the dem agenda or turn the dem party against those politicians and get them primaried out of their jobs.

Progressives voted for results not broken promises. Do it or lose support. Being a cry baby bitch about mean republicans when Dems have the power to change what they want doesn't do shit for anyone, including yourself.
