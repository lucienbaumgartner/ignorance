Thank you all so much for your insight. I absolutely do not take the idea of reconnecting on another plane with him lightly and have given much consideration to the fact that his spiritual self may be confused and unaware that he is no longer here. While I am seeking comfort for myself and want to know that he is ok, I am not educated enough in this to make any attempts for that kind of connection. I have much reading to do and really appreciate that you all have taken your time to respond. Thank you.
