Fascinating thought. It seems such a bizarre book for Rory to recommend - but what if that's why she suggested he read it? Not for any other reason than to let him know she admires a literary character who's rather like Jess? A literary flirtation, like Jess annotating her copy of *Howl and Other Poems*. 

Full disclosure: I read *The Fountainhead* as a teenager, and although the philosophy behind it left me cold, the book actually is well written and has an engaging story. Even though it's a real door stopper, it's not difficult to read, either. I didn't find it weird that Rory enjoyed it, but I thought it was brave to recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't have at the same age, and I was *far* more ignorant and na√Øve about its politics and how it fit into American society and culture than Rory.
