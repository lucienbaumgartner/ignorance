I think that at least vaccines should be mandated and universal testing maybe 3 times a semester for delta. I think it’s incredibly privileged and ignorant of students to maintain that they don’t want any reasonable measures against covid because they are “young and healthy” (think about immunocompromised students, or nontraditional students or faculty, especially those with kids to protect or to be there for) and that a semester is not a semester without partying (are you really just going to school to party? As people have said, tell this sentiment to people that can’t go to school).
