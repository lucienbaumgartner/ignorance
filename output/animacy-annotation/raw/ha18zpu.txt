**PART 2**

&gt;The importance is simply in stopping to ponder whether it is congruent to the nature of God, who you rightly call “The Perfection and Giver of Peace”, to communicate with his chosen prophet in a manner so discordant and abrasive for him.

I have pondered. And I have come to the conclusion that discord and abrasiveness are two attributes that are completely dependent on human subjectivity, and that the Divine works in mysterious ways so it is incomprehensible to continue to ponder on its nature.
  


&gt;You said he was depressed by the gap between revelations and was intending to kill himself from sadness. I’m pointing out that Ibn Ishaq/Hisham’s statement that Muhammad had serious doubts about his prophethood, which persisted after the death of Waraqa, is actually much a better fit for the hadith data, which do not explicitly give a reason. I’m further suggesting that given all the odd things we find in the traditions, Muhammad’s first impressions may have been correct.

I see. And if your mission was to convince me then you have failed since the evidence you bring forth does not lead to that conclusion. Quite the contrary, the Prophet's life, character, and actions all point to Prophethood. So if you wish to toil away trying to change my mind you may go ahead but if this is the best you can do I would leave it for a Muslim more susceptible and ignorant of their faith.
