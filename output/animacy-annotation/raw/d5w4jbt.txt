&gt;he couldn't help but notice that the Bernie or Bust and third party crowds seem to be overwhelmingly made up of Americans whose lives wouldn't necessarily be changed by a Drumpf presidency

yup yup yup. The most obnoxious thing about it too, is that the rhetoric these people are using is "You can't make me vote out of fear!" without realizing *they have nothing to fear for!* If you're a 22 y/o white upper middle class male, sure, your life will be fine if Trump becomes president. Of course you won't vote out of fear. Stop pretending like voting for Stein or Johnson is morally superior and realize it's a privilege to only be angry, and not terrified at this election. It's an extremely unaware and entitled viewpoint and it makes me so mad.
