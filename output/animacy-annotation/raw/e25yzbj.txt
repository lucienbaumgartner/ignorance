I also think the age makes a difference.

A four or five year old, in general, knows that hitting is unacceptable behavior.

A one year old doesn't necessarily understand. If I'm in a class with one-year-olds, I usually exaggerate my reaction with a firm "Ow!" because the point is to teach the child that hitting/biting, etc hurts. 

I also think that knowing your children and trying to figure out what is causing the behavior makes a huge difference. Is the child hitting because she's frustrated because you told her she can't do something? Is she overly stimulated/excited and unaware that she's hitting? If it's the second, maybe it's time to transition to a quiet activity.
