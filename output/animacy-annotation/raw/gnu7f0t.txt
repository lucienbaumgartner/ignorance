“Curating isn’t undemocratic or ‘elitist,’ a term that is now used so often that it’s become meaningless. It’s an act of generosity — you’re sharing what you love and what has inspired you. (The best streaming platforms, such as the Criterion Channel and MUBI and traditional outlets such as TCM, are based on curating — they’re actually curated.) Algorithms, by definition, are based on calculations that treat the viewer as a consumer and nothing else.”

He is saying that we are all too stupid and ignorant of *real* cinema to consume what we enjoy. And only those enlightened superior beings, like Scorsese, know what’s good. And we should be grateful that they’ve shared their curated art with us.

It’s condescending elitist bullshit.
