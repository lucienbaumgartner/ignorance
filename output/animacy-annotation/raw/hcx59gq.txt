I have tested my bones against Metal, Concrete, Rocks, Ice and Wood from height and with speed multiple times - they failed to break me.   You are just weak and unaware that you should avoid adventure in such a frail state. Those who offered guidance in your life clearly failed to enlighten you about the benifits of a high cheese diet - they failed you and left you to suffered eternally with inferior bones.
