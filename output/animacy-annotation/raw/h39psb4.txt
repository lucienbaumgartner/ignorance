Yikes. Talk about a biased reply.

Has Joao Felix gotten up from being constantly run over and get the shit kicked out of him anytime he had the ball or are we going to keep playing pretend this is imaginary sport where Belgium deserves to be handheld all the way home?

Havenâ€™t encountered fans this entitled and ignorant of football so far.
