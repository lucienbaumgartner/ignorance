I how are going to call me ignorant and unable to understand your comment when you can't even offer any explanation for your claim what so ever. Naruto never even destroyed the moon, he blocked an attack that cut the moon in half. And that attack didn't even destroy the moon either, the moon just came back together immediately after that. Also how are you going to compare destroying the moon to destroying the earth, when the earth contains more durable elements, is 400% bigger, and has a lot greater gravitational force. Also next time, why don't you come up with your own explanation instead of parroting the theory of someone who can't understand how difficult it is to destroy a planet like earth
