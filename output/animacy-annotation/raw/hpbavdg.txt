OMG Bro Seriously? Thatâ€™s what you automatically jump to? You think the reason I donâ€™t think Cyborg should be part of the JL is because heâ€™s black? MY GOD talk about jumping to insane conclusions. If you had read any of my responses you would know the real reason and besides I have no problem with John Stewart Green Lantern being a member of the League. Itâ€™s people like you who are racist. How does it feel to be a miserable, bitter, ignorant and insufferable asshole. Itâ€™s people like you whoâ€™ve kept me from Reddit. GOD youâ€™re a DICK!ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
