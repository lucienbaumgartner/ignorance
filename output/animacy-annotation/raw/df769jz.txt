Easily the most embarrassing and damaging thing to happen to the US and it's ideas of 'exceptionalism', in the entire history of that country.

The US even seems mostly unaware and unconcerned that the rest of the world is appalled. See what happens when they next try and form a 'coalition of the willing'. It will be just Texas and Alabama.

No self-respecting nation would ever follow this president into war. The US is currently alone, militarily speaking.
