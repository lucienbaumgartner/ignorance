idk if that's the right thing to do. would you warn his next girlfriend? 

I'd be surprised if that's where his lying stops.

I dated a guy like that for a couple years. it is world shattering when you realize the person you love never even existed

he definitely came from an abusive home but that's not my problem 

its been 10 years and I still assume everyone is a liar. unfortunately it's almost always true so you never get to go back to being blissful and ignorant of how shitty &amp; insane people are
