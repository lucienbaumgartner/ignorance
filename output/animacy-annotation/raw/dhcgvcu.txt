&gt; I didn't read it that way quite. He was having a few pointed jabs at the political process and at Clinton where he only gets a wave because he didn't contribute enough. 

He wasn't talking about the political process.  He was talking about the left demeaning government, dropping civics education, "and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."

There's nothing there about the political process.  It is about how the left maintains control.
