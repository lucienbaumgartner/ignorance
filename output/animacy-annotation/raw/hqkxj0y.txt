&gt; This not my business but yours attitude is what's behind half of the world's problems.

I think you meant to say "People with these kinds of opinions is what's behind half of the world's problems". Pretty ironic coming from someone who doesn't even know the difference between what the words "attitude" and "opinion", especially from a dude who's literally talking about ignorance and stupidity. 

It's the usual Indian "superiority complex" BS, right? If you don't like an opinion, attack it. If you can't attack the opinion? Attack the person. Just call someone dumb and ignorant and be done with it and go back to business as usual. Takes one to know one I guess.

By the way, there's something also called as "excess revenue generation" and "loans". Something you might not be familiar with seeing as you clearly struggled during school in your formative years. Tax is not a zero sum game like you're making it out to be as there wouldn't a single government anywhere in the world if that was the case. All "existing liabilities" are accounted for and there are budget hearings for that along with future planning and development with regards to every single governmental department there is. Any and all excesses are deposited to the RBI's reserves and last time the government checked, they had around 620 Billion USD in the piggybank.
