You are incredibly naive and ignorant of what you’re dealing with and the coarse it will take. Just go to a doctor and get treated. One is easily curable, and the other goes away with 1 pill a day and a doctor visit once a year. You’re being childish. Just see a dr, maybe a psychiatrist as well, and if you still want to die, do it in a more interesting, less painful and pathetic way.
