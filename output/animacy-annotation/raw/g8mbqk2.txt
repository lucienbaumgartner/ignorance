to be fair, if trump wins, the status quo is gone. the real problem is that those “burn the system down” assholes think that it could be replaced by something better, because it wouldn’t. power vacuums are *never* filled by people who want democracy or justice. they’re so fucking spoiled and ignorant that they can’t even imagine a world where they aren’t safe.
