And I'll address Biden in a second comment. You pulled that last comment as a little "gotcha", but here's a shocker bud. I fuckin hate Biden. I wish my president wasn't a geriatric POS that could barely string a coherent sentence together. I had the same issue with Trump. 

The problem with modern political parties, republicans included, is that they don't actually stand for shit. You just have a team that you blindly root for without understanding how the political institutions work. They want you to be combative and ignorant of history. Congrats on playing into their hands.
