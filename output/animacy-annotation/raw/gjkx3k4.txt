Not gonna lie, been doing bodybuilding for almost 20 years, and the only injuries that have ever stopped me from regular exercise, have been from sleeping wrong. Like twisting my neck, borderline dislocating my shoulder, getting caught in the blanket and tripping out of bed, faceplanting into the wall at the side of my bed.

Basically the bed is a deathtrap and sleep is just nature's trick to make you disoriented and unaware of the dangers.
