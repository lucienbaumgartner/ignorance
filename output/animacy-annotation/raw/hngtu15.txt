They are, correct. But they're not the same God.

Seriously, if you believe in the idea of God, then you have to have a religious text. And if our religious texts are different...... Hey! That means it's a different religion!

Hey, that means it's a different god!

Just because we both have a monotheistic religion, that has *similar roots, which I never denied*, does not mean we worship "the same god". THAT is foolish, and ignorant of both our religions.

That's like calling a steak and a hamburger the same thing. Yeah, they both came from a cow, but you should probably use your brain and figure out how they're clearly not the same thing.
