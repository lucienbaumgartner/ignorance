I would suggest writing a letter if sitting down to talk face to face isn't an option. 

Make it a true apology. Acknowledge that you were wrong and ignorant. That you are ashamed of your past behavior. Tell him that you understand if he cannot forgive you (don't demand forgiveness or that he "move on") but tell him that you truly appreciate how good he is to your daughter.

I would also suggest a good sit down with your daughter too. Convey the same thing and let her know how much you love her. And that her happiness is what matters to you.
