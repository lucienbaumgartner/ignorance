"To Build a Fire" by Jack London, it's a short story. I've read the 1908 version, though I know there is an older and less known version too. I think I've first read this short story when I was in 6th grade, it made me realize how humans are just animals as well and without our "modern tools" we are very vulnerable in nature. 

We are not likely to survive because we don't really have the skills, perhaps the skills our long gone ancestors had in the wild we no longer carry, because we developed a culture and society in which survival is not a matter of concern anymore --in other words, we became way too comfortable and ignorant of our animalistic nature. 

Also in this story there was this dog, Husky I think, following the unknown man who is our main character. When things got dangerous we had hints that the dog already understood the man is weak, that the weather is too cold for human to survive etc. Dog was smart, dog was wise, dog waited for the man to die and then left to search for food on his own. It was harsh cold reality of death, the dog didn't wait there in snow and cry for his owner, but just left to search food so he can survive...
