It's from a Nina Simone song. I mean music is inherently Satanic. Artists usually sell their soul or grow up in generational Satanic cults. They are the illuminati's puppet, at the least. Rebellious and with intent to steal your soul, in truth and at their worst. They get possesed by demons. Their music involves spell casting, in order to keep the masses asleep and unaware of the reality of the creator, Yahuah, and the savior, Yahusha.
