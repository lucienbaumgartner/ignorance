Conservative and liberals have called me one or the other but honestly, itâ€™s whatever. 

Conservative beliefs: 

- I believe that the United States must continue to be the militarily, economically, culturally, and politically strongest and most powerful nation on the planet where no one will challenge our strength. If I had my way, the United States will continue to the the global superpower until the end of days or whenever the sun burns itself out and wipes our entire planet out of existence. 

- I believe in possessing the strongest and most powerful military in the world and Iâ€™m not opposed to our global military presence. Because of our military strength and international presence, weâ€™ve been able to fight for our interests in far-away places, defend our allies, keep maritime trade routes open and free, stand up to countries like China, as well as help people all over the world by providing humanitarian assistance (whenever a large and catastrophic natural disaster hits, weâ€™re usually the first and/or the largest force to respond). If I had my way, the US military will be the most powerful force in all human history until a massive meteorite wipes our planet out or whatever. 

-  If I had my way, every single law-abiding American who is mentally fit and capable would be encouraged to have guns of any kind. You want an AR-15? No problem. You thinking about getting that AK-75? Have at it. You want a fully functional M61 Vulcan autocannon? You got it. I also think that some gun laws (e.g. limited magazine sizes) are incredibly stupid and ignorant of reality and were only passed to appease those who donâ€™t have a clue about guns or the dangers of the real world. Shit, I wish that I could buy an M777 along with all of the projectiles that come with it without having to pay a ton of money just for the paperwork alone. 

- I have no problems with patriotism. I am a very proud and extremely patriotic American and I love my country along with the Constitution. I believe that weâ€™re one of the greatest nations on the planet and despite our flaws, we will always come out strong. 

- Identity politics and a lot of the other actions of SJWs are stupid and serve little purpose. I also hate how everything is now made about race and in some circles, Iâ€™m suppose to have a particular view or feeling towards something just because of the fact that Iâ€™m Asian. 

- I support the police. Call me a bootlicker if you want (oh no an overused insult thatâ€™s only used when you canâ€™t come up with a good argument wow you did a great job hurting my fragile feelings ðŸ™„) but I support the police due to the fact that they have a thankless job and will get shitted on by people no matter what they do or donâ€™t do. And they will continue to keep doing their job despite all of the hate. Props to them for being able to go through all of the hatred and insult while still maintaining their bearing. 

- Capitalism is a great system of economics/socio-economics since it (ideally) gives the common man the power and ability to become wealthy if they work hard enough and have discipline, dedication, and can hustle in order to get what they want. 

Liberal views: 

- Iâ€™m not totally sure that Iâ€™m completely sold on the idea of universal healthcare but I do believe that healthcare should be more accessible to the public. I understand the logic as to why hospital bills are pretty expensive at times but I still think that medical care shouldnâ€™t be as expensive as it is right now. 

- I think that the minimum wage should be raised in order to accommodate things like where people live. 

- I strongly believe in education and I think that having an educated society that can critically think will do wonders for our country and our progress as a nation. 

- Not a big fan of religion being somewhat prevalent within some conservative circles. 

- Iâ€™m pro-choice. I can understand the reasoning behind being pro-life but I think that the woman has the ultimate say in her choice since itâ€™s her body thatâ€™s cooking up a baby. Why should anyone get a say in how she wants to handle herself, especially if sheâ€™s mentally capable to make her own decisions? 

- While I support the police and think that shit like ACAB is stupid, we have to face reality and accept that like every single other profession out there, shitty assholes slip through the cracks and become cops. They need to be weeded out of their departments and they have absolutely no reason to be wearing their badge and uniform.
