She's lying. Even at 36, if she's a decent person, she wouldn't literally be running men off. She's not just run if the mill toxic either. She's probably worse than that. One did jokes that he was about to fall in love. 

Then he ghosts her. 

Makes me wonder what she said or did. More than likely she non chalantly told on herself about doing some sideways shit. And the both bounced. But because she is delusional, and unaware of herself and other people, she cannot remember the specific thing she said that made them run for the hills. 

You really have to read between the lines with posts like this. She's lying. And withholding important information.
