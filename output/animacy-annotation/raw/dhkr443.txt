Bro, youre citing snopes, man. Honestly, what makes you think these guys are reporters of investigators? 

Buddy, you need some red pills. Snopes, politifact, Wikipedia, google, facebook, twitter. All fking in the bag. You were on the wrong side this election. Youd know all of this. 

 Did you see the podesta email or the soros email talking about creating a "progressive echochamber". What about the podesta email from Bill Ivey from the national endowment of the arts? 

 "weâ€™ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."

 Buddy, youre the compliant and unaware theyre talking about. 

Did you see Hillarys wall street speech transcripts? She told them she would need a private position and a public position (you know, for us dumb rubes). Why do you defend her, i must ask. Honestly, i never understood why anyone would vote her? It seemed like they just hated Trump and she was lesser of 2 evils. I still dont know how people can come to that conclussion.
