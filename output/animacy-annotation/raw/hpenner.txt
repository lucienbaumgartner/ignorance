Whenever I hear old people complaining about young people being woke or soft it is always in context to young people not putting up with clear hate and discrimination. Demanding that people be better and show compassion and understanding isn't being soft. Old people and some younger conservatives are just upset that people are calling them out for being ignorant and rude.
