If you read the comments, people are saying it is an inappropriate place for the protest. That is what most people are unhappy about.

If these people want to protest, i dint agree with them on their stance, but they do have that right. Doing it in front of hospitals, in the middle of a pandemic is wholly irresponsible and ignorant of these protestors. They should have protested at parliament in vic or at their local mp's office, you know, the people that actually put these rules into effect, not healthcare workers doing their best to get us through the pandemic.
