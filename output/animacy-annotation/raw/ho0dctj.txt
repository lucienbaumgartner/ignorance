OP doesn't have a reason why masks shouldn't be used by children in schools, but refuses to anyways because they inexicably consider their reflexive decision to withdraw their kids to be "apartheid" and mask wearing to be "gagging". 

OP believes the science about whether mask wearing facilitates reduction in covid-19 transmission to be "shaky" on the basis that OP believes that if you can find a study supporting that statement, you can find another arguing with it. [I would invite OP to try to find a similarly up-to-date and extensive meta-analysis as this in opposition](
https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-068302). I could well be wrong here, but I don't think the literature is as rife with rebutting evidence as they think.

OP believes that 5-12 year olds should be included in the debate on mask wearing. While a 5-12 year old may provide insight and perhaps a positive role model in a debate with OP, I don't see utility in prepubescent children debating public health if OP is so dismissive and ignorant of adult, expert scientists and public health officials.

Maybe OP wpuld ask 5-12 year olds for insight on whether people should eat nothing but candy? Or whether people should stay up all night jumping on the bed and telling ghost stories?
