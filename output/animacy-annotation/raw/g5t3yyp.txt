So... You guys have heard of people like Bezos and Musk right? If it was a "holy shit moment" realising some people make $3m per month, just take a moment to consider how those guys make that kind if money *every hour*.

The vast majority of Americans don't realise how poor they are. Most of them even think they are "middle class" just because they have a big car on finance and a mortgage on a 4 bedroom house they can just about afford. The reality is they are still wage slaves- just one missed paycheck would take everything from them. No healthcare, the car gets towed, the house repossessed, and they're nobody again. 

Other countries have a more realistic perspective on class and inequality, but America is the source and influence for so much of the world's culture today. Americans are, for the most part, absolutely fast asleep and unaware of the state of the world around them.
