Ahem, the Rwandan genocide **was** fueled by racism. Specifically, the racism of the Belgian colonial powers, who used their crazy racist ideas to divide the population into two groups, giving the smaller one power and slightly better conditions so it was easier to control the country. That group was the one that was attacked during the genocide. So reducing it to "black on black" is both reductive and ignorant of the historical context.
