The fact that you say it has to be with regards to water is my whole point. The only objectivity is the temperature at a given time. If it is 32degrees can be subjectively freezing or boiling depending on whether you're water or nitrogen. A system containing both can't be said to be objectively either unless you're being colloquial and only referring to the temperature of water. But colloquialisms are not the foundation of truth.

Which is the whole point. We use our colloquial understanding of things to prescribe Good/Evil onto external events. A man killing a baby is generally agreed to be "evil." What if he only did so because he was a madman that had a vision the baby would kill millions? What if he was right and the baby was Adolf Hitler? What if the man wasn't a madman but a time-traveler? Would the time traveler be evil for killing the child, or a hero for trying to prevent the deaths of millions? What if the end result was actually something worse than the Holocaust? Is he good or evil then?

If evil is what prevents life from increasing in intelligence and awareness, is it good to murder the unintelligent and unaware that spreading unintelligence and unawareness?

IMO it's all semantics that boil down to "what we want to see" vs "what we don't want to see" and is a byproduct of subjective conscious thought instead of a fundamentally objective natural force.
