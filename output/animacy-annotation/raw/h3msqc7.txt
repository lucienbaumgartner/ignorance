I fell for a very stupid scam once trying to sell furniture. They gave  me a check for more than the amount and said to send them back the rest in western union. It was my first time coming across this so it didn't click right away that it was off. If you weren't aware: If you cash a bad check it isn't the person who wrote the check who gets fucked over, its you. This is something I didn't know until this happened.   
LUCKILY right after I sent the money I realized this felt off, did a little more research and that's how I learned my bank was basically about to overdraft a lot of money. My bank was helpful and cancelled the check, and helped me get the western union recalled so I got a full refund minus the fee for the western union which was more than fair. Walmart has a surprisingly good policy to protect people who are scammed in this way as long as it's your first time (and if you don't learn after the first time that's on you).  


I've since learned it's cash only for this shit because a lot of scammers try to take advantage of people just trying to sell shit online.   


This happened maybe 10 years ago now btw when I was 20 and had never had any life experiences until then. Grew up in a neglectful family that didn't teach me shit so I was very young, naive, and unaware of what to look out for.   


The assholes who tried to scam me kept texting me for the ad trying to convince me of different ways to give them money it was shitty. I filed a police report with the info the bank managed to get from who's account the check belonged to coupled with the name they gave me for western union but nothing came of it.
