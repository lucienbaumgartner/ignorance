Only delusional one here is you. The fact that I'm even here makes you so mad and triggers you so much that all you can do is emotionally keep responding to a pointless conversation that any rational person would have ignored. All because I'm in your safe space, your bubble, your echo chamber, talking about real facts that you have no choice to deny. You have been conditioned into deny reality with a flood of misinformation because you can't cope with the fact the world sees you and will remember you as only a dangerous and delusional cultist. Which leaves you with nothing but lies, misinformation, projection, hypocrisy and delusion. It's sad that you are so blind and unaware of yourself that you can't see that you have proudly become everything you claim to hate about the left. It's all true about you and those you support. Every bit of it.
