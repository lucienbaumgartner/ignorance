I’m with you on the nanny stuff, it’s dismissive and ignorant of all the “other” stuff that goes into raising kids and running a family, such as directing education, selecting and arranging enrichment activities like music or art lessons, tracking on and encouraging social skills and growth, maintaining connections with extended family members snd friends, ensuring proper nutrition/exposure to a variety of food and cuisines, making sure they’re getting enough physical activity/sports, guiding emotional development, not to mention overseeing things like doctor, dentist, and therapist appts, etc etc etc. These things are being done by a parent and they are almost ALWAYS performed by the mother. It’s invisible/unnamed labor but it can require a great deal of output.
