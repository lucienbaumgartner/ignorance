Sorry, I'm a bit busy but I'll try to address some of your points.

To your first point - [RNC old email domains got hacked](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/comey-republicans-hacked-russia/), but nothing got leaked, even if it is old. I don't think it's implicated or alleged, James Comey outright says it.

Wikileaks would never confirm where their sources are from. Sure Trump has never been in politics, but look through the emails leaked - most of them aren't Clintons. Some people vote by party and not president, I would have thought you'd have known that. 

I'd also like to point out that considering it's an ongoing investigation, they may keep evidence private - last time there was an investigation (Hilary's emails) it unfairly shifted the political election without reason.

T_D also was yattering about pizzagate - while you may be reasonable, I honestly don't think them being in an uproar denotes credibility. 

&gt; some official communicating the plan to create an "unaware and compliant citizenry"

Link? I don't remember this one and there seems to be a critical lack of context.

&gt; donna brazile giving questions directly to hillary

In primary, not really all that damning, to be honest. It's bad, but it's not like "oh my god the democrats are all baby eaters".

&gt; other journalists from I believe MSNBC and WaPo asking for permission / guidance on how to report on Hillary after their interview so as to make her look best

Avoiding libel lawsuits? That's not really as bad as you think. I'd need to see the email for context.

Wow, Hilary's aids. Maybe they were just pissed off?

* Shows they rigged DNC primaries to screw Bernie out of winning the nomination.

Beyond Donna Brazile - how so? There were party politics, I didn't see the emails saying "Let's rig the primaries" 

&gt; one of her paid speeches to goldman sachs saying she was "very far removed from the middle class". 

Wait what? How could she say it in a speech? "Hi, my name is Hilary Clinton, I'm very far removed from the middle class, thanks for the money"?

Even if she did, in comparison, she was closer to the middle class than the guy who lives in a gilded penthouse in downtown new york who got a small loan of a million dollars. 

&gt; Needing a "public and a private position" on issues

Ooh, like a public and private position on how much golf the president should be playing? Trump said he "[wouldn't have time for golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMm6PcMIL0)" while running. Well, look at him now.

&gt;  who exactly is pushing the propaganda here. 

Implication is that Russia leaked false news from made up platforms.

Fox  is full of nuts - do you remember them attacking Obama for wanting [Dijon mustard on his burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAvq12Sa3VE)?

Oh and on notes of substantiated stories - Fox provided a platform for [Trump's birther movement](http://nation.foxnews.com/donald-trump/2011/03/30/trump-obama-maybe-hes-muslim). Also, private investigation.

Snopes and politifacts full answers tend to be very good, even if their simple ruling (tl;dr thing) aren't the most fair. I'd love to read some examples to the contrary with substantiated evidence.

Sorry if I missed anything - I'm headed back to work so I don't have time to review everything
