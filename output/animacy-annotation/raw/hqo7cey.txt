&gt; Karl Marx was not a real economist. His work basically amounts to a bunch of demagogueries where he points fingers at everyone and blames them for things not being the perfect utopia everyone dreams of. Never mind that he never worked a day in his life and had zero real-world experience to inform him of the realities of business....because people, in general, are very stupid and ignorant and economics is complicated and people just canâ€™t be bothered to learn it

The sheer irony!
