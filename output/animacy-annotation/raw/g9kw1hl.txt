Most players I've paired with dont even bother attuning at all they just run in and get slaughtered by super tanky enemies lol and then repeat, they also never target the priests etc in hostage missions and just agro the whole camp and get slaughtering, just a game though and most prob are new and unaware of the mechanics, giving them benefit of the doubt lol
