If you see my comments, I called Biden a fool. People on this thread asked why I'm attacking Trump supporters and not defending Biden. It's because I'm no fan of Biden and I think he is ignorant and deeply corrupt.

The purpose of quoting Trump is to show the inconsistencies of Trump supporters on this thread. You cannot question Biden's mental state and yet to this day actively support someone who asked if we could inject disinfectant into lungs. That really means you don't actually care about having a competent president. You just want one on your side.
