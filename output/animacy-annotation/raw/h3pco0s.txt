That’s fair, your response makes a lot of sense with that context. And while I do agree that age differences in partners aren’t necessarily indicative of issues, it’s been my experience having been on this sub for a while now that an age difference of 4 years or more (especially when one of the people is younger than 23) is almost always the first red flag.

I personally think age is a big factor here. He’s (presumably) had the benefit of an education or at the very least 5 additional years of life on this earth to experience emotional growth. It seems from his inability to communicate or compromise that he has decided to waste that time instead, not growing as a person, and partnering up with someone who has not had those 5 years to learn so they literally don’t know there could be better situations for them out there. OP’s comments highlight this, as she implies that he is the best partner she thinks she can find. 

People who are older tend to go for younger people because they are inexperienced and unaware of better opportunities out there. They’re either the same level of maturity as the person they’re dating, which means that additional time on earth was wasted NOT growing, or somehow they’re even more immature. They know people their age are aware of this and will not tolerate it, however people that are younger don’t know not to tolerate it yet so they likely will for a period of time.
