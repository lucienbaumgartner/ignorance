Look guy, you made a conscious decision not to call a taxi and thankfully only you were hurt, but your driving was so impaired you caused an accident. That's no better than firing bullets into the air and crying when one comes down and hits you. 

If someone else was drunk and hit you, you'd be shouting here for justice and that's just unaware and lacking introspection. You're pointing out that you were lucky enough not to mow down  children who have futures ahead of them and you're saying you should be, what, commended for it? Fuck off, man. I'm a parent and if some stupid, lazy, self absorbed fuck hit my kid and claimed afterward that at least he didn't hit two kids and should be commended, you'd better believe 10 grand would be the least of their worries.

As for the sympathy....get fucked. I used to work in health care and the damage I've seen from drunk driving on innocent people will be burned in my brain forever. You want sympathy? Do something that deserves it. 

Drunk driving is like firing a loaded weapon. Do you know how fucking heavy cars are? Go try to lift a mini cooper, you buffoon. Imagine gently laying that on your stomach. Now imagine it coming at you doing even 20mph with someone with dulled reaction times who can't stop the car in time. 

You want to go on a shooting spree, get shot, then complain you didn't even hit anyone so everyone should feel bad you're in jail and now have an owie you're beyond sympathy. You're actually psychotic.

All over a few bucks and having to dial a phone. 7 button presses could have saved you this but that was beyond what you felt like you wanted to do.

Go pay your DUI.
