I had a miscarriage around 6-7 weeks pregnant. The miscarriage started with cramps and spotting. Went from brown to red within the day. Woke up in the middle of the night curled up on the floor in a fetal position, completely confused and unaware of the magnitude of pain I was experiencing - I just slept it off instead of going to the hospital. By the next morning, the worst of the pain had subsided but I was still bleeding. It was by far the worst pain Iâ€™ve experienced, comparable to an ovarian cyst bursting.
