Bill Ivey [spoke the truth](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-compliant-citizenry/):

&gt; Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn’t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we’re off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his “George” magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I’m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking — and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

&gt; Let’s be clear about this: Jeff Zucker made a fortune creating Donald Trump at NBC; he made a fortune getting Trump elected with a billion dollars in free airtime; and he’s now making a fortune pretending to oppose Trump at CNN.'

Vox has declared [CNN is mainstreaming misinformation for Donald Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pS4x8hXQ5c), with their 'prioritization of drama and spectacle over serious truth telling'.

According to legendary news anchor Ted Koppel ‘[CNN’s Ratings Would Be in the Toilet Without Donald Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZOgnHUQ_P8)’

Jeff Zucker has now renewed [his contract as president of CNN Worldwide through 2020](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/jeff-zucker-renews-at-cnn-through-the-2020-election).

MediaQuant estimates over a [$1 billion lead in free media](https://www.mediaquant.net/2016/11/a-media-post-mortem-on-the-2016-presidential-election/) funneled to Donald Trump in 2016. Foreign meddling identified in the 2/16/2018 [Mueller indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download), meanwhile, is estimated to have been in the range of tens of millions of dollars. Domestic media coverage is [known to have impacted the election](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-presidential-primaries/), and yet this vital topic is largely ignored in our national dialogue on an ongoing basis. Political strategists have [attempted to overtly call this out](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/1/13803036/gop-boo-cnn-jeff-zucker-defense-trump-harvard), but now all we hear about from the media is the animosity passed back and forth between president, his supporters, and the press.

Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post offers [this analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeff-zuckers-singular-role-in-promoting-donald-trumps-rise/2016/10/02/7c3d4366-865b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html?utm_term=.ab28acb6f1a1):

&gt; Ratings. Clicks. Audience. Say what you will about Trump as a human being or a potential leader of the free world, he has an ineffable ability to get attention. He has called himself a “ratings machine,” and in the world of TV, ratings equal profit.

&gt; “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,” Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS, said of the Trump phenomenon in March, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

&gt; “The money’s rolling in, and this is fun. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

&gt; Moonves’s ebullience makes it clear that ratings madness infects all of commercial TV, although, of course, particularly the cable-news channels.

&gt; None rolled out the welcome mat more eagerly than CNN, which has billed itself as the “most trusted name in news.” And unlike Fox, which is blatantly conservative, CNN pitches itself as nonpartisan. It’s supposed to be the down-the-middle alternative to Fox and, on the left, MSNBC.

Despite [the narrative pushed by Donald Trump, CNN, and a majority of the mainstream media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/26/trump-blasts-cnn-am-tweet-blaming-me-bombings/?utm_term=.fab862c01663)---a symbiotic relationship clearly exists. Attacks between these parties obscure the true mutually beneficial nature of their relationship.

According to the The New York Times: [CNN Had a Problem. Donald Trump Solved It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html)

&gt;But then along came a presidential candidate who was a human breaking-news event. Trump provided drama and conflict every time he opened his mouth. So too did his growing band of surrogates, who were paid by either the campaign or the network, and in one case both, to defend his statements. Indeed, it often seemed disconcertingly as though Trump had built his entire campaign around nothing so much as his singular ability to fill cable news’s endless demand for engaging content.  
&gt;  
&gt;Had Trump lost the election, CNN would probably have returned to its previously scheduled struggle for survival. Instead, it has become more central to the national conversation than at any point in the network’s history since the first gulf war. And the man who is presiding over this historic moment at CNN happens to be the same one who was in some part responsible for Donald Trump’s political career. It was Zucker who, as president of NBC Entertainment, broadcast “The Apprentice” at a time when Trump was little more than an overextended real estate promoter with a failing casino business. That show, more than anything, reversed Trump’s fortunes, recasting a local tabloid villain as the people’s prime-time billionaire. And it was Zucker who, as president of CNN, broadcast the procession of made-for-TV events — the always news-making interviews; the rallies; debates; the “major policy addresses” that never really were — that helped turn Trump into the Republican front-runner at a time when few others took his candidacy seriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;CNN was hardly the only news organization to provide saturation coverage of the Trump campaign. The media-measurement firm mediaQuant calculated that Trump received the equivalent of $5.8 billion in free media — known as “earned media,” as opposed to paid advertising — over the course of the election, $2.9 billion more than Hillary Clinton. Nor is CNN the only cable-news network that has benefited from Trump’s incarnation as a politician. MSNBC and Fox News each had a surge in ratings during the election that has shown no signs of slowing since then. Fox, the president’s preferred outlet, is coming off the best quarter in the history of 24-hour cable news. MSNBC, the network of the resistance, has been thriving, too, often even beating CNN during prime time.  
&gt;  
&gt;But CNN was the first major news organization to give Trump’s campaign prolonged and sustained attention. He was a regular guest in the network’s studios from the earliest days of the Republican primaries, often at Zucker’s suggestion. (For a while, according to the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Trump referred to Zucker as his “personal booker.”) When Trump preferred not to appear in person, he frequently called in. Nor did CNN ever miss an opportunity to broadcast a Trump rally or speech, building the suspense with live footage of an empty lectern and breathless chyrons: “DONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE.” Kalev Leetaru, a data scientist, using information obtained from the TV News Archive, calculated that CNN mentioned Trump’s name nearly eight times more frequently than that of the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz, during the primaries.

In the words of [Drew Magary](https://www.gq.com/story/cnn-jeff-zucker-thinks-this-is-a-game):

&gt; There you have it. We are reduced to living in a TV industry where the head of CNN feels compelled to defend, to the President’s power-hungry son-in-law, his practice of employing a handful of people who refuse to actively support racism and sexism. It's not hard to see the profound effect that Zucker has had on Trump, and vice versa. Both men love ratings. Both men love attention. Both men love the art of spectacle, even when it's not backed by substance. Zucker treats the fate of the country like it's disposable entertainment, and Donald Trump does the same, and that is why nothing works.

Donald Trump is 'the media'.
