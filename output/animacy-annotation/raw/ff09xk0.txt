Here’s the thing - even if they were oblivious and ignorant that doesn’t undo the harm they did to the people. 

Even if they didn’t mean to, or didn’t want to, it doesn’t undo the mass death and suffering caused by their choices. I mentioned it in another comment, but I find that it’s very easy for people to be sympathetic to the rich, powerful and kind of likeable Noble families because they’re constantly portrayed as such in pop culture, and it’s very easy to ignore that their action (or inaction) hurt so many people.  

From the same [website ](https://www.biography.com/royalty/louis-xvi) , 

_“Louis XVI’s policy of not raising taxes and taking out international loans, including to fund the American Revolution, increased France’s debt, setting in motion the French Revolution. By the mid-1780s the country was near bankruptcy, which forced the king to support radical fiscal reforms not favorable with the nobles or the people.
When the pressure mounted, Louis XVI reverted to his earlier teaching of being austere and uncommunicative, posing no solution to the problem and not responding to others who offered help. By 1789, the situation was deteriorating rapidly.”_

He (and his govt) made awful decisions that resulted in a worsening of life for his people, and between that and the fact that he and his wife were the figureheads of lavish and luxurious life, makes it an obvious choice as to why they were targeted and killed - I do feel their treatment was too harsh, but I can’t fault the people either.
