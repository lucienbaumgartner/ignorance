please tell me how i’m “delusional” by telling this man to LET HER KNOW that she’s sleeping next to a violent abuser. again, unless you’ve been through this firsthand or have done any research into abusive relationships, you’re speaking from an ignorant and uneducated opinion. continuing to name call doesn’t get your point across boo.
