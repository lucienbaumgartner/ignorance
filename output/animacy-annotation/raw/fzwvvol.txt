Correct. The media completely ignored the emails of substance and instead focused on mundane emails. For instance, [this email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) is very enlightening of how they view us normal people and was not reported on at all;

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

Heck, people here still believe that Obama's worst controversy was wearing a tan suit when they aren't aware of his war on journalism, multiple new wars in the middle east, legalizing propaganda, record amount of deportations, etc... If the media reported on everything, just like they do with Trump, we would be in a much better place with an informed populace...the exact opposite of what the DNC wants according to their emails.
