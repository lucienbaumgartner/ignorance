Ah yes, someone who might understand why I chose the mighty over the crafty. I didn't care about charge time or battery life, or bowl size, or size-in-hand ("palm-ability"), or even that the crafty+ is a newer product than the mighty. . .what I cared about was that the crafty uses Micro-USB instead of usb-c. I would trust my life to any generic barrel-charger (like the mighty's) before putting any level of confidence in a standardized micro-usb.

I bought it when both were on discount so it was really only a $50 difference. Yet, I hate micro-usb so much I would spend an extra $50 in order to avoid it. It has failed me on every device that has had it.

I know it might be a user-issue and it might be my fault caused by some idiosyncracy in how I use items. But the FACT that I can be unaware and UNABLE to figure out what I'm doing wrong, leads me to believe that it's maybe a larger issue.

Please don't support micro-usb if you have the option. We need to work to put market pressure on companies to transition to usb-c. After all, having reliably obsolete items is only beneficial to companies selling underhandedly-short-life-items. It's economically not in our best interest to support micro-usb anymore. Additionally, It's simply bad for our ecology when companies profit by creating unnecessary or avoidable waste, instead of making products that last.

When I say that I am not trying to be critical of Storz&amp;Bickel, after all, I believe the crafty+ was designed before USB-C was commercially introduced (though I haven't confirmed this).

That concludes my TedTalk.
