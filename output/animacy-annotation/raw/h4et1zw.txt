Yea, I won’t lie and say it’s an easy balance to strike, but I try and keep a mentality of have some sympathy to the common soldier, there is a fair chance that they were conscripted, and among them there are some that can be considered innocent. However don’t let this bleed into revising history to say that the Whermacht as a whole was innocent and ignorant of what was going on, and to keep in mind that there were some that were pressed into service and were innocent, there were even more who signed up eagerly happy to help Germany kill people they viewed as sub human.
