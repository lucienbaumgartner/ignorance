&gt;Their decision is entirely arbitrary.

I mean, it's clearly not: https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2016/2016scc27/2016scc27.html

They spend many paragraphs explaining why and how they came to the decision. The man in question here had been waiting **four years** for a trial. That's insane.

&gt;Nope. That it's unreasonable.

Why?

&gt;Because 30 months is arbitrary and ignorant of reality.

You think that making someone wait almost 3 years in custody without trial is fair?!
