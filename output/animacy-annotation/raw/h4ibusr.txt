Yeah, but I got out lol. Hannah sounds VERY Naperville. Privileged and unaware of it and she's been told she's super special and smart. Granted, she graduated college early and all but I've recently learned most child geniuses just peak earlier and people catch up. Plus, I think a lot more people could probably complete high school and college early but they aren't encouraged to do so.
