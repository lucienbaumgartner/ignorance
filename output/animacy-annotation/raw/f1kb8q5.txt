You're telling me that in less than 16 years (since I've been in college) critical thinking is completely gone from society? Everyone besides me is so impressionable and ignorant that watching a YouTube video can turn a normal, rational human being into a terrorist? Is that true? Everyone who watches YouTube or sees a shitty poster is immediately at risk of being radicalized?

I don't have any way to disprove that, but it seems like quite a stretch to me that college students are so  stupid that watching YouTube is going to make them hate minorities.

It sounds like the "video games cause violence" argument in a different wrapper.
