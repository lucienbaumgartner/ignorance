This is an interesting topic. A lot of great blog posts have been written about this by varius OSR bloggers. [Goblin Punch on OSR Style Challanges](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html) might be what you are looking for. [Zaks post on Different Kinds of Player Skill](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/05/kinds-of-player-skill.html?zx=b67f2020f4755836) is also good (it is important to note that "player skill" as used when talking in the OSR excludes things like character building in Pathfinder, even though it requires player skill to build an effective Pathfinder character). [Combat as Sport vs Combat as War](http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?317715-Very-Long-Combat-as-Sport-vs-Combat-as-War-a-Key-Difference-in-D-amp-D-Play-Styles) captures how OSR games approaches combat. 

&gt;From what I understand of OSR design sensibilities, this very powerful enemy may be so powerful in an OSR version of this same interaction that the party is highly incentivized to resort to combat last. The party might instead study the enemy and its motivations and cater to or subvert those motivations in order to coerce the enemy to give the party what it wants. Is this a reasonable understanding of how OSR approaches combat versus more modern games?

Yes and no. You assume that the party is on a collision course with a very powerful enemy. If you are in this situation in an OSR game, you probably have already lost, unless the party has an advantage. Lets look at [Better than any Man](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116452/Better-Than-Any-Man) as an example of an OSR adventure. There are some very powerful beings in the adventure. But at the start, they are unaware and uninterested in the PCs. If the PCs manage to piss one of these beings of in a way in which they know the PCs are responsible, the adventure is going to get a lot harder. The best plan of action for the PCs is to try to avoid these powerful beings as much as possible (while still stealing their stuff). Direct confrontation is suicidal. If Better than any Man started with *"And btw, The Seven knows you are here, they know who you are, they hate you and they will try to kill you"*, the adventure would be tough.

Also, TPKs are less of a deal in OSR games. If the party manages to piss of a dragon who promptly burns them all to crisps, you can laugh about it, roll up new characters in 5 minutes and continue to game. 

Edit: I forgot ["What is Tested?"](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/05/what-is-tested.html)! Goblin Punch's posts surely is the source of all OSR knowledge!
