Bill Ivey, former National Endowment of the Arts chairman (put there by President Clinton) was actually lamenting the lack of compliance.

The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
