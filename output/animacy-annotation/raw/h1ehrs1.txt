NTA, but I would suggest asking the supervisor to keep the issue/complaint anonymous. Hopefully and best case the teacher is simply young and unaware of how upsetting and embarrassing being picked on by ones teacher can be for a child and just needs it brought to her attention. Worst case though, the teacher doesn’t accept the criticism as constructive and instead perceives a parent’s concern as an attack on her teaching abilities.

When I was in third grade I unfortunately experienced the later scenario where my parents deciding to intervene in the situation ended up making it worse (only initially, in the long run it was the right choice).  My point being, if you think that a grown adult teacher is above taking their anger at a parent out on a child, don’t lol. Definitely address the situation, but keep it as anonymous/ or unspecific as you can for the time being. Hope for the best case but be prepared for the worst.
