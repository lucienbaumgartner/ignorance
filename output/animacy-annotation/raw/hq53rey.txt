The reason people would attack you probably comes down to how you vote. The idea that you could acknowledge how fucked it and disparate the classes are; that we’re all basically wage slaves to a billionaire class and that people DESERVE a living wage. Yet when it comes time to go to the polls you’ve cast that R vote over abortion, guns, or some other fucking nonesense. Disingenuous at best. Ignorant and hypocritical at worst.  If you really want to wake up, maybe examine why it is all the single issue items like abortion/guns/god are why you’re a conservative yet everything that really matters is shit you keep voting against yourself on. Republicans don’t want you to have a Union or food pay, they want wage slaves.  They don’t want you educated, cause then you might figure out that single issue bullshit is a smoke screen to stay in power while denying you basic things like healthcare.
