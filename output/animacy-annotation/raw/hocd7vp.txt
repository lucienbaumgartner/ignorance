There's nothing wrong with being super woke, rather prefer that to super asleep and ignorant of things happening around me.

I've heard ignorant things said about all of the 5 languages I speak. Sometimes people say a language sounds like a box with some stones being rattled. Sometimes they'll say Hindi songs sound like when you play an English record backwards. Some will claim that a language is always spoken in an "angry" fashion so its speakers always sound aggressive. I've heard people say that English sounds like the speakers are feeling cold and can hardly articulate because they'd rather not open their mouth in the cold.

It's ignorance, that's all it is. If we didn't speak any English it would all sound like "pish posh".
