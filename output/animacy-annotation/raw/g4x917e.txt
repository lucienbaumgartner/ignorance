I think the largest point of contention boils to "why would casuals upgrade if all the popular games are available on the Series S are available on X1S or X1X?"

Like seriously,  if casuals are so cheap and unaware of tech, why even upgrade? Casuals aren't that dumb and cheap. And they usually at least have connections with core and hardcore gamers to provide information. They do some minor research.

The main reason either casuals, core, and hardcore upgrade is for games only available next-generation, features of next-generation, content available to respective platform,  and where their friends are.

That is why Sony strategically bought content exclusively for the major 3rd party games. They're strangling 3rd party appeal and luring casuals away with the "Playstation Advantage "
