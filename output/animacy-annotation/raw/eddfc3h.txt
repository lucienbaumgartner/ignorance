Bullshit.

The benefits of globalisation are substantially cheaper manufactured goods which these people benefit from.

The problem is that the opportunities for unskilled labor are pretty much zero, and that would have happened even without globalisation.

If you have nothing better than a year ten education and no skilled trade you're fucked.

That's sad, but it's a life these fuckwhits **chose**.

This isn't the United States. 

They had access to a high quality free public education. They had access to affordable university programs. They had access to apprenticeship programs and traineeships. They still do, even as adults. 

If you were caught unaware and unprepared for the end of Australian manufacturing then you're a fool, and deserve what you've gotten. Except again, this is Australia and you have a way out.

The people in these ralleys aren't hard done by, they're just assholes who can't accept that it's not the eighties and being a bigoted jackass isn't OK anymore.
