Hot take: Most FE protagonists aren’t that deep. At all. In the slightest. They’re on the same level as the gremlins.

Chrom for example could have been a lot more flawed. If he was extremely flippant and ignorant of his royal status, and paid little care for his sister’s job as exalt, it would have made it so all of his guilt felt more warranted when she died. As is? He was just some decent guy who had sown traumatic experiences. He didn’t cause any of those mistakes. No lessons learned, minimal character growth, no self improvement etc.
