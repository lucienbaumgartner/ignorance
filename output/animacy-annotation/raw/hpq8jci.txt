I have literally NEVER discarded someone put of my life in any manner, let alone in a sociopathic way. Whoever you are basing this ignorant and awful comment off of, had more issues than just BPD. This is an awful and painful comment to read, especially the whole dehumanization of "one of you". 
 
I am very very very sorry you had such a bad experience like this with someone who had BPD, but in zero way are even most people with BPD like this. I really hope you see how people like myself with BPD arent all sociopathic manipulators who will throw away someone in an instant.
