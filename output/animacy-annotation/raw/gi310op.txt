Well it must be easy being an ignorant, primal animal who doesn't have anything but their first world problems

I feel you, and i've had just about noone to relate to, or empathize with throughout my entire life, and I frankly am extremely jealous of people just living in the moment, not having a single worry in the world

People who worry less are happier, and people who are less self aware, and unaware of their sorroundings typically live better lives

That's just typical animalistic behavior, and some of us just happen to be ahead of the competition in terms of psycological evolution, such as you and I are

That's just my world view, and you know what they say "the world is what you make it out to be"
