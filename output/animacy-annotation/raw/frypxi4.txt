Lol imagine being so naive and ignorant that you compare a worldwide pandemic to a terrorist attack. Then again, I guess you don’t have to imagine.

Also, most of the country is shut down, and very few parts are starting to reopen now that people are in need of basic necessities such as food and clothing. “Not responding to the crisis” is a straight up alarmist lie.
