I just think everyone understands that this is irrelevant now. He isn't praised as a role model either.

Tyson was a really ignorant and uneducated person, but he grew up a very hard life, no father, lost his mother, gangs, rape, abuse, he was an angry person that was tossed aside by everyone. The only person who helped him was his trainer and that was only due to ability to fight and his aggressiveness.

People just enjoy the ability and his aggressiveness and ruthlessness, at least he was able to channel that into the ring for the most part.
