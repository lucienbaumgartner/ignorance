Lol, what else was she supposed to say during a time when wives were expected to be the husband's little bitch? Women had no freedom, not as much as they do nowadays. I bet she wanted to say something like, "this wasn't even my fuckin' job, man. My husband is just fuckin' dumb and unaware of his surroundings, now I have to lead a whole army? The fuck, man"
