Lol no fuck that.

People that choose to be ignorant and scared of a shot that will prevent them from falling seriously ill do not deserve to clog up hospitals and fuck up other people's lives who are vaxxed that need medical attention.

butterywaffles9 uncle in Wisconsin doesn't deserve to die because conspiracy theorists refused the shot and are taking his bed spot up for his cardiac bypass surgery.

They made their choice, others shouldn't pay the price for it. It's less about me being an asshole and more so just speaking in terms of fairness.
