I disagree and think that’s a leap. To me it looks like a dive. (And if you read the Ferrari drivers comments, he seems incensed, so I’m sticking with a dive). He claims to be 1.2 a lap faster, faster, but unaware and unable to set up a proper pass.

Also, these cars have ABS. If you are about to make contact, jab the brakes. Even if the Ferrari had all the momentum (what you’re saying), why not avoid the collision?

I see a divebomb, you see a faster car sticking on a line. No matter what, the Ferrari is at fault.
