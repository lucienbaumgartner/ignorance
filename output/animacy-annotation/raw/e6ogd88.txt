that is actually a very good point and one i had not considered/was even aware of. there is still 2 full seasons of relative underachievement in the league.

decided to look a bit further before just talking further out of my ass now.
2017-2018 Real finish 3rd. 76 points accumulated. 3 points behind 2nd placed Atletico, a whopping 23 behind first placed Barcelona.
2016-2017 they won the league under Zidane's first full season 3 points ahead of second placed barcelona.


umm.. i was arguing against zidane, thinking they did not win the league under him. i was wrong and unaware that they actually did a league and CL double.. dunno what i was thinking here really. Clearly talking out of my ass. I was under the impression it was a league CUP and CL double that they pulled.

Zidane in then i guess?
