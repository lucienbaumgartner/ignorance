Gold comment in this context doesnt mean gilding the comment.

It mean that the comment is so moronic and ignorant that he has to be saved to be used as a proof of why this sub has such a bad reputation.

And yeah majority isnt all. The rest is Chinese workers who dont give a shit about NA LCS/other region and only watch LPL and Worlds if LPL teams are playing

As i said, DONT talk about stuff that you dont understand or have any clues about. That would avoid writting that kind of ignorant comments and looking stupid like now
