I honestly found it refreshing that the chicken seemed unaware and unfazed, since I'm so used to seeing what you described that I actually expected it. It was much funnier for me that the chicken was a normal stupid chicken who doesn't understand English and has no idea what is to come. But maybe that's just me?
