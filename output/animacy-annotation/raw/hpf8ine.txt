As a long time truck and trailer tech I can tell you that in order for brakes to fail ( they lock up ) the driver has to fail first. Drivers can be so negligent and unaware of their rights to refuse a load for this reason. Problem is there are so many drivers that don't know a single thing about their truck or even how it works, which means their pre trip inspections are shoty if they even happen. 4 dead because this driver probably was like many and just jumped in the seat and drove. Easy to give the basics of this story to a stranger that doesn't understand the responsibilities a driver has as well as options and get them to sign a petition.  Truck safety is not taken seriously by too many drivers and businesses,  I see it on a daily.
