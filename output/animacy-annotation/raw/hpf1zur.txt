The theory is that if any non-human living creature on Earth had the capability to wipe out humanity, it would've done it by now. By that logic, while I promise you that there are definitely some terrifying sea creatures down there, as long as they remain uninterrupted and unaware of us, we should be good. There's also a very strong chance that whatever is down there would not survive further up in the ocean due to the higher temperatures on the surface as opposed to down there. So realistically we may never discover what's down there and, tbh, I'm okay with that.

 Meanwhile we still don't know exactly what is at the corners of the universe, assuming there are some, or if we're the only living species to exist. Personally I don't know what's more terrifying - learning we aren't alone, or learning we are.
