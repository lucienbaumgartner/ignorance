I'm always curious about that on the site. I have tons of parts from builds that went the custom route(all just accessory, non serialized non firearm) that someone could get for a good price and be happy with but there's no where to sell them. Letgo won't let you, ebay won't let you. And all because they are ignorant and unaware of what's legal to sell and what isn't. Thanks for the info. If yours goes well maybe I'll post some.
