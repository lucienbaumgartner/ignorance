This is a trend from people in the northern hemisphere. A couple of decades ago people from certain countries of Europe thought that ELN and FARC were the "good guys" fighting for the people and not the narcos they are. There is even a popular case of a Dutch girl (I believe) that came to Colombia and joined one of those guerrillas. You seem to live in my country, you know how controversial and ignorant that kind of thinking is. But is not just that people live in a bubble far away from latin america, is the fact that they don't want to come out of it, and assume the world works the same as in USA or Europe.
