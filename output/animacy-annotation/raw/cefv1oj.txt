Punching people in the face. Like, I'm invisible and they're just standing there completely unprepared and unaware that my invisible fist is about to smash them full-on in the face. 

I have that fantasy about people who embarrassed me, were cruel to me or that I'm otherwise very angry at yet would never actually do anything to. 

This is almost certainly an unhealthy fantasy.
