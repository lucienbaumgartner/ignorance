A similar thing for me. Growing up I often felt what I now know is gender dysphoria, but at the time I was so isolated and unaware of the queer community that I didn't know any of the terms. The only label I had for myself was 'pervert.' As you can imagine that meant a lot of suppression and self hate for a while. Wasn't until college where I met a girl on my floor who was trans that it clicked.

It wasn't an instant click either. I had body image issues through high scho, and for the first time I started connecting all the things that I hated: facial hair, broad shoulders, genitals, ect, and I noticed a pattern emerging. Like many trans people who start to realize that they are trans, I tried doubling down on being a man. Grew out my beard, did typical bro guy stuff. Hated myself for it. Took about 5 years from learning about what transgender is to finally accepting it and starting HRT.

People often ask me if I feel happier now that I'm transitioning. I tell them it isn't so much about happy/unhappy as it is about feeling right/wrong. Taking hormones and seeing myself more fem feels right.'
