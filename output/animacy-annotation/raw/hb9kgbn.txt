Education on what? On how safe and effective vaccines are? We already knew that, in 1960. You know, when we eradicated polio. And Measles. Diseases nobody has anymore thanks to vaccines. 

The 10% are people who are so profoundly stupid and ignorant that they're afraid of well understood well established science, simply because they don't understand it, and they are so lazy and narrowminded that their reaction isn't to want to learn, it's to be scared. That's the bottom of the barrel. Just pure intellectual emptiness. 

How do you reason with somebody who's opinion isn't based on reason? It's only based on beliefs and emotions. Education is powerless against people who don't think.
