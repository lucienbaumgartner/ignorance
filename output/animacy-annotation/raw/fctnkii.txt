I see posts like this and cringe, not only at the thought of this never being a reality in my life, but also at the thought process behind these kind of posts. The one where having a girlfriend can magically turn your life around and cure your depression. Where if only I had love in my life then I’d be happy. Am I saying it doesn’t help to have a girlfriend, no, it can help and turn your life around, but that will not fix it completely. It will not change the way the world works and it’s trajectory or depression. I feel it’s stupid and ignorant that people still believe this, as it merely just one of many things that causes pain, not the entire reason. I feel these are people who are depressed for different reason than many in here are or many with actual depression are.  This is however my cynical opinion, and I only ever see the bad side of something, never the good.
