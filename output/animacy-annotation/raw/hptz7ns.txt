I don't fully agree with this. I'm also a healthcare worker. Yes, some of the dementia sufferers we deal with are blissfully unaware and content.

However, there's those that roam all day crying because In their mind, their (grown up) children are still small kids and they can't find them.They think they've been abandoned, or they think it's just a day out and are upset when we tell them they can't leave
 They cry for their mothers because they're lost and confused.

There's another who's dementia has formed into such severe anxiety, she can't relax or have fun. She's constantly in her head feeling bad about herself. You can try to calm her down, but the dementia means she forgets and starts crying and repeating her name out loud. A cycle of feeling nothing but fear and contempt for herself and none of us can help her. 

I get what you're trying to say, they don't realise half the time what they mean or feel, especially in the last moments...but the journey to that point for so many of them is riddled with pain and suffering as they slowly break into a shell of a human being. It's heartbreaking. I would never want that.
