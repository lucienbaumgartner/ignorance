I feel like this is the tenth “what I wish I’d known” article I’ve read that sounds exactly like this. I believe you can’t know exactly what it feels like before you have a baby but that’s true for anything. You don’t know exactly what it’s like to have a dog before you have one. You don’t know exactly what it’s like to be a college student before you are one. 

I think it’s less that people are unaware and more that they convince themselves that they want something so bad that they ignore the warnings.
