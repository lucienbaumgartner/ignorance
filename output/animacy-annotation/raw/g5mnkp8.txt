I'm 37 and 4'10". I've never had an issue with my height, but I have had some really messed up experiences because of it. I've had grown men wanting me to act like a child for sexual reasons. A cashier once yelled through the entire store my age and got all of her coworkers to "come check out this 30 year old!" when I was buying alcohol. I'd like to tell you that it gets better when you get older, but all you can really do is accept yourself and not allow people like that ruin your day. The men I mentioned were obviously sickos who should probably be on a list, and the cashier was just ignorant and unaware of how her actions could affect someone else. None of them deserve to ruin my day. They're the ones with issues, not me.

Edited to add: You should check out Asian stores for clothes. It's saved my wardrobe. I found one locally, but you can search online. Amazon even has some. The reviews might be not so great because everyone bitches about the sizes running really small. You can also find a good tailor and have clothing tailored to fit if you find things you really like but are too long/big.
