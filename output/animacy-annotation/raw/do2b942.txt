Meh I believe msg can cause or contribute to headaches, same with too much salt I think. I've had headaches after Doritos or cheezies or pho, or whatever with msg so many times totally unaware and unsuspecting then realizing ya I ate a lot of msg and salt. Plus so many people have reported this correlation it's a little ridiculous to say there's nothing there.
