Damn a tin foil hatter since the first grade? You've exceeded me by a long run.

I was 12. I remember walking out of my room and the news was playing as usual, except something was off. My parents stared at the T.V. in complete silence and their eyes never left the T.V. not even to blink. I ate my breakfast and left for the bus. Everyone and I mean everyone was talking about it and wondering what was going on. We arrived at the Jr. High i was attending and the upon walking into my first period class (science) there it was the screen. The same horrific event that made my parents silent and unaware that I left for school. The entire day was filled with this event ( teachers crying claiming they have someone related to them in those building one way or another...probably lying) they kept the footage on repeat for at least 2 weeks. I felt angry and scared for what this means...my older brother who joined the Marine Corp the year before is now telling me he's being deployed to Afghanistan, and my dad (who is a retired CWO4 in the Marines) told my mother that he can't forgive himself if something happens to my brother overseas, since he is the one who convinced him to join the corp. I remember everyone hated "towel heads" and "goat fuckers" even myself. It took me till I was 20 (8 years after) that everything that made sense didn't anymore and joined the tin foil army.
