I feel like you are short sighted and ignorant of trans people. But that’s fine. I guess this is my daily reminder that this is how some people think. I know many people who are trans and they don’t fit you’re goofy depiction. Some do but ya know we all encapsulate aspects of feminine and masculine. What I hear from you is that you expect people to embody one or the other. Thank you for expressing your opinion though it differs from mine I respect your right to have an opinion.
