Ok let’s have a serious debate, she’s angry and impulsive, quick to violence, she has a naggy family that’s stripped for cash and constantly hounding others for money, if you ever had a child with her she’d definitely give it a stupid name, she causes trouble for others constantly more so than every other member of the party, she’s arrogant and narcissistic quick to boast, about all her accomplishments and hypocritical when it benefits her, but in the face of gore and big threats like dragons she freezes up in fear, she’s 14 so that’s a legal problem, and she’s delusional and unaware of her own flaws, yeah watching her from a outside perspective is funny, but imagine actually having to deal with her getting into fist fights every day with other adventurers, or her impulsively blowing up property, kazuma has to spend a fortune paying off onion duck farmers, and pot hole construction, all around she basically has all the flaws of a arrogant hotheaded, violent, narcissistic girlfriend, because she literally does have all of those traits,
