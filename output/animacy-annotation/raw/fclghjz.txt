Dude, I'm fucking trying really hard to get through to you, but you are so comically bigoted and ignorant that you won't take two seconds to question yourself, and so you take it out on me. Why? Are you afraid of the prospect of an honest conversation? Listen, man, no bullshit, if you really want to talk about anything rationally, I can hear you out. I don't like this petty back-and-forth grade school banter, and I'd really be happy to hear what you have to say. I'll stop with the keyboard warrior crap, and we can talk about it like civilized people. I think I've been where you are right now. Again, not bullshitting. I'm serious.
