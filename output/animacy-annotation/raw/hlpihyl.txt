it should bring attention instead that too many hispanics  would rather work in a warehouse, drive big trucks, buy nike's, fitted caps, and jerseys instead of doing well in school and trying to go to college and actually having good jobs so they dont have to live in the hood and worry that the ghetto is being rebuilt and made into a nicer area. And yeah, i grew up in El Sereno, California. I know what im talking about.

Instead, this shit show is trying to convince us that the bad outsider is the son who actually went to school and is a top chef but hes not hispanic enough because he doesnt speak spanish perfectly (blame the parents) and is educated. That every damn female around is apparently a dyke and its ok. That its ok that pops lived in this damn country and never bothered to try to get papers. that was irresponsible and ignorant. That its ok to blame your problems on the affulent people, because thats easier than fixing them. The show is full of stereotypes. These people are probably devout catholic, so what the eff are they doing talking to the witch lady like its ok? 

this show does little to show off hispanic culture. Instead if just shows the negative stereotype that mexicans have already been presenting for ages. So many problems face the characters in this show, and they are all of their own making. And its a shame that they couldnt find a way to show the better parts of what amounts to a large population in the US. 20 something different hispanic countries, and only 1 is represented......and not in the best light. That spanglish language shit is not ok. Its shamefull. It shows lack of education in a character. this show is NO. 

And that latinX bullshit needs to go. Our language has male and feminine versions. Deal with it. If you dont fit into one of those 2 categories, then you are fucked up in the head. dont try to change the whole damn world to fit your crazy imagination.
