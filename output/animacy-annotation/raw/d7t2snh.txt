As the parent of a young child who invited no less than 40 kids to a birthday party, and had two children show up, thank you.  We had zero family in the area, were new and unaware that softball and other sports were in full swing, and that people don't really RSVP anymore.  Our child has special needs.  That was the day I lost a lot of faith in people.  We did what we could but our child had a hard time understanding why none of her friends showed up.  The two that did show up were one kid and that kid's sibling.  As a parent, it broke my heart.
