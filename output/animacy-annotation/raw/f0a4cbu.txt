Yes, that is a perfectly understandable and natural reaction and I don't think less of you for it.  You are thinking purely selfishly in that scenario, and I don't think selfishness is inherently bad. It's just a perspective.

Other people view the situation selflessly, and deduce that when a mentally handicapped person is making them uncomfortable, and unaware, that the condition that makes them that way is far more concerning that their own discomfort, and choose not call attention to it.

It can be very hard to put yourself in the shoes of a mentally handicapped person. I don't blame anyone for reacting naturally negatively toward such a person committing social faux pas upon them. These handicapped, however, don't understand what to do and not to; they have been called out, declared to be an asshole, looked at with disgust, etc their whole lives.

So yeah, you don't like being near or looking at or being reminded of them, but your discomfort with it pales in comparison to their condition to such a staggering degree that perhaps you might begin to understand why your attitude is deemed by some to be offensive.
