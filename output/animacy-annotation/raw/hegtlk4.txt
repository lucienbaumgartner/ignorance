Are we going to equivocate a labor shortage with wage increases? Your original post doesn’t mention anything about people not going into the trades, starting a decade ago. Probably because you can’t blame “the governmental” for it.

And no, sick people cost money. I personally have had my income highly impacted because an employer got sick. This isn’t some old persons. It was a young, otherwise healthy person. They’ve had long Covid for a year now, still struggle with it, and it lowers the amount of work I can do. 

Even better, say my parents had gotten sick and died. You’re apparently, whatever, about it because they’re old. But I’d have lost childcare. Meaning I wouldn’t be able to work like I did.

Ya know, constructions workers never got told to stay at home in Montana. They were considered essential workers. If anything, during that time, there would have been great labor incentives to get the work. Even now, you can get a paid apprenticeship immediately, and it’ll pay $60k a year. People don’t want the jobs! They’re not skilled and our society doesn’t value them like they should. It has zilch to do with people being lazy or whatever bullshit your insisting on here 

Normally, you’re right. But just look up Typhoid Mary. I’m sorry, but your entire premise is honestly immature, naive and ignorant of history, law and economics
