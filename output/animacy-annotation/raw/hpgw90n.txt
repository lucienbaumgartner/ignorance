No. 

I have, at this point, little to no tolerance for the whining of the unvaccinated.  I think they're appallingly selfish and ignorant. That being said, people of conscience don't deny care to the sick, no matter how they got that way.

At some point, some hospitals will undoubtedly have to triage patients. This must be done based strictly on medical considerations, making decisions much the way they would for a natural disaster. We can visit our contempt upon them if we must, but not until after they've received the best medical care possible under the circumstances.
