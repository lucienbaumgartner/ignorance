The amount of food the new manager let me take home and eat for free made up for it in my mind. I lost about 140 from the asshole that was stealing but I worked there for 3 years and almost never had to grocery shop so I just left it alone =P hindsight I should've taken action but I was relatively young and unaware that I could.
