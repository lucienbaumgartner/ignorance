FFS, now you’re just being obtuse and making a lot of assumptions here about my journey. How do you know I haven’t passed anything? Not that’s it any of your business, but I said nothing about how I AM doing. Worse yet, you’re assuming everyone can just take a straight month for studying and shitting on those who can’t for whatever reason.

Of course, it’s not a fucking participation trophy. Nowhere in my remarks did I suggest that. Everyone has to put in the work, no exceptions. But to assume people fail solely because they didn’t study hard enough is insulting and ignorant of reality. But I guess that’s what being on a such high horse does for you.

If you’re a senior or above, I really hope you’re not as arrogant and short-sighted with those under your care.
