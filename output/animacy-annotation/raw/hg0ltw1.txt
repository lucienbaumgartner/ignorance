But they'd probably be thrown through a loop if you called Jesus a mythological character who was a mere allegory that never actually historically existed or had a direct influence on the world as a physical human being

So is Jesus a myth where you can derive lessons from, or was he a real historical person? How about any of the kemetic gods? Is it literally true that your heart will be weighed against the feather of maat when you die? Are all these history or mere mythological allegory?

Because, I'll be totally honest, when you say, "real listening", it simply sounds like nothing more than just, "u/halbhh 's way of listening" - masking it as the *true* way to view religions when it's really just your particular way to do so, not having any more or less substantiation than literally anyone else's way of listening

Because for people in their respective religions, they believe their myths are actual history. Trying to waive them off as myths purely for the sake of a theology that proclaims that they're all supposedly apparently aiming in the same direction is, again, rather dismissive and ignorant of the religions themselves
