I was visiting a state I had moved from, and this girl I had only met a few times invited me over to “say hello.” I don’t pick up on signals too very well so I imagined this was going to be a pretty normal thing. I imagined we would catch up for a bit and then she would probably say she had stuff to do. But I got there and she seemed really happy to see me which was a little odd since I didn’t really know her well but I also wasn’t going to question her good mood. After catching up a bit she asks me if I had eaten breakfast, I hadn’t so I said no and she asks me if I would cook some eggs, and basically make breakfast. That probably seems odd but anyone who knows me knows I cook a lot. So we have breakfast and I’m still blissful and ignorant that this girl is dropping some serious hints. I thought she was laughing at my stupid jokes a little too much but brushed all that aside. After breakfast she cleans up the kitchen and asks if I want to go to her room and watch a movie. Naturally I say yes, at this point I’m beginning to wonder if there is something more to this visit. So we go upstairs and I’m watching whatever on her bed and her forearm begins to rub against mine and I finally understand what’s happening. It ended basically as you would expect.
