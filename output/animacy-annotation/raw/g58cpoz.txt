If someone is negligent and unaware that they could have easily killed you they absolutely need to know about it in one way or another.

Even though a healthy dialog may have got thr point across better,  "freaking out" on them will hopefully make them think and look twice for the next cyclist.

The way I see it you hopefully just saved another cyclist's life in the future.
