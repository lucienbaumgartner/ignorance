I always find it amusing how others struggle to be relevant by picking other people's lives apart.   This post and every like it is just more evidence how ignorant and vapid people can be.  
At least in this case, your means to appear relevant is centered entirely on what another is doing lol.  Let that sink in a moment so you can reevaluate your own relevancy.

Yea it's gross, but it's also none of your fucking business and you certainly cannot live that person's life better than they can.  You are a fucking loser struggling to be relevant in the wrong way.
