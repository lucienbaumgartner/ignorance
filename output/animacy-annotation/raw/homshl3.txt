Imagine if I put on a costume of things you don't fuck, like children, and walked around fucking other people in those costumes, most of whom actually fuck children, qbd engaged in online communities posting and masturbating to art of specific child suit characters fucking.  Then I tried to argue that it was perfectly normal and that I wasn't socially oblivious unaware and mentally dysfunctional to you.  It would sound utterly insane.  That's what being a furry is.
