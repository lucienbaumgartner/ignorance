&gt; jeeeez. are they hard classes

I didn't consider them hard by any means, but considering the amount of ignorant, unaware, and stupid people out there I suggest you actually try to pick up some useful life skill from them rather than complain. I feel like I know way too many people who could spout off a stupid LoL fact but can't explain who Joe Biden is.

Take an American Politics class. There's way too much happening in the world for you to not.
