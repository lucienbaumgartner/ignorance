&gt; Like, no shit a culture is better that upholding its own cultural values. The same can be said for literally any other culture.

Look out, your cultural relativism is showing. 

I'm saying it's objectively better to have LGBT freedom, gender equality and non-corrupt, open courts not based in theocracy. I'm happy to make that judgement, you seem not to be. 

The things I list were not always our culture, we progressed, got better and more people are free, accepted and flourishing as a result.

Don't bend the knee to theocracies in your desire to attack "whiteness"(ugh) or "the west". It makes you look foolish, ungrateful and unaware of just how good we have it.
