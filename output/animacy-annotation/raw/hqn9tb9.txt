I’ve been talking about individual cultures in the US this whole time. I’ve said many times in this convo that the US has many cultures as a mixing pot. My entire point, as it relates to cultures since you have proven to be incapable of grasping any other argument I’ve made, is that every single person has a culture. We don’t know enough about OP to know what her culture is, but even if she grew up in the middle of Iowa, she still has a culture of some kind. So it was ignorant and wrong of you to say she doesn’t have a culture. That statement betrays what kind of person you are.
