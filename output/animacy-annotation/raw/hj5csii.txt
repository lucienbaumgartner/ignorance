Merely seperating from the Catholic Church is not Protestantism. 

The Arians, The Nestorians, The Miaphysites all seperated from the Catholic Church after the Councils of Nicea, Ephesus and Chalcedon respectfully.

Do we call the Armenian Church Protestant? Do we call the Coptic Church Protestant?

Or for a more recent example, The Orthodox Church left the Catholic Church because they did not agree with Papal authority as interpreted by the Latin Church. Are they Protestants?

That's just ridiculous, and ignorant of Church History. Protestants are a group that seperated in the 16th century and they have specific doctrines that they share such as Salvation by faith alone. They are identifiable, and they do not mean "every non Catholic"
