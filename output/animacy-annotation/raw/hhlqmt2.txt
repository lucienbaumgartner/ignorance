Stalin formed a non aggression pact, not an alliance, with Hitler after the western powers of Europe rejected his offer to form a United front against Nazi Germany. The USSR invaded Poland, who was quickly becoming fascist in their own regard, shortly after Germany and denied Hitler from gaining a larger foothold in Eastern Europe. Itâ€™s completely idiotic and ignorant of history to say they were working together as their non aggression pact ended shortly after and resulted in the start of the Eastern Theatre of WW2 but go ahead and continue to cite Wikipedia.

Social Democrats are still capitalists and when revolution is at the door and they might lose their precious capitalist system to a socialist one, most capitalists will side with the nationalist and fascist forces that seek to preserve the old ways. Especially in modern times when fascists are not openly so and co-opt liberal and sometimes even socialist rhetoric to mask what they are.

And I am quoting Joseph Stalin, you capitalist swine.
