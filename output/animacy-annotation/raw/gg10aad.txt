&gt;Trump was generally just too lazy and ignorant about foreign policy to intentionally start a war - it's probably too much an effort for him

Your argument is that Trump is so lazy and ignorant that he is the most anti-war president in modern history? Cool

&gt; However, he was reckless enough to potentially start a new armed conflict with Iran by killing Qasem Soleimani 

Where is the new armed conflict with Iran?
