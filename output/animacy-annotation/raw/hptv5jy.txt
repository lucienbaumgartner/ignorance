NTA. That was very mean and ignorant of your parents. Even if they had good intentions. You know what they say, "the path to hell was paved by good intentions". 

In reality ignoring something like that will not make it go away, and by not understanding what was different about you added years of needless suffering to your life. Never mind the money, they took a medical issue and made it so much worse by denying its existence and thus denying you the option for treatment and therapy to learn to cope/ thrive. 

They didn't want you to feel different from the other kids, but by not addressing it I'm sure you felt so much more isolated. Many people have ADHD and or fall on the spectrum and live fulfilling wonderful lives, but by never treating you as an equal they really fucked up. 

And worse, now they're essentially gaslighting you saying your feelings are invalid and that you're only feeling them due to the autism?? Wow! That's horrific. You are valid, the way you feel is reasonable and I'm so sorry you've gone through this.
