Thankfully history proves you wrong, and the fact that men in general do the things she is talking about. To subscribe it to them based on the blackness of a group of males as the distinguishing factor is foolishly racist and ignorant of human psychology. Sophie need to check her black male hate at the door. She falls over herself to talk about being allies for all these groups, but got hate for black men? In a word she a hypocrite!
