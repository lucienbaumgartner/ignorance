I play this game a ton and still suck (maybe 6k kills on my whole account), but honestly, I just quit if the champ squad is 3 stack preds.

Lots of people will down vote this, say "get guuud", and tell me things like "you won't get better if you don't play better people." But they're not smart, so that's okay.

Getting utterly steam rolled by them after they bully my level 150 teammates with 300 kills on their legends doesn't make me better. It flat out doesn't. AND if that's what makes you better, why aren't those people and the others saying it in ranked if the only point is to get better? (LULZ how stupid and ignorant that argument is)
