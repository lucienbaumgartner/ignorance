&gt;We live for the next enjoyment and hoping that things will get better. I hate living a lie.

Yeah I hate it too, feeling so disconnected from existence, I was born just because my parents fucked and conceived me, there's no higher purpose It's just all chaotic suffering. 

I think in the future if things don't go to shit due to another world war or some catastrophic event humanity will be eventually replaced by artificial intelligence. I often hear about conspiracy theories and fear mongers saying AI will kill us, but why is that so bad? Humans are inherently flawed and most of the times unaware and delusional about their cruelty, a superior intelligence/life form replacing us would just seem like progress in my book.
