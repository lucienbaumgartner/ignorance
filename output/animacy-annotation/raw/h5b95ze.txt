I fervently disagree. Not because it’s MY opinion that he put the foundations money toward certain things, but because it experts opinions that he should be doing it. I dislike Gates in particular because he has horrible, unethical business practices that got him the money he is now able to throw around. He throws it around to a low priority issues, while experts all tell him it should go elsewhere, and he gets to look like the greatest person on gods green earth. All the while getting enormous tax incentives for doing so. People are dying from preventable diseases in third world countries, not polio. Polio doesn’t matter if you’re hospitals don’t have the resources to keep people from dying from the flu. When you live in a wealthy country these issues don’t matter, and eradicating polio sounds like an amazing goal - and to an extent it absolutely is. When you live in a third world country you have much greater concerns, and when the funding source comes in and ignores what you need, then turns around and says, “Look what a great job I did,” it’s perfectly ok to say, “No you fucking didn’t.”

Meanwhile he is also preventing the advancement of medicine by defending IP laws that prevent poorer countries from creating and using generic versions of medication created in the US and elsewhere. He doesn’t care about poor people. Creating a charity is a great way to hold on to wealth and look good in the process that’s all. He is arrogant and ignorant of the things he talks about most often and it’s at the detriment of people in the most need of help.
