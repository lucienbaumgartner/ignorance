Yeah maybe ? Really unsure these devs just seem so inept and unaware of what comic fans want out of a marvel game.

Feels like they thought the player base was just all filthy mcu casuals or worse.

I was sold on a multiplayer game so that is what I wanted, to have something to play with my friends.

All my friends quit playing ðŸ¤·
