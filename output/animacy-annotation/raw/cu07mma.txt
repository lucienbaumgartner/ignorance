People in glass houses, my man. And what's with the hostile attitude anyway? Are you just really young/immature and unaware that it's not polite, acceptable, or cool to call people names, particularly "junki" &amp; particularly on this sub reddit? I can't imagine why'd you say that to me, even if it was solely to try to insult me for some reason. 

Have I done anything to you?

Not sure what connection exists between your two statements there, but from reading your posts, you're _far too smart_ to have written that asinine statement, so I won't say anything else that isn't nice &amp; just assume you're immature, perhaps a bit socially awkward and trying to hide your insult behind some literally mask of tough guy stupidity. Doesn't suit you well though; stick to the cool, intelligent posts you've written about PCs and opiates, ok?
