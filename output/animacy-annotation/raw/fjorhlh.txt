I guess we should close all the stores in Vancouver proper that rely on paying people a wage they can't live in Vancouver with. 

Oh, that's just about every service you use, maybe it's an absolutely idiotic thing to say all these people should leave? Maybe it's so shortsighted and ignorant that it'll somehow work? 

I don't know, I'm just asking questions.
