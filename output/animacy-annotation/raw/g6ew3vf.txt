A few months ago there was a moderator from the old group posting in here.  I initially didn't care.  But eventually I messaged them and said you want to post and comment in here then you need to unban me in the old NJ group.  They never answered.  They want the right to state their opinions every where but they cannot permit free speech in their group.  It simply means that they are afraid of dissent and exposure of leftist lies.  Just as our schools keep students dumb and unaware of anything that conflicts with leftist dealings they must do the same in their group.  Imagine all the kids that are in that group being exposed to facts rather than propaganda.  They can't allow it.
