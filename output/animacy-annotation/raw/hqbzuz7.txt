The dude types like he's in the middle of a stroke yet believes he's superior to all women. This delusional superiority fantasy is stunting so many men. They will never be able to self-reflect long enough to actually realize they need to learn and develop basic skills, they just remain stupid and egotistical. 

Honestly, I kind of love it. If they go on believing that are inherently superior they will just happily remain stupid, ignorant, and unskilled.
