Qualified means someone that has had 25 years of public life experience and has not demonstrated he can deliver on the promises he keeps making. 

Qualified means showing some (even small) ability to change the status quo and not just talk about it. 

If Bernie was at the same stage in his career as a freshman senator, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt but after decades of talk and no results, I'm sorry but he's not fooling anyone. 

Running the most complex executive machine in the world require skills Bernie has never demonstrated he posses. You may be satisfied with his rhetoric but that seems to be all he can actually offer. 

Go do your research on his legislative record. No major bill sponsored, not a single shred of evidence he even understands what would take to get even one of his campaign promises achieved. 

I know people hate this comparison but I see no difference between Trump and Bernie, apart from the platform they support. Both are unprepared, unaware and too full of themselves to be honest about their inadequacy.
