I didn't see too many mean comments on reddit, but I didn't dig to the bottom. Dig to the bottom of every thread and there is toxicity, and I think it's very unfair to call *them* the majority of viewers. Anything with less than a few upvotes, is NOT a majority opinion on Reddit.


 I think everyone was just unaware and curious. I mean, for me I thought you were like every other streamer. I've seen dozens of clips of you acting normal. Then, I see a clip where you say you won't lock your door for a long period of time (not safe) because you don't wan't to touch keys. There's nothing wrong with it, but you have to admit it is off putting. With that little context, people WILL draw conclusions if it is not cleared up. If you don't wan't to clear things up, I HIGHLY recommend you don't visit reddit. No one is going to downvote you, just reply to comments explaining things. The majority of LSF users don't dislike you. 


With that said, I don't watch your stream. So I can't chime in on much there, but I have been on reddit for years. And this subreddit acts very specific because clips are so short, they are mostly misconstrued. Either: Clear them up, or if you don't wanna waste your time, stay away from LSF, it will just stress you. Good luck man.
