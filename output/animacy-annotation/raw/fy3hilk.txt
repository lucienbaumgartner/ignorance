I like that she makes that point herself, basically.   
"you've seen me put crazy colors on my eyes. Is it because I'm superficial? No."  
"I don't know why you do it... you've not devoted your entire artistic passion or outlet into makeup."  
This is basically the old "we can objectify people and admire their beauty, but they cannot admire their own."

Or the other take that goes something like "when men had the tools and talent to display women's bodies with paint and canvas, we called it art. When women had the tools and talent to display their own bodies, with photography and social media, we called it vain and inappropriate." 

A person's beauty is only beauty if they're unaware and unable to profit off of it? And people's (often specifically women's) beauty and physical existence does not belong to them and if they take ownership of it, through makeup or photos or anything else they like, then they are shallow and superficial and vain?   
Interesting things to think about and explore.
