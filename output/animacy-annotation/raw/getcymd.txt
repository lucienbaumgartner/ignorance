Ok do you agree with Vaush's assessment that most of the things said in the video are variations of the idea that white people are privileged and unaware of it? I think that's probably the crux of our disagreement.

Also the hypothetical with slaves and slave owners was used to identify a key concept that we both agree on. Mainly that it can be ok to make generalizations about your oppressors. This same situation can still be applied to today though. Black people are still oppressed and white people are still the oppressors. The degree of oppression is very different and maybe because of that you feel like black people are no longer justified to make such generalizations. But in any case, thanks to the slave hypothetical we have at least found a key concept that we agree on.
