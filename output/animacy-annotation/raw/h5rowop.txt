You know that Smash Bros, one of the biggest E-sports games, doesn't have a ranked mode? Just because tournaments and competitive matches are done via customs doesn't mean that there's no competitive scene.

And yes, the Hero Series was a giant cock up, but that was entirely on the organisers and Ubisoft. In fact the unlock "exploits" that Alernakin used to win the Hero Series were widely known about, and the entire competitive community at the time, including Alernakin himself, had urged Ubisoft to fix them, and asked the tournament organisers ESL to ban them in the ruleset - which they outright ignored. Comp players literally warned that unlock tech would be used if not explicitly banned, but ESL decided to allow it.

And moreover, **that was 4 years ago!** The game is *completely* different nowadays, and a hundred times more competitively viable, and the ruleset of the Dominion Series tournament has actually been made with consultation from the competitive scene, meaning that some truly broken techs and "exploits" are banned from the series. If people continue to dismiss the entire game due to one badly managed tournament shortly after the game's buggy release, 4 years later, that's incredibly close minded and ignorant of them. Get with the times - are you still dismissing the current Tour de France because of the doping scandals of the 1990s and 2000s?
