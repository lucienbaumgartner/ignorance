This is so offensive and ignorant that I want to laugh. Itâ€™s especially funny coming from someone in Florida. 

You realize that a lot of people from all kinds of nationalities have olive skin and curly hair? My parents do. No one has ever said a thing about them or my ethnic last name. 

Please, stop being so bigoted.
