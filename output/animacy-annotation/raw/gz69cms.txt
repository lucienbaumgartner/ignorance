&gt;Ah yes, the corporate media preaching that we should care for our neighbours and not be selfish. 

LMFAO Over the past year, we’ve seen the largest transfer of wealth to the top 1% EVER in history. We’ve seen small businesses go out of business because of bullshit lockdowns that the corporate media was pushing while almost all of the big companies like Amazon and Walmart flourished. And even the big companies that were somewhat harmed by the shutdowns will still flourish because as the lockdowns end, they’ll still be in business with less competition since many of those smaller competitors went out of business.

How fucking oblivious and ignorant of reality can you be? You’re a 🐑 making the rich richer and you don’t even fucking realize it.
