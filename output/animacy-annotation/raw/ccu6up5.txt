&gt; People should remember that being offended is a choice.

It's not a choice. You don't choose your reactions; you just react. It just happens naturally.

If you grew up black and poor in some inner-city ghetto, do you choose to not find it funny if a bunch of privileged white students at upscale university decided to have a "ghetto-themed" party where the students dress up like urban black youth and act "black?"

I think it can even apply someone white who grew up in trailer park. "Let's have a white-trash party!"

&gt;People should also remember to judge the intentions, not just the action of someone.

Even if they're intentions aren't to offend, they are only showing their ignorance by not knowing that what they do might offend or anger somebody.

So you don't always get a pass because you are dumb and unaware that people not find what you're doing funny.

&gt;If you complain about every little things, it does nothing but drowns out the REAL racist issues. People become desensitized to racism claims.

Not everything regrettably racist is someone saying, "Fucking niggers!"

And we can do more to improve how we treat each other than just take a stand when we encounter something like that.
