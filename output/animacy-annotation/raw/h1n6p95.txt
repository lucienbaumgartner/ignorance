Yaaa.. human rights are so tiresome right? This conflict isn’t about religion. It’s straight up about land. 

I thought you were a troll before, but now I see you’re just not very well informed. And that’s ok. Assuming you’re an American. Many of us over here aren’t well informed on ME matters. 

It’s ok to be really young and ignorant of the world. We live fairly sheltered lives here. Hopefully some day you’ll have a desire to learn. 

But if you’re not young, ya there’s no excuse for being uninformed. Unless you’ve had a traumatic brain injury or something.
