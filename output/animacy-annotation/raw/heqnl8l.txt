Yes, the Batman in BvS is just very stupid and unaware of the world around him. He brands people because reasons, they die with big headlines and everything and he doesn't stop doing it or wonder why it keeps happening. He also has no idea about legless guy not receiving his checks and the checks being sent back with threatening words until the last second and never investigates who could be behind it. 

He also just automatically accepts that Superman must die and never tries to talk to him or investigate Superman mostly doing good things and instead plans an elaborate murder. Most of the plot points in the movie are just about making Batman angry over and over again. 

It's the worst Batman.
