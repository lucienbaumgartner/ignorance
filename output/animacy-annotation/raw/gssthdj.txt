**hot take:** Bec is being extremely reckless and inconsiderate for the position she's putting Melissa in. Every time Bec demands apologies, Melissa's thoughts, or tries to be "honest" in the public forum, Bryce sees that as another opportunity to exert power and win one up. We can see that this has gotten to the point where Melissa is isolated from the group by Bryce as he is that distrustful of the group.   


Rule #1 of DV is that you don't put the victim on the spot to air their grievances in front of the abuser - that's going to expose them to danger, and any time it won't go the way the abuser wants it, they're going to punish the victim. If you want to help them, you pull them aside confidentially and safely.   


Bec wants the circle jerk that she gets from humiliating Melissa in public, which is all the more why Bryce gets to paint the picture as Bec as the "bully", and not Bryce as the asshole who flirted with another woman at the gym.   


However, it's important that the entire group stood up to Bryce after he sexually assaulted Melissa, that was absolutely disgusting. The behaviour needed to be called out then and there.   


And we must remember that ultimately Bryce is responsible for everything here, not Bec or Melissa. Bryce is the dickhead who gets called out and flips it to paint himself as a saint and justify that "it's you and me against the world". I just think that knowing the power dynamic between Bryce and Mel, that Bec has been reckless and ignorant of how her *style* of approach could and had endangered Melissa.   


DV puts people on the sidelines in some fucked up situations, and it's so unfair to the victim - while I want Melissa to be safe and for this abuse to stop escalating so much, it's unfair that the cost of her being safe is isolation, to any extent.
