As a lakers fan I know he didn’t come here just to play for the lakers and that he wants to get into Hollywood and everything else LA has to offer. I just think some of the takes are just stupid and ignorant that he is just collecting a paycheck from the lakers so he can focus on his film career. If he wanted to win this year then he wouldn’t have gone to the lakers, but the lakers have max space this summer so if they have a good summer then he will be right back to title contention.
