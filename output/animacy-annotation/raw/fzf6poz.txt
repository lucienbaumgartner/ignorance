3. That was entirely dependent on the relationship with hook ups I would wait until maybe a day or two before we met up for relationships for one or two dates. I have disclosed in person over the phone and on text message I prefer on text message because I put the person less on the spot
4. Female
5. Male 
6. I have not passed it on to any of my partners
