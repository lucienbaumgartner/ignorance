I honestly want to know where all these sweepeing generalizations you mention as examples in your post come from. Maybe I don't hang out with guys in their early 20s enough to hear these conversations. But in my experience I have never met a gay guy that judges older gay men for having sex. Guys come out in different times in their life and with that comes a sexual awakening that they are entitled to have. Or, they were married/with a man for many years and at 40 or 50, find themselves single and wanting to explore what they had missed out on while being in a relationship. None of this has to do with maturity or where a person "should be" at certains points of their lives. If a person is judging men for having sex at certain ages, I think that just shows how immature, and ignorant that person truly is.
