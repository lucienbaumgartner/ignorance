Compared to a highly educated modern college grad, sure, but it's all relative. Compared to the nation 50 years ago, when segregation was still a popular cause and being gay was a social death sentence, they shake out fairly well.

At any point in time, it's always true by definition that compared to the most educated class in society, the rest appear "uneducated, uninformed, ignorant, and unaware of their ignorance", but that is because the educated person has the benefit of having been educated, informed, and often forcefully deprived of their ignorance through that education process. It's true now, it was true in the 50s, and it was true 150 years ago. But using terms like this isn't a great strategy because it shuts down conversation. Call someone else uninformed, uneducated, and ignorant, and they won't listen to anything else you say. Instead, you have to find ways to change how they see the world, you can't just shame them for not seeing it the way the already educated see it.
