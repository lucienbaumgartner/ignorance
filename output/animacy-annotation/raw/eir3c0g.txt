If you think that either white people or American non-immigrants are incapable of inventing things, then you are both racist and ignorant.  That simply isn't the case.  Also, who are you to give America orders on how many immigrants it will decide to take in?  That's not your decision in the slightest.  You can only decide how many immigrants your own country will take in.  If no immigrants want to move to your country and the citizens mostly want to move somewhere else, then I would recommend fixing your country instead of blaming another one.

What does "a platform on which to promote global equality" mean?
