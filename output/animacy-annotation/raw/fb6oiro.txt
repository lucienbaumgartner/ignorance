You're right, he fits right in in Washington, but it gets better.  Many Republicans for quite a few decades were smart enough to be able to hide their corruption and outright disdain for fairness and equality in this country under the guise of morals or having standards, but Trump is so blatantly corrupt, evil and ignorant that he can't even hide it, and the average 'fence-sitting' voter of America is watching.

He's actually doing *huge* damage to what's left of the Republican party's image, and anyone aligned with this group of traitors to their country is going to be seen through for exactly what they are.  There *will* be a Blue Wave reckoning come 2020, and many, many voters will be ready and mobilized in order to get this treasonous and corrupt orange slime out of office, and boot his vile group of sycophantic traitor Republicans out with him.
