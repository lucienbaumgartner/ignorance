I think it's because, how many of us grew up with our parents (or any adults for that matter) teaching us emotional recognition and regulation? Nobody sits you down and tells you how you need to talk yourself through the experience of being angry, and how to do so without causing even more problems. Some people learn that skill along the way, many don't seem to. We're just stupid and unaware of ourselves. We do not know of any other ways to "manage" negative emotions than to blow up. A more intelligent human recognizes emotional sitations, is practiced in and knows how to keep themself in check, and finds ways to work WITH others.
