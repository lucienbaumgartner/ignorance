I think the best way to explain it would be to look at it the way the Ancient one showed it. Time is linear, they can hop back and forth, things change and change back, time fixes itself and so forth so long as all the infinity stones are there to lock it all in place. So returning the stones would have set the timeline to where it was when they were taken. I would not be surprised if when asked, the Russo brothers or Marvel or whoever will explain that they didnt kill Thanos1.5 in his time, so when Steve replaces the stones 2014 Thanos is still alive and unaware that he has died twice already. In short time wants to happen and it wants to happen right (which kind of breaks from Marvel canon as they work off parallel timelines based off major events being different all the time)
