Tbh I don't think it's so much to do with generations, it's people not actually listening or believing how bad an allergy can be unless they see it for themselves.

The amount of people willing to put allergens in people's food because they keep thinking/saying "it can't be that bad" or "you're just saying that because you don't like it" and "you're just looking for attention" these are the ones that worry me the most. It's one thing to not understand, but to be so blatantly stupid and ignorant that they put other lives at risk to "prove a point" or "catch them in a lie" it just.. I have no words for these kind of people.
