This. Calling Poland complicit is lazy and ignorant of the fact that the Nazi's ethnic cleansing plan included both Jewish Poles, and ethnic Poles, who they also considered inferior. Millions of Christian Poles were killed so that Germans could resettle their land. I come from a Polish family of Jewish and non-Jewish descent, and both sides of my family were killed in death camps.
