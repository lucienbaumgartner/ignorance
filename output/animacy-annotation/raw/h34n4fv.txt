I use a ton of products from China but I am able to keep them firewalled from the internet.

The basic idea of something like seafile necessitates internet access.

While I have a ton of experience in programming and technology in general, I’m not arrogant enough to think that I would be able to audit the code myself.

Sure you can watch and see if any traffic is leaking where it shouldn’t but you need to be actively monitoring the traffic when the leak happens. Not ideal.

You’re assuming my intentions which is arrogant and ignorant of you. Like I said, I’ve installed seafile, like the product, and want to use it. But products based out of China have a heavy influence from the government there. That is a fact. Just today a new report came out that tiktok’s parent company is heavily influenced by the government there. 

For the same reason I don’t trust Google with my personal data, I don’t want to risk an unaudited software from a country known to influence products with backdoors.

This has nothing to do with China. I would have the same reservations with unaudited software from any other country with that sort of reputation.
