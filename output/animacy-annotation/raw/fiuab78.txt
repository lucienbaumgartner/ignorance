&gt; the worst part in OW really is that people - just because there are heals in the game - act like they don't even know about the very basic of FPS games like taking cover, not do dumb shit like exposing yourself to enemy fire so easily etc.

It isn't because heals exist in the game.  It is because OW is a casual enough game that you can achieve a pretty mediocre rank like plat/gold easily, despite being extremely unaware and oblivious.
