Thank you. Yea, I know my intentions, it’s his I’m worried about. And I often find myself perfectly happy and unaware that men are attracted to me or making moves on me until it’s very much blatant in my face. I’m queer so have dated women and men, but really more like a 5 on the Kinsey scale. The way I see it, it’s more notable that I’m monogamous, and not looking to advance my career through anything but honest work. Thank you for being welcoming to women in the trades!!! I work with some really great guys, they back me up on stuff and encourage me to try/ask/do new things on the job.
