While I agree the friend made a pretty big error in judgment trying to set you up with her fuck buddy, the reaction to cut her off entirely seems unnecessary. Certainly, something you are free to choose, but not necessary to keep you safe from future poor judgment from her.

I'd certainly cut *him* off entirely. No need for further contact there. Then I'd it make it clear to her that this was not an okay thing to hide from me while she was also trying to connect me with this guy. And that she is not to set me up in the future.

Your friend is obviously going through some shit in her own relationship. She tried to rope you into her own sexual drama. On some level, she probably did honestly believe this great guy would be great for you, but that was probably ore silly and ignorant of her, and not intended as a deliberate betrayal. That is absolutely not cool, but can also absolutely be addressed by one clear conversation and a boundary; I am hurt that you connected me with this guy but kept important information from me about your sexual relationship with him. That was not cool. It felt like a betrayal and makes me question if I can trust you as a friend. If we're going to remain friends, you need to know you don't get to set me up again. Ever.

Again, you are totally free to end a friendship you don't want to continue. You don't have to stay friends with her.

But personally, I'd have that tough conversation and enforce that boundary. Not torch the friendship. Your friend fucked up big time, but it sounds like she's going need to some support in the near future while she deals with the deep shit she doesn't even realize she's in yet...
