Exactly. The renegotiation isn't happening - the PM hopefuls who are promising it are either lying or delusional.

They could have a cunning plan where they promise a renegotiation then make sure the EU gets the blame for being inflexible when it doesn't comply - this would be a workable strategy for somebody who wanted to run down the clock and go no-deal.

Or they could be so arrogant and ignorant that they genuinely feel their superior negotiating powers would get them something different from the EU than what's already been decided.
