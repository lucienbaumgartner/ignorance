knowledge and knowing "something" is largely an illusion and it's a way of allowing yourself to forget that you've connected the dots and drawn the line in an arbitrary way .. a lot of the conflict in the world seems to come from people who "know" things to be "true" ... be glad that you can't learn everything .. ignorance is bliss and not ignorance as in retardation or idiocy or ignoring (head in the sand) .. ignorance as in just being blissfully unbothered by "knowledge" .. blissfully unbothered and unaware of known "right and wrong" .. blissfully unaware of scientific/mathematic concepts that suck the fun out of reality.
