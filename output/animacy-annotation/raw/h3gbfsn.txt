I am secure (F24) and have been all my life. I have a similar experience like you had with your AP partner.

Sadly reassuring *does* feel like a chore to me and I made a post about my boyfriend last month. Dating people who are not secure and unaware of their attachment is exhausting for me. I feel that I build resentment. People who don't do self reflection don't feel like responsible "grown ups" to me and therefore are not dating material for me. I am not interested in doing the work and hinting at them that they might should do some self reflection. I came across FA/DA mind games in my younger college years and as soon as my date showed signs of being dismissive, I let them go. I don't have time for this. Mind games mess with my peace of mind, I don't care if they are intentional or not. 

On the other hand I work better with AP friends and my AP boyfriend because I like caring for an AP more than being treated badly by a DA... If that makes sense.

Many people told you that you shouldn't feel the anxiety the breakup caused you because you are secure. These people clearly think we secure people can brush off everything and endure everything. Which is not true. We are not robots. Of course unpredictable events and mind games confuse us and cause us anxiety. These people might not realize how much damage they do in their relationships if they think a secure partner can endure bad treatment.
