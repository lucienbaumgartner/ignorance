Yours is also a rather disingenuous counterargument. Rape is rape whether or not the person is affected by it. If someone had sex with comatose person but the comatose person was completely unaware and unaffected by it, it's still rape. Obviously the outcome of child molestation is far worse for the victim than beastiality, but outcome doesn't decide the crime. Rape isn't bad purely because of its effects on the victim per se, although that's obviously a major factor, but because it's a display of blatant lack of respect for bodily autonomy, something literally everyone values short of their own life. It is one of the worst things you can steal from another.

The reason that, say, a dog having sex with another dog isn't nearly as bad as a human having sex with a dog is because of the fact that humans are moral agents, dogs aren't. Humans obviously construct systems of morality, dogs live off of instinct. Because of that, we can't expect nor should we force them to live by our moral code. If someone kills another person, that's murder. If a lion kills someone, that's natural and unavoidable (although the person obviously has the right of self defense and anyone else should be allowed to defend them). We shouldn't have to try and sentence that lion for killing someone, although most people would try to neutralize the threat of it.

So no, I'm not making a thought terminating cliche or excluding any cases in my argument here. A violation of bodily autonomy is one of the worst things you can do to another no matter who it's done to, the harm caused after the fact is just the immoral icing on the cake.
