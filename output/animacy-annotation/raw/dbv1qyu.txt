What an incredibly unaware and short-sighted comment... 

"Well I have JUST enough to afford the basic necessities of life, so I guess that's fine."

Look around. Since when does ANYONE stop at that? Since when does anyone stop at anything? Are you going to decline a raise simply because you already make plenty? No, of course not. Even people who classify as upper-class still have the desire to make more, *let alone everyone else*. 

You can always have a better life regardless of what your income bracket is. That's KIND OF what drives the absolute majority of people and the exact reason why wealth distribution is as bad as it currently is. It's because you can never have enough. That's why self-centered greed is a thing that's currently wrecking our world for everyone but the top percent. 

To have financial security in the US you need to make a minimum of $30k/year. 

So according to you, then why do people make more than that? They make enough to have financial security so why bother trying to make more?

You're oblivious. At least try thinking first. I'm half-drunk and half-asleep and I can at least understand something as absolutely simple as why people want to earn more than 'just enough'. So what's your problem? You're just intelligent enough to be able to use a keyboard? Seems to be the case if you're going to put such idiotic opinions out there.
