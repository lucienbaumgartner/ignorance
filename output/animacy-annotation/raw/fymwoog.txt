Lol, many Indians and Indian media. There's no [1960 claims along the LAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute), and in 1960, your Nehru guy was so arrogant and ignorant that he didn't talk at all and was doing all the micro aggression. (China settled the border with Nepal, Pakistan etc. during the years via dialogue but your Nehru govt did nothing but mocro military aggression.) The war was fought in 1962, and what's the claims about 1960 again? Where's your basic logic? You even have the relatively free media, not like China, and you are just going to wash the facts down the drain like the current USA.

Edit: for people who don't like to face reality, wikipedia is probably a conspiracy theory site for you. Also, is this a decoy to divert your attention from the 40k new cases per day now?
