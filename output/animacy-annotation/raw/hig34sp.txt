I never said Paige was innocent, I said you're hypocritical if you're calling her out for that but ignoring that Alison also took advantage of Emily. You'll make every excuse under the sun for Alison while condemning Paige. "It was a peck" "She saved her" and so on. Maybe you should set YOUR bias aside and call things like they were.

Paige was confused, and unaware that Emily was DRUGGED. She'd just been sleeping or chilling or whatever when out of the blue Emily showed up and tried to kiss her. She thought -maybe in retrospect, maybe in the moment, who knows?- that she might have been drunk but she wasn't sure. She didn't put two and two together until after she had been drugged herself. And you don't know if it was a peck or not. All we really know is that Emily initiated it and Paige felt guilty about it.

Alison was NOT in any way out of sorts though. She was sober and in control the entire time. She knew Emily was delirious, and could see her losing consciousness when she initiated the kiss. Emily did not initiate it or give any indication that this was what she wanted, even in the moment. Emily was not even conscious of the fact that this was really Alison, being both delirious and Alison perpetuating the belief that she was dead by not revealing herself to be alive, thereby pretending to be a hallucination of sorts in order to take advantage of Emily's vulnerable state.

Paige didn't lie to her. She didn't trick her so she could get a kiss. All she did was be there. And yet you choose to believe that Paige was further in the wrong here than Alison. That being kissed by someone who's not sober is worse than tricking someone delusional and kissing them. It's truly baffling just how skewed Emison stan morals are.
