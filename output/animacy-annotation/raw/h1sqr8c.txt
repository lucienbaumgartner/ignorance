Anyone wonder if she sees that stuff from rate the influencer or girlgangz?  And that is why she is  "struggling"...using the term very loosely here. It is like clockwork. Cue the IVF sop stories and inspirational quotes.  I honestly can't figure out if she is straight up consciously shady or she is just super unintelligent and unaware of the FTC requirements and such.
