It's called respect and human compassion. I personally have never used a hashtag in my life and that was the first time I even typed the word. Even though I'm coming from a place of ignorance I can plainly see how easy it would be to change a letter, symbol add a letter, etc.. I can't for a minute imagine searching a hashtag, seeing nothing but I lady and her young children then choosing to fill that thread with my own personal content. I do not know if that was the case but if it was it would be extremely selfish and ignorant of me to do so. Imagine a human created something for themselves, their friends or loved ones but because you saw it... now it's your too? Strangely selfish and autistic behaviour. That's coming from a person with autism. I'll never understand why people think they can just take from others and then get offended because someone points it out and in this case politely asked you to refrain from doing so. 
But like I said maybe she's insane and has no leg to stand on. Idk which is why I don't run my mouth without context. 
Also check the thread it's filled with hundreds of bullies now trying to belittle and disparage this lady for asking a favour from a stranger. The internet sucks because of people like that. Not because a lady politely asked for help with something
