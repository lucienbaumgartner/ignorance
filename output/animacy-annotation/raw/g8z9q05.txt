But that doesn't explain how Jamie could be trapped in a memory. Memories, as explained by the characters, are experiences they have lived and witnessed. For most of them it's a happy time, Hannah meeting Owen for the first time, Flora making a friend with the ghost boy or seeing her mother. Or a nightmare, Peter having his mother find him. 

Jamie being asleep and unaware of Dani touching her shoulder doesn't support the show concept of what a memory is. Jamie also lacked the heterochromia that comes with welcome  possession. Now if they had a scene where it was Jamie laying in bed and Dani hopping in with her, that would be a great "is she having a memory or is she tucked into a memory? If so, by who? Dani or Viola?" moment.
