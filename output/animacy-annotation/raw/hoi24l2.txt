Will most likely take the survey in a little bit when I’m free but as someone who has gotten into OTC stimulants over the past 12 months and now in the last few months prescription level uppers after being completely clean and unaware of how much these things factor into performance enhancement I can 110% say without a doubt stimulants and uppers(Adderall would be the prime example in this context) is like taking your brain to a completely different level

It’s like being in the “flow state”(people can Google that term but basically that point where your mind is just impulsively making the perfect plays, reads, and movements without you actually consciously thinking about it) for a significant set amount of time depending on your dosage

The stuff that I’m on specifically is something that I take before big business days that just straight up wires me into what I want to do for hours upon hours without thinking about even things like eating, sleeping, or taking breaks

Depending on the dosage I can’t even sleep properly have the time after being up for 22+ hours(specifically last week I stayed up 34 hours throughout a very successful business day and only managed to get 3.5 hours of sleep that night before not being able to sleep anymore and feeling like I wanna work again)

I say all this to say that the right combo of all these things is complete night and day, speaking as someone with legitimate concrete evidence that it’s positively impacted my business output as well as my overall mental and cognitive function, less mistakes, faster reaction, less thinking and more doing

I’ve applied some of the lower level stims in the past to playing Call Of Duty as well and the effect is very prominent there as well as I felt like I was literally playing at a faster speed than everyone else

If I were to go head to head against myself on and off PED’s(specifically prescription stimulants/uppers) I would consider my counterpart to have a true advantage

I take it for my business practice so I’m not really directly taking advantage of anyone here(just maximizing my output) but it could definitely be used and abused in any sort of competitive nature
