I ABSOLUTELY think Kathryn is racist.  I don't think she is deliberately so.  I think she is ignorant and unaware of her privilege.  I think she should be called out for what she has done and said, and I think she should just have to handle that.  And I think she can learn, do better, and still likely never learn enough, because Kathryn is about Kathryn and that's just the hard facts, regardless of the topic.

My issue with Leva and this storyline is that Leva is NOT calling Kathryn out because of racism.  She is not continuing to attack Kathryn at every moment and break up her friendships because she is so concerned about Kathryn's racism. She is doing all this because she hates Kathryn over what happened with her friend Cameron.  Period.  

Leva is not calling Patricia out for donating to Trump.  She wasn't calling TRav out for being a vile right wing Republican politician back in the day when he was one of her "big name" friends at her bars and restaurants.  She wasn't refusing to attend Cameron's plantation wedding, or any of the other hundreds of plantation events we all know she has attended without a second thought. 

The reality is that pretty much every member of this lily white cast has some pretty deep-seated racism in them.  And Leva is not there to educate any of them, because she is not a voice for people of color.  What she is is someone using a legitimate movement to take down someone she doesn't like for far pettier reasons.

Which I just can't get behind.
