Pros: It's beautiful. The cost of living is nearly the cheapest in the country. Living near Louisville/Lexington gives you access to all the benefits of a metropolitan area, while still being pretty "country" feeling. The people are typically pretty nice as well.

Cons: The people - They're absolutely ignorant when it comes to politics, health, safety, etc. That means elected officials are almost always right-leaning, so you get all the "perks" of that as well - Abortion restrictions, no legal weed, decreased environmental regulations (leading to more pollution and BS), more attacks on lower-income families, etc... If you belong to a minority group, it can even be a bit dangerous too (depending on which group you're in and where you live). There are still hardcore racists in most rural areas, and I mean literal neo-nazis when I say that. If you intend to start a family, then you need to home school. Period. End of discussion. The public education system in KY is one of the worst in the country, and alternative options (such as private schools) are incredibly toxic cultures as well. Not only that, but even if you don't belong to a minority group... If your children end up LGBTQ+... I cannot stress this enough, they will be bullied within an inch of their life in rural areas. I'm speaking from personal experience, and from the experience of everyone I know. Lastly, you're not going to earn an amazing wage here. Even with the cost of living quite low, employers still tend to underpay people in KY across the board. 

I love it here because my life is established here. If that weren't true, I would be leaving for someplace less ignorant and toxic. I love the beautiful scenery here and the almost-ruralness of living near Louisville... But I can find that elsewhere without the costs of all the cons I mentioned above.
