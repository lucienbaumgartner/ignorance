Those aren’t “fleas”. “Fleas” would be if OP finds themselves doing good things with narcissistic motives. OP is doing things with their usual non-narc motives but is now simultaneously realizing how the narc views and performs the same actions.

So now OP has a real superpower. OP does the action with their usual selfless/pure motives but is also able to see how those same actions are performed by the growing and probably sizable narcissistic population.  

The reason it is a superpower is that most people are naive and unaware of narc motives, and narcs themselves are paranoid/distrustful and do not believe people like the OP exist (everyone is either a fool or a fellow narc, to them).

So OP can see a much bigger picture than most people.

Also, OP, don’t worry. Just because you can see it doesn’t mean you’ll become it.  These patterns are engrained at a very early age. You’ll still be you.
