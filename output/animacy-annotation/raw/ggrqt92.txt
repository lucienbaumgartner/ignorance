I disagree. Not worth putting all the blame on Ginella- it’s a team sport. But he came in to the game tonight unaware and slow to react. Cifuentes was setting pace more than we gave him credit for and we suffered after that sub. It’s all retrospect and we did a hell of a job without Atuesta. But yea...Ginella deserves a time out
