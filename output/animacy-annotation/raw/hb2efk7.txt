I said saying it is like NAZI GERMANY and the HOLOCAUST. I did not say fascism. It is fascist some of the things that happen in this country. But way too many people keep saying it is like Nazi Germany. That is so far off base and absolutely ignorant it is baffling. The moment any thing is fascist it is Nazi Germany. Give me a fucking break. Americans are so sheltered, entitled and ignorant that the moment some 'freedoms' are restricted it is a sign of the Nazi's. Most of my post was more in reference to anti-masking and anti-vax. Great! now this response will be followed by that damn bot.
