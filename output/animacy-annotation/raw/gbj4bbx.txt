Hahahaha.

I’m from Shenandoah valley. You know the one in the country roads song? 

I lived on a farm that had chickens, cows, and horses for 21 years of my life and worked my ass off bringing tons of wood in for the winters.

I left because I realized how stupid and ignorant that place and it’s people were! I faced racism everyday of my fucking life because apparently all brown people must be Mexicans trying to take your job so GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE WITH YOUR IGNORANT BULLSHIT.

YOU are the one out of touch you fucking loser.
