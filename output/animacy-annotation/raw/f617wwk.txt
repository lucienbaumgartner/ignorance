If you think speaking plainly means you are somehow speaking the words of a Republican, then you are sorely mistaken. Hannity has a bit now where he is basically saying anyone who shops at a Walmart is a Republican. I can guarantee you 1000% Mitch McConnell, Trump, Hannity, 75% of the Fox News crew, Rushbo ARE NOT SHOPPING AT WALMART. They are selling you on hateful ideas to make themselves rich and unaware that the GOP and ...Corporate Dems are out there making sure you vote for them on stupid social issues that they will ignore and will not affect you in their daily lives. Wedge issues and Culture wars are not actual things.
