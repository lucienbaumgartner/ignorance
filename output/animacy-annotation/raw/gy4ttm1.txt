&gt;You cannot ban people from owning more than 1 (or two) of something, sorry. And you don't want to.

It is called regulation. Imagine if the top 1% just bought all the water reserves and agricultural farmland. They can just hoard it an let anyone starve. That fact that you would be content with that is sick and ignorant of you.
