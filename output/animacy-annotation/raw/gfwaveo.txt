One explanation I came across on a different thread about the homophobic Hungarian lawmaker caught at a gay orgy made sense in that most homophobes who are gay and unaware of it believe it is normal to be attracted to the same sex and your religion/culture/whatever requires you to forcibly repress those feelings. They believe everyone has those same urges and gay people are to be derided and victimized because they are weak/immoral/whatever and fail to do the same. Inevitably this internal conflict explodes into public view. They do not realize that straight people are attracted to the opposite sex and do not have to wrestle with that conflict.
 Edit: And yes. Many homophobes are just sociopaths regardless of the above and in many countries they have official sanction to fulfill their blood lust openly and horribly.
