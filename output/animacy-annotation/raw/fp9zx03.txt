The issue isn't the definition of terrorism, the issue is his interpretation of the definition where he believed just being intimidating enough to scare someone counts as terrorism.

&gt; then you could also have a counter group protesting them but standing around with bazookas and flamethrowers, right?

No, you can't do that...

&gt; Would your original protestor feel comfortable with that or would they start to get tense?

If that happened sure they would probably not feel comfortable, not that it matters. Most protests have specific zoning and licenses and they can prohibit carrying certain weapons and items. They specifically do this for that reason because there often are counter protesters who go there with weapons concealed as signs to attack the other side. You can't just go to any protest and have whatever weapon you want. And you are supposed to have a protest approved to be able to participate (they don't give out approval for counter protestors so if you show up as a counter protestor they will prevent you from entering the zone and usually take any weapons you might have).

&gt; Or say having an automatic weapon at theater or a restaurant, right?

I can't stand when people act like they are being intellectual but what they are saying is so insanely stupid and ignorant that it just makes conversation pointless. You understand that places like movie theaters are private property, right? You can't just take a gun inside...

&gt; Most people don't like guns being waived around in their face much less by yahoo's who aren't military.

Who is arguing about whether someone likes it or not? That's meaningless.
