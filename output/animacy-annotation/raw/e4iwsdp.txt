I just watched this yesterday, and I have to say, this its a pretty bad movie IMO.




Everyone says the twist was the best part. And yes, it is unexpected, but only because the plot makes no sense, so there is no way of "guessing". 






**SPOILERS AHEAD. BEWARE.**


**Some plot holes I have found:**



[Let's start with the war. Why would you send the army to "turn off" some robots. I mean, it makes no sense to the goverments of the whole world to send the army to shot robots in their working places, amidst civilians, fathers and children, CEOs and Politicians, anyone could have been wounded.](#spoiler)


[Instead, they should have call the robots for maintenance, or to clean an empty yard, and shot them from an elevated position, with ranged weapons. Not like they do in the movie, were they go with assault rifles just to fight melee](#spoiler)


[Also, why shot them to turn them off, they should have  a switch or something... or just reprogram them. They must have need for a firmeware/software update, or a patch download at some point.](#spoiler)



[Also, there is a point in the movie where a bounch of people is asking for help in the rooftop, and a spaceship just blow up the building.... What was the point on having your men going room by room killing robots, if you can just blow the whole building?](#spoiler)

[when the humans first enter peter's building, they look like a swat team, but then they fight separately. Israel Broussard character (the soldier) beats a barricaded door for half an hour before shoting, and then its revealed he can just go through a thick wall like its made of paper....  just... what's the point? Also, he could have talked to the robot on the other side, and tell him he was a neighbour who needed help. There is no way of knowing (at first glance) a robot from a human, beside the spacesuit.](#spoiler)


[Then, the human has his weapon stolen (And hacked!) and is shown to have a tracking device on it... like, Why not to call an airstrike on its position?](#spoiler)



[also, the humans could have just throw an EMP bomb in each city, before landing. It would have made everything really easy. But I guess there would have been no movie](#spoiler)


[I also don't get how the humans even lost the planet. Like... even if the robots are much stronger, and get kill some soldiers and steal their weapons... The humans have an organized army, navy, airforce... spaceships! I get that the robots probably outnumber humans, but still, just shot them from afar.](#spoiler)


[And how are this robots free from the 3 laws of robotic? I understand this is not in the "Asimov universe", but still... At least the first law should be pretty obvious: "*Do not harm a human*"](#spoiler)



[Also, I think this movie is really lacking from a VIKI, from "I, Robot". Specially since the movie is just "I, Robot" if the robots won the first round. in the way this film is presented, there is no way the robots will win. With a central AI orchestating things from behind, it may be more plausible](#spoiler)



[I also don't understand the logic that, the whole army of the earth wasn't able to defeat the robots in the first war, when it was in the peak of its power, in a joint operation, by surprise, and against unaware and unarmed robots,  but then 50 years later, they hope succeed on a first try against the same robots than now had time to build defenses, prepare a plan, arm its population, etc (but yet, for some reason are still unarmed and unaware)](#spoiler)


[the human soldier even say they didn't know if the atmosphere was still breathable, implying that, because the robots don't need air, they could have poluted it as a  defense. And it's true.](#spoiler)



[Even more, taking the last point in consideration, if the robots resisted the initial "deactivation" process, and showed a will to exist, and humans had the capability to make a mass Exodus to Mars, they could have offered to take the robots to whatever planet they like.... Since they don't really need anything. Nor shelter, nor air, food or water, and their bateries seem capable of last for centuries without recharging. and both "races" get to live in peace](#spoiler)



[And what's the point of having your memory wiped? there you realize its everything made for the plot twist to happen. That's the only reason for each character decision. Even if the robots were suffering because of thos memories, just erase the gory parts... what's the point of not knowing even that they are not humans? Also, data doesn't work like that. If I erase a file form my computert, it doesn't get recovered. I don't found randomply parts of my file while playing a game or something. And turning it off and on doesn't recover my files like that.](#spoiler)



[As a last point, this movie fails at being dramatic after the plot twist is revealed. Your wife isn't dying... why a felow robot even says "There is nothing more we can do" (and he **did** know they were robots, as the diagnostic tool was shown to be an electric device") just grab her and give her new batteries later. It makes no sense. or even more, take it's HDD and plug it in somewere else later. The train could have escaped with just 1 robot, with the "brain" from everybody inside a pendrive, everything is plotdriven and makes no sense](#spoiler)



In summary, this movie is bad and everything happen so the plot twist can happen. Even more, everithing is **forced** so that the plot twist can happen. Most characters make bad decisions so that the "mistery" can be kept a little longer. It could have been a good movie. The original Idea from the plot is good, but it's like the writer did not think the plot not even for a minute.
