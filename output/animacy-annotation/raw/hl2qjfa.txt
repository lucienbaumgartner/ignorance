okay I now know *multiple* people who are claiming to be not white who are super duper mega white, and they're literally doing the "I'm 1/64th XYZ" and I almost can't handle it, you're not a POC, people do this shit with disabilities, I almost can't bite my tongue on it anymore, its so stupidly offensive. Like, you're wealthy, blonde haired, blue eyed, tall, from a wealthy white family and now you're a "POC" and so you feel like your life has been difficult when you have a million dollar+ trust fund behind you. its fucking remarkable. I can not fathom how extremely priviledged people are fighting tooth and nail to appear not so, maybe to make their narrative more interesting/to lie about what a 'fighter' they are? It always comes up when discussing how much you've over come so they have to invent a "as a native american..." narrative to somehow compete with another person at the table who has *real* mountains they've climbed, its so unaware and offensive to them, jesus. Like, you took a ancestry DNA mail-in kit thing that said you're 0.02% native, chill, you're not suddenly a civil rights hero for being .02% something and being born a millionaire.
