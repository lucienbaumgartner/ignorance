&gt;Almost every perverted moment is a shared scene between the 2 in some capacity.

Perverted scenes? What scenes?

&gt;Also I'm not ignoring anything, I've watched and read the same series you have, played the games, watched the movies, probably browsed the OP reddit. Am I not allowed to disagree?

You are allowed to disagree, but saying that Nami as a character has no defining moments or storylines is just ignorant and blatantly wrong.
That's what I pointed out.
