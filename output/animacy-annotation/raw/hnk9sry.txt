Smoke some weed or drink some alcohol first, you need to know how you react to altered states of mind before you dive into the world of psychedelics. Everything you've said sounds like a recipe for disaster and psychedelics can leave you with long term psychological problems which is all the more likely in your case, I'm not trying to scare you by saying this btw it just sounds like you're young and unaware of how huge of a leap you're thinking of making. Dropping acid is one of the most reality altering things you can do to yourself and whilst it can be an incredibly fun/healing/beautiful experience it also has the possibility of being a hellish one if handled incorrectly. Imo there's no such thing as a bad trip, only challenging ones, some believe that there are bad trips but I see it as the users fault rather than the drugs as at the end it's only a chemical. Stay safe and stay hydrated ðŸ’œ
