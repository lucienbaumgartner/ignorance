I'm well aware that people who book last minute are generally unprepared, non-planners and likely to be bad guests, but there is a sweet spot. Being booked solid a full 6 weeks in advance means you have good guests who got cheap rates. Being unbooked 2 weeks out means you are charging too much and eventually going to get bad guests. It's not a linear drop off. 

Every property and region is different. Outright dismissing a strategy is quite frankly, ignorant and unhelpful to OP. I'm glad you found what works for you. For me, I doubled my monthly gross income by raising my prices very high 2 months out, and tapering them down slowly every week until the week of booking. 

Further, you don't need to be booked solid to have optimal income. In fact you're probably better off not being booked solid if you are charging high enough. For example, if you charge $100/night and have a 100% monthly occupancy rate, that's $3k/mo in revenue. If you charge $300/night and you have a 30% monthly occupancy rate, that's the same amount of revenue, but your expenses went down. Less cleaning, less supplies, less wear and tear, and most importantly, less risk.
