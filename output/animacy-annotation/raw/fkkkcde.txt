All I keep thinking is that the US has a major problem with the fact that we have a bunch of service industry folk who are giving people things that they consume with their mouths and handling massive amounts of unclean cash and yet we can’t not show up to work, and most of us probably don’t have enough money to be out of work. 
So meanwhile, as clean as we can be with washing hands and following health dept rules,  here we still are probably existing as vectors for spreading the disease.
So what happens if and when we become like Italy? Whose going to pay the bills? 

So many people where I live believe all of this is a conspiracy to not reelect Trump, or something. So they are still coming out and I’m relieved because I can’t afford to not make money. I have no savings besides a crown bag of quarters. And then I just see these massive gatherings of people at my bar as the first cases of the virus are popping up in my state and am just like, we are fucking screwed.

The selfishness of the way our country has operated for years is deplorable. I’ll probably survive the virus. But what about my older, conspiracy-theory convinced regulars who might be ignorant but don’t deserve to die because massive amounts of underpaid Americans can’t afford to stay home from work? And the workers who won’t be able to pay rent because business is slowing and closing down because of this. Is this new unemployment bill covering workers whose shifts are being cut back and who are making a third of normal? Doubt it.
This could tank the economy if it gets as bad as Italy, which it sure might. And not one person deserves to die because our business and government and ceos are so cheap and ignorant that they can’t afford to support the people who make them their profits.
