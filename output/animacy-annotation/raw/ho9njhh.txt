* vaccination significantly lowers the likelihood of an individual's infection of SARS-CoV-2
* vaccination significantly lowers and may even prevent COVID-19 when an individual is infected with SARS-CoV-2, even considering variants that the vaccine was not directly created against
* with mass vaccinations, it is theorized by most epidemiologists, doctors, etc, mutations will significantly slow leading to higher efficacy for the vaccines
* mRNA vaccines are far safer than prior vaccinate technology, which introduced an adulterated version of the virus into the body
*people of all ages can have unknown underlying health issues, which COVID-19 can exasperate, leading to significant symptoms, long term health issues, or death
 
Also. if you are unaware, and most people are, SARS-CoV-2 is the virus/infection, COVID-19 is the symptom of the infection
