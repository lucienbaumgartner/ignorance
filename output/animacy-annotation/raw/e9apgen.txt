Your example of "the first person to scream rape" is incredibly backward and ignorant. That view of the world comes from MRA cesspools, not reality.

Why do you need to pick sides? Zirene did something that hurt some of his friends. It isn't up to anyone to decide if they are allowed to be hurt. They are hurt. That is real life. This isn't a debate. It's a sad thing that happened.

This isn't about who is right or who is wrong. People got hurt, things are messed up. It just is.

And don't presume to speak for Chat. I'm a fan and I don't agree with you at all. Encouraging them to pretend nothing happened is so gross to me. I love the openness and honesty of these streamers. The last thing I want is for them to hide how they feel.
