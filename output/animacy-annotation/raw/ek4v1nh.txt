First of all, you are (presumably) paying this person to do what they chose to do which is counsel those with emotional trauma or just emotional pain. It is so fucking RUDE and ignorant that she would do that; you should report it to your councils health board with her name as she is clearly not fit for this job. 

No matter how frustrated she is at you, she shouldn’t respond like that as she is a professional! 

Here in the U.K. if you attempt, idealise or let your therapist know of plans of suicide your confidentiality is broken and the appropriate parties told (usually your GP)

I can only sympathise with you about how this vile person responded; but please, do not think that death is what needs to happen. She is very very very veeeerrrrry wrong and I think a response like that could lose her this job. 

If it frustrated her that much, why would she reply? She is one toxic person and probably (not excusing) dealing with her own shit that she’ll need to sort before becoming a healer of others
