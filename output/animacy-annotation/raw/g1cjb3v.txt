Yeah, it's pretty hard to feel anything but bitterness and anger these days. People are intentionally putting me and my family in danger, over what some psychopath narcissist says. Every day is a new, lower bar. Every day I think, how could this possibly get any worse? And the next day it does. I've been inside for 5 months now, and I don't know if I can see an end in sight.

It may just be the case that the USA has been corrupted too deeply, people have gotten too intensely stupid and ignorant, that we probably aren't coming back from this. It doesn't matter what happens in November, this country is clearly beyond repair as it stands.

**The only way we can fix the USA is to let the South secede like we should have in the first place.** The sane part of the country should just build the biggest wall ever made around the red states, and make them pay for it. They can live in their little Republican shit hole with their tyrannical leaders who play political games with their lives. They can have their low taxes and the non existent social services that come with those. The crumbling infrastructure, one of the worst educational systems in the world, a wildly corrupt health care system, zero safety net for job loss or disability, what the fuck ever.

Then the rest of us can move on with our lives.
