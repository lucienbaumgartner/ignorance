You have to see this through the lens of theatre.

Everyday folk are completely incapable of fully grasping the complex, harsh realities of the world. This is an entirely intentional effect, perpetrated by misinformation, disinformation and an obfuscation of the political process.

Reality being inscrutable and difficult, people retreat into a symbolic reality, one in which complexities are replaced with simple "truths". In which every difficult sequence of events has a managed narrative. People retreat into a simplified version of the world they feel is "relatable". Clearly defined "enemies", clearly defined "teams", etc...

From this lens, politicians are actors. They perpetuate the managed narrative, and are rewarded within an internal structure. But regardless of how high they climb, they will always be actors in someone else's script. They may be promoted to a lead part, but they are still just an actor. 

Meanwhile in the stands: the crowd cheers for Othello to win out over Iago, simultaneously aware and unaware that neither is real, disbelief permanently suspended.
