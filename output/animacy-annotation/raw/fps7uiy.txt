In recent years there has been some push back against what Obama's administration did against sexual issues in education. Some of that pushback is justified. Some colleges drastically overreacted on the issue and created virtual court systems that gave so much credit and protection to the accuser it was extremely difficult if not impossible to prove innocence even if you were in fact innocent.  Essentially they took the "believe all women" idea, something rooted in good intentions, turned it up to eleven, and as a result, bad things unsurprisingly started to happen.  

I think in part the DoE is trying to moderate the regulations to strike a balance between protections for the accused that are essential to the American idea of justice, and effectively prosecuting sexual harassment and assault claims. I think that's the intention, but leadership is so incompetent and ignorant that we're now yoyoing around to the other side of extreme viewpoints on this issue. 

But I'm more generally willing to assume incompetence over malice.  I could be very wrong
