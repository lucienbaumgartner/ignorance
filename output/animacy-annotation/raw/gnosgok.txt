Sure, I can get behind this. As I said it’s a hard thing to balance sometimes. Imagine some players that are new and unaware of the purpose of dark sight facing “experienced” snipers in the scenario I’ve mentioned previously. I would struggle to look at this situation and make a change in game affecting everyone that’s healthy for Hunt’s longevity.
