This is often the case for me. Most of the time when it's a sexist meme, or a comment that's slinging ignorance without really discussing anything I down vote and move on. Other times I don't feel like I really have anything constructive or valuable to add other than saying "what you said is ignorant and dumb" so I don't. Again, I down vote and move on.
