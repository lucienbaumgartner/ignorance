You really think its racist to look at an environment and claim issues that came from that environment? I also think he's being a bit dumb, they're uneducated and ignorant of things, sure.. but there could very well be a PHD-having person on that plane hanging on.

They very clearly articulated their reasons for their odd belief. No need to make assumptions on racism just because it makes you  feel more right.
