So still no numbers? I gave actual numbers. From WHO (World Health Organization). 

It’s one thing for you think the U.S. and Fauci don’t have accurate numbers — but to claim that the ENTIRE WORLD is making up numbers is next level stupid. 

I’m not “picking a fight.” I questioned your idiotic statement and you couldn’t back it up. That’s on you, not me. Don’t get mad at me because YOU’RE ignorant and stubborn. That’s not my fault. That’s yours.
