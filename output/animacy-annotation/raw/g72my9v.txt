Advocating for communism (as you say, no state, on par with socialism) and ignoring 20th century history really does not put you in any position to advocate for it. 

You wandered into r/Capitalism, with shocking ignorance of socialism in practice, and proceeded to dodge a question, while making light of the absolute elimination of 1/3 of the human population of a society in the name of socialism/communism. And proceeded to blame free people and free markets for the actions of socialists/communists.

That is disgusting and evil. I hope you are simply innocent and ignorant. That can be corrected on your own.
