Thank you my friend! Hope it was butter popcorn - not sure why classic salted even exists. 

Agree on everything you said - about how she is so numb and unaware and in the zone - that a slight provocation brings out her true nature. CLAP. I want to see so much more of this. My hope is that this season was focused on Vs growth - and the next one will give us everything we need to see in the Dark!Eve rising frame.
