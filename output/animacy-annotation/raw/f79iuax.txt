Ya I agree that sure don cherry shouldn’t get demonized and it should be forgotten that he has done so many great things for the sport and for communities but at the same time it’s comments like those (factless and ignorant) that are “ripping the country apart” it’s not the immigrants that come here that are the problem.  Ya there’s going to be growing pains and adjustments for EVERYONE involved.  Some things I’ve had to do are being more patients with people that are learning English, maybe sometimes not understanding a conversation between two people (or a group) in a foreign language (makes me feel left out or out of the loop sometimes), and maybe sometimes not understanding a specific cultural behaviour that I’m not familiar with which can be very frustrating I get that.  BUT thats a sacrifice I am totally willing to make 100 times out of 100, to make a better world not just for me, not just for Canadians but everyone.  Patients, respect and understanding from BOTH parties plays such in important role in integration of immigrants.  I thing if everyone has those three things when it comes to solving political problems I think we’d be on a path that’s moving forward.
