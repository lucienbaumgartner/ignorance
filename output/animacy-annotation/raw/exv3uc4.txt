Your comments make you seem both aware and unaware that your surroundings have an influence on you. You seem aware that you grew up in a more accepting and open area where you were influenced by others to have that opinion. At the same time you're smug about coming to to that opinion before someone who came to the same conclusion as you, just a little bit later, all while growing up in an area where people might be less open and it's a harder and less safe opinion to hold.

How can you be smug about an opinion that you acknowledge was influenced by your surroundings, while looking down on others for coming to the same conclusion as you, despite that fact their surroundings might be telling them the opposite.
