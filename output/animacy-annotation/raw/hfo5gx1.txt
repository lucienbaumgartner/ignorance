&gt;Yet the initial reporting cast the story as a David vs. Goliath 

This was only half the reporting. The other half of the reporting was old media that didn't bother to examine the short squeeze angle and reported it as "reckless retail investor push GameStop prices to unreasonable levels". Either the old media was intentionally ignoring the story about reckless hedge funds over shorting a stock, or it was incompetent and unaware of what people on WSB did know which was that these meme stocks were over shorted creating an opportunity to make a lot of money.

I'm more likely to believe the media was incompetent, or believed their audience too stupid to understand a short squeeze, so they just told them the easier story of a "Robinhood revolt". But the misrepresentation of the story by the media fed into the true believer narrative that the financial system is rigged for the wealthy and all the halls of power will collude to keep it that way
