Jesus H. Christ, are you fucking kidding me?  Do you seriously believe that all impoverished people own cars, have access to medical care, have electricity, have a cell phone, have access to the internet, etc.? 

Do you think all of those are just *benefits* that make impoverished peoples' lives better, not literally *requirements* to even *have* a job?  A job which may not even pay enough to cover those expenses? 

150 million Americans struggle with medical dept.  That's nearly half the population.  50 million Americans go to bed hungry every night, including 15 million *children*. 

Are you so privileged and ignorant that you've never met a homeless American?  Because there are over 1 million of them. Nearly *1 billion* people worldwide have no access to electricity or running water, but hey fuck them because they're not American and don't count, right? 

I am honestly fucking appalled that you have the utterly heartless temerity to believe that poor people today are better off than rich people a century ago.  For fucks sake you asshole, maybe do 5 minutes of research before you post such a blatantly inaccurate and frankly insulting take.

Sincerely,
Fuck You
