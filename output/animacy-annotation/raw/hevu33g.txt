I think my only point was that Democrats take part in gerrymandering, regardless of how successful or not.  In the podcast that this post is referring to, the reporter made it seem as if Democrats were naive and unaware of the methods and effectiveness of gerrymandering. For the last few episodes where Michael Barbaro wasn't hosting, I've noticed an sharp pick up of liberal bias, namely in the paraphrasing by Nicholas Fandos.

And while I appreciate the time to write and research that last comment, I'm not sure if it addresses my own comment.
