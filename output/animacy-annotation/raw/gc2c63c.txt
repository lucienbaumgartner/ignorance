Yta. You don't know every teacher in the world, and being a teacher doesn't equate being a good human being. I've encountered many shitty teachers over my school career, fortunately nobody abusive, but who are you to tell teachers can't be abusive. At 13 years old one is not completely naive and unaware of what goes on around them, and probably that child understood more than you gave them credit for. You have a shitty attitude.

"They should glad anyone cares about their welfare at all." 

I wouldn't want a nurse like you around my children.
