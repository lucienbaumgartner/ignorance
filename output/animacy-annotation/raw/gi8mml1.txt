The writers feel very detached and unaware of how feelings work. Which sounds really harsh but I honestly can’t think of a clearer way to put it. They treat all negative actions the same, so everyone reacts the same to someone killing one person, as everyone reacts to ending a species. 

While both of these are negative, the reactions and feelings towards them would not realistically be the same. It seems there’s really not ceiling as to how far someone can go and still be presented as sympathetic. Which is a problem. Aside from it not making sense, I would question what kind of person is writing this story, who feels objectively that her actions are excusable? Genocide being present in the game puts a certain amount of responsibility on a writer. It’s in theory okay to include that, but they need to consider that Warcraft’s generalized morals are based on our own. Are there differences? Yes. But on the whole, what’s considered good there is considered bad out here in real life. Killing an innocent? Bad. Giving money to the poor? Good. 

The basic concept of morality is identical to ours here in reality, and so taking a real concept, genocide, and positing that there could be a good reason for it, is in my opinion... I don’t know about offensive, but certainly tone deaf and highly questionable.
