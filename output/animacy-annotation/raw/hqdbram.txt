Did you miss the data coming out of South Africa when omicron started? Stating that this variant is likely caused by a vaccinated person being the source. Hence why it is vaccine resistant? Not anti vax but to be sooo fully pro vax saying it’s the cure all and unvaccinated are to Blaine for everything is very ignorant and just wrong. There are a lot of fucking stupid anti vax people out there but you can’t call yourself unbiased if you’re making this a political issue instead of looking at rational solutions.
