Why even say that? Any person without a subjective polarized mind could see that what I meant was in an ideal situation that’s how things would go. This system was created long before us all and that’s why you think “I” need them. I don’t truly because at the end of the day if shit didn’t work out I’ll do what I need to do to survive. Your statement was unneeded and ignorant of the facts at hand. 

And you’re right, that’s what I did. And it worked and all is well. What I’m saying is though that it seems a bit unnecessary for us to have to do all of that and for them to do it as well. Time is money and it just seems like a very inefficient way of doing things.
