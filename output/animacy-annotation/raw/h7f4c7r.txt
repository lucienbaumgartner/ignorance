It’s a bit of both. The guy is so detached from reality yet not. He’s a manchild, aware and unaware of the things that he’s doing. Heck, the guy might even be expecting a fucking realm collision between his fantasy world and reality. He head-butted his wall repeatedly hoping that his so-called fantasy world was behind there.

He’s a mad guy, but he could go fuck off for all I know.
