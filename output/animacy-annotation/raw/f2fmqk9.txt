Wow, imagine being so entitled and ignorant that you think someone having a potential illness and needing to take a bathroom break in their own home is evidence of them being from a third world country??? (Don't see how this relates at all) and being more concerned about how the situation affected you than the fact that someone might be ill, but gave you a massage anyway.

Grow up dude. Shit happens.
