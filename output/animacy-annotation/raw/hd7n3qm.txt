&gt; If it has milk in the title and doesn’t contain milk then by uk consumer trading standards they would be breaking the law.

Evidently not, otherwise these products would not be sold.

&gt;If you disagree then take it up with the uk government.

I don't have to, because the law very clearly doesn't ban plant-based milks from being sold as milk. Peanut butter, coconut milk, soy milk, all fine.

&gt;I only teach this sort if thing in my lectures, I’m a nutrition lecturer, I don’t work for the gov. Well, technically I do but nothing to do with trading standards.

I truly fucking hope this isn't true if you are this feeble-minded and ignorant. That clearly isn't the law on the matter, nor is it valid to suggest people get confused when the see oat milk. I highly doubt a lecturer would ever make as inane and untrue comments as yours, but then again you claim to work in nutrition rather than a real field like dietetics, so maybe you are one.
