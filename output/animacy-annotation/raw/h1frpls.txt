The scariest thing is that I have friends that I love who are faithful readers of this...not sure when they switched from just being pro-life to anti vax, anti Pope, anti Democrat...its not "catholic" in the strictest sense of the word. Have mentioned this to my priest. Approximately 10% of active Catholics believe in QAnon conspiracy, whether they call it that or not. Its disturbing and ignorant of the faith. Bishops and priests subscribe to this, too.
