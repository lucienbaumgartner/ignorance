You’re a 19-year-old janitor and I’m a 27-year-old Business Analyst who can actually afford to do whatever she wants, regardless of there being a man in my life or not (I have a fiancee currently). Just because you’re useless and unaware of the dangers of being useless, doesn’t mean the rest of us are.

Or you’re a hateful woman-hating incel. Not sure which is worse tbh.
