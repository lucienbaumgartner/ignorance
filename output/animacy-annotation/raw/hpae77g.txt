My girlfriend is full filipino but born in Britain, I am fully white British, she speaks tagalog and wants to teach it to our children, I agree, because they will be half filipino and its part of their culture. You are an idiot and sound stupidly racist with this awful take. Yes your son is American but he has a full filipino half of the family. How do you expect him to bond with that half of his family? Awful take, do better. The only thing he will be confused by is why you don't want him to know anything about his culture. And you will have to explain to him that you're ignorant and racist.
