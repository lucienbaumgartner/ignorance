That’s a lot of words and excuses just to say “I’m all for helping make the world a better place as long as it doesn’t infringe on my right to be happy and ignorant of all the bad things in the world. And if you make me feel bad about contributing to a bad thing, then I’m going to blame YOU instead of taking personal responsibility!!”
