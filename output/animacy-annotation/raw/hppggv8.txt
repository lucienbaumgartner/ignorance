I have a girlfriend who was raised in a similar way as your husband and she developed a nasty ED that has taken her years to overcome and it is still a struggle sometimes. Restricting food is a terrible idea and you should not listen to his parents thoughts on this matter because they're ignorant and out dated. Let your daughter eats what she wants, she is exercising regularly it seems and she's not just eating junk all of the time, there is nothing wrong with that. NTA but please keep your daughter away from your husband's parents
