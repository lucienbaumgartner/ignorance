She trash talked people all on her own. The difference is other HGs own it. For some extremely strange reason, Nicole can't own the player archetype she actually is. She's one of the biggest snakes and worst strategic players in BB history. It's not a big deal and there's nothing offensive about stating that. It's entertaining and funny above all else. It's just that she's so... unaware and offended, seemingly by everything.
