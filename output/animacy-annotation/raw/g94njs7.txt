In the countries that I'm aware of, this doesn't generally take place as an injection. You drink/swallow the medications. This is very different to the lethal injection procedure used in the USA that is used to kill prisoners. The American system is barbaric and because medical practitioners refuse to get involved can often result in pain and discomfort. However, during euthanasia the entire purpose of the procedure is to ensure a peaceful and pain free death. Therefore it is organised in such a way to ensure you are asleep and unaware of what is going on as you pass away.
