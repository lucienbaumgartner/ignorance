May I Introduce, The Vampire

Reasoning: I chose this character to be a dark elf because of their resistance to fire and vampires have a weakness to fire, so really the only drawbacks of being a vampire now is the sunlight damage.

Gear: The mighty count can wield either mephala’s daedric artifact, the Ebony Blade or use Harkon’s sword with a destruction spell in the other hand and wears the vampire royal armor with vampire gloves and boots, plus the diadem of the savant, you also can wear either the ring of the beast if you chose the Ebony Blade or the ring of the erudite if you chose the Harkon spell sword style and any enchanted necklace of choice.

Play style: His style of fighting is charging into battle without fear, chugging all kinds of powerful potions he has at his disposal and when you deem it brassard, turn into a Vampire Lord. With that kind of ancient knowledge, all will fall before you.

Companion: I think it’s rather obvious who The Vampire would want by his side but just in case, you’re going to want Serena by your side as you’re loyal servant. Also you should have the great stead Shadowmere as your mount.

Factions: The groups of people that you should  associate yourself should be evil and unaware that what they are doing is wrong. A good example of what kinds of people I mean are the Dark Britherhood. You should also do plenty of evil quests and quest that can make you more powerful, such as the main story and the daedric quests.
