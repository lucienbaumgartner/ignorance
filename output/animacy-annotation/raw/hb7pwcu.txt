I agree that people say “I’m sorry” too often, but your criteria for when you should say it is kinda silly. 

Cutting someone off in the grocery store isn’t morally wrong. But you should apologize because you just inconvenienced somebody else’s day because of your lack of spatial awareness. If you didn’t apologize in this situation, you would be seen as rude and unaware of your own actions. 

I don’t think your actions need to be morally incorrect for them to warrant an apology. If your actions inconvenienced another person in some way or another, then you should apologize.
