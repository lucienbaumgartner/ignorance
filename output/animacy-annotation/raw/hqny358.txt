I can tell you’re a clown because you say you “run your own unit”. Bruh . The ego on this guy. No competent doctor will claim that. ICU nurses, RT’s , consultants play a huge role in patient care in ICU. 

Also, as you must know from experience, in medicine 
You run across many patients who are ignorant and uneducated. It’s your responsibility to care for them regardless instead of ridiculing them or gloating when they die. 

For a patient like this- why keep telling them they have covid? Just say they have a viral infection and need treatment. You gotta have a little more sense as a clinician… you’re gonna get upvoted here because people here love when covid deniers die. 

Also you told the ER doc not to intubate him? So the guy was DNR/DNI?
