OVER your nose, sir. 

You don’t have COVID? Damn, it’s like you actually don’t understand how viral infection works. Ignorant logic. Here’s how it works. 

COVID takes 2-14 days to show symptoms following exposure. This means that for 2-14 days after EXPOSURE (meaning you are carrying the virus. Get it? Good) you will STILL BE HEALTHY and unaware that you are infected. 

So Mr. r/iamverysmart — let’s say you were exposed and then for those... let’s give it an average of 8... those 8 days, your dumb ass is not wearing your mask over your nose because you falsely believe you “don’t have the virus”. How many people do you think came in to contact with your nasty viral droplets from your nose while you just assumed you were healthy?
