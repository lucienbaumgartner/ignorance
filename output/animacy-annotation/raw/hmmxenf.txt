I'll give you an example from my brain.

Me: reads a tweet (by the way - Twitter is HORRIBLE for this - it literally just gave the nasty voices in my head a million new scripts for arguments. Deleting my twitter and blocking the site on my browser was one of the top two or three best things I ever did for my mental health) that says "how brave of \[some person dealing with cancer\] to fight this illness without opioids!" and then another tweet in reply that says "How dare you imply that people who use opioids aren't brave?!?!"

Voice 1: Yeah! She's right! How dare they?

Voice 2: But the OP was just saying that about their sick friend- you are such a jerk for overanalyzing something they said about their sick friend-

Voice 1: -That is so privileged and ignorant of you to think that what they say about their friend doesn't have effects on other people! That person needs to be more mindful of their words!

Voice 2: But that person didn't have to chew them out about it on Twitter, and-

Voice 1: -TWITTER IS SOME PEOPLE'S ONLY RESOURCE FOR RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH! THE INTERNET HAS LEVELED THE PLAYING FIELD. OTHER MEDIA ARE BIASED TOWARD WEALTHY, EDUCATED WESTERNERS AND THE CISHET ABLED PERSPECTIVE- AND NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO NEWSPAPERS-

Voice 2: BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY! AND TWITTER IS OVERRUN WITH RACIST AND MISOGYNIST ABUSE THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN DOING ANYTHING ABOUT- 

The actual me: -OMG SHUDDUP I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.

Voice 1: YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SLEEP! YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GOOD MENTAL HEALTH! HOW DARE YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT SLEEP AND MENTAL HEALTH WHEN A BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER? MENTAL HEATH IS FOR THE PRIVILEGED-

Voice 2: -OMG THAT IS SUCH AN ABLEIST COMMENT!

...aaaand etc, etc, etc. You get the idea.

I get what you're saying about it maybe not being autism, but autism and anxiety go together so often that personally I can't always be bothered to pick apart which of the two is causing my current distress. :) My anxiety so frequently stems from trying to understand the neurotypical world and its (to me) weird perspectives that it often feels like part and parcel of the same thing with being autistic.
