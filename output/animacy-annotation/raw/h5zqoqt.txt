Hey mate, so sorry you are going through this. I can relate to being young and unaware of the rules. Please don't feel down. You are literally 10 months away from being eligible to going back to the states to see your friends and family. I know that the visa process is painful, but honestly 10 years in the future when you are in the states and happy, all of this will seem like a distant dream. Keep your chin up lad / lass.
