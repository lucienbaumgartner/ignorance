Should a person be held responsible for things someone related to them did whilst they:
A: Were asleep and unaware of it
And B: Could therefore do nothing to stop it

If, for example, I bring someone to my house and murder them while my wife sleeps in that house, and she has  o knowledge of the incident, should she be held responsible?

Because right now you're saying Breonna Taylor is somehow responsible for her boyfriend (ie someone else) shooting at police, and therefore if she gets shot it's ok. Breonna Taylor did not do anything. She did not fire a gun. She did not threaten or attack police. Whether her boyfriend's reaction to the intrusion is valid or not is unimportant in this matter. Taylor did not do anything, and the fact that a person that did not do anything was shot by the police is a travesty.
