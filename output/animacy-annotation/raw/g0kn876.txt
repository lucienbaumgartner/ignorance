No it isn’t... it’s absolutely a red herring and now you’ve turned it into a straw man as well. My entire point, which I’ve illustrated and sourced pretty thoroughly, is that historical and systemic racism absolutely has an effect on equal access to opportunity and equitable outcomes today. To say that shit is all in the past and that history doesn’t matter is absolutely absurd. No one with any shred of credibility would suggest that the measurable generational (and again, when discussing mass incarceration and the drug war, very current) socioeconomic impacts of racist policies in the US suddenly don’t matter or have any impact. That is so completely and utterly foolish and ignorant that it’s really not even worth as many words as I’ve already dedicated to it here. This conversation and your just world bias has actually been a marvelous display of the exact kind of privileged worldview that the original post is about though, so I applaud you for presenting such a wonderful case study.
