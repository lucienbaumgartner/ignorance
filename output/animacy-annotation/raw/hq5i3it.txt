It's not inherently racist to acknowledge a statistics like "desire making up 13% of the national population, the black community accounts for 50% of arrests" but having no follow-up is clearly suppose to imply black people are inherently more criminal.

If you know where these statistics come from, you know it's an alarming result of systemic racism. If you just kind of shrug your arms and wink at everyone, yeah you're ignorant and racist.
