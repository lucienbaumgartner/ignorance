I’m sorry that your dad is/was unaware and abusive. It’s not right, it’s not fair and you don’t deserve it. It wasn’t your fault. Even if he ever ended up being diagnosed and still treated you that way  there is absolutely no excuse for that behaviour.

I had a brief….thing….with someone who I believe strongly was on the spectrum and was emotionally/psychologically abusive. The way he spoke about himself it’s like he knew but never said it out loud.  he used it as an excuse for his behaviour, like it was ok somehow? I felt like he didn’t know any better and I tried so hard to understand his behaviours. Ultimately it was traumatic for me.

My mom was abusive too. She had tantrums, she beat us, all the things. I repressed all of this until I started to go to therapy. It’s been painful and eye-opening. I think she is completely unaware. Maybe she knows she is different somehow but I don’t know. What do I excuse? What’s ok and what isn’t? I’m still working through those feelings and it’s confusing.

Something I read, or that my therapist maybe said to me was that we are allowed to grieve what we could have had. We are allowed to grieve the fact that we didn’t have supportive parents, or that we didn’t have the right supports or guidance. It hurts to know these things and it’s ok to grieve them. 

I see my parents in a different light but my relationship with them is….ok? I’m not close to them, really. They aren’t capable of understanding and supporting me and I have to accept that. 

I do agree that a proper DX would be a good place to start to understand yourself. Even if you don’t get one, you know what your truth is. I may or may not seek one myself. But you can start with validating yourself as much as possible. This sub has been supportive and a good place to find like-minded people.
