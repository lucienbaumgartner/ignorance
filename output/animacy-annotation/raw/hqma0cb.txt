I’m a 21 year old diabetic female who’s married and come from a family of diabetics. I’d like to say we have a ton of time tbh. Especially because we make healthier choices, get blood work done often and rule out other diseases, etc. So next time someone says something so ignorant and blatantly rude let them know that who knows how long THEY have left 🤷🏻‍♀️
