Yes they are. Dogs are innocent in the sense that they are totally unaware and incapable of being aware about the human world, and the horrible things we can do, and they themselves have a very limited world view that exists on pure instinct, like a baby. Dogs don't have romantic feelings, they can't fall in love, they can't make meaningful conversation even amongst themselves, their personality consists of food, rest, play, sex, violence, and sleep, and they don't have the ability to exhert control over these things because their drive isn't fueled by logic or reasoning, but just the animalistic desire to live, breed, and die. A dog will eat food if it's there, where take a dump when it wants, and has sex with anything resembling a dog. They can't even comprehend why they put their faith and trust in their owners, they just assume that you care about them as much as they care about you, and you could abuse that trust multiple times over and they'll still continue to believe in you,  much like a young child. If that isn't innocence I'm not sure what is.
