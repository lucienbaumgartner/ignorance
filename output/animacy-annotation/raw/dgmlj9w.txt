I wasn't even born when the Original Trilogy came out, and when I watched all 6 films in order (1-6) many years ago I wasn't even aware that they were "prequels", I was just a kid and I watched them all totally unaware and unbiased, and even then I still didn't like 1-3. It's nothing to do with "nostalgia" for the original trilogy, the prequels are just crappier films, and all of the changes he has made to the originals (for the most part) just make the films worse.

George Lucas had much less control over the Original Trilogy, and when it came to the Prequels, he just surrounded himself with yes men and had all the control he wanted, and what he made just wasn't all that good.
