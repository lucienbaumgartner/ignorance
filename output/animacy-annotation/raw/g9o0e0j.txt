Don’t forget high blood pressure! Even if it’s managed with medication, it’s a serious risk factor, last I heard. 

My favorite idiocy was “well, the people with preexisting conditions probably aren’t contributing members of society anyway,” like people with disabilities are worthless? That was before we knew a whole lot about how common risk factors are, but even back then, there was no reason to think covid only killed people who were physically unable to work. Sorry, it just stuck with me how cruel and ignorant that comment was, and I didn’t just hear it from one person, either.
