ok right I am the dumbass but you are the person who isn't intelligent enough to see the problem with when the good player lands on the eva and the bad player lands on the p2020, you are so biased and ignorant that you only use the opposite biased example. On the flip side because of RNG the bad player gets killed in either scenario because a good player will drop a bad player with a p2020 even if they get a peacekeeper. However when SBMM is on and the skill range is tighter a diamond 4 can drop a predator on the drop, but a bronze isnt likely to pull that off. 

Meanwhile, good players are supposed to be smart enough to know and respect their opponents. IE dont drop hot if you don't want to deal with RNG, good player learn how to mitigate and adapt to RNG so long as the skill range is tight enough to allow for it. Go somewhere else and loot up. IE why you see the pros all land in different locations.
