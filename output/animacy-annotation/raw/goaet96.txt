What really fucking grinds my gears is the fact that when you upload to YouTube, it literally won't give you the option to publish it unless you specifically mark whether or not it's safe for kids.

Then there's the rule of no swearing in the first minute, that's fair in case of a random click I guess.

But when you read the terms and conditions, youtube actually allows nudity provided it's not for sexually arousing purposes. They allow swears of all sorts provided they aren't used in violence in a discriminatory manner.

But your getting channels and videos taken down, demonotised, or banned for auto-mod flagging it up regardless of whether or not its within the t&amp;cs. 

The hammer is random, unyielding, and ignorant of it's own code. It's absolute horseshit.
