 Well since humans are terrible at making that connection I don't see how dogs would be better. 

 Many people are pregnant and unaware, and some cultures don't even believe sex leads to pregnancy! 

Dogs don't noticeably act differently around pregnant dogs, why would they for humans?

Dogs that are used for anxiety or Neuro disorders are capable of sensing things, but the actions are taught not innate to the animal. 

Now I leave room for the possibility, and certainly don't see why a dog couldn't smell hormonal changes, but it's big leap to smell a change in odor and know what it means. This to me less likely an event than an observer enjoying some confirmation bias. 

Dogs are pretty surprising animals but they're not magic.
