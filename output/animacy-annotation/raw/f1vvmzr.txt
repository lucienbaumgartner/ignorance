But what bad stuff does it do? That's the problem I'm having, I've never seen any of the problems others have so I feel unaware and unaffected. I'll check out mixplorer silver but I've never seen it recommended before so my hopes aren't too high for it.

Does mixplorer silver have a recycling bin? I don't want to waste Â£5
