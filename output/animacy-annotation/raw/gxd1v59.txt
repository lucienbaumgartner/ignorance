imagine being so arrogant, and ignorant, 

that you honestly believe you should be able to dictate what other people say, or hear. 

i get it. 

you are just another intellectual coward, another sheep who prefers to follow than to lead, 

who is scared to have his version of "reality" challenged by the real world. 

you know, if you weren't such a coward... if you weren't so scared... if you weren't so yellow-bellied...

instead of running your ignorant mouth about things you know nothing about, 

why not open your ears, and open your eyes, and open your mind...

to alternative viewpoints. 

we all know that "diversity" to you mean diversity of skin color, not diversity of opinions.  

we know it drives you absolutely nuts when "people of color" are conservatives. 

thats why you call them "uncle tom", 

because thats exactly what a racist would think
