Ok? 

The point I was making is that /u/FirstPlebian was making a bad argument by assuming that the only other options for such a position were political appointees. Which is wrong, because **far and away** the vast majority of "government jobs" are just simply jobs you apply for and do the work as your 9 to 5. 

If I assume good faith, they're just passionate and ignorant of such a thing. But regardless, it was a bad argument.
