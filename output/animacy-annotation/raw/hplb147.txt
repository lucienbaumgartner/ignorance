Also grew up in New England. Casual racism was everywhere. The amount of white kids I heard use the n-word to be funny is just... gross. I cringe when I think back on it, but for a long time after high school I chalked it up ignorance and immaturity, but with no real malicious intent. After the last couple years though, facebook has forced me to concede that some of those people either absolutely DID have malicious intent or they stayed the same level of ignorant and immature they were in HS.
