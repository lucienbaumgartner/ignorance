I'm imagining some stupidly liberal college kid (like I once was) reading this. If I had, my walk-away moment would have come a lot sooner than it did. All of these documents and NOTHING EVER about doing right by citizens. Only how to lie, manipulate, and "conspire to produce an unaware and compliant populace". They don't give a rat's ass about anyone but themselves. They're all like Piglet Navarro filing her nails.
