it's not healthy for you to generalise the way you do.

"Well, considering conservatives are the ones who have traditionally openly hated LGBTQ people, pushed against women's rights, been openly racist, and have denied or simply not cared about climate change...
  

  
I don't think conservatives have any right to complain about being hated unless they are both uneducated and ignorant of the implications of the movements they associate themselves with."

so I am uneducated and ignorant? then what are you? my policies would actually help the people in society we can help. yours just breed dependency.
