It was definitely funny when it happened. But the t-shirts and flags and all that stuff has gotten out of hand. It’s not funny anymore, and it just comes across as being ignorant and childish. 

If you want to say “fuck joe Biden”, then say it. Don’t puss out and hide behind a meme. If you are going to have a political belief so strong you’ll wear a t-shirt with the slogan to Disneyworld, you should stand behind that belief.
