People like this, make me genuinely wonder how many are trolls on this page. Truly, because maybe I'm hopeful that no one is THIS ignorant and neglectful to their children. But sadly, I'm well aware, that people like this OP do exist. And they will always be TA. 

YTA. I hope you re-evaluate how you look at your children. Especially when they're adults.
