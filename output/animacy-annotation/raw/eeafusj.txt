As for older bands that I enjoy and that have influenced my riding for Undergang I guess would be (some more obvious than others) Carcass, Autopsy, Grave, Funebre, Xysma, Disgrace, Exhaust, Impetigo, Blood, Grotesque Infection, Rottrevore, Eviscium, ... And for newer bands that I love who makes death metal so heavy and ignorant that I feel like I get dumber from listening to it I'd recommend Fetid, Torture Rack, Cerebral Rot, Galvanizer... Off the top my my cracked skull
