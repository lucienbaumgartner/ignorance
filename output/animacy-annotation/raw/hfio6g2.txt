Well that is stating the obvious. No industry policies and only the coal and resources horse in the race can we expect a bright future with such stupidity?. 

This government is clearly willing to wreck our economic futures with the blinded stubbornness about coal. They must owe the coal industry a lot in terms of paying back their donations to be so blind sighted and ignorant  that they are willing to effectively economically wreck our nation.

What I dont understand is why they are willing to sacrifice it all. I can understand that its their ideology and they love coal and supporting the coal industry. But what harm will it do to really to have a diversified strategy of supporting  their coal donors demand while at the same time supporting other industries and technology. At least we could develop  and be ready for whatever the future holds. Now all our government seems to want to do is sabotage everything else in our economic futures just for the  ability to say for  this for their ideology " see we told you coal was the future we would not be a broke nation if you listened to us and the coal industry" Its clear that they are willing to sabotage Australia and Australians economic future with this blind sighted stupidity that will wreck our economy.
