A lot of people seem to equate "NYT bestseller" and "popular YouTuber" with "powerful person," which is so mind-bogglingly reductive and ignorant that it's hard to know where to begin with correcting them. Like, getting a single book on the NYT bestseller list for a few weeks doesn't magically give you the same clout as Stephen King. Having a successful YouTube channel doesn't mean that you wield any meaningful power outside the confines of your own channel.

I read takes like the one in the OP and think, "Hooray, always nice to read the opinion of somebody who doesn't actually know how the world works."
