This is a massively privileged and uninformed take on the issue.

The issue at hand is not girl spaces or boy spaces.  The issue is that the GS is in no way equivalent to the BSA, and their is no way to make it so.  

The BSA is bigger, older, better funded, wider reaching, more prestigious (at least in part because of historic sexism) has many more/bigger/better camps and is part of a worldwide organization (which is already mostly coed and has been for years). The GS is none of those things, and acting like they can just "fix it" is totally ignorant of the reality. 

 It has literally taken a century and a worldwide movement to make scouting what it is, even if the GS wanted to achieve the same thing (they don't, they have different goals) and if they had a plan to make it so (again, they don't) it would take at minimum 50 years to achieve something even remotely comparable.  Meanwhile millions of young women (like my daughter)  would miss out on life-changing opportunities that you and I were privileged to enjoy because of something we had no control over.  

I'm sorry that the idea of women having the same opportunities you did makes you sad and uncomfortable, but that's life.  The truth is that the presence of women would not have diminished the value of the male role models you had in scouting.  You're going to encounter women in every part of your life for as long as you live (they are, in fact, half of all people you will meet)  and trying to prepare a young man for leadership while actively excluding women is doing him a massive disservice.  The exclusion is harmful to BOTH sexes.  

Besides all this, the girls have their own patrols at the scout level and their own packs at the cub level, and have their own female leaders in both cases.  So not only is your opinion exclusive reactionary trash, it's also completely unfounded and ignorant of the reality of the situation.
