If they can't cope with driving at the posted limit - nighttime, rain, and fog notwithstanding - then they should do the right thing and pull over to let you pass.

If you don't have the skills to drive at the posted speed, don't obstruct others. 

If you don't pull over, you're either a cunt who shouldn't be on the road, or so unaware and unobservant that you shouldn't be on the road. Simple, really.
