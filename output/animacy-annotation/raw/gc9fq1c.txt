Its not yourself you should be worried about. Just use antisceptic, wash you hands often, cover them sneezes and coughs, and dont talk much. The entire point of wearing masks is to prevent the respiratory droplets from touching another person. If there is no mask, there is nothing blocking those droplets from getting onto other people. So please if you would, wear a mask so we can get over this goddamn pandemic. Once it is over, you will be free to not wear a mask but because you choose not to, you are being selfish and ignorant that you would choose yourself over other people. Imagine willfully giving someone the virus without you know it, and that ends up killing them. How would that make you feel that you indrectly caused someone to die because you decided to be selfish?
