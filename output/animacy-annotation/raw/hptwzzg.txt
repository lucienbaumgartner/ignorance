Your just ignoring stuff that was canon for years just because it is inconvenient to your view of the force. Look man a lot of us developed our view when legends was the expanded universe and was still canon. 

What our actual issue is here is phiosophical. I disagree with the Jedi on a philosophical level just like I do with the Sith. I find them narrow minded and dogmatic and ignorant of the fact that their own order is just as much of a bastardization of the force as the Siths. 

Legends is there, it exist, and we arenâ€™t going to go away just because you start yelling canon.
