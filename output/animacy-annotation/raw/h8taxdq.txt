Ahh, I get it. "A site I don't like said it so it must be false." While I'll mainly point out how stupid and ignorant that reasoning is, there are also tons of other sources:

Like CNN https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/politics/us-sends-plane-iran-400-million-cash/index.html

And the LA Times
https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-iran-payment-cash-20160907-snap-story.html

And CNBC
https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/02/us-sent-400-million-in-cash-to-iran-as-prisoners-were-freed-wsj-reports.html
