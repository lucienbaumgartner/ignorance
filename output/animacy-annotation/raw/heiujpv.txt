That's the problem: he is carrying the assumption that all life will follow his home planet's path and all life will die. It's so narrow focused and ignorant that it's outright lunacy. He literally highlights the problem of lack of resources for people and decides to kill his own people instead of build an empire for the shake of acquiring resources. He established a government, built an empire and lined himself up with all the abilities necessary to help balance resource inequality and instead he went "warlord goes brrrrr" and just got to killing.
