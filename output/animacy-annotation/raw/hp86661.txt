Your question is extremely ignorant and disgusting. Not everyone is homeless because of substance abuse. Some people become homeless because they lose their job and are unable to find a new one before bills pile up and they are evicted, they may become homeless because of a natural disaster, or they may become homeless for many other reasons. Educate yourself.
