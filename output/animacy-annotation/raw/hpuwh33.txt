It's taken advantage of a young, naive, ignorant and blissfulness young mind that's the issue. An 18-22 year old is still a kid. Next time you teach a class ask the class if they know about the state level employee salary database, if the students don't then educate them. If its a private non-profit school teach them how to use the IRS 990 search. If its a for profit publicly traded go into the 10k. Most business schools teach the edgar searches but not the other searches.  This probably should be taught at an orientation type level course for all students. Make sure that they know about the car allowance, housing allowance and performance bonuses for administrators aka the executive team. Do you teach them that the board of directors is equivalent to the board of regents, or that a CEO is the equivalent to a chancellor. Or that a minority of people get to decide what the cost of the services are for the institution, not the majority of laborers, here I am talking about the tuition and fees.
