&gt; *Per the results of the survey, posts on hybrids that do not plug-in and fuel cell vehicles will no longer be allowed. Plug-in hybrid content is still permitted.*

Fuel cell vehicles are more EV than plug-in hybrids.

Fuel cell vehicles exist in the world and are being used right now. Sticking your head in the sand about it and banning discussion of this class of EVs will achieve nothing but making the sub narrow and ignorant of what's going on in the EV world.

What a dishonest farce.
