This will always be a problem, many who are formally diagnosed truly don't have Asperger's, but are convinced that they do. How could they know if they didn't? After all they aren't certified. But at the same time, people forget that there is NO typical case of Asperger's. there is going to be, and SHOULD be, a great deal of diversity within the community, because none of us share the exact same experience. This is a central problem in educating the public actually. It's tough to explain something well when it can be described in so many ways. To list some 'typical' symptoms doesn't always do much good. You can be socially awkward, have poor coordination, etc. and yet not have the condition. Yet some, like myself, don't fit the symptoms perfectly.
So, what I'm basically trying to say is that it is really, *really* hard to tell if someone does or does not have it based upon what they post on Reddit alone. Many high-functioning Aspies are undiagnosed and unaware that they are any different than most other people, but they still have the condition itself. It may not be what you expect though.
I concede the point that a great many people are misdiagnosed, which is true for a most diagnoses in general. It goes back to the "hard to tell" thing. They *could* be really shy and introverted, but otherwise no different than everyone else, or they could have Asperger's. Do we diagnose them or not? We don't know for sure what the truth is there. I guess the issue is self-diagnosis, I feel that this best fits what you are describing, but correct me if I'm wrong. This is a problem for all conditions and disorders, just like the hypochondriacs you mention.
So, I guess what I'm getting at is, it's not /r/Aspergers , it's all subs that are related to mental and physical health. I don't feel /r/aspergers is bad despite a large number of subscribers who don't have the condition, but this is all my opinion.
