The Muller investigation which has made more money for the US than it's spent? The Muller investigation which has gotten several arrests, including members of Trump's campaign committee who have confessed to federal crimes and association with Russia?

Either Trump was incompetent and unaware that his campaign officials had illegal connections to Russia, or he was complicit and part of it. 

Likewise, Trump's lawyer has stated that Trump ordered him to commit federal crimes.

There's evidence there, but you're saying "It's not enough." That's fine though, it's clear that you're willing to ignore anything that makes Trump look bad because you don't want to acknowledge that it'd mean you were tricked into supporting someone who didn't have the US's best interests in mind.
