I mean. I knew not to say that word at 15. I wish I was all knowing and knew everything in her very stupid 15 year old heart but I think a lot of this comes from coddling white children and protecting them from the knowledge of racism which is something POC especially black kids don't get. 

I think the first step would be to improve the history classes in the US (and I'm sure in Canada and Western Europe because I've seen it get toxic and ignorant). Of course, I'm not an expert.
