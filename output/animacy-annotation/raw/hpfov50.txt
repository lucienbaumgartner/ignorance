The inexperienced and insecure only understand strawmen that they can easily dismantle within their highly limited frameworks.

*”You don’t like bands with more than 10 monthly listeners.”*

(Translation: I can’t pinpoint any difference in quality between Gojira and Infernal Coil as I’m painfully unaware and unversed when it comes to Death Metal as a whole, so I assume that the reason “elitists” dislike the bands I mindlessly worship must only be strictly based on how many fans/the exposure each band has. Never mind that I would use the  exact same reasoning I’m strawmanning against to talk shit on the popularity of Billie Eilish, Nickelback, or Taylor Swift as being lowest-common-denominator music-by-numbers for people who’ve never once tried to explore anything beyond what they’re spoon-fed (not that I’ve ever even tried to rationalize my thoughts that succinctly). Also, I legitimately believe the reason that Metallica lost cred amongst “elitists” with the “Black Album” has nothing to do with compositional style, and everyting to do with how many people -who wouldn’t be caught dead listening to thrash before- suddenly got into them for apparently no reason at all. Thus my conclusions are not that I have basic-as-fuck-entry/pleb-level tastes, but that others who don’t worship the same polished turds that I do only refuse to do so because the band is “popular” and no other reason whatsoever.)
