Well of course it is predictable, almost every episode follows a certain path

Opening shot of either murder/kidnapping victim being happy and unaware of their incoming doom or a body being found 

Music distorts as the killer appears/body is found

*BUM BUM BUM BUM*

A quote relevant to the case.

Team talks about victim being missing or the bodies being found

Profiling ensues. Team gets interviews from witnesses and Garcia hacks her way into narrowing the suspect pool by revealing the unsub's terrible childhood. Occasionally, the show switches to showing the victims being tortured. It will also show the BAU members with their families, if their family is relevant.

"LET'S GO" 

Team drives to unsub location and one of them says "This is not the way, you can fix things" and either the killer accepts and is arrested or they don't and they are shot. 

Another quote relevant to the case.
