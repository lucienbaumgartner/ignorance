Bro my brother died in a car accident, I don’t care how much you love smoking meth, driving while on any hard drugs is completely ignorant and irresponsible.
If you actually don’t See the problem with the fact that mfs like this bitch endanger themselves and other peoples lives. I don’t hate addicts, i’ve seen the side with humanity, that they realise what their doing can hurt other people and try to hold out for as long as possible. Those people get my care and support, not proud meth smokers that endanger others lives.
