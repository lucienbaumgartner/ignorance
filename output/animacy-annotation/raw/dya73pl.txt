Hello, I would like just to know in order to generate data since there’s little to none upon this topic. I’m more concerned on how an age factors into this, seeing since I noticed more individuals that are younger seem to be more aware of what it means to be Intersex. I’m really unaware and unsure how to place that option in, which is why I put “other.”  I’m sorry if that offended you in anyway!
