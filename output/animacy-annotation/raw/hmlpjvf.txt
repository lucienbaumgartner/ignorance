i'm assuming the downvotes are for suggesting that there's nothing wrong with being friends with people who have different politics.

in our current political climate especially, and in the context of the OP, this typically means being 'friends' with those who at best are apathetic to the destruction of life as we know it on our planet and the oppression of many marginalised groups.

at worst, it means being friends with racists, transphobes, misogynists, and ableist assholes.

the fact that it doesn't impact your relationship with friends means either you are also fairly apathetic to these important issues, you minimise and/or enable them to keep these bigoted views, or your lived experience hasn't exposed you to notice or recognise these issues in day to day life.

for me, i was apathetic and unaware of my privilege for many years, and always thought politics was boring and unimportant. i didn't think i was a part of the problem, but i was.
