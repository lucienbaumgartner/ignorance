It's worse the niave.

The youth are so unaware and unknowing, yet truly believe with their entire beings that THEY are all knowing and anyone older or of an older generation is mentally incompetent and useless.

I can unequivocally say as a 56 year old that  even though at the age of 21 I not only paid for and went to college but also was running my own restaurant...I was such a dumb shit.

At 30â€¦I was running several successful businesses and had gotten my PH.d...but I was still a dumbfuck.

At 40...yup..DF.

AT 50...no different

On my way to 60... And I know for a fact those who are older then me, as ignorant about this world as they are...are still a lot smarter then me.

It takes time and experience to learn that you don't know nothing.
