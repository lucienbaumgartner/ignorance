Crypto is good when you know when and how to use your drone and I say this from experience you can get so much more tactical plays with a crypto and he can get your teammates banner when you die from safety with his drone and spawn you back instantly. The EMP is a free 150 damage if the enemy has full shields. The gameplay for him can be super fun just have to get used to playing with his drone and finding good spots to set yourself so no one finds you playing on ya phone like a kid helpless and unaware of certain danger . I just wanted to say that in response to all the crypto hate. He is viable for some not all.
