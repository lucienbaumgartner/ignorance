His entire political career has been about courting genocidal white supremacists and violent political paramilitary groups. This has been going on since before he was elected, for more than a decade. This week he scheduled an event to bring those people together and storm our nation's capitol in order to stop the certification of the EC vote in our democratic elections, in which he lost. His supporters came ready to take hostages and to execute political prisoners and media. How oblivious and unaware of everything around him do you suppose Trump would have to be to not know any of this.
