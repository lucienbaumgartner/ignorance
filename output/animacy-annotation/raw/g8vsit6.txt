Imagine being so stupid and ignorant that you assume the only people who see the giant flaw with capitalism are "useless" and "too dumb" to make a living under the system. 

I am doing fine under the system FYI, but I am not blind to the suffering and inequality that it enflicts on billions of others.

Maybe when you grow up a bit you might have a similar epiphany and see what a great big bootlicking idiot you were when you were in your twenties.
