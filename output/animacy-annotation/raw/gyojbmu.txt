Since I was about 15 and a teacher at my school came out as gay and told us some people can be gay and unaware of it. It comes and goes for me but I have also had other themes such as tocd (which is a lot like this but instead of worrying that I'm gay I worry that I'm transgender, it's equally terrifying and frustrating) and incest (fucking nightmare, I tell ya, have had this since I was 14).
