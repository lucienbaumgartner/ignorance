**Law of Civil Discourse**

Do not engage in personal or ad hominem attacks on other Redditors. Comment on content, not Redditors. Don't simply state that someone else is dumb or uninformed. You can explain the specifics of the misperception at hand without making it about the other person. Don't accuse your fellow MPers of being biased shills, even if they are. Assume good faith.

Associative Law of Civil Discourse - A character attack on a group that an individual identifies with is an attack on the individual.

This is your first warning. Further comments of this nature will lead to more moderator action. Review the rules so it is unneeded.
