There’s a dense and fairly useless book I read in a college philosophy class by a guy named Alain Badiou, pretty sure it was called The Politics of Event. 

Anyway, he’s responding to the postmodernist belief that our search for Truth in the world (science logic enlightenment etc.) is worthless and ignorant of the a lot of chaos and unharness-able flux. He says that while many areas of politics and life can’t be reduced to measurement or experienced consistently by anyone of any background, a few moments are truly “universal,” they are accessible by anyone, their weight and meaning speaks to anyone who happens to experience it. 

This - and other moments like it - exhibits traits of “an event,” the author actually lists art &amp; music as a place where something beautiful can be created that ignites a little spark in our brain by participating. Even if you don’t know the song, it’s moving. So many people, of entirely different backgrounds, politics beliefs, classes, races, etc. - all stripped of it for 5 minutes, singing a song that means something to them in particular but also a song carries a meaning of its own. None of the details for a few minutes, because for that time, people weren’t individuals for the length of the song. They were a carefree crowd pouring their hearts into a song! 

I’m not doing the book justice, it’s much more complicated (as philosophy usually is) than I’ve made it out to be - but moments like this always send me back 10 years to reading that book. No matter how you justify it, these moments are electric - even watching it from afar gave me shivers. It’s cool to see people set aside their troubles and just do something together for once. Great video!
