Oh my God... You're mental...

Please show me where I said they should be illegal. Please, so I know that you're capable of reading. 

There is a big difference between things that have a risk but have a purpose. Why do we use chainsaws? Because we need them to get wood from trees to get multiple different materials or because we need to chop some parts of the tree to avoid other serious accidents (for example, to chop a branch of a tree that is near an electrical line or that is in risk of falling in a house). Why do we use vehicles? Because we need to transport ourselves to different places. Do they have a risk? Yes, but the risks are less if you have some sort of license (like a driving license) or if you know how to handle the equipment, and the benefits are way more than the risks. Now let's look at why do you need your fireworks. Name literally just 1 good reason of a positive outcome of using fireworks, you idiot, apart of "wow it's pretty". Is your good reason more important than avoiding triggering the PTSD of veterans, causing fires, and hurting/killing people? 

I'm not even going to touch the "I think a lot of veterans lie about PTSD... obviously some have it but some like the paycheck that comes with it." because I have literally no words to describe how awful and ignorant that sounds.

The point that I was trying to make is that is selfish to fire fireworks because you want to even knowing all of the implications that they have rather. Fucking idiot, you're the reason the whole world sees the USA as the clown country that it is. It's very clear to me that you don't know how to fucking read, so I'll stop responding to you now. Have a good day.
