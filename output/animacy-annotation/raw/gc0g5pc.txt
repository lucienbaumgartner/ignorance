So both my parents are in nursing school, mu dad graduates in December. We've been poor all our lives collectively, and my parents are getting ready to buy a new home within the next 1-2 years as their income picks up. At our current house, I get no privacy, my mom calls on me to clean dishes while I'm in the shower, she barges into my room all the time, she wakes me up just to tell me we need to clean, and my dad supports all of it. They've had a habit of clingy and overbearing behavior while I was a teenager (I'm now 18).

My mom says she'll hire maids so at the least I won't have to clean for everyone, but she wants me to stay in the house while I go to college (a local uni in town). They'll be paying my tuition and financially supporting me, but according to my mom, being in an apartment will be "impossible" and she got angry at me when I said I wanted to live on my own (to get some privacy, though I can't tell her that, she'd get mad). My parents want what's best for me deep down, they have good intent, but it feels like they stifle me by expecting me to be someone I'm not. 

I'd be moving in with my girlfriend I met online who lives in a nearby state and plans on moving here, but there's a small twinge of guilt wanting to move in with someone so important to me I've never told them about.

I haven't told my parents about my girlfriend because she's transgender, and they think I'm a woman (I'm AFAB, nonbinary) and they're transphobic, even if they don't admit they are. They support trans people they don't know but the moment that anyone in the family is trans they can't understand. Not only that, but they're both older and unaware of how the internet is, and generally are afraid of everyone on the internet, acting all "stranger danger." They found out I send dirty messages to a 14 year old boy (I was 14 at the time as well) and they convinced themselves I was actually somehow exploited by a 40 year old whose face looks 14, not an actual guy. (He was, indeed, just a 14 year old guy). So, I hope it'd understandable why I don't want to share my internet life, especially that I met a queer woman on the internet they wouldn't respect as a woman and that, in a way, I'm leaving their home for her.

My girlfriend suggested she moved here, and I live with my parents, and we make a cover story that we met and started dating so I can stay over, but even with this sollution, I still feel wrong. My parents want to financially support me, but they don't know me personally because they've hurt me too many times and been too paranoid.

TL;DR: My parents want me to stay with them in their nice new home in a year when I go to college. I want to stay with my girlfriend they don't know about when she moves here, because they don't respect my privacy, but keeping a secret from them and then moving out when they pay for my college makes me feel bad. I can't tell them about her because they wouldn't understand from past experiences I've had. AITA?
