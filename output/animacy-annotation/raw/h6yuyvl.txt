The take that “nature is evil” is so incredibly childish and unaware that I might cringe to death. The existence of nature and the harmonious balance of life on earth is one of the biggest mysteries we know of and is nothing short of a miracle. You obviously do not go outside enough to understand the real beauty of the natural environment, which by the way is the only reason we enjoy our existence. We are a product of nature and the fact that you can form this childish skewed opinion from the comfort of your easy role in advanced society is laughable.
