Well, it's kind of hard to explain I guess but here in America my experience with a person acting like this that is overweight like that seems to always be someone who doesn't care about anybody and is just super self-indulgent as well as a typically unaware and undereducated person. They are bullies that think they can do whatever they want and not worried about how it affects other people. I guess maybe I've just had a specific set of experiences or something but when I see this lady and the way she's letting her dog bark at the cat while she just looks on and basically encourages it, is a typical behavior of a certain type of person here in America that I'm embarrassed of.
