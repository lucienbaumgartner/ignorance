&gt; WTF? No one gets to decide. His skin color is what defines that

'Not so much' is the phrase you used when commenting on Chris Smalling's blackness. You'd be a whole idiot to not realise how offensive and ignorant that is. If Smalling classifies himself as a black man, who are you to point to the hue of his skin and tell him otherwise? 

&gt; He clearly isn't 100% black, just compare him to Lukaku

You're reducing an identity to a skin colour. You have no idea how strongly Smalling identifies with his black heritage. If you don't see what's problematic in defining someone's blackness is by comparing skin tones then you have no business trying to speak on the matter at all. 

&gt;  You've taken the discussion from the relevant matter into something that doesn't matter at all

Says who? You're out here casting aspersions on how 'black' people are and then want to tell a black person that such ignorant talk doesn't matter. You're a whole idiot. 

&gt; so inclusive of you to choose who gets to say anything on the topic of racism, just because you think someone is ignorant.

You strike me as the kind of person who'd try and put out a fire by spraying it with gasoline.
