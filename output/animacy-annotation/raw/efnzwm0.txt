Imagine being so stupid and ignorant that you can not think for yourself and still obediently swallow the fabricated narrative as it is continuously pushed by the media in easy bite-sized portions in order to manipulate the public opinion. Most people already get it and see through it because ... well, after all, it is so blatantly obvious. But you are the useful idiot regurgitating the deliberately fabricated false narrative. You still don't realize that you are being had!
