It STILL takes less time than getting every meal at a fast food joint! 

There’s literally NO reason to not meal prep unless you don’t have a fridge.  People eat like shit because they refuse to do the bare minimum to eat healthy. The only benefit of the doubt I will give them is that they are unaware and uninformed about their alternatives and don’t know how to cook.
