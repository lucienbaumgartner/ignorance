Gonna have to agree with all of this.   The fact that this dude assumes he has a right to make choices for her body without her consent is a instant *fuck no* from me and a massive red flag.   That's way the fuck worse than the disagreement about abortion,  and that's already a very legitimate dealbreaker.  

"And then there is the delusional “protect you from rape” part. Like is he smoking crack?"

It's either he's high on drugs 24/7 or he's so completely oblivious and ignorant  that he knows nothing about the real world
