I never said i liked Nesta, in fact she’s the whole reason I dnfd ACOSF halfway through 🤷🏻‍♀️ people are entitled to liking these characters and I’m entitled to disliking them. I also don’t like Mor while we‘re at it. Downvote me to hell and back I don’t care. I like most of the other characters and generally thought that her female characters in TOG were better written and less obnoxious. Even Kaltain at her hight of being annoying in book 1 was more likable to me than Nesta and Elain. Because she at least wasn’t mistreating the one person who cares for her, she was mistreating competition. Nesta and Elain are the definition of entitled, ignorant and ungrateful.
