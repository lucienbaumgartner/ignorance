Your definition of good  must be different than 90% of the communities. Anyone with over 50 kc in CoX or ToB is probably considered good at the game by most of the playerbase. I'd reckon 75% of the player base has never had a kill count on either raid. I'm not saying you can't get carried to raids KC (although I doubt anyone will carry someone for over 50 raids) but your whole argument that *you're not good because you had to try something 100 times to complete it* is just an ignorant and flawed argument. History has proven time and time again that those who fail and try repeatedly until they succeed will eventually be good at it. Have a good day man.
