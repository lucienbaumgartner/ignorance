No, it’s not at all difficult, obese people just enjoy being obese and choose to do it. /s

Seriously dude do you have any idea how stupid and ignorant that question is?  There are libraries worth of research and studies on the causes and treatment of obesity out there yet idiots like you still abound. 

It’s like asking someone who’s suicidal, “Have you ever considered just not wanting to kill yourself?”

For fuck’s sake.
