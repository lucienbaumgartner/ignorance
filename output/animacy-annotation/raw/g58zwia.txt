That’s simply false that no physically disabled people have caretakers and only have nurses. And also simply false and ignorant that all physically disabled people are “bed bound and not going to gym at all“ lol. 

The person they’re referring to very well is intellectually disabled, and literally all of my above comment would still apply. This Facebook ranter isn’t a doctor or therapist, he doesn’t know shit about their treatment plan or excercise regime. And maybe the disabled person only WANTS to walk at 1 mile an hour. Maybe they’re trying to ease them into working out for longer intense stretches. 

Sounds like Facebook ranter just doesn’t like looking at disabled people at his gym, and is pissed they get to come in for free, and is disguising his projection under some pathetic attempt to appear like he cares about caregivers abusing the disabled, even though he has literally zero evidence to suggest that’s the case.
