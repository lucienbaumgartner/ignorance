Yeah I know, and that annoys me! I wish more kids would at least want to lean about the history of things..and all they care about now are their stupid smartphones. Like yesterday, me and my dad went to the store to get water, and a girl was on her smartphone blocking the isle, completely unaware and oblivious to her surroundings. These 'smartphones' are making people more stupid than ever. All I need is a well built device to make and receive telephone calls, and a Western Electric model 500 or any other W.E. phone does the job. I also have a 1903 Stromberg-Carlson Telephone Manufacturing Co. hand crank magneto wall phone! I also like old farm tractors and engines made by the International Harvester Co. Things were simpler back then.
