You are so incredibly stupid and ignorant that it is hard to believe you know anything about this. The union didn’t secede you dumb ass. States seceded from the contract at will known as the constitution. We then formed a new country just as our forefathers seceded from England. We took over a military property just we took over British armories and supplies  in what was to become America. Lincoln initiated the war as I just explained to you. Boy you are stupid and cannot grasp that it’s your idiot view of history that is revisionist in that it is contrary to known fact. You are too dumb even the simple things. You live in the twilight zone. The rest of us live on planet earth.
