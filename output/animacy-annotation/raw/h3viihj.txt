How is that idiotic? I don't have a bias. Both Argentina, the UK and every other developed nation is out for themselves and only force is stopping them. It's mutually assured destruction.

 I think the idea that countries wouldn't invade other nations based off of kindness is far more idiotic and ignorant of history.
