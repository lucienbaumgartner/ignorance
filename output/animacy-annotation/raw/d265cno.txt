The child is smiling at the demon, innocent and unaware that it is a bad thing, is showing compassion and love to a monster.  Later in life,that child may very well become the monster.  This reminds me of my life recently...

My ex left a few months ago now..  I miss her so much it's probably unhealthy lol.  When she drives away.. Every time... I can't keep the tears back.   I try not to show weakness in front of my child but recently my 2 year old saw me crying when "momma run away"  (thats just what she says when people leave sometimes .. at least I think she has no concept of that statement's meaning yet...)

"it ok dadda.  It going be ok." 

gives me a hug.  

"I love you dadda"

I feel like I'm that monster a lot of days... and that little girl is my daughter.  unaware that her daddy is a loose cannon in her mother's eyes and completely insane in his own.
