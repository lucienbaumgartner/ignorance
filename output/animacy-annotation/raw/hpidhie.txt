It wasn't because of "islamophobia" you jihad loving douche, it was because they were blocking highways and affecting the flow of traffic for their "prayers". If they had simply limited themselves to, you know, actual places of worship like mosques, nobody would give a shit what they're doing.  
  
Ignorant and poorly informed Islamist sympathizers like you are the reason why it's hard for most non-muslims to empathize with genuine instances of islamophobia.
