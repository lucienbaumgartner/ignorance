True, as I see it.  It would also be foolhardy to assume that they do exist.  Again, throw an eyeball over the "dark forest" solution to the Fermi Paradox.
  

  
"It would seem illogical for species of their nature to possess technological insights as to how to assist/instruct corporeal 3D beings like us as to how to go about traversing the physical Universe as they apparently have no requirement of such technologies."
  

  
My assumption is somewhat different from yours.  I would think ET, should he exist, would be a creature who exists in the time/space continuum that we know about.  It would be arrogant and ignorant of our science to assert that we know all there is to know about physics; therefore, the idea should be kept open, that ET may indeed know a few things about physics and time that we do not.
  

  
Lou does not provide any evidence whatsoever that ET exists as a corporeal being in time and space.  At one point in the interview, I got a chuckle over him saying that the videos were "official" Navy videos.  And it's true.  The Navy has released grainy black and white images of some geometric visual pattern, along with a soundtrack of a guy expressing amazement.
  

  
The Navy and Air Force, while we're at it, need to increase the resulution of the cameras used to record these UFO's.
