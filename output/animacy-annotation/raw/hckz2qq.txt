I'm American and it annoys the shit out of me sometimes, but there's so much more nuance to it than "Americans are so dumb and ignorant!" That kind of attitude is just as annoying as the ignorance some of my fellow citizens display. 

I'll also point out I'm fairly well-traveled and cultural ignorance is by no means a uniquely American trait by a long shot.
