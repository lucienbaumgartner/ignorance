What an ignorant and naive old man. We need to change the culture that age and experience means wisdom. While it has been true for thousands of years, it comes from experience based knowledge during a time when little changed from generation to generation. With the explosion of technology over the last century, the elders of our communities have chosen not to keep up.  In my personal experience, I get the saying of “Can’t teach an old dog new tricks”. I believe this is just an excuse of stubbornness and not to be true reality.  A true strength is admitting your wrong, or admitting your not knowledgeable on a topic and instead of condemning out of ignorance, learning and adapting and creating a viewpoint based on knowledge and understanding.
