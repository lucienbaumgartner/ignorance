I think this kind of anime can work well sometimes, combining comedy with psychological intensity can be interesting and compelling, but the genre awareness in Kuma Miko seems to be way too clumsy (so far, at least) for that.

It's clear that Machi experiences some form of severe social anxiety, but the people around her don't really acknowledge it, and the specific way her breakdowns are framed as cringe-comedy stops the audience from engaging with the necessary critical eye. If the anime was set up as "a slapstick comedy about dealing with personal mental health" or "a psychological slice-of-life about coping day-to-day with anxiety" there would be many ways in which this show could be made to work, but from the start it was "woefully unaware and socially undereducated country bumpkin wants to go to the city" which doesn't really allow for a thoughtful integration of mental health themes.

So either you get caught up in the moe SoL comedy (whether you find Machi's breakdowns are endearing and cute or actually funny) or you find it frustrating at best, and there is almost no room for a meaningful examination of anxiety.

However, I'm gonna stick with it until the end, since it could always pull a 180 and retroactively acknowledge in a meaningful way the issues it raises. It could also return to the surprising and jarring (in a good way) comedy that it began with in episode one.
