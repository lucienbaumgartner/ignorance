Cyclists aren't a homogenous crowd - some ride by the rules and can rightfully be pissed off when vehicle drivers make idiotic choices that put them in danger. Many of those same cyclists are also drivers. And many of those responsible cyclists detest idiots on bikes that flout the rules of the road.

The bicyclists that flout the rules are probably too stupid and unaware that vehicle drivers have done anything ignorant or dangerous.
