The confederate flag is a vaguely interesting historical footnote of a failed rebellion/treason, the flag utilized as and called the confederate flag is a modification of a battle standard later used as a navy jack and later used to signify that a person is opposed to de-segregation, called the dixiecrat flag by people at the time, since this was before the southern strategy strategy the Dem/Repub party goal exchange, and so to me the flag used as a confederate flag just indicates the bearer has never studied history, and at best is just woefully ignorant and unaware of how hateful they are being.
