People gonna talk about the few weeks where folks were banging pots and pans for frontline workers in solidarity (never mind that frontline workers often do shifts and could be trying to sleep when the neighbourhood office workers doing remote 9-5s decide to go feral on their kitchenware at 7 pm,) and then not talk about the two-and-counting years of shitty grind that frontline workers have been forced through while confronting the worst “protests” of the destructively ignorant and selfish.

“People came together!” No they didn’t, Shelly, you watched a handful of heartwarming viral videos in between not tipping your delivery driver.
