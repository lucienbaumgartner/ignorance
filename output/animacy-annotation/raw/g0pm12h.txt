"No one" ... Yeah.. some some really do mate..the Gulen cult wants to see Turkey burn so they can take advantage of thr chaos and return etc. Most PKK supporters dream of a civil war. And it pains me to say but part of the opposition supporters doesn't care at what cost it is, as long as AKP goes..when the TL first crashed many on this sub celebrated it hoping that it would oust the AKP (as their success is also very much tied on their early economic growth etc)


It's a sad reality. AKP will go, but the people who want to burn Turkey down for that to happen are incredibly dumb, naive and ignorant. That doesn't mean they don't exist. 

The younger generation, many of whom are just becoming voters and have lived under nothing but AKP rule will slowly become a major voting block. Kids that grew up with YouTube, netflix etc and aren't as conservative etc. These will likely largely vote against AKP. The AKP got so much support because for a long time we the conservatives felt like second class citizens. This is why many of them vote AKP no matter what..but after 2 decades of AKP they are no longer the victims and society is quickly becoming less religious and conservative.
