No one really is against the new form of talking and texting. Older people who may not use it as much dont use it for a simple reason, and that’s because it’s not the way they were taught. If you’re taught as a kid to speak old English from the medieval ages, you’re going to probably spend your entire life speaking old English. Maybe you will understand newer English, but chances are old English is still your primary “language”. The same can be said for texting acronyms and newer slang. People who are “against” newer forms of language are most likely ignorant and narrow minded.
