You are fake news dude :P The Zondo commission has implicated quite a few people in corruption, with evidence. But, if you knew ANYTHING about the Zondo commission, you would know that once the commission is complete, a charge sheet will be handed to the NPA, that is when the arrests for state capture start.

It matters who you support, and we know that you are a Zuma-supporter, because it exposes why you are willfully ignorant on state capture as well as the myriad of people implicated in the Zondo commission for state capture.

There is a mountain of evidence implicating Zuma in state capture and corruption. To deny that is stupid and ignorant. Of which you are both.
