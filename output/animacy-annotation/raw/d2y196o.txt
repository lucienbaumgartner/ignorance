Southern Californians.  Of all the wasteful, egotistical, unaware and ethical shitbags in this world it seems they all come from SoCal.  Try it for yourself, head down to NOLA and tell people how your from LA and how great it is.  Or Seattle.  Hell, pretty much anywhere other than California hates SoCal'ers.

In my entire life I have never met a group of people who simultaneously have an over-inflated sense of self importance and a severe self image issues.  How in the actual fuck does that even happen?  How can someone think they are a gift to humanity and have enough self loathing to make Woody Allen jealous?

To top it off, it's often the state where they do the "stupid american" routines on TV using real people.  It's seriously disturbing that the overall IQ of Cali would jump 40 points if SoCal slid into the ocean.

Which is another thing.   There are fuckijg people that believe the entire state is going to slide into the water when "the big one hits."  Holy fuck.  We could only be so lucky to lose that garbage laden shithole of a sprawling concrete jungle to the sea.  It'd be like a retarded Atlantis.
