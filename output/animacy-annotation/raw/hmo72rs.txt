I'm a pedestrian, cyclists and motorcyclists before being a car driver. The last of my worries is people not indicating on a lane change that I assume is always done on a safe manner, if not then an indicator won't change the unfortunate outcome. There are much more subtle behaviour that are condoned by the majority that in the past put me in much more risky situation, e.g. giving right of way to a minor road for politeness and almost causing a car crash behind, not using the headlight to increase visibility in all situations, parking while facing the opposite direction, ... 

&gt; Unpredictable and ignorant of other drivers

That points exactly at what I was trying to say: awareness of the road conditions and the surroundings should be the metric to judge predictability, not whether one indicated when there was nobody around. A person indicating and suddenly jumping in front of another car thinking they followed the rules is the real hazard compared to one that waits for the lane to be empty and smoothly moves to the overtaking lane without signalling.
