I never said you believed it, you are ignorant and unaware of it.

maybe that ive spelled put how fucked up the game is you should adjust your understanding of the system and why certain policies are in place to prop up that agenda.

Stop being an unwitting contributor to it.

Convictions make you a convict.

Stop believeing in things and start realizing
truth

and yeah i could prolly spell out your bliefs and stances on a  checklist republican's fall in line , yall are a cult. The entire idea of conservativism is predicated on there being an ingroup which you fell you are a part of dur to your political and or religious alignment.

If there is one defining strength of the republican party its that every thing is lock and step. The hall mark of the right is that diversity in thought is not allowed.

thats why the left is so inneffective , we cant agree on shit there so much nuance and reality to sort through nobody has the full answer

its way easier to fall back on ones ego and beliefs system and say , you know what?

that shit is complicated

whose got time for that when we can tell our pious righteous good patriotic flag loving pure blooded American tell us what to think.

WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN
