I second the GP's suggestion, the PTSD might be causing a flee response and she might be seeking a change of location / life situation wherein her hormones are mixing in to make her look for casual live-in. This is her being very naive and unaware of how to handle things if they go wrong. I think therapy is better. If (and only if) she wants a life-change situation, she could even live alone in a nearby flat or live in shared accommodation with other girls or friends wher nobody controls her life directly. But under no circumstances should the escapr from suffering be mixed with sexual pleasure or relationships. She needs to be really lucky to get a guy who understands her mental health issues and treats her well to the point that he helps her recover. This is only possible if said boy has high emotional intelligence and can control his mind and body really well. Not a large percentage of all boys. I have no idea of what kind of boys she talks to or is friends with.

TL;DR: The way to freedom from suffering is rarely sex or romance, in fact they have the capacity to add more.
