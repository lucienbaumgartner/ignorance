I was young and unaware and informed by porn and neither of us were great in bed. I was terrified of getting her pregnant, so I was fine with non intercourse stuff. 

Add some good old fashion church going Baptist guilt, a big bout of depression after a job loss, and me just being generally awful at that point in my life. 

All leads up to terrible sex and relationship.
