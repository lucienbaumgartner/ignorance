It's something we'd like to call political presedence. As long as we allow bad-faith actors (in this case massive multi-nationals and the dubious states they serve) we cannot be certain of our own protection. 

I come from a country that has absolutely no forms of conflict or waring whatsoever, yet we get spied on by the likes of the US. If you want to know I come from Norway and the NSA has been spying on millions of my countrymen. Companies like Facebook, Google, etc help them in that endeavour. I'm pretty sure a funnel of our activities, personal info and movements to a foreign actor is a pretty dumb thing. If you suggested that to someone in the past you just might have gotten punched in the face for being a traitor.

Then again, I'm all about nation-states getting to protect their sovereignty as a form of decentralisation of power. Unfortunately politicians are so ill informed and ignorant of how you could secure digital sovereignty. Telling service providers that the data stays inside the countries borders is one way of doing this.

So again... I completely disagree, from a stand point of principle.
