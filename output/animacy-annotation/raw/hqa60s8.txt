It depends on the cause of the tiredness and dullness for me, a second sit is worth it if I’m tired and distracted and unaware of the cause because it helps me figure out what I’m doing/believing or thinking that is leading to the tiredness, but if I’m aware that I didn’t get much sleep and have exhausted myself then it’s not of much use to me, but it’s very useful if I’ve had a long day because it helps relieve the tension and stress
