Oh man. Trash in an understatement. They were demoralizingly bad. Soft, unaware, and useless are words I'd use to describe Strnad and whoever started with him against Cleveland. 

It was like our post-SB50 RT situation. Menelik Watson, Donald Stephenson, and Michael Schofield levels of suck. They were so bad it made our entire defense inept. Inept enough to lose to Case Keenum and a 3rd string RB. They freaking sucked out loud. Freaking Keesum trucked BOTH of those shitty LB's on 4th-and-3 for a TOUCHDOWN. 

Gross!
