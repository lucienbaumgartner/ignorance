i posted last week [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/k6iqde/covid19_discussion_thread_december_04_2020/gem4733/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) 

an update; one roommate tested positive and the rest of us tested negative. i didn’t go into detail in my last post about it, but basically i’m still afraid i might be a false negative. i don’t have symptoms as of right now, other than my throat feeling weird (i strongly believe that’s my anxiety because i was fine before she said she was positive, i’ll monitor though). when we got tested on the 4th, it had only been 4 days from exposure but i was so anxious and unaware that my instinct was to get tested right away. public health informed me after that testing 5-7 days from exposure will give the most accurate results. now, knowing all of this, the lady who tested me that day was totally misinformed. i explained my timeline to her and she specifically told me that it was a perfect day to get tested (who hired her 
?😭). when i left the testing centre, i found out that my roommates were turned away because their testers said it was too early to tell. i haven’t gotten a second test even though i’d like to because all of the calls i’ve gotten just told me to keep isolating and monitoring for symptoms. 

additionally, i also discovered that my positive roommate has not been following the isolation guidelines we were given in the first place. i only go downstairs to use the washroom and retrieve my food from the fridge, otherwise i’m cooped up in my room all the time. yesterday i really had to use my assigned washroom so i went downstairs masked only to find her walking around the kitchen without a mask (this was before she got her positive result). that was the first time i’d seen her in the common area all week and i really thought she was following all guidelines and now that i’m aware she wasn’t my anxiety has skyrocketed. i also feel incredibly stupid for not saying anything yesterday because i heard her coughing in her room beforehand. this whole experience is messy and instead of studying for my exam tomorrow i’m sitting here typing this out LOL. this was way longer than i intended it to be so if you read to this point... thank you. 💕

tldr; may or may not have covid. anxiety fucking sucks. 2020 is the year i’m losing trust and respect for people ✌️😂.
