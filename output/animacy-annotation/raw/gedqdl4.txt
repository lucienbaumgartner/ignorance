Also, it’s possible that he’s just cranky and is trying to just take the quickest road to making peace. Going to her brother right after his wedding to complain about someone is immature (as is being a jerk and pestering someone when they tell you to stop asking about their weight) and I’d bet he didn’t hear the full story and is just trying to get his sister off his back and get rid of the drama. 

Side note: she should not have clients if she’s that insensitive and unaware of boundaries when it comes to weight loss?
