For some people, yes. But for me, this kind of “mistake” would indicate something much larger - a huge gap in social awareness, standards of professionalism and just generally conducting yourself as a polite adult. 

Those things are personally and professionally important to me. It would make me pause and possibly reconsider this person as my partner. I would want to take into balance if there were other instances of this kind self-centered, unaware, and immature behavior.
