It's not so much that they're unvaccinated as much as it is how ignorant and selfish they are while also being unvaccinated. I know unvaccinated people and they're the most irresponsible people around. They don't wear masks unless forced to, they couldn't care less about who they may kill by spreading the virus. I don't really care if they get vaccinated as long as they wear a mask always while around people, but they typically won't do that either. That's why they're often referred to as sociopaths. 

My favorite unvaccinated fools are the ones who are smoking a cigarette while calling the vaccine poison. Further demonstrating their ignorance.
