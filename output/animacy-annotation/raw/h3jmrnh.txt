I would say you're better off knowing the truth.  Happier?  That's pretty subjective.  For instance, many of us here on this sub are happy by ourselves, maybe with a dog for company.  Some of us (myself included) *aren't* happy, but we still feel like we're better off without a woman in our lives.  Happiness is a personal thing.  And there are definitely men out there who are married, happy, and unaware of things happening in their lives.  Doesn't mean they're better off.
    
I don't like living a lie.  I would rather know the truth so I can plan around it and try to come out ahead.  That goes for all things, relationships, politics, religion, everything.
