I absolutely freaking love this!  I love good villains.  

Vladimir Makarov from Call of Duty, D-Fens (William Foster) from "Falling Down", and Anton Chigurh from "No Country for Old Men" are my all time favorites.  And they are highly intelligent introverts.

Next step would be the shadow functions. Te, Ni, Se, Fi.

For example, Se Trickster often makes INTPs unaware and oblivious of their situations and surroundings.  Your villain's obliviousness to the harm he's causing, is also an Se thing.

Also, pay close attention to Fi Demon.  This is where things can get real spicy.  

If through the Fi function the INTP becomes earth-shatteringly furious... oh gosh.  He cares about nothing but his tortured feelings.  He can justify any horrific deed to himself, because Fi is a principals-and-morality function.  They can use the TiNe functions to think of the smartest and most destructive ways possible, to destroy anyone or anything.  Be it his enemy's emotions... or the enemy's body and life.

Bruce Banner is an INTP.  When he becomes enraged, he becomes the Hulk.  Good analogy.

Dont take any of this as absolute truth, I might have got stuff wrong.  But really study Fi Demon, as it can be one of the most interesting and TERRIFYING aspects of the villain.
