Trump is so under educated and ignorant of how the US Government works that he thinks the US Supreme Court ultimately owes its loyalty to  him *especially* the Justices who were appointed by him. He thinks they're like William Barr, his personal  consigliere, and owe their allegiance to him rather than the Constitution. That's the Godfather mentality that is going to be Trump's final undoing once the legal challenges against him and his family are in full swing.
Running for office in 2024?
He'll be too occupied with lawsuits and criminal charges. 
The hounds are at the gate waiting to be released.
