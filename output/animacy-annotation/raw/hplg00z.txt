Her essay “TERF wars” was pretty ignorant and transphobic, her newer book includes the regressive stereotype of a cross-dressing man luring and killing women, and She’s been unwilling to listen to trans folks trying to explain how her being openly transphobic is a problem given her massive wealth and platform. I recommend checking out ContraPoints and Linsey Ellis’ video essays explaining the situation, both are really interesting.
