"There we go, I was waiting for that"

Yeah, because you know damn well how utterly ridiculous it is that your sole priority in a conversation about these horrible people is a stranger on the internet who is - god forbid - making fun of their weight. Your ability to foresee someone calling you out on how absolutely stupid that is says nothing about the validity of that criticism.

I've repeatedly laid out for you all the reasons why this sub exists, why people feel so strongly about Trisha - and STILL, the only thing you care about is people making fun of her for being fat.

How you are unable to see how ignorant and privileged that is, is beyond me.

And if you're really going to start using a barometer for whether it's okay to make fun of someone's weight based on how much "worse" a person is when compared to another person, then guess what - you really don't fucking care about body shaming at all.

Guess what - Harvey Weinstein is a fat, ugly piece of shit.

Now go ahead tell me why you think that's okay vs why it's not with Trisha. Please, feel free.
