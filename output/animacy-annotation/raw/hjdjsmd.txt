Yep.  
  
&gt; Maye, traveling by himself in a 2018 Mercedes, allegedly crashed into the left rear of a Volvo while driving north on the Florida Turnpike at 7:33 p.m. There were no injuries, the traffic citation says, but the driver of the Volvo -- Jamila Abraham of Belle Glade, Florida -- filed a civil suit and is seeking in excess of $30,000, per court filings.

&gt; Maye was found in his car just north of where the alleged accident occurred, according to the police report, which also stated that he was unresponsive and unaware that he hit another vehicle. His eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred and officers smelled alcohol, per the report. Officers saw vomit on the driver's door and the floorboard.

&gt; Maye told officers that he hadn't been drinking and that the smell was from two days ago. He declined to take a sobriety test and provide a breath sample. There was damage to his Mercedes that corresponded to the Volvo's damage, the report said.
