I’m not sure I’ll be able to help you a ton, but I’d like to just say that I feel your pain. What an unbelievably thoughtless and careless act. It’s truly criminal to mindlessly spray the equivalent of a nuclear response to insect and plant life so carelessly. I hope you find both peace and justice. I truly hope you seek litigation and teach them a lesson.

In the meantime, all I can say to help remedy the situation would be to add as much microbiology (fresh compost, worm castings, compost tea, etc...) as you can, because my understanding is that the micro biome is the only true warrior against these poisons. That and time, sadly. I’m sure you’ve already done this, but make sure you give both soil and foliage a good wash with fresh water. 

Make sure your neighbor understands his/her ignorance and the unbelievable thoughtless act he/she has committed - They may be fully unaware and ignorant of the significant harm they’ve caused. 

Best of luck. Sending good thoughts to you - I know you are experiencing some heartbreak. Here for ya
