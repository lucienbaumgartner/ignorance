They've been standard in every company I've worked for or had any friends work for. Everything I've ever heard through my 10 years in the industry does lead me to believe a 2-4% (minimum) inflation adjustment every year is fairly standard.   


Personally I would take it as a red flag and a "fuck you" if a company wants to treat any tiny amount of a raise as a big deal that you'll only get every couple years after begging for one. Extremely ignorant and short sighted in this field right now too. I know it's clich√© to tell people to quit their jobs in this industry after any slight, but in this case I think it's honestly the right thing to do.
