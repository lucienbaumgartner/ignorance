It’s not secular. I’m telling you this as someone who’s had it forced on me my whole life. Christmas isn’t secular and claiming it is is 100% white supremacist “crusader” mentality whether you are Christian or not (and it sounds like you’re clearly from a Christian background even if you aren’t currently religious) . Listen to minorities when we tell you what you’re doing to us with this nonsense. 

You wrote a post saying that it’s wrong not to close on Christmas and making assumptions about what holidays people need. No one is saying to mention us every time you make a post (nice straw man), but you literally wrote something erasing other peoples traditions under the false guise of being inclusive/doing the right thing.  And trying to force us into your ideas of what Christmas is or should be. 

The way you wrote your post makes it harder for the rest of us to get our holidays, and tries to forcibly absorb us into a Christian focused mentality. Your post about it being inherently bad not to close on Christmas (vs acknowledging how we ALL need different holidays off and in many areas no one gives a flying fuck about Jesus)  is basically forcing Christian values on people under the guise of being about worker’s rights. Worker’s rights means ALL of us being treated fairly with our needs met not making ignorant and factually incorrect blanket statements that fail to acknowledge and even erase the most marginalized.
