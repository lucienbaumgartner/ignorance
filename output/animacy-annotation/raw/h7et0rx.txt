* Having tantrums when they don't get what they want... no matter how old they are
* Not having any idea whatsoever what life is like for people without their money and privilege
* Demanding everyone bow to THEIR wishes and put THEM first in everything
* Sulking, crying, flouncing off
* Mentally stunted and ignorant of the real world and the battles others face just to get by
