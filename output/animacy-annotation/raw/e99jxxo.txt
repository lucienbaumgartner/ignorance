We have been over this. Only a stubborn child complains about a situation without having any input as to a solution. Yes, life is unfair. Shouting that fact really loudly doesn't help anyone, or make you some sort of hero. If you actually cared you would spend, at a bare minimum, some of your spare time to research the issue. But you're not going to do that. You're not going to bother learning anything, or reading anything. 0 books read, 0 experts consulted, 0 anything, the only thing you know is you don't have money and other people do, that's the literal extent of your knowledge. You're just going yell about how its unfair, like a child having a tantrum, literally bringing no solutions to the table, or practical ways to fix the problem. Just crying about it. Do you even realize how insane and ignorant that is? Even the most idiotic people supporting the most idiotic causes bring some prospective solution to the problem they complain about. You have fucking nothing. Just a little internet rant about how life is unfair. How insightful and constructive. How dare I not respect your opinion.
