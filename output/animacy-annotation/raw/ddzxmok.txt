China values education enough that it feels secure enough(after 17 years of State indoctrination) to send it's children to the west for university. They are actually protesting the Dalai Lama's coming speech at [UCSD](https://qz.com/908922/chinese-students-at-ucsd-are-evoking-diversity-to-justify-their-opposition-to-the-dalai-lamas-graduation-speech/) because he's an "oppressor".Cuba went from 50% to 99% literacy under Castro. Yeah there's Pol Pot but I'd say he's the exception not the norm.  

Former KGB propagandist [Yuri Besmenov](https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=sdYrXbwJbj0) had an interesting talk 30 years ago about the rise of cultural Marxism in universities. Kind of explained how we graduated from the classical liberal dream of equality and being judged for the content of your character(not your skin color) to ideas that are seemingly at odds with them like white privilege, oppressor and oppressed, strength through diversity(only of color, at least 8/10 professors lean left).


["As I've mentioned](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging."  - Bill Ivey.  This is kind of what I mean, once control is taken over education it's not solely the indoctrination, but the *omission* of things like civics. I certainly wouldn't of minded more civics a year or two ago.
