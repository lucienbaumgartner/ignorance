"She has nothing to be having seizures about." See how ridiculous and ignorant that sounds?

Depressive Disorder is an illness caused by a lack of happy chemicals in the brain. It can be caused by many things and exacerbated by unhappiness or stress. Similar to how seizures can be brought on by external factors such as flashing lights but is caused by an underlying issue--else all of us would seize when exposed to flashing lights, right? 

Also, bullshit she doesn't have anything to he depressed about. Her father was abusive. She currently lives with two very young children who she is expected to care for that apparently scream constantly. She has a mother who dismisses her feelings and concerns and makes decisions for her she has no right to make such as how she should he feeling. Depressive disorder aside, your daughter has plenty to be depressed about. Educate yourself. Your daughter deserves better than you're giving her right now.
