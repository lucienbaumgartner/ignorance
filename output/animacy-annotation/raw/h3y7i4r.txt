Only just read this while coincidentally feeling lost and unaware of where to go from here, and I appreciate it a lot! It feels so complicated because I need more experience to get a job that will put me on the path to what I want to do (therapy), but I don’t want to do that down here and get into a contract that I’m stuck with for however long. My friends from where I went to uni would probably be fine if I stayed with them while I earned a couple of months’ wages so I could move out but I don’t want to assume that and take it for granted if that makes sense. I think I’m going to try and polish my experience-less resume as much as possible so if an opportunity comes up I can go for it anyway. It’s weird as well because my parents think I’m only moving up for this course or whatever (tbh the other day I said I want to move up there anyway but I think they see this job as a catalyst and without it there’s no reason for me to move just yet) - hope that makes sense and I appreciate any help!
