I feel ya there, altho X in my experience is almost as bad, at least in terms of mine, my wife, and her bfs immediate family. They tend to be incredibly selfish and ignorant of the real world, and just content with how things are with no ambition beyond their immediate circle and no concept of a greater world view... the boomers imo tend to be more evil in nature whereas gen X is just, idk, clueless. (Obligatory there's exceptions, like my gma is an absolute saint, but yall get my point)

Millennials (biased as my gen) are either moderately unstable/uncertain (likely due to a complete lack of hope) or angry and aggressive bc we realize we were the first gen truly absolutely sold out by the boomers, and sacrificed by gen x blissful ignorance. The zoomer generation (my 9 yr old brother etc) are likely to have decent lifes overall due to Millennial sacrifices, and hopefully better parenting in general and teaching of furthering humanity, at least, from the Millennial parents who aren't so scared and apathetic that they fall into the same trap of hopelessness as their parents... particularly now that at least a few more of us lucked into some wealth be it with crypto, gme, tsla, or any other similar events...

... I think I gotta chill on the weed lmao. BTC to the ðŸŒ•
