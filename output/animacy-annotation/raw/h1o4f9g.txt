She needs to work on her self esteem and the way she views trans people. You hooked up with a woman. They aren't objects to be viewed as fetishes. Trans people are people. This is entirely a her issue. You didn't do anything wrong or immoral that needs defending or justifying. She just seems insecure and ignorant of transgender people and what transgender means. You hooked up with a woman. No biggie. 

I do want to add that the way you talked about this being the only time you did anything with someone in the LGBTQ+ community feels a little hinky to me. As if it's something to be ashamed of. I don't think you mean it that way. Still, people are people, regardless of gender identity or sexual preference. It's not a big deal.
