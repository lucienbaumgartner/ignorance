Not really big into name calling, so maybe I’ll refresh you on the actual rules.

A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer then a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screeners position.

That’s an actual quote of the rule. Hell even the ref told Lloyd Pierce. “I spared Trae. It should’ve been an illegal screen”.

Don’t be mad, it was an illegal screen. The ref didn’t call it in your favor. The play blew up ANYWAY. Get over it.
