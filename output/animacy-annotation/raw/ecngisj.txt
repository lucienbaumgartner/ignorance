Now, I know that this kind of question has been asked to death, but I would still like to know to have a decent conversation with some people.

My stupidest thing happened not too long ago actually. I was having severe diarrhea and I pooped in my pants uncontrollably. As soon as I felt something weird on my pants, I ran straight to the toilet and I took my pants off, seeing that there is some shit in there. My ass was leaking diarrhea and some it landed on the bathroom floor. I did however make it to the toilet to take a shit. Little liquid pieces of diarrhea was still around, and I wanted to get rid of them by wetting some toilet paper and wiping the diarrhea off the floor before drying it with a towel and I kept the towel and put my dirty soiled underwear on the wash basket.

Unfortunately, my mother found little pieces of wet toilet tissue on the towel, and she asked me about it. I told her what happened, and she flipped out at me. She told my father and he was pissed off too. They had to wipe the entire toilet clean with disinfectant wipes, as they told me what I had done to clean the toilet was wrong.

The next day, I was lying in bed still sick, and my mother found that soiled piece of underwear from last night on the washing basket, and she was pissed off, more than she was the previous night. I had absolutely forgotten to tell my parents about my soiled underwear after getting that bollocking for it. It took a while for my mother and father to forgive me.

I really look back at those events in pure shame and disgust. I was old enough to know not to do that kind of thing, yet I was so boneheaded and ignorant that I thought that I could do this myself. I feel like such shit. I live in a house with my parents and my three younger sisters, and if anyone of them would get sick, I would have had nobody else to blame but myself. I want to just put it behind me as much as I possibly can.
