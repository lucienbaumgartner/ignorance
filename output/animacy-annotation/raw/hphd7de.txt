Yara has such an ugly ego. I mean, I wish I could applaud her confidence but she’s nothing but an attention seeking idiot. She’s not smart. She’s not witty. She’s not original. 

I did enjoy her during her first season but after her trip to Miami with the poor people comments, she turned me off. Fucking ignorant and stupid.

And I think the Pole/Karine issue is serious. I can’t bring myself to really comment on it because it’s scary. I hope they get help.
