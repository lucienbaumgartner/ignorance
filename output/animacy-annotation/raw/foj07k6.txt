Using butthurt to try and gain some footing in a reddit argument... Wow. 

Of course the government knows that some people are going to break the rules. That some people are going to think they're special. That the rules don't really apply because "everyone else is doing it so I don't have to".
Some people are going to act like that, and some people are going to try everything they can to justify that.

Those people are socially irresponsible, selfish and ignorant. That ignorance either comes from ignoring the facts or not understanding the facts. 

Your stretching to justify all of this going so far as to say "it's a choice and we have free will so we can do what we want"!, Can't wait to use that next time I break the law.

This will be my last comment - I hope OP and anyone else who sees this are smart enough to see that the correct thing to do is to just wait until lockdown laws are relaxed.
