Definitely you are right on that point. The thread is talking about all the awakening from the point of view the way itachi decipted the way to sasuke (kill a close one) (it also has the same reasoning that when someone close to you is killed , you awaken it out of sheer anger) to awaken the mangekyou sharigan. During their final fight ,itachi wrongly decipts the method again as forming close bonds, cutting them, and then killing your own brethren for new eyes. All to allude sasuke till his own death. It is awakened either way, you kill your close one or lose a close one. Though i don't remember anyone doing the killing way, moreover itachi does all this to project himself as the bad guy to sasuke. Sarada is unaffected and unaware of any of this, and still awakens it. Thus the infrence she did it the positive way. 
Do correct me if im wrong or my understanding is wrong. I can chat for hours on this.
