Your ignorance is fucking astounding ðŸ˜‚. The fact you think anybody here would think for even a shred of a second that this game makes only 500k an entire year is just such a testament to your absolute utter lack of any credibility whatsoever lol. You are a joke to them. Nothing more. I assure you this lol.

Game ain't goin anywhere any time soon. Sometimes I wish it would to spare us all and save us from our irrational addictions lol. But alas, they'll keep releasing new polished turds and like the chumps we are we'll keep gettin em, while they rake in pretty damn close to a million bucks each time. Is what it is.

But 500k a year. Only a dollar to get a dragon slayer.. That my dear know nothing noob is just the most laughable, false on its face, downright retarded claim anyone has ever made on this board. So, ummm, congrats I guess? ðŸ˜‚

Anyway, everyone knows how absurd that is and they know I'm right. So no real need to go round with ya anymore, though it is quite hilarious to see you flail around trying so hard to convince people of shit that's so batshit insane and ignorant that you don't have a chance in hell to ðŸ˜‚

Noobs like you been claiming this game is dying nonsense for legit years already. But right now the addicts are very much still shooting up as much as they ever had lol. It's sad as fuck, but still blatantly true. After slayers they'll come out with some new gimmick, and we'll all be right there breaking even more soul records. Then a year from now some new know nothing noob will claim the game is dying.. On and on the cycle goes. 

Anyway, everyone knows how big a joke you are and how batshit crazy the shit you say is. So I'm gonna head out.. Enjoy your dollar store dragon slayer next Thursday kid ðŸ˜‚
