Hey! I want you to know that it's okay, it's just your private. Now, you want to forget about it or something, don't use an omegle again with same purpose of giving nudes to people, do socialize online but not with those things, people might take advantage of it. It's better be mindful and vigilant, stop using it by now and focus on what is important to do, make routines that would help you forget it and lastly, forgive yourself. You are young and unaware of it but I hope you learned from it and apply that you wouldn't do it again. God bless ❤️
