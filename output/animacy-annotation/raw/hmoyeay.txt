ESH. Your husband sucks more, and I honestly don't see why you'd stay with him at this point, but it doesn't make what you dis right. Dragging kids into an adult argument and trying to cause resentment in them just hurts your kids more than anyone. You don't want your children to be in pain, do you? Even the oldest is probably too young to really understand money trouble and the younger 2 are definitely too young. Do you want your 5 year old to feel the same resentment that you feel towards your husband? Children that young shoild be happy and ignorant of how bad life can really be. The best parents will shield their children at any cost. It might have been different if they'd asked you at christmas why they don't get as many presents(althpugh you still wouldn't be justified telling them everything) but you told them as soon as you found out not because it was best for them, but because it'd make you feel better.
