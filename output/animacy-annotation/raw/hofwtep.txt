&gt;The relevant fact is that the Taliban islamists subsumed most the muj, but you knew that.

Point stands. It makes you sound bigoted AF. “Islamists” is a bizarre way to describe them.

It would be like using “maoists” to describe everyone from present day China. Or “Stalinists” for Russia.

When “Pooh bear ists” and “Putinists” would at least be a Little more accurate.

&gt;Amusing all your arguments are predicated on rhetorical semantics. The US gave stingers etc to the muj to overthrow the soviets, but again you knew that.

Woosh. Here I’ll explain since you’re dense: the stingers didn’t win the war.

Taliban won without stingers. Mujahideen would have won without stingers.

You are: wrong.

&gt;About 2-3 mil since the War on "~~Terror"~~Muslim, but again you know this even if it's your job to parrot the PR.

Ehh, Afghanistan - they harbored terrorists who attacked US citizens on/ above US soil. 

Lol nobody defends the Iraq war- that piece of shit is universally reviled. Wtf you taking about?

&gt;Nobody said the US was uniquely "bad", just the baddies now, when your lot are pretending to be the Rebel Alliance.

“Baddies” lol. They’re just the biggest.

That’s it.

You’re Still trying to make them “uniquely” bad. China just squashed Hong Kong. Russia’s slowly conquering Ukraine. Half of Europe was involved in Afghanistan.

Africa is constantly having horrific civil wars. SA is… ehhh, maybe Sort of getting better, but it’s not like those countries haven’t had their share of war and atrocities.

**Mankind** is the baddy now. And always.

Murder apes.

Your need to make it about one particular country is dumb, and ignorant of history. :)
