Whining about my factual post history only shows how much of a liar you are, and calling me an incel is just projection on your part.  Then you insult me more, lie about my positions, my emotions, losses and actions.  All your accusations are knowingly false and most likely more projection.  I can't imagine how you've become so prejudiced, bigoted and ignorant that you are so angered over truths, and must lie so much about someone like me who speaks them.  Please call 211 for the Psychological help you need.
