Just like to remind those who forgot it was Clinton who repealed G.S. George Bush Jr. who allowed Chaney to run wild with military spending. And Obama who dropped a bomb for ever 20 minutes they were in office. But yea the economic system is the issue lmao. Pretty sure itâ€™s the voter being unaware and ignorant that allows this to happen.
