they are challenging, and I don’t know if anyone can truly change your view if your “view” in this case is actually your emotions. 
 
As a fellow white person I see these “all white people” statements as truth. In fact we are all racist and ignorant, that is the truth. The movement is about confronting racism in ourselves too. We are all learning and growing every day.  Throughout this past month I have realized a lot of shit I thought I knew was flat out wrong. Opinions I had were actually racist without me realizing. It was shocking but damn I’m glad for those “all white people need to...” statements because they helped open my eyes to myself!
 
Allow these challenging feelings to help and motivate, not discourage and feel guilty. No one should be made to simply feel guilty for having privilege to exist and not be bothered or stereotyped as Black people have been throughout history. This emotion isn’t helpful for any sort of cause.
