It is so fucked up that our society has been wrongfully structured to perpetuate this fear. Hopefully, we can revolutionize and radically transform society so these judgments will no longer be relevant to people. There are still so many implicit biases and it's so unfair and ignorant that someone would ever judge you, or see you less worthy of being loved just because of your skin color! You are beautiful and loveable no matter WHAT.
