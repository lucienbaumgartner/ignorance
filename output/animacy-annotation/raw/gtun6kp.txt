I actually think it's an improvement for Riot to change Seraphine's og lore. Having the Brakern crystal be okay with enslavement was really wrong for Riot to do, especially when we know from Skarner's lore that the Brakern experience agonizing pain when being used as batteries. What's worse is that Riot has Seraphine ignore the voice and not explore why these crystals are talking. I can undertand it's because they want Seraphine to be more focused on the Piltover/Zaun conflict, but having the story gloss over the fact that someone knows the crystals that power the city are alive and conscious doesn't give Seraphine a good image. To be clear this a criticism for the story and not the character

Now that Seraphine can't really hear the Brakern, she can focus on being a unifier for the two cities without having the controversy of ignoring the Brakern. However this leads to another criticism. We all know this: Seraphine's goal is to unite the two cities by singing songs that can help people "find their voice," in other words she wants to make people feel good via songs that resonate with them. It's great that someone is trying to prevent a civil war between the cities but I find her methods very naive and ignorant of the real issues of class disparity and systematic exploitation of the working class, which is a valid reason to dislike the character but not the story. However, it goes to show that there is a lot of room for character, and although Seraphine's empath abilities are great, she has a lot to learn before she's ready to save anyone. But I believe, ~~Aang~~ Seraphine can save world.
