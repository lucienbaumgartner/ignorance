The sad thing is, the business is profitable. Circumcised foreskins are sold to be used in beauty products. There are creams made from the cells within foreskins. 

It genuinely astounds me that Americans doctors are woefully unaware and ignorant of the functions of the foreskin. I don't think I've ever seen an American made/published medical textbook that actually included anything about the intact male genitalia.
