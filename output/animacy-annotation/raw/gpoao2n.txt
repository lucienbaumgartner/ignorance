I would believe this propaganda which you and many others spread in punjab. But no amount of propaganda can overshadow what I have seen from my own eyes, heard from my own parents, heard from my late grandparents. People were open fired upon. Hindus were specifically taken out of busses and killed. Homes looted, women raped. Many sought refuge in haryana including my own relatives. So tell this wikipedia propaganda to someone who is unaware and forgiving of the truth.
