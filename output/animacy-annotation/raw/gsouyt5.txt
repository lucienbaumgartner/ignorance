the title should give the explanation. This wasn’t a “imma beat you up because you Asian “situation.  This is a “you called me out of my name “ disrespected me situation and that word has the ability to anger a black person.  It’s a trigger word. And different cultures have trigger words that can make someone fight you(assault you). I know there are racist.  But beyond that the rest of society is just so disrespectful to each other a lot of times. Disrespectful and ignorant of each other
