&gt; Anyway, I found a really interesting 5-part piece on "untangling the knot" that I think is pretty great, and I feel it really appeases the feeling of frustration by clarifying the craftiness that went into the deliberate set-up of the feeling! I hope you enjoy the read!

Funny that this article is the one you link since it is the basis for a good deal of my rage. To spare you the boring parts and a lot of invocations to Khorne, the Blood God, I can highlight the problems.

For this purpose, I will just grant the articles points(which I don't). What does that leave us with? We are watching a complex ballet of local politics through someone that doesn't understand the politics of your average kindergarten class. And because Dany is uninterested and unaware that means the readers suffer through this. You can't just have a clever idea for a story: You need to be able to tell it in such a way that it is enjoyable, or at least readable.

That said, the blot never addresses the incredible decline in language seen with the editor becoming a pushover. This may not bother everyone but it is big to me.

Anyways, at the end, we aren't going to get an end. I've lost faith that GRRM will live to finish his series. So, D&amp;D are our resolution. woo.
