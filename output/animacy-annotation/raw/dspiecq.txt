As you mention sexual education, you have me thinking... In their upbringing, premarital sex is prohibited. If one married young like this couple did, they would have been virgins. Hence, they don't have any sexual experience, and being in that world, there really isn't much to worry about. They have had no exposure to conventional relationships and all the bullshit it brings, so they are unaware and unconcerned.

Like in their dating scene, they are not even supposed to French kiss. Hence, it makes it easier for someone to date a best friend's ex without much jealousy. As their relationships are so tame, they become accustomed to not worrying about rivals like you would logically be. As you haven't done anything physical with him and no one plans to, your relationship with him would be barely tolerable to her.
