I finally got enough money to travel just a few years before the pandemic. Everywhere I went I found places and communities literally raped by mass tourism.. with people just like me, no bad intentions, but it was the sheer numbers, the bus loads, moving excited and ignorant of everything around them. I found it so repulsive. 

I am not the resort hopping person and I avoid tourist hot spots at all costs, but I could still not see how I am any different or how I am not contributing to the problem. Something fundamental has to change about the way we move. Itâ€™s so sad that people from poorer countries cannot just move to and work in any country they choose, but people with money can travel wherever they feel like for as long as they feel like and treat the destination country as their playground.
