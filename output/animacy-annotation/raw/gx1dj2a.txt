Ok like holy shit. 

Like i always knew that this sub is mostly comprised of ppl recovered or recovered from ED, so I felt like maybe this sub cam spot disordered eating patterns better because they had to learn what nutrition was to survive, whereas most ppl don't ever have to learn like that. All this to say that i always kind of thought that ppl in Eatn't were either normal but unaware and vulnerable or disordered and intentionally hiding it. But this post?? Oh my goodness this is so sinister. Blaring ted flags, this OP seems on the verge of a mental breakdown, she has the responsibility of a kid, and they're egging her on?! They are more concerned about their little elitism "Im above food and human emotion and flaw" circle jerk than they are about someond CLEARLY in crisis? Like wtf?!! 

Toxic AF like I'm so horrified.
