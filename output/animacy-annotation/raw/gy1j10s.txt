When you take out a mortgage to buy a home to live in and raise your kids, you're taking on debt.

When you buy a car to get to and from work so that you can earn a salary to pay for the mortgage on your home... you take on debt.

When you go to the furniture store to buy furniture for your new home and put it on your store card with 48month 0% financing that is debt.

When you and your brother decide to go into business together and take out a business loan you are...you guessed it, taking on debt.

There's different types of debt. To just blindly say "*all debt is bad and keeps you poor*" is woefully childish and ignorant of the reality of financial management and growth. 

Grow up.
