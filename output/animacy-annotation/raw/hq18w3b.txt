I don't think it's sickening, I've read a few posts and all I felt was tremendous sadness and pity at somebody so ignorant and fearful that they experience a horrible, avoidable death while taking up a hospital bed for other people. The whole situation is very sad.

If anything I hope that subreddit acts as a wake up call for people.
