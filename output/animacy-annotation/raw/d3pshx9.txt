Aggressive drivers are predictable. You give them "too much" space in front of you in the expressway and they'll cut in. They're trying to get wherever they're going as fast as possible. I've driven in most major US cities, and I'll take aggressive Midwestern or East Coast drivers any day over clueless and distracted Southern drivers. Detroit is like Go Dog Go! Everyone trying to get somewhere as fast as f*ckkng possible. If you're not going 85 in the left lane you will be passed on the right and flipped off. Chicago, Philly, the same way. Houston where I live now, worst drivers I've ever seen, and it's because they're unaware and clueless. The left lane during your morning commute is often the slowest lane. Probably b cause there's a pickup truck towing a trailer full of lawn mowers going 60 in the left lane. The middle lane is for people who want to spend more time on their phone than looking at the road. Accidents abound every day and they clog up traffic, almost every one somebody rear-ended someone else because they're not paying attention.  People can't even manage 4 way stops so they all just wave at each other while playing on their phones. I can predict what aggressive drivers are doing it going to do. Oblivious drivers? Watch out.
