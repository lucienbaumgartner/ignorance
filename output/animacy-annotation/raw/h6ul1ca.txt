Yeah, and  most of the complaints people have about Robinhood apply to all/most brokerages. They get mad about SEC rules, acting like Robinhood made the decision, and to intentionally fuck over their customers. You can opt out of margin lending/investing. 

Robinhood is fine for first time investors. It's easy to learn on Robinhood. The charts are the cleanest and most intuitive for new people who don't understand complex charts. 

I don't like robinhood and hate their CEO and don't use it, but people are so hyperbolic and unaware of what is and isn't robinhood's decision
