For those unaware and interested in the question, there is a "conspiracy theory" that veganism (or, more specifically, giving up on meat) is being promoted for various reasons including, but not limited to, a way to create a more docile public, to lower the average lifespan by reducing "necessary proteins" in meat, as a way to cover for not realizing a huge flaw in the meat production pipelines is about to force people out of meat, and to cover up a dark truth about what is actually in the meat (as if the actual situation isn't already a dark truth, of course...)

These kinds of theories aren't very new, but the internet has definitely made it feel safer for people to talk about them. These same ideas exist in a lot of pieces of media, like for instance, in the many films where &gt;! people realize that the meat was really something else at the end as the primary climatic plot device !&lt;.

These are pretty much guesses without real data (which may be cool to dive into) but I bet these theories represents at least 40% of these people in online environments, although a smaller representation is likely to be found in real life of course. The rest are trolls, bots, and people genuinely curious but have been unable to clearly articulate that they weren't trying to troll someone (regardless of which party or both are at fault).
