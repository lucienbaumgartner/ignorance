Physicalists are pretty hypocritical. They first claim that it takes oxygen, chemical reactions, and electricity to create consciousness and thought. That lucidity requires high levels of all of these. Then they want to turn around and claim the opposite... the lack of them accounts for extremely lucid experiences.

Apparently we are more lucid when our brain activity and brain oxygen is LOW (as that's how NDEs are) than when they are high, yet we should still accept that HIGH activity is the cause of lucidity and consciousness.

We're self-aware because of our brain activity, we're higher forms of intelligence because of our bigger brains...

But we're at our most lucid when our brains are mostly OFF. We can only form perfect memories more clear and real than dreams by having our brains be mostly OFF and totally unaware and unresponsive to our immediate environment.

Because logic.
