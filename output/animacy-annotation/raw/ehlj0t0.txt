Lol don't blame me. That was all you. 

Love is incredibly sexual if it's about two adult sexual humans regarding a romantic relationship. Why are you nitpicking? Is that seriously your argument? That it's romantic harassment instead of sexual? 

It's not casual. What he did wasn't casual. It was by a WIDE margin unacceptable. Most sexual harassment is causal. Most sexual harassment is passing, meant to be positive, and ignorant. That isn't an excuse.
