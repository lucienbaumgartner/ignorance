No you weren't, and it's not ironic, but I understand why you say that. You say what you think you need to say to protect your crippled self-image. From your first response you were on the backfoot in defense mode, totally blind and unaware of what you said, I said and what it all meant. It doesn't matter what we were talking about, because you would've protected your negative emotions from the offense you feelâ€”not your views in itself. 

That's why " This wasnt directed at you at all" matters to you. 

That's also why you didn't feel like reading past the first sentence of my initial statement; ego and negative emotions.

You are all about facades, and one can't reason with a narcissist.
