Trump will throw everyone under the bus and truly "drain the swamp" that way. I'm waiting for when he throws junior under the bus lol.


You know, I could see them removing trump and pence, making pelvis president for the last year when the trump depression hits, then running a republican candidate who screams that the depression was pelosi's fault and the American people being so stupid and ignorant that they elect some other republican swamp creature in 2020
