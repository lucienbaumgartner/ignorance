Nah. I'm not wrong. You're far to angry and insecure and unaware of yourself to be highly educated. Plus, it's easy to see form you're writing that you don't have a terrific education or the kind of vocabulary that would suggestion being intelligent. 

You're lying. But that's OK. Go- eat. Your couch and snacks are calling you. Just try and remember- they're just snacks... they're not love.
