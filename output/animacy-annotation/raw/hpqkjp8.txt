&gt;Doesn’t change the fact that I found a treatment plan that completely got rid of my psychotic symptoms.. And it doesn’t change the fact, that I had a pretty severe case of drug induced psychosis

I...never said it did?

&gt;it being self-induced is a moot point considering what I went through

Again, not a thing I mentioned, although I will in a moment.

&gt;You’re basing this off of a few comments that barely scratch the surface of what happened to me.

No, I'm basing this off of my career in research with multiple trainings in human subjects research as well as multiple authorships on peer-reviewed papers.

&gt;Considering it’s nothing more than a case report, I don’t understand your reasoning here.

Allow me to explain:

1) As far as I've seen you disclose, you did not obtain any type of IRB or other ethics board approval for this "experiment". Given the procedures and experiences you described, it is incredibly unlikely that an IRB would approve such a protocol so I feel confident saying that it probably didn't happen. This alone is enough to make you average research team or journal highly unlikely to draft or publish any information about what you did, because there is a huge amount of legal liability for them if they do.

2) You identify multiple other substances and supplements that you have used, or continued to use, before and during this "experiment" period. Causality requires non-spuriousness of results, so regardless of how closely you monitored dosages and kept ample notes, it would be incredibly difficult for a research team to assess and affirm that it was the Blue Lotus that did the work here. **To be clear**: I'm not saying it didn't, I'm saying that from an assessment and reporting standpoint there is not necessarily enough there for them to pass muster for publication.

3) It kind of does matter that this was self-induced, from a research standpoint, for several reasons. Without a trained professional to assess your pre-experiment baseline, assess that your symptomatic presentation meeting the level of psychosis, and then assess your post-intervention resolution of psychotic symptoms, then all anyone has is your word. Unfortunately, self-reporting "I wasn't psychotic, then I was, then I took Blue Lotus and I wasn't again" doesn't stand up to peer review. 

Did you know that I went from not running and then trained really hard and ran the 40-meter-dash faster than ever recorded? You weren't there though, and I can't actually demonstrate to you that I was capable of doing it because I don't run anymore, but I swear it totally happened.

4) It also matters that the psychosis was self-induced by specific activities because your case report may not be applicable to broader populations. Psychotic symptoms induced via specific, controlled activities are not necessarily the same as those accidentally induced via substances/activities or induced by mental health. Simply put, there aren't necessarily a whole lot of people who induce psychosis via some combination of intentional cannabis/amphetamine/dph abuse coupled with sleep deprivation, so people who research interventions for psychosis are probably not looking for self-styled "psychonauts" as their primary treatment population. **To be clear**: your experience may be a building point for future research (more on that below), but this all makes it extremely unlikely that your case report would be used for any type of publication.

None of this is intending to insult or argue with you, so I'm not sure why you got so defensive. Your anecdote isn't science, although it could be used to spur science. That's an okay thing. However, your behavior was dangerous and would be highly irresponsible to subject others to, so there would have to be massive changes to try to do this as actual research.

&gt;Plus, I think my experience would be incredibly intriguing to a lot of researchers

Probably! There's a hallucinogenics research lab at Hopkins--a guy I went to undergrad with is a researcher there now. Professors, even researchers at R1 schools, are usually pretty easy to get ahold of--their emails are usually published right on the faculty websites, and most of them will write you back pretty easily. If you send an email and explain what you've explained here, they may be interested in pursuing things further, or possibly not. But it's a bit self-aggrandizing and ignorant of really foundational elements of research science to say that you'd like your experience and "specific treatment protocol" to become "an official case study".
