Well I will point out a couple of flaws in this logic. 

First, you are making a generalization. I'll give you that this position you claim might be based on your own anecdotal evidence and experience but it is not an absolute truth.

Second, the right and left aren't these definite groups or entities that aligning with means you fall into categories labeled by the group opposite to you. There are parts you like and parts you don't and you more than likely engage with people who are like minded.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, the way people engage in an argument is how I separate the ideology from the person. More often than not those from the Left how have a more difficult time in engaging with viewpoints they disagree with without resorting to insults and a condescending attitude to which they argue. 

Same can be said with individuals on the Right. I have agreed with people on the Right but their reasoning for what they believe is so  ignorant and convoluted and hateful, that I face palm and empathize with the Left when they see this person in the wild. "You're the fucking reason why we can't have civil conversation you numbskull." 

We should all make a more concerted effort to engage with others civilly and take each person as a different conversation instead of lumping them into one category and refusing to participate. In your experience, those on the Right are harder to talk to and in my experience it is those on the Left, bit that shouldn't dissuade us from trying again the next time.
