Exactly! I just get so sick of how unaware and stupid people are, all the time. Like, I shouldn't have to ask you to excuse me all the time. So sometimes I just lift up my hand basket over my head and inch sideways past the idiot's cart, hoping they see why I have to do it and how annoyed I am and how ridiculous it is that I have to do it. 

Plus, sometimes they block the aisle with their cart and stand ten feet away from the other side, so they wouldn't hear me say excuse me unless I yelled. So I just shove it out the way myself.
