You may feel like you asked a good and critical question, but instead you come forward as ignorant and unaware of African-American history. It is not possible to judge this case just in light of the acts alone, it has to be viewed in light of both past and current history and racism.

I myself am also not an American citizen and cannot in anyway relate to the sentences given in the United States. But it makes no sense to compare the judicial system and the prison sentences in my country to the judicial system and prison sentences in the U.S. Not only are the systems different, their history, social problems, political systems and state ideologies are completely different. To understand this matter, your knowledge from France is not necessarily very relevant.

Racism is a deeply rooted social problem which is hard or almost impossible to understand the full depths of, especially if you are not a part of the discriminated group. I am white, and for that I have been very privileged.  And I wish for all people no matter their ethnicity to be judged by their merits rather than their skin.  But for that to happen we have to eradicate racism. Ignorant questions (sometimes unintentionally) can contribute to the maintenance of old and outdated structures in society.
