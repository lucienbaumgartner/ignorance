In retrospect it's easy to say without the shock of the moment that you could've torn her head off for that disgusting comment. But you rose above it. Yes it's upsetting that there are judgemental cunts like this, but they're the ones with lives so unfulfilled and ignorant that they would judge you for this.
Your daughter is going to grow up without these toxic preconceptions and will be a delightful, happy and non judgemental person thanks to you.
