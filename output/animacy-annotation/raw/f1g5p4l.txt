I wouldn’t say replicants as a whole. My fathers a republican and he hates the shut out of trump. “He’s a god damn orange fucking idiot” is what my father says about him all the time. As much as I disagree with my fathers and most replicants political beliefs, he isn’t a bad guy. He’s actually one of the kindest souls I know. He was just raised a republican and that’s how he loves. He’s a astounding human being though. 

However there are piece of shit Republicans who are incredibly uneducated and ignorant that get a “what the fuck are you saying” out of my dad about once a week.
