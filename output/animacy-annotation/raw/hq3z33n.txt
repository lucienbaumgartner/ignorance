No problem! 

Something you have to remember is America is a \*huge\* country, and there are \*many\* different types of people with different experiences - and therefore different mentalities. 

There *are* definitely people who don't feel 40 hours is too much/much at all. That could be because these people are just very "work oriented" and find themselves needing constant busy work to be fulfilled or happy. 
It could also be because some of these people have found careers that are fulfilling for them and don't feel exhausting, and that pay well enough they aren't stressed about finances/working multiple jobs and can afford healthcare, vacations, etc. 
(35-40 hours of work in a week looks a lot different for someone who is making a comfortable wage, can pay their bills no questions asked, has money for vacations, actually *gets* vacation time, can afford healthcare/medications, and isn't working 2 dead-end and physically destructive jobs versus someone who is living paycheck to paycheck in poverty in horrendous working conditions with no vacation time and unmanageably inconsistent scheduling.)

Some people are, to put it simply, just ignorant and unintelligent. The types that are mocking people in France for working "so little" are often the same types who feel that disabled people are "full of shit and just need to get off their asses and work" and who will insult anyone who feels things like government benefits/universal  healthcare/higher minimum wages are valid and needed, calling them "freeloaders" or worse.
You literally had a huge portion of the US arguing *against* unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, and other protections for workers/Americans during *the entire pandemic* - even at the beginning when things were at their most uncertain and "dangerous" - because they felt "no one should get handouts" - as if benefits to keep people afloat who were out of work through no fault of their own due to shutdowns were "lazy" and "asking for free money."


One of the most disgusting things about America/the American people - in my opinion - is that a large portion of them have been completely "brainwashed" - for lack of a better word - to believe that the subpar quality of life our government provides is actually *good* and *all we deserve.* 
These people are fighting *against* improvements that would make our country livable, fair for all, and eradicate poverty, because they feel people need to "to pull themselves up by the bootstraps" and "struggle for everything" if they want to get by.

These are the Americans who "seem to like working as much as possible" that you're describing. 
They either genuinely believe that they enjoy this miserable existence - usually because that's how they were raised, in close-minded, ignorant families who do as they're told and never try to fight for better for themselves/others - or they're pretending that they do because ignorance is a lot easier than looking at the realities - which are that for many in the US, life is miserable and bleak.

I would say that most people I know - family, friends, coworkers, workers I speak with out in public, etc. - *do not* like working as much as possible.
*Most* if not *all* I encounter believe we need *serious* reform around worker protections/benefits. 
(We don't have mandated paid vacation weeks like France does, and most people - in "lower end" jobs especially - are lucky if they can get *unpaid* time off when they're sick, nonetheless if they need a break/vacation, and they suffer financially if they *do* get it.) 
*Most* if not *all* I encounter agree that we need to raise minimum wage to a livable wage, and enact some *serious* changes around wages in general for workers all over the country. Cost of living has gotten insane in many places in the country, and poverty wages are still the norm. It is *very* hard to survive in a lot of the country if you do not come from wealth/fall into privilege. 

Many Americans *do* work as many hours as possible with little to no vacation time - and often multiple jobs - but I promise you it isn't because we enjoy it or want to.
