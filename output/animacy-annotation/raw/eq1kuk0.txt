Ehh.. arguably she is the worst and probably last monarch of Britain.  She oversaw the complete destruction of the British Empire that her ancestors and ours built with blood, sweat, and tears.  Now Britain is reduced to an island the size of michigan and her people are so lost and ignorant that they have already been conqured by an invader. London is now a Muslim strong hold... kings of old are rolling in their graves.
