That depends on the context of that situation. Some people can be reasoned with and brought into the fold which is something that I'd personally like to see more of if and when that's possible.

The problem with Nazis however, is that you have to be 100% Intolerant to virtually every aspect their beliefs, appearance, etc. because 9 times out of 10 when you see them doing their little marchs and demonstrations they're actually testing the waters to see which communities will let them get away with that shit and which ones won't. 

And make no mistake the KKK and these neo-nazi types are domestic terrorists. If you let them they will do anything they think the local community will let them get away with and then some.

Violence isn't a be-all-end-all in every instance but, you beat believe that I won't shed a single tear seeing a bunch of grand wizard wannabes getting their teeth rattled.

The only way to keep Nazis from becoming a household name is to resist them in anyway possible and typically if someone is so hateful and ignorant that they've joined a coalition who's solitary goal is to spread and enforce that hatred and ignorance, they're usually beyond reasoning with.
