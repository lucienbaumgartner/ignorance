They deny reality and live in an echo chamber or are just blatantly racist. Its very strange to see. My own mother is a bit of both. During one discussion before 2016 she screamed at me "we have to take the country back from the muslims" when trying to rationalize supporting the mango menace. When I explained how racist and ignorant that comment was she said "I dont want to talk about this anymore". She won't acknowledge any of his comments about veterans, or the fact that he doesn't care that Trump's boyfriend Putin put bounties out to have us killed.
