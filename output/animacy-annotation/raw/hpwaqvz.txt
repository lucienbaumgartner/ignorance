No, that's ridiculous. Covid is literally being actively studied by the vast majority of the world's relevant scientific minds as we speak, and the wide range of results, especially to new variants, are more or less impossible for someone to have complete awareness of without at least somebody helping to break down that information, especially if the person in question is a layperson.

If you are genuinely arguing that asking questions about Covid is immoral then you're arguing against scientific literacy. You can argue that Twitter isn't the place to ask those questions, and you can argue that celebrities should be careful about what they invite with such questions, but you can't just write off any question about Covid as willfully ignorant and immoral. 

That's absurd and directly antithetical to efforts to spread information and knowledge, and frankly it's embarrassingly poorly thought out.
