Oh definitely take away her license - that ship should sail and never come back. 

But also, throw in some public service for good measure, because it takes a very socially unaware and obtuse person to repeatedly drive while distracted, so some eye-opening experiences might help her come down to earth, help out some people in need and do some service to society that she has been a danger too. Win, win, no? 

This helps with not completely destroying her reputation/job prospects (which will be harsh), but also demonstrate that lessons may have been learned and the person might have changed.

If licences are taken away only, it is easy enough to get fake ones, especially for someone who may never realize how their actions might affect others.
