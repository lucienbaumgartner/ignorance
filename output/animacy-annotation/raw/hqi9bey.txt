I feel on a mental level, trauma brain is a very real thing. Your fear center is on higher alert and the rest of your brain kind of takes a back seat in this case. I’ve never dissociated as much as before COVID simply because it took me 7 weeks to recover. Isolation has left me wary of people. Worrying about physical health and the people around me has left me with anxiety about my physical health which wasn’t a concern pre-pandemic. 

On a social level I have learned that while being immunocompromised while looking completely healthy, people can be very ignorant and selfish. You catch a cold, I have the flu. May be in a healthy looking package but my immune system is negative. 

Physically, I feel like I have never overcome the fatigue from COVID. I still cannot eat like I used to. I crave no food, am full after half a portion and am falling asleep at my desk despite sleeping 6-9 hours. 

Overall, it amazes me how resilient we are. We’ve adapted to complete isolation, became completely selfless and had to find new joy within ourselves. While domestic abuse skyrockets, proudly sober people relapse under the pressure and depression becomes as crippling as it could ever be we still as a population have learned to appreciate the simple things. Calling our loved ones so we aren’t alone. Walking with our pets just so we both see the outdoors and finding new hobbies we never would’ve been able to try. So while I am equally shocked at some things, angry at others and frustrated as all hell…I am in awe of everything we are able to do as people.
