Yeah but you're mad at a very small amount of people. 

No one's blaming you for slavery or racism. There's simply an irrefutable existence of a system that oppresses non-white people. White people benefit from this system even if only passively. 

Like I'm not responsible for the patriarchy as an individual man but I still exist within a society that favors men over women through fostering a lot of discriminatory sentiments receive those benefits passively. I don't get mad at people who say men suck, because they're not talking about me specifically, they're talking about the system as a whole. 

The history of anti-black racism ripples through the modern day. We still feel the effects of it in the media we consume and everyday interactions. So no ones saying white people are responsible because of their racist ancestors, just to be aware. Like OP's post is the most seemingly benign stance ever but it's utter nonsense because it's completely unaware and naive. 

Passiveness with regards to racism is only one step below active discrimination because the status quo will persist if unchecked.  Today's people aren't responsible for slavery but they are responsible for creating a better tomorrow, and that doesn't happen accidentally.
