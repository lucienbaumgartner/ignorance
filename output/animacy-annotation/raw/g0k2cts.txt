Because from a moral perspective it is worse to knowingly cause arm than unknowingly cause harm? A lot of vegans (probably incorrectly) assume vegetarians know to a certain degree what happens at egg hatcheries and on dairy farms or should at least be interested to do the needed research get the knowledge, while they imagine omnivores as unaware and uninterested.

I wouldn't call it "hate" though, I would describe it as disappointed. I am also not convinced that vegetarians get more critique from vegans than meat-eaters.
