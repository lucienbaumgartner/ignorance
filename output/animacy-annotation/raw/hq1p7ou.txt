Being a host doesn't give you rights or powers over other people. The fact that you think this is the case only proves that your sister was right in saying you are young. I would go as far as to say you are naive if not willfully ignorant and complacent.

You need to grow up and shirk off whatever indoctrination your parents obviously imposed upon you.
