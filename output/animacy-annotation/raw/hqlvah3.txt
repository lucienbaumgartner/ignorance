Say it’s American people, is the school also not an American school and thus American people? I’m referring to students and the school as separate parties. You seem to be referring to America as a whole. I agree that America has a LOT of ignorant and stubborn people. IMO I would prefer that the school mandates vaccines because schools have been doing it for generations, why would it be any different now? But the problem is that they DONT. UNTIL we get to that point, the SCHOOL has to come up with safe solutions for everyone— vaccinated or not. Believe me, I have no empathy for those that choose not to get vaccinated when they can, but it’s not like YOU or I are able to single-handedly make/enforce those rules.
