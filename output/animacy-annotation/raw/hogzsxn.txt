People, myself included, joke about the collapse of the collapse sub itself, but this a real issue.

I used to periodically delete all of my comments (as many other members of this sub periodically did), but one of my major predictions about the future was that as collapse becomes more imminent, people won't react by become more aware of the real issues behind collapse, but will instead become increasingly more insane in their views.

Pre-pandemic, despite a range of opinions and views, this sub was largely people who understood the basics of systems thinking and complex systems and, having studied our own society, realized how deeply in trouble it was.

It was a refreshing place to feel sane in a world that seemed completely mad. 

Unfortunately things have only continued to get worse after the initial pandemic boom. It's rare to understand systems thinking here, and often really understanding issues will get you down voted.

I still like to comment in this thread because there are occasionally people who still get it, but I think that time is running out.

The new generation of collapse subs are largely scared and ignorant of what's really going on, and so tend to lapse into weird paranoid thinking about collapse (or becoming bizarrely optimistic).

Thank you for this post as it's a hopeful remind that there are still some conversations worth having here.
