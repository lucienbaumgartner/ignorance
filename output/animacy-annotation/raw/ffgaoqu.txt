Describing someone or something as a **Wayne** (e.g. “he was such a Wayne last night trying to get that girl”) grew pretty popular within the District of Columbia around the 2010s’. It’s used to describe someone doing something really stupid and ignorant that it causes them great embarrassment and just makes you go “oof yikes bro”. 

It all started when the Department of National Resources was first formed by a new District-wide Congress under Obama’s presidency, with George Daniel Wayne being put in charge of running the newly-established Department of National Resources/DNR. However, Secretary Wayne’s mismanagement of the DNR and his overall incompetence caused a great eyesore to the Obama administration. This culminated into Wayne being fired by Obama, arrested, and executed via firing squad when Wayne tried to make a secret deal with the various war tribes involving the partitioning of local resources, which amounted to him confessing that local war tribes and bandits have been paying him off in exchange for giving them much-needed resources like fuel and metal. Luckily for the Obama administration, Diane Shoeman was able to redirect and steer the DNR away from complete and utter catastrophe and with her competence and leadership, Secretary Shoeman was able to create an extremely efficient and effective DNR that served the people of DC as well as bring back trust and credibility to the Department of National Resources. However, calling someone or something a Wayne became really common during those times.
