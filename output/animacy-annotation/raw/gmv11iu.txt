Well first off it’s good to hear you took care of your employees. I also want to say I’m aware there’s CEO’s out there who’ve never worked a day in their life and inherited business and wealth from their family, and they’re completely disconnected and unaware of how their employees are living and quite simply don’t care. And to that I’m on your side when I say I think it’s wrong. I know if I were ever in a CEO’s position I’d take care of my hard working employees because a lot of times they are under appreciated. That’s why I think CEO’s who started at the bottom do a better job than the ones who just end up at the top because they know what it’s like down here. But yes, I don’t want to have to pay someone’s salary with my taxes and I know I might have contradicted myself in agreeing with you, but I just want to say thanks for being respectful.
