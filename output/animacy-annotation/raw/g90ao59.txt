he *was* an evil, awful man, and it's very important for us to recognize that, because it means we've made progress. i consider myself an extremely progressive person, but if, in two hundred and forty-four years, people look back on what i believe and are horrified that anyone could ever be so bigoted and ignorant, that would make me happy.

things get better, and it's okay to acknowledge that someone was objectively unethical and wrong even if the behavior they engaged in was acceptable at the time.
