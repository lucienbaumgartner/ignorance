Why do you keep posting links to articles that show how incompetent the government is and that warn that a no deal Brexit is so bad that emergency contingencies are having to be thought up which harm us as proof of how great Brexit is?

It's frightening just how unaware and oblivious people like you are to what is actually about to happen to the extent you can't even see things with the stuff you post. 

Earlier you posted an article about companies planning on leaving the UK as proof of how well it's all going. Are you for real?

You're like a guy trying to convince me to take up cigarettes and showing me a photo album that's just pictures of smokers all dying of cancer to sell it to me.
