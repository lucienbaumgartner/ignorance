I am NOT suggesting taking the paid PTO off! Your Halloween example is close to my OP.. if you want to have a birthday party (or in this case a Halloween party) whenever you want thats on you. You and your family can pretend Halloween is a multi day holiday all you want. It doesn't make it true. That's not to say to not have the Halloween spirit or something. By all means enjoy the holiday. 

The holiday comes every year. Halloween,  Christmas, all of them. Every year. The idea here is the same day every year. Christmas comes once a year the same time every year.

Now if you are fortunate enough to have a job offer pay holidays off... when that holiday comes you get that day off with pay 

It's that fucking simple. Regardless of the day of the week. If this inconveniences workers one year or consumers one year then tough shit. But celebrate it on the actual holiday. You were guarantee the day off WITH pay and thats what you're lucky enough to get. Don't be selfish and try and expect society to just stop so you can have an extra day just because you want that extra day to be a business day. It's bullshit.

If they can't enjoy their holiday because of work and they feel their precious holiday was stolen because it fell on what normally is a day off anyways then they're being selfish and ignorant of those who work every holiday and ESPECIALLY those who work every holiday without pay. They don't enjoy their holiday. Do they expect THEIR day off to inconvenience thousands of people?

No.
