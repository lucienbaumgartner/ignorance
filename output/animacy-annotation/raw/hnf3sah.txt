Then what isn’t ”exploitation” because last time I checked everything around you including the device in your hand has been made by a worker, so are you, the champion of worker’s rights, upholding an oppressive system? Or are you just wrong and ignorant of how the mechanics of most businesses actually function, I would say the latter.   
Of course I know a business needs workers, but not everyone is going to take my advice like I said in my original comment. Your argument is you making up a completely unrealistic scenario and presenting like it’s going to happen. I’m sure if every worker in the world suddenly had the personality, the vigor, the money or a means of getting some, the business idea, the background knowledge, and the connections then my argument wouldn’t hold up but not everyone has those things do they?
