My parents were narcissistic and rabidly individualistic. They always treated me like a burden and reminded me I was one. my mom fully admits she didn't want kids, but her husband's did. They treated their kids like trophies not people. They had no love for parenthood.

I was asked to leave many times before I was 18 but I ended up moving in with my high school bfs family at 17. Went back for a month at 19 and it was hell so I left and haven't looked back. 

I think selfishness and, "not my problem", is a huge part of it. I also believe most of their friends found is callous and dysfunctional but my parents are too painfully self involved to care. So it might not be all Americans but selfishness is the American way.

The hilarious thing is they claimed to be put out by me, as in I asked for too much, but really my mom and dad both took far more from their parents for much longer than I ever had a chance to. I think a lot of American Boomers are extremely entitled and unaware of how they are, what their privileges were and what the world is like now a-days. 


Haven't spoken to my family in years. The idea of a happy/close family is quite frankly an alien concept to me. I don't get it. It was always suffering for me. I see people who are community minded or family minded and I'm jealous but that wasn't my culture and I can't really assimilate now. I'm also selfish. I also have NO desire to have kids. I wonder why...
