Why would Israel specifically attack a building containing media for no reason at all ,  knowing the media backlash that would surely follow?  It implies that Israel is  extremely stupid and unaware of the potential repercussions .  Israel may be guilty of many things, but stupidity at this level is not one of them .

There is at least one outright lie in the article, the claim that Israel shares all their intelligence with the USA.   Neither country does that .
