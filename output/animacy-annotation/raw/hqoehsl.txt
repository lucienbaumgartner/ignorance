That’s a bit oversimplified.   Which again is fine for normal conversation but the difference still matters in certain contexts. A venomous organism is one that bites or stings to inject a toxin. A poisonous organism is one that unloads toxins when something else eats them or touches them. 

Poison ivy is a common misnomer but also doesn’t prove any points on the matter. There are always things like that.  Poison gas is a category, not a specific thing. 



The difference between venomous and poisonous is indeed irrelevant for a normal conversation. But it is extremely important in certain contexts. 

For example if I encounter an animal that has toxins and it bites me, knowing if it’s venomous or poisonous is the difference between “ow” and “call 911” 


Saying the difference doesn’t matter in normal conversation is fine.  Saying the difference doesn’t matter at all is at best ignorant and foolish.
