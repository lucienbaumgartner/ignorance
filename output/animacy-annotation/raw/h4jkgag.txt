Depends on what country you’re from. A lot of the world is Scandinavia or Canada.  

Sure the U.S. isn’t perfect by a long shot but every time I see someone assert that it’s a third world country or is like a third world country it’s obvious they have no idea what the actual third world is like. 

If you think corporations lobbying Congress is as bad as it can get you need to see what actual proper corruption is like in a country and how that fundamentally makes the lives of everyone (except those paying them) living within worse. 

It comes off as completely uninformed and ignorant of what the world is actually like.
