They can't actually stop people from coming here for more than 2 years without very good reasoning. Trying to fight against that is a waste of time, it's EU law. In reality it's not even 7 years, it's 2 in practice. Also, this transitional period was over 15 years ago, we had open borders with EU nations for many many years before the word brexit was even invented.

I can't believe you're so stubborn and ignorant that you're trying to spin this as if us not opting to delay the arrival of unskilled immigrants years and years ago means we accepted them.

Read the links I posted, we don't have a choice, this is EU law. Not delaying for a couple of years isn't the same as accepting and agreeing with the law. The only recourse for stopping this immigration is to leave the EU, and that's what we've since done.

Also, it was under a labour government not a tory one when Poland joined the EU and we had mass uncontrolled immigration.
