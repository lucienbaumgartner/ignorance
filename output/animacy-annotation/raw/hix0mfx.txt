Nope, and it’s extremely naive and ignorant of how top down organizations work to think that the US military will have mass defections due some sort of attack of conscience. Americans are known for their - how do I put it kindly - situational ethics. Add that to the mix and, if the SHTF, the US military will do whatever the fuck it’s told whenever the fuck it is told to do it with few if any exceptions.
