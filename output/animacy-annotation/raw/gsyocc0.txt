“He’s just... not good in bed” I disagree. Being completely unaware and inattentive to how sex is for your partner doesn’t even make it sex anymore. He’s using you like a fleshlight. Sex is about more than just penis in vagina and if he hasn’t learned that yet then he’s either a teenage boy or he’s a shit boyfriend. Like this is so gross to me to even imagine. I’m a lesbian so my perspective is different, but sex isn’t over until we BOTH finish in every relationship I’ve been in... he’s making a choice to not even try with you.
