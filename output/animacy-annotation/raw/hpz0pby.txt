You’re so clearly misinformed, and simultaneously so confident that it’s hard to determine where to start. First, transgender people do not uniformly go through gender alignment surgery where their sex organs are changed. Some certainly do, but many elect not to. Of either population, many do not feel dysphoric about their genitals. 

The entire rest of your comment can be completely discarded as **sex and gender are not the same thing**. Also Jesus Christ sexual orientation is a completely separate and unrelated topic entirely. 

What I find exhausting is that I don’t know you at all, but I feel comfortable making the claim that your ignorance on this, and likely many other topics, is detrimental to our society as a whole. 

Like you’re completely and factually incorrect - individuals with infinitely more experience, education, and exposure than you have assembled an incredible amount of knowledge on the differences and relationship between sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Same goes with many other nuanced topics. And yet you feel confident enough in your limited intelligence on the topic to make ignorant and objectively incorrect statements while holding exactly zero room for growth in the event you are confronted with new information.

Labels aren’t an issue for me, or for most people I know in the modern, developed world. We understand them because it’s actually incredibly simple to do so when you are too scared to engage in learning something that doesn’t reinforce your existing beliefs. Ignorance is an issue, and it’s why as as a country we have entire swaths of people willing to vote against their interests and pull society back into a literal dark ages because knowledge and information you don’t understand frightens you. 

Grow up, ya know? Or at the very least get some perspective.
