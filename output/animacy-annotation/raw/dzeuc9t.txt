That's a valid point, but that's where self-control and restraint come into play. That girl has absolutely no excuse lol. She fucked up. But if she just kept to herself and sang it in her car for the rest of her life, there would be no problem or harm done. She would simply be fully enjoying Kendrick's art and stories. While the word will never have a reason to be a part of her vernacular, the word isn't the problem itself. It is the individuals, such as that girl, who are socially unaware and careless who ultimately cause all the problems and controversy.
