Talking about stuff with people on the internet is much different than creating a marketing campaign for a fucking movie, stop trying to strawman shit. It doesn't matter what your political beliefs are and whether or not you believe in social justice, I'm just saying that maybe this should be promoted at another time but you're so egotistical and ignorant that you're abandoning logic and reasoning just to prove your point.
