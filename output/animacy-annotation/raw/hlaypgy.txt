&gt; How would you like someone taking your picture or that of a family member and posting it on the internet for all to see?

Non-identifying pictures of a person in a public space? I...don't think I'd care even a little bit if it was my family member.

&gt;We are all aware of the shit that is happening.

I think some people are unaware, and even more people will ignore it as they shuffle on by with their lives. Documenting the harsh reality serves a purpose.
