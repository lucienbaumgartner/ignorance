I met Barry once, years ago at a small rural pub on the West Coast. He was a self-obsessed tool, spending the night by the bar trying to catch everyone as they got a drink in an obnoxious effort to ensure the whole room acknowledged his presence. It was pretty clear he was hoping for some “hey you’re Barry Soper!” comments to help him impress a lass, and seemed to be getting quite offended at the lack of attention. He started talking to me while I was waiting for a beer and did the whole “do you know who I am?” bullshit after about 10 seconds of conversation, then acted arrogantly dumbfounded when I told him I didn’t know who he was. Repeatedly tried hassling me for being uncultured, uneducated and ignorant of one of NZ’s greatest journalists. When I left I heard him immediately start the same thing with the next guy in line.

Not surprised at all that he’s still such a petulant stain.
