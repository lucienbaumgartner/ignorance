Personality pet peeves: 

\- People who are inconsistent

\- People who aren't open for conversation about their own beliefs, both conservatives and liberals. Also if people are extremists and think of things in black/white

\- People who guilt trip others with morality, people who like guilt tripping, period. 

\- Disloyalty and blatant liars. 

\- People who are avoidant and unaware of their own behavior and self. Especially if I'm honest to them about something. 

\- People who can't handle directness

\- Hypersensitivity to every little thing you say that might offend them or some other group of people they might/might not be affiliated with. 

\- People who won't let other people live their own lives (intrusive, controlling, annoying, nosy)
