Yes, the deaths from capitalism is also a big deal and so is the holocaust. Just because I believe in this asshole’s right to free speech doesn’t mean I’m some kind of apologist for his beliefs or a conservative. My point is that no one’s beliefs should be restricted or cherry picked by the state. Even though it’s hateful and ignorant, that includes the outright denial of atrocities. You can’t be a supporter of free speech if you advocate locking people up solely for their unpopular rhetoric.
