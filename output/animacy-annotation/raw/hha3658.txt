Because you have nothing to say. Backpedals to "just making a joke".

It's a fair point that being argumentative isn't optically great. The alternative is what? To do nothing? To keep allowing Tories to get away with horrific behaviour because half of us present ridiculous hyperbolic arguments that are obviously false to anyone with a basic understanding of psychology or economics. Or so disingenuously represent our opposition that you couldn't have a hope of convincing anyone who isn't already incredibly biased and ignorant of common sense. I don't think this is the way. You have to make sound arguments or you'll be so easily criticized and shut out at every election.

I'm sick of it. I actually want things to change, and I'm not interested in lying and misrepresenting as a method to get there. It's immoral and more importantly it's clearly not effective.
