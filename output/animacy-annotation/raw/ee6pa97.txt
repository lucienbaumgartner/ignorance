To be fair if your car is surrounded by 5-10 dudes when you are alone you get a fight or flight reaction. 

Ofc she was stupid, but even if one of these people would have actually gotten run over it is at least partly their own fucking fault. I bet the reaction would have even been different if they just stood in a row blocking the way instead of surrounding her car. 

All actions these idiots do are designed to make people react in a extreme way, nothing else. They want them to overreact so that their own stupid actions fall flat / donâ€˜t seem as bad. 

As dumb and ignorant that women may be, these people are way, way worse. Have to agree that it is a video full of assholes though.
