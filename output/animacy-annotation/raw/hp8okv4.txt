I've been feeling exactly how you've described as well. I also have a very bad feeling about where this is heading considering not only has this nonsense been going on for way too long, but it's escalating at such a fast rate. The COVID camps and the talk of compulsory vaccination is absolutely terrifying. The vaxx passports should have never been allowed to come into existence and there are likely plans in the works for them to become our digital IDs. 

It's hard not to fall into complete despair when you think about how the evil few have so easily been able to hijack almost every aspect of the lives of billions. We are not only at the mercy of the rich and powerful, but also the ignorant and fearful who believe everything the governments and bureaucrat doctors and scientists tell them despite the obvious inconsistencies and outright lies. I can only say that we need to keep the hope alive despite everything. Almost everyone has a line in the sand and more and more are joining our side by the day.
