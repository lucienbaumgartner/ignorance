It was, ball was heading to 6-yard box, you can't know what would be if it went past De Sciglio, but since he denied Juve a chance with his hand, which was clearly in front of him(as you can see on the image  posted above) it is a penalty, you can't give him a pass cause he was unaware and oblivous.
