I mean anything you find sexually attractive is fetishized. Women are sexual objects of desire to men. It's the primary thing we like about you. and any man that says otherwise is lying to both you AND himself. men are possessive of women. they always have been and always will be. no man goes to the club looking for a human being. they're looking for a conquest. this whole premise is absurd and ignorant of mankind and sexual behavior.
