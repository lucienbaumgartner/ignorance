Well, I mean, Their Generation is obviously perfect and without flaw so it was very audacious and ignorant of me to say such a thing.

New Gens: This planet sucks and its your fucking fault!

Them: But but but.... Boomers!!! Genx'ers!!!!

New Gens: Fuuuuuck you, you had plenty of time to fix it and all you did was complain.

Them: Shocked Pikachu face.
