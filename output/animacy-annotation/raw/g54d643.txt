See, this is why Matpat has the biggest responsibillity in this franchise and it shows how he screwed up everything in the last 2 years, not trying to be rude but a lot of people really thought Michael was BV and he was a robot by his fault on thinking that

He is a big youtuber and the most spoken FNaF youtuber and narrator for the franchise, which by default everything he says is gonna be taken as 100% truth by the ones outside the fandom and unaware of the complicated lore and discussions

The fact that he is finally put himself into the rail with the book series is kinda heartwarming, but Scott had to make an entire book series just to slap Mat's face and say "WAKE UP", and still, not always are great videos (I cant belive he really thought the ballpit time travel was actually real and even canon)

He is capable of the simple thing that NO ONE in this community can do: change your mind about the lore, with his skilled narration and focused simple video and explaination format he can do everything
