Well, that's partly why people are so divided on young people transitioning specifically because of cases like these. I wouldn't really say it was a "phase" though, and rather it was just a misunderstanding brought about because you were just simply unaware and too young to fully understand the scope of things.


I'm glad you found yourself despite the trauma and things you've been through. Happiness and fulfillment above all else is ultimately what everyone's goal should be.
