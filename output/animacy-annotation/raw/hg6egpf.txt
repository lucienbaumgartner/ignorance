I mean, if you wanna insinuate that women don’t know any better and refuse to see better men that would seem rather sexist and ignorant of you.

The objective reality is that most women have more choices and get to be pickier when it comes to men because of it. They can afford to put the onus to impress on men because they have the option to speak to 10 others.

I understand that unless you’re a bisexual and you aren’t viewing women’s profiles you might not understand how it is. Theres a large number of women with “Shoot your shot”, “Message me first, you gotta be funny” or “Don’t be boring” is indicative of the situation. 

You can agree or disagree but just slapping “Incel” on a post is the laziest and cheapest way to discredit somebody. I don’t believe women owe anything to men, I don’t believe that women should align with perceived gender roles and I don’t believe women are any worse or better then men. I’m pointing out the reality that it’s easier by far to date as a woman than as a man.
