In regards to the arguments he was making against sam, there is a foundation. Its just one thats very deeply rooted and not so easily explained. There is no way to simply explain it to someone who is still unaware and asleep. You have to lead them to a point where they can jump in and experiece it, but most of the time the thinkers like sam harris have a little monkey on there back that pushes them away from it over and over again which causes them to run around in circles of logic and loops basically for all eternity.
