The ones who systematically erase all prior knowledge of the menu directly before they are supposed to order? The ones who stand in line for 5 minutes and don't even look at the menu, only to stand slack jawed at the register as they run their two brain cells together as hard as they can, only to finally ask you what's good, cut you off mid sentence and order something that is completely opposite of what you were just talking about? The same ones who then spend an inordinate amount of time attempt to find the perfect change, only realizing after they counted out 13 pennies like  kindergartner trying to remember their numbers that they don't have a quarter to cover the 38 cents portion so they have to fish out another dollar that is inexplicably kept separate from the rest (or in the case of some very large female offenders, inside their bra). 

In case you guys can't tell I used to work customer service. Still salty as fuck about people like this. Worked in a few locations actually, the worst offenders on all fronts by a landslide where when I worked in an area for a more well off clientele. Easily the rudest, most entitled, unaware, and worst tippers.
