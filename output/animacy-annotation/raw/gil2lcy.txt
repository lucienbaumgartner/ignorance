I must say, then, that what you experienced just could not have been THC-induced. There is no full spectrum CBD oil that has anywhere near the amount of THC required to get you high let alone induce temporary psychosis, even with 3 vials worth. You'd get more THC from smoking a small amount of cannabis.

Additionally, CBD has been found to act as effective antagonist to THC's potential psychotic effects, so the significant amount of CBD you consumed would have played its own role there.

If you're willing, I'd be happy to know the exact oil you consumed.

In any case, it would be useful to know if you smoke weed, at all, or if you frequently use psychoactive drugs of any sort. Microdosing is effective in treating a number of mental health disorders, but I am both unaware and unconvinced that it can help to treat or alleviate potential psychosis or schizophrenia.
