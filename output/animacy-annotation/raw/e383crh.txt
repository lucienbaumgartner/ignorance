I think you're misunderstanding the context here bro. I hate the LDS church and their love of polygamy and money and oppression and rape. I hate that they are what people think of when they hear the word Mormon. It's ignorance that has people thinking all Mormons support them and their beliefs, some of us have been fighting them since 1844 and we won't be lumped in them and their bullshit.

And your irrelevant "fact" added dick to the conversation. Everyone knows the LDS Utah Brighamite church has never truly renounced polygamy and never will, because it is the foundation they built their claims to legitimacy to run the church on. You are unaware and ignorant of the other branches of Mormonism
