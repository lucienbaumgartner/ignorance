My first Halloween was when I was in the 2nd grade, where I was just learning about the holiday, and my best friend from second grade- Rohma-  invited me to go trick or treating with her. I convinced my mom- who was hesitant, and unaware of how the holiday is celebrated- to let me go. We went to the local drugstore, and she bought me a pumpkin pail. I got a witches hat, and was ready to go. I waited at home for hours for her to call, she never did. Finally I called her house in desperation, and her mom picked up, and said she already left with her friend. 

I was devastated. My mom felt bad so she took me to Rite Aid and just bought me candy.

Rohma and I made up of course- back then (don’t know what she’s up to since elementary school), but I still randomly think of that, and go “fuck that bitch.”
