Oh for goodness sake enough with this “both sides are bad” nonsense.  It makes you look woefully uninformed and ignorant of reality. BoTh SiDeZ!! Give me a break. One side aligns themselves with literal nazis and white supremacists and the other wants people to be treated with social and judicial equity, and you’re telling me both sides are bad? Lol! Do you honestly hear yourself?
