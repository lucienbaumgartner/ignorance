Brunei is simply too apolitical with very little appreciation of politics and how power and administration works in this country and in others, which is why I never thought that full democracy would work for Brunei, just as it didn't really work for Malaysia.

Bruneians like myself aspire to a great many developments in Brunei, from younger , better educated ministers, to dial down reliance on boomer and old guard leadership structures , to modernize economically, have a sustainable digitalized economy and so forth. 

But the fact that many bruneians are still so apathetic to what happens in the country, and do not know beyond what they've read in the newspapers , many who still get their understanding of the world from facebook links shared on the internet and the world western media - which if you've watched documentaries like the Social Dilemma on Netflix  - show how base and easily manipulated opinions are. 

The fact that many Bruneians are still so disconnected from the geopolitical realities and truths in this country , unaware and unappreciative of larger mechanisms at work;- It really is a cause for concern . 

If we truly want things to improve and be better, then we must be deserving of it and be able to understand and appreciate the issues that are happening , and be able to parse through the information available,  to discuss and resolve them.

Looking at Brunei through Legco and BB and r/Brunei, I see very little evidence of it. Until then, we get and have what we deserve, and that is MIB - this sweet comforting lullaby of how safe , warm , and satisfactory everything is , and that it's just good enough .

I'm happy to discuss this with those interested in the topic. Ad hominem attacks , juvenile and low effort / threshold comments will not be responded to.
