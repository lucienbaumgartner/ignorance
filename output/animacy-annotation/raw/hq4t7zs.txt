Not to nitpick, but I don't think you know what "playing psychologist" means. I never tried to identify some part of your psyche that supposedly led to your shitty takes. And though I did make an assumption about you when I said you wouldn't enjoy shamisen or shamanic music, it was on the basis that you don't enjoy dissonant music that go against western standards, which in my view was a fair point to make, considering that the only engagements with Asian music you previously mentioned were that you hated Chinese opera, tolerated Hu Tao nursery rhyme, and enjoyed anime openings + k-pop. Intentionally or not, you're coming off as someone victimizing themselves in response to backlash over a rather ignorant and silly original comment (that I suggest you re-read to understand why it could be upsetting to a lot of people). My best advice for you is to log off, take a deep breath, and stop convincing yourself that other people are "playing psychologist" or "forcing a political angle." It's really not good for anyone.
