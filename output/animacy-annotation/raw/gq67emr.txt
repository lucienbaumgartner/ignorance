How about this? Americans are tired of living in fear. We don't want to bully the world and rip it apart with our free-market mantras. We don't want kids to grow obese through the starvation of nutrients. We don't want shit lives with shit mortgages for properties that don't live up to their values. We want real purpose and real ideals. An America that cares for, tends and grows the brightest minds, the largest dreams and makes even the most stupid and ignorant of us believe in ourselves. We have accumulated the wealth and the knowhow to fulfill the founders' dream of an independent nation that is a light of liberty in the world, at home and abroad. We have the means to let every single one of us accomplish our finest moments, but we cannot go further until we smash this idea of America as a con. The biggest con. Run by the orangest Don.
