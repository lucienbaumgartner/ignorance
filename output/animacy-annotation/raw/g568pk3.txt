I donâ€™t disagree. I feel like many already take this approach.

I think the first and main problem is, at what point in the game do players discover this? Being new and unaware of the repetitive cycle of WR, they go in blind and unware of an ideal approach. 

I was one of these people three months ago. Had it not been for me coming here, I would have been in worse shape than I already was/am, and heading down a path of more wasted gold and time.

Companies benefit from the psychological trickery though, so this "blindness" of newcomers (and even vets) is taken advantage of as often as possible.
