Are you ignorant and unaware that government research and development gave us the computer, satellites, and the Internet?

WWII government research and development created the first computer.

The NASA space program developed and created the first communications satellites as well as placing a man on the moon.

Al Gore created the World Wide Web with his Senate Bill authorizing spending and construction of the network we now call the Internet.

Are you in denial? 

Government has created hundreds of breakthrough technologies too numerous to go into for a short comment to a posting.

Are you just a kneejerk capitalist who does not know anything, because government does indeed create technology?.
