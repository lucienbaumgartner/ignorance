So, the only reason AM is justified is if you procreate? 

I hope you get a lot of help before you get married on how to process things ‘properly’ analytically. 

Two people are a family. You sound selfishly ignorant and oblivious of your dumbness. Have you ever thought two people who don’t want children can meet through AM and if their other goals in life align can make a good life together. Much better than people who reproduce without a thought and have no business even being married, forget being parents.
