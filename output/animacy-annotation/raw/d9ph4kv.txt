&gt; This is true for any politician, regardless of the party.

Some politicians try to rely on people's awareness of what is important. I agree that they aren't very successful though.

The conflicting ideas in the dissonance are 1) that democrats are the well informed, well educated and well meaning ones while people voting for republicans are uninformed, dumb and evil, 2) democrats rely on their voters being "unaware and compliant" and ignorant of civics.

From what I have noticed liberal voters are much better at dealing with cognitive dissonance. For example they believe that Trump is somehow against women equality when it's enough to read for a minute about his daughter Ivanka to know it's a complete lie. Or the fact that Hillary received a lot of money from countries that sponsor terrorists and don't even allow women to drive - how can one support someone like that and claim to be a liberal at the same time?
