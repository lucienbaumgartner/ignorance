Alright you're a fucking idiot. People are there to shop and they get caught up in their thoughts just say "excuse me" and move on. Again at restaurants just say excuse me like a normal person. 

But the real evidence of how fucking unaware and selfish you are is that you talk about someone being stopped in the middle of the road and didn't think to see if they might need help. You only considered how it affected you and then have the gall to accuse the world of being self centered.  Fucking hypocrite.
