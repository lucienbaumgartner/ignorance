&gt; No. It's quite relevant. You are blaming the courts for something that is not their fault.

It's not their fault for being unreasonable?

&gt; Why don't you read the decision? They explain why.

Lol. I think it's pretty clear at this point that *you* haven't read the decision, and you're just hand-waving me away.

Their decision is entirely arbitrary.

&gt; That's your final argument? That the SCC is wrong?

Nope. That it's unreasonable.

&gt; Why?

Because 30 months is arbitrary and ignorant of reality.
