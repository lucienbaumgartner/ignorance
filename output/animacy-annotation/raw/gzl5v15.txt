This is the same comunity that has so many redditors on the spectrum, even the most obviously sarcastic posts need an /s tag to not get downvoted. 

This low-rent scripted content-farm called "Buzz 60" should be your first red flag that this is a manufactured event.

The moms  are clearly acting, and *throwing their wig* at their son?!  C'mon, TV has been scripting these sort of interactions for 50 years.

I know people on the spectrum have trouble parsing through this kind of stuff, but there are also just a lot of gullible saps on here who are so dense, naive, and ignorant that they take these kinds of videos at face value. I'm just like "how can you not see how obviously scripted this is?!?!"
