I think the difference is: The former is known and transparent to both parties while in the latter case, one party is kept in the dark and unaware of whats happening.

Im fine if my partner doesnt love me anymore and wanna find happiness somewhere else but Im not fine if he does so but at the sametime tell me how much he loves me etc...
