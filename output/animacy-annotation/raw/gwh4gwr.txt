I'd add that it's a "known anachronism" at this point. Most people know it should be pronounced Por-sher, but doing so makes you seem pretentious and unaware of The Understanding that most of the English speaking world pronounces it Porsh.

Language, grammar and spelling are not fixed, and there is no committee that has the ultimate say. If enough people use a word or say a phrase a certain way, it becomes acceptable English simply by virtue of enough people using it.
