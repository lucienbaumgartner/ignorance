The idea that people can't design their home the way they want based on everything being of a certain time period is incredibly fascist. I found you annoying before, but now I just think you sound like an aimless dumb fuck. Like...you OWN design? 

I said thank you for your opinions and people should be allowed to design their own houses buuuuut you're a weird fucking fascist. At first I thought you were ignorant and annoying like most of reddit. 

Then I realized how idiotic you are.
