I agree investing on LPs alone would not be the most ideal strategy, one can invest in both sides for broader exposure. Hard part is how to pick the winners because I'd say a large number of companies in this sector are scammy, and the shady hype-sters enable these executives to make bank on the back of the ignorant and unsuspecting retails.
