I’m just a very quiet and chilled guy and by now I’m already kind of used to these misconceptions that I can’t talk, think, eat by myself and everything. I have spastic cerebral palsy, and while it didn’t affect my speech, my limbs can go crazy sometimes and give the impression that I really can’t do anything. I can, it just takes a little bit of time and I’ve learned to get used to this dynamic.
The girl was pretty ignorant and obnoxious, but I truly believe she wasn’t trying to be. When she’s not drunk, she’s usually sweet, even though she can be a Karen sometimes. The thing is, my girl is Colombian, she screams even when she doesn’t want to, so you can imagine the whole scene when she was intentionally shouting lol
