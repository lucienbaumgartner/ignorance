I thought it was because they don't have many jnj vax like they did the last couple weeks. Im pretty sure it's a supply issue. The state of texas is only getting 800k doses this week when we got 1.7mil last week. 

Why does everyone jump straight to a political conspiracy? So obnoxious and ignorant of any facts or logic.
