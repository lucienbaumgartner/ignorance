I went to Penn State in the early 90s, and when this story broke, SO MANY people I knew jumped to defend him. 

 "He told his superiors, there was nothing else he could do!"

 Paterno had people above him on the list, but he didn't have "bosses" or "superiors". If he wanted something, he got it. He was the unofficial king of the school. 

He kept the Blue Band off the field in the 1997 Outback Bowl, because he didn't want the band messing up the grass!

There are two scenarios for this; either he knew about the abuses, and helped cover them up, or he didn't know, and is far less perceptive, and ignorant of his own staff's activities. 

I think it was the first.
