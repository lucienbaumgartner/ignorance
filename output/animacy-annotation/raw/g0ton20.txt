I can sympathize with that notion. I wouldn't worry about it though. Places like the internet are especially cavernous echo chasms. Given our selective hearing, so to speak, of what we like and what challenges what we like, we are more likely to pick out or push back against things that pique our interests. It is just that we are blind and unaware that others have already done it, like the Simpsons. So some people add to the pile unnecessarily while putting the onus on others to sift through the redundancies, sensationalizations, etc.
