What do you mean he’s not getting up to much? He’s 50 and just became the oldest major winner in history winning the PGA Championship this past summer against guys who are 20 years younger than him. That kind of turning back the clock doesn’t just happen, especially when you factor in the shape that Phil used to be in as he’s slimmed down quite a lot over the last couple years.

You’re comparing a president who by all appearances absolutely refused to work, with a guy who has put in work when he hasn’t necessarily needed to. Also, if you shouldn’t believe everything you read on the internet why is the answer always to google something, rather than trying to get responses from real people who can put things in easy to digest terms??

I just think Phil is getting shafted by this community. Apparently anybody who’s not knowledgeable on everything surrounding unprecedented pandemics is supposedly ignorant and too stupid to do their own research when it’s likely they don’t know where to start. And that’s not anybody’s fault. The fault lies in not trying at all and coming to your own faulty conclusions.
