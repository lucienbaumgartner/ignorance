Same God as Moses, Jesus and Abraham. Same God the Sikhs and other monotheists worship. He is the Creator, he who does not beget nor is begotten. Islam is the way that is chosen because that is what the creator sent as the final revelation and the proper way to worship the one who created me. Its a shame you  were so narrow minded and ignorant that you didn't know anything about Islam before you left. This is evident from the statements you made. Instead of looking at morality from people who don't care a single drop about you, you should have taken the objective morality from the one who created you. I hope you are guided back one day or at least give a better light into the truth
