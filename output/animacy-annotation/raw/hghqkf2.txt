My point is that you can only regret things where you know you made some shitty mistake. If you are entirely in the dark and unaware of how your actions affect others, you're not going to regret. I'm not saying that it is not harmful. Harm is caused regardless of intention. I very much agree it wasn't nice and that he has all the right to be upset. On the case that maybe she's not aware of the harm, yes, maybe she needed more empathy or just to pay more attention, and this is why these things might need a serious conversation for her to realize it and correct it. And in that case going on some petty revenge to address it instead of just talking to her is a bigger shitty thing to do than what she did to him, imo, because he is definitely aware it is shitty. 

Yes, disrespectful people who do mean things intentionally are everywhere, that's correct. And revenge is intentionally shitty for certain, and would put him exactly at this terrible person spot that we can only speculate whether she is or not.

Edit: fixed some words I ate
