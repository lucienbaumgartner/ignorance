There was a slight pause in the Knight of Ninestars, before he gave a small nod of assent. "I shall allow it for the time being, L-Milanna." He gave a little bow of his head, the moonstone cloak clasps shining softly in the light. 

"Though I have always found that there is a difference between the actions of a bold man and a foolish man, and the same can be said of women, even those who know how to use a blade as well as you do." He tipped his cup to her ever so slightly. His hand moved to rest upon the table as he leant back in his seat ever so slightly...He looked intensely unaware and uncomfortable doing so, but it was obviously that he was trying his best to humour his partner at the table.

"It is not so very far from the Sisters and Ninestars, you would be welcome to visit should you so wish."
