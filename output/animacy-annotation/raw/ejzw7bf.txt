It's inappropriate, but I don't think Biden has malicious intent or thinks of it as sexual.  It's just something he's grown accustom to doing and it's never really been a problem before.

It reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld, where that guy would always get nose to nose with people when talking to them.  I know that's just a TV show, but some people are just weird and unaware that their actions make others uncomfortable.  Heck, I always hated it when (usually old) women (strangers) would refer to me as "honey, sweetheart or darling".  There is nothing wrong with it really, but it always made me feel uncomfortable.
