While I fear these idiots as a group, because they're why the GOP is so spineless in the face of active efforts to destroy our democracy, I can still pity them as individuals.

Pity, because they're so fucking gullible and ignorant, that I can only imagine how often they are fleeced by other con-men in their lives, without ever gaining the ability to learn from their mistakes.  Their lives must be one constant and bewildering cold rain of being fucked over.
