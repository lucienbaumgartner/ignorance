I think your interpretation of those established FF themes relating to "not blindly following orders/dogma and trusting in the power of people over supposedly divine power or uncaring rulers," is close to my understanding. However I don't think XV is the antithesis of that idea.

One, **Noctis is the True King.** Meaning everyone: the bros, Luna, the Six, Regis and the old kings, trust in and follow Noctis. I'll explain.
 
The True King's power or Providence is described by Bahamut as *"a power greater than even that of the Six."* This power is the only way to end the immortal Ardyn. Meaning the Six *cannot defeat Ardyn alone.* Using the True King's power involved absorbing the power of the Crystal (*End of Ch.13*), the Kings, and the Six(*Both during the game and culminating in the ritual at the finale*). The Crystal is described as holding the soul of the Star; meaning by the end of the game Noctis held the souls of the entire planet within him and was able to direct it to his will. 

&gt;Merriam-Webster definition of "Providence" 
&gt;1 a *often capitalized* : divine guidance or care
&gt;   b *capitalized* : God conceived as the power sustaining and guiding human destiny

XV's Providence is Noctis's Providence, he borrowed the power sustaining the world and guided it into scourge Ardyn's face.  Moments before the kill-shot we see Regis and the Chocobros in a classic "My friends are my power" frame. Noctis implores Regis to trust him before unleashing his power. 

Two, **Noctis wasn't raised as the True King.** Meaning, Noctis was not raised as Yuna was in X. He was left to be largely carefree and ignorant of his true duty or responsibility. Noctis is not driven by his dedication to Bahamut or the Six, instead he's pushed by everyone's faith in him. He doesn't really even understand it, in fact it pisses him off (See first royal tomb, his surprise in Ch. 12 at Luna's hidden feelings). Why should others give their life for him, he wants to save everyone, he doesn't want to lose anyone else. That's his motivation throughout.

Now, quickly, onto Nyx and the Lucii. The question asked of Nyx of who to sacrifice for power was a trap. The answer is no one. Only the selfless are worthy of the power of the Lucii. If you are tempted by power like Luche you burn to a crisp, if you do it to save your sister with a hint of revenge you lose an arm. Now why would the power only be given to those willing to die to protect others? We see how short lived the full power of the ring and Crystal are. I will have to dip into the FFXV Ultimania Scenario Side because all the lore guide in XV says is that the Crystal "*has a will of its own, and channels its sacred power through the Ring of the Lucii to the monarch who bears it*" 

&gt;I'll put the beginning of the **Prologue from the Ultimania**
&gt;The Star was being quietly eroded.
&gt;It is not even clear when it began, this Encroachment/Erosion of Darkness. Infested with the horrifying creatures called “Shigai” [Corpses/Daemons], the world is slowly but steadily being swallowed up by a night of despair.
&gt;The Star had a will.
&gt;It is a powerful shining stone・The Crystal was created. 
&gt;There were six-pillar-kami in the world. The Six, as they were called, created a ring to allow mortals to tap into the magic of the Crystal.

The closest FF analogy I can think of for the True King is from FFVII; where a person could theoretically sit in the confluence of the entire Lifestream and become God. The will of the Crystal is the will of the Star, the one that Noctis is able to direct to save his living friends in memory of his dead friends.

*Now why did Noctis need to do this? Why be so protective of the Crystal's power? Why require selflessness?*

**Ardyn.** The immortal guy described by Bahamut as a straight up fool in the JP localization, saying his mind was "twisted by spite and bent on revenge," in English. According to Bahamut in XV, Ardyn is immortal *because* he took in the scourge and tried to use the Crystal only to be rejected. According to Ardyn, he wants to kill True King Noctis (*holding the soul of the planet inside him*) because Ardyn was killed by the Lucian King of his time. Yes, explicitly killed in JP. Ardyn was killed then in his 2000 year bout of hatred and anguish corrupted the world and brought the darkness. Sound like someone else who couldn't handle rejection or mortality? 

Maybe Garland from FF1. Maybe Xande from FFIII? Maybe Kuja from FFIX? Maybe Yu Yevon and Yunalesca from FFX?  Maybe Buhnivelze from XIII? 

Facing loss, rejection, and death is tough; as natural as those things are. It's not great to lock thousands into a never-ending dream in order to preserve them from death while damning thousands of others to the tyranny of a dream powered kaiju in the hope of saving those people the pain of war. Working with others on a realistic solution is better, **accepting those painful elements with the joys of life in mind** is better than **selfishly rejecting everything** in a nihilistic murder spree.

Lastly, JP Bahamut tells Noctis he will have to abandon the future joys of life in order to unleash his power - this is better to me than the line about "many sacrificed for all... so must the King,"  because it's not supposed to be about coercion. Bahamut's revelation was easy mode, for Noctis to sleep, think things through himself. We saw Noctis's actions after waking, but we shouldn't forget what he tells the bros atop the stairs.

&gt;常に胸を張って 生きろ
&gt; Keep your head up and live your life. 

(Not just Walk tall... but to *live*) Perhaps as he had the ability to do for his 30 years without the full burden of his duty.
