"like crack to me" bruh this was so funny hahahahaha

Unfortunately I've never met an Infp afaik, and if I did it was likely when I was younger and unaware of mbti and when I understood myself alot less

So yeah I can imagine how an unsuspecting infp might wanna run to the hills at the sight of young me

Current me might not be so bad to them, but I don't actually know that atm though I'd imagine if I take my time listening carefully to them then maybe I'll identify various opportunities to achieve effective communication w them

Then maybe they won't want to run away at all lol

Enfps I don't know if I've ever met em but I probably wasn't worthy in my past, now idunno how it'd go since I've only interacted w a few on reddit

But yeah I think ideally I'd love to date and infp whaman they're just epic magical humans love em to death
