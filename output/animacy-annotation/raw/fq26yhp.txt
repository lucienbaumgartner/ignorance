I want to have a nice discussion here. But your comment about "highest skilled workers in the world" makes me think that you believe California is where all of the most skilled engineers are.

Which is so naive and ignorant that I am finding it difficult to rebuttal. 

Just look at a list of top engineering schools in the country. I admit that California has several, but absolutely not all. 

What is your opinion of Indiana? They have 2 of the best colleges for engineering in the country. Purdue University and rose hulman. 

Guess who also has a top school (higher ranked than most California schools). NEW MEXICO. 

I know plenty of people who don't mind moving to the desert for their work. I also know several people who don't want to go to the desert (me included).

I also work with some very smart and incredible engineers that came from places like MIT, then went to California and silicone valley. Yet, ultimately left California for a better career with better living and better pay. 

So if you think California is the holy grail of the US tech and engineering world, you are sadly mistaken.
