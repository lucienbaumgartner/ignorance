Me, me, me. **I'm** afraid.  *I* don't want to have regrets. 

What about your wife who has spent years working on your relationship? What about your wife who remains devoted and unaware that she's now become second place to you? What about your daughter who admires you and looks to you for protection? 

But I guess it doesn't matter because *your feelings* are apparently more important than your family. And for what? A girl who is almost 10 years younger than you. 

This is why I hate posts like this. These types of posts are made by people who have no interest in doing the right thing. They just want to 'do justice to their feelings', no matter who may get hurt from it.
