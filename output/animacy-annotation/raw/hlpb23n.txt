… 

Yes, these are all just coincidences. 

Go look at a survey of couples who have very successful relationships, there won’t be any correlation with having the same birthday. 

Also, 1 in every 365 people your same age have your birthday. In the US, there are about 5 million people your age. Let’s say 45% of those are women, and 1/365 has your birthday. Guess what, that’s over 6,000 people; there’s multiple of them in every major metro in the country.

As for the rest of it I couldn’t bring myself to read in detail, but the universe does not give you or anyone else signs. It just does what it does, unaware and uninterested in our lives. You are free to interpret signs in whatever you want, we typically refer to someone who interprets a lot of signs as schizophrenic, but you do you.
