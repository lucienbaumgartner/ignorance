&gt; Marx was never anti-semitic, I just proved that

No you didn't.

I literally quoted him making antisemitic remarks, and your claim that he was "ethnically Jewish" and therefore magically cannot be antisemitic is farcical. That's not how logic works. People can be (and often are) bigoted against groups they are close to.

He didn't consider himself to be Jewish.

Indeed, the argument that he was "ethnically Jewish" is something typically seen in deeply racist groups, like antisemites and the ethnoreligious apartheid state of Israel (which, notably, also didn't exist at the time, so is doubly irrelevant).

Whether or not someone else considered him to be Jewish has zero bearing on him being antisemitic.

And heck, you can be racist or bigoted against a group you are a member of. Plenty of people are.

Marx didn't believe in god. That means he was an atheist. That's what the word "atheist" means - someone who does not believe in any sort of god. He wasn't a part of any atheistic organization or anything, but being an atheist has nothing to do with organized religion or organizations. There are many flavors of atheist in the world, many of whom use other terms to more specifically desribe themselves.

Because he was a pseudointellectual narcissist, he liked to prove how smart he was, and thus constantly proved how stupid he was, like most people who are incompetent and unaware of it. His ranting about atheism proved he didn't actually understand atheists at all, as he believed that atheism was a "refutation" of god, which is not what atheism is.

&gt; Marx also didn't call himself a "Marxist", so for you to say he had an "ideology" (despite criticizing the very notion of ideology itself) reveals quite a gap in your knowledge on these topics

Being an ideologue is bad. But the fact that it is bad doesn't mean that people aren't ideologues.
