Well to be fair some schools do have funny traditions that wouldnâ€™t seem racist/insensitive until the right circumstances. I knew plenty of kids in high school that I bet would think it would be hilarious to throw tortillas like a frisbee and not even have the thought go through their mind that it might be racist, kids are stupid and unaware of how others might perceive things
