Start today. I decided to make a change this past summer - when my child turned 10 months old. Here she was, smiling at me, on a beautiful morning, so happy and excited to play - and there I was, hungover and not truly present and able to share her joy. I decided then and there to get my shit together before she was old enough to remember me that way - as a drunk. 

I won’t tell you it’s always easy - it’s not. You may slip up and that’s ok. But make this change for the better - before it affects her life, too. We need to take care of ourselves first so we can take care of our kids. These days, when I don’t drink, it’s for both of us. But at first, it was all for her. You’ll get there, but you have to get some sober time under your belt. Kids, so innocent and unaware of life’s struggles, are the best motivation to make positive strides.
