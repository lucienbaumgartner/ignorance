I’m not talking about profiling and conviction. Those are obviously skewed. Maybe instead of making assumptions of my beliefs, listen to my words to have a better picture painted for it. Im talking strictly about police brutality, which has been proven to not be as skewed as people believe. As for my comment you’ve combed through to find, my points still stands. I am in the side of people protesting for better policing, but I will never condone violence or rioting in response. You say things “that can come back.” Do you realize how close minded and ignorant that sounds? I’m not saying this to deride or demean you, I feel like you have good intentions truly. But many of this places have gone bankrupt, and they won’t come back brand new. Peoples lives being ruined will not come back. This riots have caused 1 billion dollars in damage, which is not something we can simply toss aside like you want to. These are real stakes. If I had your house burned down and lost all your money and possessions, but I was doing it because I’m upset over some form of discrimination in this country, how would you feel about it? Would you be okay with losing everything because it “can all come back?” I’d likely think you would not, and justifiably so. Not supporting violence and destruction doesn’t make you any less sympathetic to a cause.
