&gt;I guess it's from a social good/marketing standpoint, not actual cup quality.

Why jump towards the least obvious conclusion on offer there?  

It's cheap and easy to toss shade at Starbucks, but it's *only* cheap and easy - not particularly worthwhile or substantial.  

The average consumer - specialty or no - is utterly unaware and largely apathetic to what Starbucks pays for its beans, this thread and the responses in it might as well stand in evidence, as do many prior threads in the community.  

Yes, there's some measure of 'social good' in play - they *want* to do good, but if you spend too long in Specialty Circles it's not hard to miss that by and large from the opinion-makers in coffee, those efforts might as well not be happening based on how they're posed to the consumer world. 

They're buying quality.  Not in some cunning right-angle interpretation like rhetorical or marketing value, but literally buying quality, in the same way and for the same reasons that other folks "buy quality" in coffee.
