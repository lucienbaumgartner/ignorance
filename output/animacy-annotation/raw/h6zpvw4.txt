Couple things I want to add. 

1. Emotional calls to Sharlene in middle of the night. Reminds me of Jen S who basically said Nick strung her along for months after breaking up in Paradise (FaceTiming daily and using her for emotional support) until he got the Bach gig. Really seems a pattern for Nick (needing a woman friend for emotional support)x 
2. I’m sure Nick likes Natalie’s personality, but in this interview and in his Instagram stories, he really does seem to treat it as if he’s won some sort of jackpot — a woman this hot with a good personality. I see it on stories all the time too. Makes me cringe because she probably really IS too good for him. Glad his friends told him that. 
3. I hope when she was asking for more of a relationship she said: “you see, what I don’t understand is...why would you make love with me if you weren’t IN love with me.” And “what we are doing is fiancé-type stuff”
4. We had a Nataliejoy insider on here once who said Nick is pretty socially awkward and unaware of how he comes of. Which...yeah.
