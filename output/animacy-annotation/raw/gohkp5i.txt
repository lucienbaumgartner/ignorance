I am from Croatia. Yes, you are right, but it is so unprofessional and ignorant of them. I guarantee that there are a lot of men who suffer from low test and they are not aware what is the cause. They go from ssri to ssri and wait for the right one to start working. There are many of them who probably kill themselves because this is not a way to live. Right now I am on two ssris and I feel worse than before. But ready to take life in my own hands and start with TRT.
