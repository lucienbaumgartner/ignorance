What the fuck are you on about?  Nobody shot you, nobody was “coming in hot” or whatever nonsense you have dreamed up in your head to justify being such an epic failure of a human.  

To get this angry, this quickly, you must be terribly lonely.  I bet if you stepped back, and took a look at the choices you’ve made, you’d see how many friends and members of your family slowly removed themselves from your life because you “hit them with a rocket” after whatever perceived slight bruised your baby soft ego.

You haven’t pissed me off at humanity.  You don’t even inspire anger directed towards you as an individual, I only feel a tiny bit of pity... I can’t imagine you wake up feeling good about yourself, or the day ahead.

You’re a victim, but not in the way you think.  You’re a victim of your own failures.  A victim of your own anger, lack of intelligence and the skewed beliefs in what makes a person strong... you see yourself as powerful and tough, but the world sees you as scared and ignorant.  That won’t change until your attitude does; you’ll wallow in mediocrity your whole life, never making a real connection with anyone.  

I stand by my earlier assessment... nobody will remember you.  You’ll never make a difference in anyone’s life.
