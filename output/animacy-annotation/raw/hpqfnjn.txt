Similar to some older people being ignorant and bigoted. It's not so much age, but the collective environmental influences of those generations. Some of it is also typical developmental milestones. Like...the brain isn't fully developed till 25 so reasoning and risk assessment isn't as strong till that age. On the same side of things, the brain is more likely to atrophy the older you get. So you lose mental and physical abilities you once had.
