If they were hoping to detract from their mistake by pushing to prosecute the person that found the flaw. I think they may have drawn more attention to their misunderstanding of how the mistake was found. Gov Parson's actions should require an investigation into who coded the site and how the SSN's were put into the html source code in the first place. Gov Parson is unaware of what he actually said and may have even opened a huge can of worms for his administration to clean up. You can see him reading straight from the paper given to him from his administration, that alone shows me he has no idea what was written nor what he said on this incident. 

Someone needs to educate Gov Parson's administration on what a "hacker" is by definition. There are good and bad hackers, this reporter's actions would more than likely not fall under any of the definitions of a hacker. Source code is public on all Websites, meaning anyone could view that data freely without "decoding" or needing  authorization to view it. 

This is the disconnect with Policy makes and Technical folks. And that gap needs to be bridged before news conferences like this one are put out to the public. Makes his administration look very unprofessional and unaware of the facts to how the reporter found the info. The Report needs get a finders fee for finding it and reporting it to the correct folks. I hope he countersues them and makes them remember before they start to vilify someone doing the right thing.
