Sounds like you know very little about KSA or how sharing military tech with allied Nations works. Sharing technology is not propping up. “Propping up” gives the impression that if it wasn’t for United States aid and support then Salmans regime would collapse and this is just not the situation it’s also credibly ignorant and American centric pretty much exactly the point that’s being brought up.

Is Salmans regime and oppressive police state that is a strategic ally of the United States yes

Is it depending on the US for control of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reliant on the United States for control No.
