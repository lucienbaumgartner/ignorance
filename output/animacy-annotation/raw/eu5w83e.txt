&gt; And condescending too. You'll have a job at The Verge before you know it.

My reply towards you has been explained above already. You’re unaware and ignorant about the individual and community responsibility when it comes to fact-checking, preferring to conflate it with your disdain towards gaming websites.

That’s a dangerous and extreme way of thinking. It implies that you’re also disdainful and against fact-checking, and that you may be prone to dishonesty. Why else would you react that way? And why else would you react towards me?

Before you attempt to “judge” me, it’s best that you look yourself in the mirror. Simple as that.

Again, be better next time. And, if you have nothing of value or worth to contribute in a discussion or conversation, then what’s the use of you joining one? I doubt you’d be like that in a real-world setting among adults, hence it makes me question why you use the internet as an excuse.

Good day. 👍🏻
