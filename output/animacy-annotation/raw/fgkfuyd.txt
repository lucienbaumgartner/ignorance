I’m not a Democrat (anymore), I’m not a fan of Pete Buttigieg, and yes, I am a supporter of Donald Trump. But this video is repulsive. For this woman to stand there and say “I’ve never heard it” when politely told it is common knowledge...wow. Well then you’re completely unaware and really unintelligent. It makes me wonder what the fuck else you don’t know and yet you vote anyways. Fucking gross.

Democrats like to claim ignorance and stupidity are exclusive to Republicans, but damn do they like to ignore this shit in their ranks.
