This is absurd. 

There is no risk to using condoms.  There’s risk NOT using condoms.  That’s how you get STIs.

And absolutely cannot equate birth control with condoms.  That’s extreme hormone input to women—some get heart palpitations, some get mood swings, some get severe pain—it’s major and absolutely not on the same level.

If you’re so selfish and ignorant, that yeah, I’m on girlfriends side—no sex for you.
