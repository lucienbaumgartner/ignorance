Pardon my ignorance, by passing technique, do you mean the body shape when receiving a pass? Intelligent player always have open body shape when receiving pass so they have the best option to move the ball into opposition dangerous zone. Is this what's lacking in xhaka? If yes, then i believe arteta can help to rectify this on training.

I know xhaka can be a bit slow and unaware of opponent player position, but under arteta he has more composure and pass better (although your analysis still suggest that he still pass to a very limited range thus slowing down the play)
