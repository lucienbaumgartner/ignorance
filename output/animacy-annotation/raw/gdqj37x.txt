I haven't seen or read Harry Potter because I'm not interested in yet another story about a male chosen one and his female companion who's super good at a ton of things but can't be the chosen one since she's, y'know, a girl. I also find it a very depressing and hopeless universe. You're either born a magical superbeing through absolutely no merit of your own or you are doomed to be utterly meaningless and unaware of the awesome amazing world around you.
