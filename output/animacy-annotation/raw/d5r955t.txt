I'll say Council of Nikea. The sudden dismantling of the Librarius is just bizarre, even for the Emperor, and it leads directly to the deaths of tens of thousands of Loyalist astartes when they are unaware and unarmed against the emerging daemonic threat. It also completely removes the Thousand Sons legion, which would have been staunchly Loyalist, and further weakens the Space Wolves, who expend themselves in the sacking and burning of Prospero.

Magnus' little stunt in the Throne Room also didn't help.
