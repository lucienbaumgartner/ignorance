Saitama's way of doing things causes others to react in ways they normally wouldn't react. It hasn't even been shown that most of the B-class would be completely ignorant and dismissive of Fubuki, let alone being capable of shrugging off everything the Fubuki group throws at him from words to physical actions. So to take how the Fubuki group handled Saitama as the norm when most B-class aren't Saitama doesn't feel like an appropriate conclusion. Fubuki's statement is vague. The beating could be anything from just giving him some bruises and hoping the experience would scare him. Considering there are heroes who've lost limbs, yet continued being heroes, Fubuki would have to clear a high bar to truly ensure a hero isn't capable of doing their job anymore. But I doubt Fubuki and the gang even approach the levels of violence such as tearing limbs off like Garou and Melzegard.

The meteor cluster killing no one was confirmed. Fubuki group noobcrushing is confirmed. The details of how prior noobcrushings/recruitments tend to go has nothing confirmed about them.
