I was not trying to present a false dichotomy but rather to posit a value judgement in general terms. More specifically, is it better to be happy and unaware that you will die tomorrow, or be unhappy in the knowledge that you will die?

And what if happiness is derived from the suffering of others? Are sadists and masochists unalloyed to be happy?

Those are the results of people acting on their beliefs in a democratic society where the opposition is insufficiently energized to counter them. The original belief is not at issue, but rather the action to enforce the belief. I don't care what your opinion on birth control is, as long as neither of us forces it on the other.
