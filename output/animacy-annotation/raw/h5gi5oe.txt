I’m not hiding behind autism? What are you on about? You don’t know what I struggle with or not. Awfully bold and ignorant of you to assume I’m “hiding behind it”. Looks like you need to do research on autism as well. It makes perfect sense to *me*, I wouldn’t identify with it if it didn’t. I just literally didn’t know how to *put it into words*, but with the help of reddit I do now. 

My point still stands. Your comment is completely irrelevant to this post I have no idea why you felt the need to reply if you obviously can’t be helpful lmao. Post a question in a non binary sub if you’re so confused 🤷🏽‍♂️
