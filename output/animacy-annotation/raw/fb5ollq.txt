For me it was rock climbing. I was working super hard on a climb that was (for me) quite difficult. Over and over I fell at the crux, or just after because I had no gas left to finish the climb. Then on one attempt, my mind emptied, I moved smoothly to the top, clipped into the anchor, and thought "what the hell just happened?" I had no real recollection of the moves or the effort required to do them. I just remember breathing and not stopping and there I was at the top!

I have had a couple flashes of this in BJJ but am still so new and ignorant that I lack the knowledge or fluidity to get into that state for any useful length of time, at least so far!
