Hi. Im 15 months into this (could be older than that but based on my test results I can traced back). I've been single ever since the diagnosis, but if I ever get to see anyone seriously, I'm definitely disclosing. 

I also have HSV2 and with my last partner. He understood me, we were cautious and did everything to protdct him. He appreciated that too.

I think this was possible largely he new me as a person (about 5 months prior to properly dating each other). So a suggestion from my experience is spending more time with the person you like over a longer period of time to really get to know each other...? (If you haven't tried this approach). 

Thinking back about myself when I was young and ignorant, I think I would have fucked off and ghosted just the same (I was so stupid and unaware of sexual health back then.) 

But like they say, honesty is the best policy and you are doing the right thing to protect others. I play by that policy and I mentally stand by your side. It's totally okay, it's not you ;)
