Yes, I remember the myth. I even learned it from Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor, where the first major boss is Baldr (spelled Beldr in game) himself. You defeat him by finding twig of mistletoe that, like you said, didn't take the vow to not harm him.

Still, to me it looked like Loki had a hissy fit about someone having a very interesting ability that made him the center of attention. Baldr was basically whoring with his body...

Anyway, it's still Loki's fault. Tyr was blind and unaware that the twig he received could kill his brother.

...And then when Hel agreed to revive him if everything in the world had cried for him, Loki disguised as a giantess refused, and voided the agreement.

Anyway, Loki's a dick and everyone knows that.
