&gt; the fact that you avoid to learn about virus and sh*t instead of learning

For christ sakes, the first real worm that was written for "Personal" machines was written before Windows even existed. For the Apple II, of all things.

The only people that would buy a Mac because of some magic ability to defend themselves against virii or malware are just as delusional.

&gt; Also I don't have antivirus

Is that because you've finally learned to not go around clicking every executable possible, or because you're ignorant and unaware that executables and your personal decisions on what to run will make no difference if you are the victim of an exploit, or a developers evolving malicious intent?
