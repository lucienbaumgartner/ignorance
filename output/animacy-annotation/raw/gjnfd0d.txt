I think the main difference for me is that some people truly are ignorant and unaware of certain things being problematic, even if their intention is not bad and they don't mean ill or don't realise the deep problem their words or action can cause.

But lots of people, especially among fans KNOW what is right and what is wrong, especially with how woke kpop fans are and yet choose to behave wrongly against idols.

It's also very different if professionals, like hosts and so on, in the US or western europe, which are multicultural regions are being racist, cause they absolutely know and if people from countries that are mono racial behave problematically. 

I learned to never assume that just because I know or am aware of certain things that everyone around me is on the same level. You say internet exist, but that is if you operate on the internet in english and are concern with mainly american culture. So many people don't really use internet in english and in their native language those topics are simply not brought up.
