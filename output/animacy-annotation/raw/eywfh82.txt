Yes, sex shaming not ok against women, totally ok against men. Better call up the girlfriend to let her know I'm apparently an "incel" so she has to dump me lol. 

You're so annoyed that you are demonstrably wrong and ignorant that you have to resort to empty insults and base bigotry. You are hilariously intellectually stunted.
