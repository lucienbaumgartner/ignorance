This is horrible and he sounds like a self absorbed asshole. People that say these things to their partners usually think of themselves as some prize and that they are so much more aesthetically appealing than the other .

But on the other hand this sounds like my situation with my daughters mother. We tried to make it work for her but the thought of having sex with her absolutely repulsed me. It was a mental thing because we fought so much she was so petty and ignorant and selfish she made me want to kill myself just to be away from her. She accused me of cheating on her because I just stopped touching her let alone initiate sex. One night she damn near rapped me, seriously pulled my pants down in a full fight and try and perform oral, I had to push her down and ran out the apartment and spent the night at a friends house. I went back the next day and broke up with her and then I had to face her vindictive nature for the next 17 years. She made me out to be the villain and she told people I cheated on her with my now wife but it wasnâ€™t the case, I knew my wife before I broke with her, but we were literally associates, not intimate. We just clicked at the right part of our lives and now have been married for 15 years. 

While being a complete ass, I have to ask is the marriage overall in a good place as far as communication or respect. While still being an asshole I would have to think he has a side also. His communication is garbage and he says things he should keep to himself, but there are always 2 sides
