Been married 20+ years.

Sure, I look at other women and find other women attractive.

But, I can honestly say, I never want to have sex with them or really desire to have sex with anybody else.

This oddly has gotten me into "trouble" a couple times because I am totally oblivious and unaware of being flirted with or hit on because my mind just isn't in that head space at all.

Finding someone attractive !== a desire to sleep with them.
