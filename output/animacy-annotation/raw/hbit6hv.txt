As a BIPOC and have been pro vaccination, I strongly disagree with any mandates especially around food or public spaces; back home, many of my fellow friends and people of color are not vaccinated despite availability. The BIPOC community unfortunately has the lowest rate of vaccinations per demographic. I fear that mandate will essentially act as a de facto segregation/denial of service for my community. Also, while itâ€™s neither here nor there, OP is not the best ambassador for encouraging those to get vaccinated, OP comes off as brash, obnoxious and overall fairly illogical and ignorant of all the meta circumstances surrounding this complex and nuanced issue. Much more problematic than beneficial to helping spread the word to encourage my peers to get vaccinated.
