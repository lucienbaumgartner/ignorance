When the weather and warmth are perfect, when you feel the sun on your skin, and you're taking a deep breath of the freshest air. You're standing in a beautiful place where you can almost see no human or man-made artifacts. Looking out over a vast expanse of mountains, trees, lakes, river, animals, birds, clouds, and for just a moment you are entirely at peace.  When you feel the immeasurable size and expanse of everything that isn't part of your life as you--just for a moment--observe some of it continuing on its journey entirely unaware and unaffected by your presence.
