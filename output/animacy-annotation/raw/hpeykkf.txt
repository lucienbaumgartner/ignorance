It's because I love to learn about cultures of the world. People like to say that Americans (estadunidenses) are stupid and ignorant and I really don't identify with that stereotype. I live Brazil most of all and I have spent the last few years learning Portuguese, and I also live close to Mexico so I have always felt that Mexican culture is part of who I am. I love learning languages in general, so to see what the opinions and thought processes of locals around the world is is very enlightening. For example, if I wasn't following this sub then I wouldn't know that most of Latin America doesn't like "latinx" because the people who live here are generally supportive and vocal for it. Being here in this sub makes me feel like I can get a better perspective than in my own country. Thank you for everyone who contributes!
