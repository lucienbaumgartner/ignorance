For lurkers, googled it and terf means either feminists who are hate trans people or people who continue to ask questions about trans people until the answers they receive make sense.  

These groups can not be distinshed between on the surface so any signs of "this doesn't make sense to me" should therefore be assumed to be an attack until the point at which the potential bigot declares unwavering allegiance to the mission of shutting down said questions, in themsleves and in others.

And feminsits who don't hate trans people but who are blunderingly stupid and ignorant of trans issues also count as terfs.  Cos you can't tell a good faith vs a sarcastic "how are you a woman?" from one another so both are equally suspect.
