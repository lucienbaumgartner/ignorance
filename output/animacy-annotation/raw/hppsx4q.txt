The tribes were supposed to be diverse, black, asian, etc. Daniel was also supposed to be asian. But due to the tattoos taking up space and not something you can put on them like 4 did, they couldn't make many different races with them for space and time constraints.

Daniel ending up another white guy also made the whole "white men's burden" thing which follows-chalk's quest doesn't help being named civilized man's burden".

And with daniel and joshua being mormon, and the history mormons had with native americans... Well it just came off as ignorant and racist.
