Honestly the class system is so terrible that it tries to force champs into systems that are incomplete in their ability to fulfill that class type fantasy. Singed labeled as **Mage** not AP Bruiser. Karma as Enchanter rather than Mage, etc...I prefer the older definitions where they grouped definitions such as Karma, Morg, Lux, and **Zyra** labeled as Support Mages. They were intended to provide high instance damage while offering utility.  

The devs are playing a game with Karma mains atm by ignoring any requests of AP Karma. As if Faker, Bjerg, Crown, and many other instances of AP Karma were never intended, but a matter of circumstance. This is not surprising since devs are very much anti-pro due to competitive's overarching reach to the limitations and design capabilities of champions. A case like Viego where his kit is so buggy that he's disabled in pro play. For most of the community, they are unaware and unbothered by this decision. For the devs, they are now faced with future challenges of their designs being limited due to the potentiality of bugs disabling their champs for patches in competitive.  

How this connects back to Karma is in their ways of balancing her. They find no future for "enchanters" aka support mages in solo lanes - due to their tendency to stifle lanes, particularly top. It's not just Karma either hindered by this. Soraka, Sona, Lulu, Janna, and Lux to an intent. So they play the absolute affirmation of support Karma through explicit patch notes specification of role, eternals, data on her, etc... The irony in all this is that they think this absolves them of the failed rework for her, and the inability to balance her according to her original design. Support Karma mains are also kept on hold, and if a rework ever to come to light it would be so mediocre and basic such so in order to keep her prevalence in pro at a minimum.
