&gt; This is true of all health issues then. 

Incorrect. Unless all of the sudden alcoholics are filling up the ER. There could be cases of this though, in say a college town after certain games. Same paradigm happens though. Someone gets less than ideal care. 

&gt; but its not a scenario where hospitals can only save 100 people and we have to decide who "deserves" it. That's not only ethically impossible and morally gross, its a net negative for the health and wellbeing of an entire society.

It happens quite often. 

&gt; I have loved ones with severe autoimmune diseases who can't get vaccinated, and if they caught COVID and were in the ICU right now, they'd be a part of that same statistic.

Then you **of all people** should want as many people vaccinated and out of the hospital as possible. 

It's ignorant and selfish to even try to argue 'the other side of the coin' my goodness.
