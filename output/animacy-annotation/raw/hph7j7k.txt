I feel like I "matured" as a dev the day I finally accepted that readability matters more to me than cleverness, succinctness, etc. And I'll still prefer the succinct option over the verbose option if it's still readable with the goal being requiring as few comment as possible by simply having sensible variable and function names. If I have to explain what I'm doing (note: not why I'm doing it, e.g. backend concerns out of our control lead to wonky frontend code needing explanation) with a paragraph of text, chances are the code isn't readable enough. 

I'd say my quirk is being generally UI-dependent and ignorant of many hotkeys. I still use a mouse a lot for moving my cursor around (with a little use of arrow keys when near where I want to be). I hate using CLIs. I'm sure many other devs would be shocked to watch me actually work, despite any compliments I get for my results in PRs and whatnot.
