Ok I see where you're going. Active camouflage is definitely a technology modern militaries are currently exploring. I don't think it's unreasonable to think an advanced species would have nearly mastered it. I've always thought the argument: "if aliens are here how come we don't have good photos?" -is a poor argument. Conversely, I've also heard "well if aliens are here and hiding it they're doing a bad job obscuring their presence"- referencing all the stories of sightings. I've seen both arguments from skeptics. 

Just looking at it from a purely speculative pov, when human biologists study animals in remote locations they'll often use hunting style blinds and take some precautions to avoid disrupting the natural behavior of animals. Surely some animals would observe the biologists or notice something is out if place but the general animal population of the ecosystem being studied remains undisturbed and unaware of the human presence. In these instances the biologists do not use the entirety of human technology available to completely avoid detection. Instead they just take reasonable cost effective measures to avoid disturbing the natural behavior of the observed population. Perhaps ETs or whatever intelligence was here to observe Earth is doing something similar.
