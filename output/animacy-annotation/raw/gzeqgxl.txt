I am a Smooth brain ape. I have no previous stock experience whatsoever. And I honestly get upset about post like this. YES you are better because you understand the situation better than other people (even though you've probably been here for months). But hold on. have you considered that the people that seem to be asking the same question is a new ape every time? they don't realize the same question has been asked before because news flash! they are new and unaware of the situation. You must not have children otherwise you would be a little more understanding. IT IS OUR DUTY TO GUIDE THE NEW APES INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN ON THEM FOR ASKING QUESTIONS. Sure it's annoying. but you can teach where to look for answers so that next time someone ask one of these question they can answered them as well.

I'm probably gonna get backlash for this rant but APE NO FIGHT APE. Be welcoming instead of hostile like this.
