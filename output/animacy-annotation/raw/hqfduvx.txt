Same reason social security isn't "charity." We all benefit. The alternatively abled are part of the American project, you child. Countless things you use everyday and take for granted that were fought for by the ADA and members of the community and improve all our lives. Automatic doors, escalators, ramps and handrails. Things that you happily use. How completely ignorant and irresponsible of you. You would also through out all the contributions made by members of the disabled/alternatively abled community.
