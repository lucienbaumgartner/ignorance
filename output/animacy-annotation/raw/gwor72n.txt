Yeah adding millions, me getting married and having one kid is not ruining the planet. Is asinine thinking, it’s a defeatist human approach. The last decade we have made huge strides in recycling and renewenable energy. We are finding new species of microbes that eat plastic.  The planet will not cease to exist by my decision to have a child. One single person is not ruining the planet, it’s giant corporations that take all the resources from an area and then dip. Acting like you’re saving the world by not having kids is really stupid and ignorant of the problem at a larger scale.
