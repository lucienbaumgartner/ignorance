Yeah, that first 10-20 seconds after an IV is called the rush.   It can only be felt when iv'ed and the people who think and tell people smoking sniffing plugging is just as good as iv are just retarded and ignorant.

That euphoric rush is the whole reason everyone uses needles. Nobodys just born with a fascination to poke metal into their skin. But when you know the difference is either sniff/smoke and slowly feel it, or iv it and within 2 seconds get that crazy euphoric rush, thats why people dont go back to sniffing it anymore.
