Eh it’s not like you hate Peggy. I’ve been binging it since coming back onto Hulu. 

I think it’s more that she’s so overbearing and ignorant, that she is super grating to normal people (think how Grimes hates Homer).

But you kind of get used to her, they dailed her back later in the show, and if you can look past a lot of her just sheer ignorance, she becomes a lot more funny.

“Hank... the day before Thanksgiving, in my opinion, is the busiest travel day of the year”

One of my favorite ongoing jokes with her, she’s just so oblivious to the fact that it is a common known fact, but she, in her mind, knows this super secret thing that no one else does. It shows because of her musings column she writes, again... she believes she’s sharing this LPTs and shit with people when they’re painfully obvious they are commonly known.
