This is such an ignorant and stupid way to look at things.
There’s indonesia who’ve had 2 female presidents and there’s Saudi arabia who just made women driving legal and then there’s iraq in which you don’t matter if you’re a man or a woman cuz when the bomb hits you’re equally done.
There are nearly 50 muslims countries, which one are you talking about?
And equal rights as which one’s culture?
You want women not to wear hijabs and then they’re equal?
Elaborate.
