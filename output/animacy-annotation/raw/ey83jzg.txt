I actually disagree but not wholeheartedly just on the dose thing. Mushrooms are forgiving to those who are unaware and new comers, there have been plenty of times where people stupidly or nt stupidly ate an absurd amount their first time (Paul Stamets as an example) which incredible things had happened. I also think higher doses are more forgiving than smaller ones because you're not trapped in this weird limbo between kind of tripping and not ready tripping. You have a much better time if you know you're tripping vs being sober, the in between imo is where shit goes "bad". I think if people started with a half quarter it would be most ideal because you get the full experience without it being too "maddening". Just my opinion, but I think newcomers take far too less rather than too much.
