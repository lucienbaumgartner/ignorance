A lot of men will become jealous of your pregnancy and upset that you can't do everything you used to do for them, including sex. And then after the baby is born they are jealous of the baby. It happened to me and pregnancy was HIS idea. He had to go fight for his country for 11 months and I couldn't WAIT for him to leave so he could stop stressing me out. When he got back it was the same old shit and when I realized he was never going to change, about three months later lol, I dumped his ass. I spent the next five years struggling my ass off even though he had 50% custody and 50% of childcare costs covered. And he stressed me out bad the first couple years because he was angry I wouldn't take him back. And then he met his current wife and started chilling out. He's still so selfish and ignorant that I could scream but it's so much better. That experience scarred me for life. No more marriages. No more kids. No more nurturing partner who does more than her share. 

CHOOSE WISELY
