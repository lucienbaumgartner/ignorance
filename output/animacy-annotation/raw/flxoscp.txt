Well, your first statement didn’t say that, it says fuck them they deserve it. 

But also, that’s a false dichotomy. In fact, you could make an argument that the prisoners had no choice in the matter because they are locked up, and by imprisoning them the state has a duty to provide care. That’s the responsibility the state assumes when incarcerating people. Would a prisoner deserve it more than someone who violated the shelter in place order to go to a coronavirus party? 

Your statement is so broad, inflammatory, and ignorant that it hardly is even worth discussing. It’s hateful and unnecessary. Tragedy should bring out the best in us, not divisiveness.
