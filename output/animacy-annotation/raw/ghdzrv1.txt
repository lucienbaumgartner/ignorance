As much as I enjoy the game, the story kind of lost me. Granted my last game before this was Air Combat so I don't know the world as much as the other aces here do, but I found it quite hard to keep track of what country I was fighting for and what was going on. I didn't feel particularly attached to any of the main characters (Princess, Scrap Queen, Harling if we're counting him), and I felt like their actions didn't often make a great deal of sense. Then again, I didn't go into the game expecting a masterful story, so it didn't bother me too much.

Mihaly's a total shit and I like how they took that angle with him. Rivals like Yellow 13 are a personal favourite of mine where two heroes fight on different sides, but Mihaly's justifications for his actions are so selfish and ignorant that it makes him easy to hate.
