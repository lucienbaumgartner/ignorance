I hate those men who are really well built and as a result are painfully unaware and ignorant of literally anyone else around them save those who they feel an interest or connection to. Bonus points if they wear necklaces with some sort of gold or silver insignia. Generally, I dislike most outgoing people because they come off as impolite or disrespectful, though this isnâ€™t always the case.
