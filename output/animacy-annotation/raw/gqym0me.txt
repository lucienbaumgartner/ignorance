When I was younger and unaware of my did to a degree because I was interacting with the others in my head but I did not understand that they are not beings who have their own separate body or had literally passed but stayed in this world as a spirit, had I known I had did, I certainly would have been questioning it a lot more than I am as a young adult even though I just knew it was really bad without the knowledge I have now. I didn't understand why they were always around until I was legally an adult and living with my fiance after I had experiences thanks to an exroommate that my dog and I shared and caused more issues with both of us, including in our mental health as I now have PTSD too. The bullying I went through in elementary school is a massive part of why I have did as I know things went physical at least once and suspect it may have possibly gone sexual as well but there was never any witnesses who reported so without trying to get into the memories my trauma holder has, as we're currently working on trying to help her heal because she is the most traumatized one and the one who needs to heal the most for us to heal as a system, despite final fusion not being a goal, because individually, we're all at different places in our healing, I have no concrete this definitely happened outside of the one incident my mom heard three different stories from me about. That incident resulted in a broken arm and my mom tried to find out what happened but no one was able to tell her what happened because only the bullies and my headmates knew. I have also recently learned that my first split(when my protector was formed) was due to watching 9/11 just 14 days before my 2nd birthday because my dad also around that time was in another state for work and my mom did not know how to help me and despite trying to, she was unable to get me help or the resources to help me with dealing with the emotions I was dealing with or anything else because people kept telling her, she'll be fine only for me 20 years later to disprove everyone who was saying that it wouldn't do any long term harm. Maybe they would have been right if it weren't for the bullies but who knows but I also only got confirmation on that this calendar year so I no longer doubt because a couple of incidents may have been not that bad on their own but combined, all of my experiences while I was under 10 were definitely bad enough to scar a child. Heck, it would even do damage to an adult, especially if my suspicions are correct and I strongly suspect I'm not too far off on at least a few of my suspicions/theories about why we're a system/what we've been through and I think the fact that we've been in therapy since first grade is why we were able to stay a small system as well as had all the clues to figure out we had did in highschool but didn't have the knowledge until a couple of years later.
