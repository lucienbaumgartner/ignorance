I can see you're not interested in any facts I might have to offer here, but with regards to your first point, the 1950s wasn't the turning point you seem to believe. You're placing the blame for a broken education system squarely on the conservative response to desegregation, which is narrow minded and ignorant of the other factors that have contributed to the decline of public education in the US.

With regards to your second line, which is unfairly dismissive and demonstrates poor faith, I will simply say that having studied the comparative history of American education in depth while becoming a teacher, I'd posit that the decline of the American education system really started with the dawn of industrialization, and that basing public education on a factory-like model is the single greatest factor to blame.
