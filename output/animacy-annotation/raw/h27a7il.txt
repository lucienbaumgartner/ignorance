I would INSIST I be tested for and diagnosed with ADHD, because even though 15 is kind of late, it still would have changed the trajectory of my entire life. It’s hard not to feel stupid or lazy when classes are a daily exercise in attention endurance, manic memorization doesn’t work as well as it did in elementary/middle school, and even homework for subjects you *actually LIKE* are just...not getting done. Add in a dash of childhood perfectionism and 2 shots of anxiety, and that cocktail can really crush a person’s confidence and sense of self. 

I’ve been a Mess for over half my life in part due to being undiagnosed and unaware that help was both needed and available. If I’d had medical intervention or even just better coping tools at 15, it would have made a world of difference academically, socially and emotionally.

*Fun! Fact!* Inattentive type ADHD is rarely caught in girls early enough to give us a chance at reaching our potential! Because for a insultingly long time, research and findings basically centered only around presentation in young boys.
