Or.....you're just really Hot and unaware of it.....My cousin she's super hot and I asked her why she never approaches guys she looked at me like I was an alien from mars. Hot women get approached all the time there's no need for them to put in effort is the gist I got from her.

Liked "&gt;Happens that every guy I’ve been on a date with from the app was slightly awkward and an introvert, I don’t mind either of those things though." 

It def is a good place for introverts. Or if you just want to hookup and never meet the person ever again nor risk meeting them at your fav bar and have that awkward stare down contest.
