I think you do need a mother. Clearly you didn't get taught respect, manors, and have a serious lack of care for others. 

There still is a time to be ashamed of being wrong and ignorant. That time is now. You are wrong. You are ignorant. 

You're the one who everyone disagrees with here. 

That makes you wrong.
