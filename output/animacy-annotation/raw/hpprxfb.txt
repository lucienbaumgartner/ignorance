Thanks I appreciate it! Yeah I'm not too worried about those guys honestly, I take none of it personally. Halo is the only game I would ever consider spending money in beyond the retail price, at the end of the day, it's freaking Halo! I would rather be willfully ignorant and happy than take part in this protest and have it tarnish my enjoyment. That's not to say I don't think the prices are a bit steep, more or less that for me, you can't really put a price on the Halo experience. 

Some people aren't into that and that's ok, but if I see something cool in the shop I'm shelling out the money haha.
