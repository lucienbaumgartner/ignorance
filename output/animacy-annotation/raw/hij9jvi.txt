&gt;clutch your pearls about people being mean to Marvel movies

It's comments this dumb and ignorant that disappoints me.  Actually read my comment and not just the part you want to read. You argument is the base definition of a strawman argument and it only shows you want to find a reason to say i'm defending the movie even though I literally say the movie is bad and I made no effort to "defend" (wtf) the movie or disney or mcu or whatever you think i'm "shilling" for.

&gt;I understand Marvel waited 10 years to put gay and non-white people in their movies but it’s just a coincidence that we’ve all had enough, I promise

Again---I'm not saying Marvel should be praised for them finally being inclusive.  I brought that up because of the actual real stories of trolls review bombing.  Not that inclusivity = no criticism.  

instead of just reading what you want, how about reading the comment.  I know everybody is in a rush to be the edgelords here with the quick retort and apparently any comment longer than a sentence is too much for anybody to actually compute so you default to rhetoric.

Anyway, movie is critically bad so keep punching up (?) on that movie.  That's really my entire point of this.  If that is wrong, okay I'm wrong?
