I’m sorry, but that’s complete bullshit. 

Just because the “meaning” was retconned into some warped sense of “southern patriotism” doesn’t excuse its origin and what the fuck it has been utilized as I history and to this day. 

Just because those who identify with it are too willfully ignorant to accept they’re waving a symbol of hatred and rebellion over the ending of human ownership doesn’t excuse them of ridicule for it. It’s 2022, you can’t pretend to be ignorant and proud of it when the information is literally at you’re own fingertips you can objectively research yourself. Unless, obviously those with same argument as a defense are refusing to be objective entirely.
