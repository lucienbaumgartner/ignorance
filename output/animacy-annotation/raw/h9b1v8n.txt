Nothing.  


It sucks, but you can't save everyone, especially those who don't want to be saved. Afghanistan is, and will always be, hopeless.  


As someone who deployed to Afghanistan a decade ago? If you really want to help, vote for politicians who don't use wars, and America's sons and daughter's who fight them, as election year pawns.   


And promote activism--real activism that shakes the state &amp; national government, not Pearl Street. The American public, as a whole, has been apathetic and ignorant of 20 years of war because it's convenient to ignore problems that aren't our own, and it's someone else's son and daughter doing the dirty work 3000 miles away. The Boulder bubble encourages this imo.
