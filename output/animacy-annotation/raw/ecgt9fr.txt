* Considering the coworker doesn't live or work in your city and walked by your house and smiled at you, did you not say hello? Ask why she's in town?
* How do you know she was there two days in a row?
* What was his reply to her asking why he left her out in the rain "like that"?

There is not enough info in this story, but judging by what you've shared, if I had to jump to a conclusion it would be that they're fucking behind your back and he's lying to you. How convenient that you tend to go away two nights per week, and that co-worker comes into this random town, and has the nerve to seemingly deliberatly catch your eye and not give a damn!? My guess is they are planning to be together. 

While it's *possible* she's a stalker who entered your house while your boyfriend was unaware and asleep—that's a bit farfetched of an idea, right? Not the most likely answer—The easiest/obvious/straight line answer is usually the more probable one. He's cheating, and she was on the couch. OR... your boyfriend is gaslighting you and put perfume on that section of the couch to drive you crazy and cause a problem, so that eventually you break up with him, and he gets to be with "crazy" coworker.
