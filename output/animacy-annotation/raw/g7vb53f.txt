Probably gonna get down voted for saying this, but, I actually feel sorry for him. Imagine being so self centered, stubborn and ignorant that you make yourself suffer so you can just keep up appearances! 

No one should have to suffer from this horrible disease, and it genuinely upsets me how more concerned he is over eagerly wanting to win the next election, that he forces himself to not be receiving the medical care he greatly and obviously needs.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if he dies from Covid and it will be his own damn fault...

I understand he isn't exactly a nice person, but he has kids and a wife that are watching him suffer, watching him doing this to himself and.. well.. that's gotta be heartbreaking.

I hope he smartens up sooner than later, but I realise that is probably not going to happen.

He will keep on suffering and infecting others, all for a stupid bloody political election.
 
Ridiculous...
