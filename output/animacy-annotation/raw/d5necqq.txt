Okay so a teenager who was born in poverty and whose parents might be collecting welfare is a parasite? A couple who couldn't afford to go to college and thus struggle to make ends meet and take up welfare are also parasites? A single mom who had her husband walk out on her while she has kids to take care of is also a parasite? 

Tell me more about how you in your wealthy background had to go through such hardship to ensure you aren't on welfare even though that was never a worry for you since your parents and mom's family are "filthy rich". You are a piece of shit to the core because you fail to recognize the privileges you were given at birth which many other people do not have or share, and you call them parasites and something lower than you simply because they got shafted in the lottery of life unlike you. 

You are every bit unthoughtful and unaware and stop calling yourself a libertarian because you have no understanding or respect for the entire point of the philosophy.
