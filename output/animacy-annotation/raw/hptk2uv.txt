I think the US seriously has some big misunderstanding of what right and left means, when you’re right, you’re not a Nazi you simply support capitalism, freedom etc. that doesn’t mean you hate equality. When you’re left you support the idea of communism and mostly put equality above freedom but that also doesn’t mean you don’t support freedom. Far left is not good, far right is not good being right or left in general is just a political stance with different view that factually aren’t bad or good. The problem I’ve come to see is that this subreddit is far left which is an extreme and extremes are never good. Being right isn’t denial of science there is no causality between these 2. When you say people are denying science that is because of religion and not because of your political opinion. This sub and the US don’t understand what right and left means. Y’all simply associate right with being a redneck conservative and left with being a perfect progressive person without any moral issues. Both sides have valid points, it’s ignorant and narcissistic to say otherwise so the best way would be to find a compromise and place yourself more in the center than on the far right or far left!
