People are ignorant. Now is as good a time as ever to be alive for an infant. Infants rarely get seriously ill from covid 19, especially if breastfed. Children also don't start remembering things till about age 3 so by time that happens, we will have either some herd immunity or a mostly safe vaccine and the world will have regained some bit of normalcy. Until then our babies will be very loved by their closest family and because of that will be blissfully happy and unaware of all the chaos in the world.
