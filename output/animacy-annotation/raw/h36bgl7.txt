&gt;Bhagat Singh cut his hair and renounced Sikhi, so not sure what Sikh values have to do with it.

You googled the wrong guy lmao Bhagat Singht Thind never renounced Sikhi and continued to wear Dastar and perhaps even keep the Khalsa so Sikh value have a lot to do with it.

\&gt;. Of course he had to side white White supremacists and the racist laws because they were the lawmakers and the laws?

&amp;#x200B;

Ridiculous assertion that is antithetical to history. If everyone sided with white supremacists and racist laws we'd still have chattel slavery today... People fight against such things because opinions and ways of thinking exist in society... he chose to not fight against injustice but instead align with the racists. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Like? Are you out there fighting police one v one? Have you ever called them after a car accident? Are you siding with them or are you just existing in society today the way it was built?

&amp;#x200B;

What are you even talking about anymore? You're having a conversation with yourself I imagine cause this has no relation to what i'm talking about. Nothing you said is relevant to what I'm talking about and it's also a foolish argument you can critique something in society and still use it. You're very much this meme [https://i.imgur.com/5FiWitX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5FiWitX.jpg)

\&gt;This tendency towards utopianism is self defeating.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; A lesson every person who thinks they're politically active and "on the right side of history" is going to learn eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

Saying that agreeing with baked in legitimate racism in legislature and the racist and completely unscientific miscegenation laws is Utopianism is quite rich and ignorant of the very real and active progressive movements around at the time and centuries before this lmao perhaps research history before so confidently making such assertions.
