That's because you can't fight authoritarianism and corruption by giving whoever's in charge more power to subdue those not-in-charge. As you note, centralising power just makes it easier for a corrupt administration to shore up its own power if/when it gets in. It's like trying to achieve peace and harmony by bombing the other guy harder and occupying his homeland, which directly causes insurgency and escalates the total amount of violence going on.

Instead of addressing the symptoms you have to address the *causes*; fix education, teach critical thinking, change the law so it's harder to spread misinformation (don't infringe freedom of speech, but require things like equal-prominence corrections, the fairness doctrine, clear labelling and separation of factual vs. opinion programs, etc), remove or reduce the influence of money in politics (Citizens United decision, etc), sharply curtail lobbying (or just make it *really* transparent, so everyone knows who's funding who), etc.

Yes it'll be hard (it's never easy to climb back up a decades-long slippery slope) and yes it'll be controversial (but not nearly as controversial as simply banning or criminalising certain specific opinions), but it also actually addresses the root cause of the problem with America; that the people - the ultimate check and balance against tyranny - are so corrupt and ignorant that they won't vote against obviously corrupt and ignorant representatives.
