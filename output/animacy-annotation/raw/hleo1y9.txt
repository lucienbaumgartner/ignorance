Point of order; there are 3 diagnoses that correspond to multiplicity(DID, DDNOS, and OSDD).

There are other, non-disordered types, generally under the umbrella of multiplicity/plurality.

This umbrella includes persons aware and unaware of eachother, who may or may not share memories or skills, who may or may not control who is fronting, and who may or may not merge and split regularly.
