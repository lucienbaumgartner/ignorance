Do you read what i am writing? Or your head is just focus on being against me. What isn’t true in what i am saying? Being from Switzerland meens that i know that here you pay for everything more than i other countrys and the same with the bank account for holding it you pay. That is all fine but then i want quality for it! And not an error while unstaking my fucking tokens! An ATM never did a mistake and gave me my money, Swissborg does it and people have than trust in it, that they say „i“ certainly made a mistake certainly pressing on the wrong button? Who thinks that, is just stupid and ignorant of reality. It would be better to tell your self OK that could happen and be aware of. But any way i am stopping here, do what ever you want anyway.
