&gt;b) people organizing protests can be held liable for the crimes of third parties that occur at the protests, regardless of their own intent in planning the protest or their lack of involvement in the crimes.

About this part....IANAL, but wondering how would it apply to the current trend of y'all queda brigades crowding roadways and more specifically trying to run Biden's campaign bus off the road? If one of these drivers caused a collision that resulted in injury/death of another, could the whole group be tried for vehicular manslaughter/homicide (since there appears to be some intent with these groups)? Or, even on a smaller scale, could they all be given the same traffic ticket for speeding or ignoring whatever other laws - if one is under the influence, could they all get DUIs?

Asshole-ry aside, seems like a terrible precedent to have set.

Not to mention it feels like it is attempting to stifle freedom of speech. If I have to worry about the actions of others while I peacefully demonstrate then that would likely cause second thoughts about any form of demonstration. Aggressive agitators could come in and cause trouble, flee, then unaware and peaceful protestors get stuck with the charge? Fuck that!
