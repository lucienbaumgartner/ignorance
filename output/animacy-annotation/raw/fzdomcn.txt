Went to a high class restaurant with my family, I took my good friend along with me. She isn't really living the best life money wise, so, I decided to take her. When we got in she ordered the fanciest steak on the menu and when she had it handed to he, she took a bite and loudly said "You call this shit food? God, you rich people are so idiotic and ignorant that you can't even eat good food, I'm out of here" She didn't even try to pay for that expensive meal. Turns out nothing was wrong with the steak, she had been eating sour stuff earlier which affected her taste. I don't talk to her anymore.
