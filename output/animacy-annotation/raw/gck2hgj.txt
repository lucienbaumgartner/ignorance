This isn't special of black America. Minorities of all kinds across the globe experience this exact thing. They're held down by a system that encourages them to behave in ways that keep THEMSELVES down. Everyone else is ten steps ahead. They grew up educated for generations. The way they grow up, with therapy and textbooks and the latest research, that's what puts them on the right track. Their parents' parents' parents have been well off in the most basic ways that minorities aren't: education, SLEEP, FREE TIME, healthy diets, healthy relationships, healthy hobbies. The list goes on. That's what makes a "minority" a "minority." 

And ultimately it's being uneducated and ignorant that make homophobia. The same is true of racism, sexual abuse and rape and victim blaming, crime, etc.
