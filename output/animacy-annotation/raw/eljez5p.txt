Yes, this.

P.S. It is always cringe to read or listen to those, who mention that they study psychology a little bit, to give more weight to their words, because they compensate their inner insecurity through covering it under the mask of a trusted doctor, who, in fact, just legalises his arrogance by naming himself with this status. If you read especially this case, you will notice his subconscious attempts to place himself over those, who usually had rejected him, so he tried to understand their reasons but avoided the thought of feeling himself miserable by calling them all easy, simple and ignorant. That is quite easy to notice if you watched "Lie to me" and read psychology books, like I did. /s
