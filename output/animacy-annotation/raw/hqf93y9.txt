Lol you don't understand the pettiness and ego-driven decision making that's in the DNA of every cop. You think she'll be able to just walk down to the station and ask nicely for her property back? 


Even when proven wrong, cops will refuse to cooperate (ironic right?) or admit wrongdoing just for the principles of there own egos not being damaged in the slightest.


Either you're very ignorant and possibly optimistic, or you just love sucking off that pathetic blue line bullshit. I hope it's the former.
