Do you know how many x-rays of children are taken every single year? Hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Do you know how many of those patients are innocent and unaware that the photoelectric absorption rate of their bones is being used by *pedophiles??* All of them.

Frankly I'm appalled that America isn't doing more to combat this. I mean, how could this have gone unnoticed for so long? It's in the *name* of the ray! "X-Ray!" Why couldn't they have used Y-Rays? Disgusting the lengths that child molesters will go through to corrupt our children.

This is just another reason why we should be mandating that our children wear lead underwear at all times, and refrain from allowing them near an X-Ray, UV light, or even ultrasound until they're at least 18 years old. Preferably 21.
