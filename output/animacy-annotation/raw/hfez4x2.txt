Hello friends!

Number 7 here, The Lost Aether Compass. 

This book has definitely been inspired by stealth video games, particularly Dishonored, with a corrupt world run by a secret society and Void given powers. I want reading it to feel like a stealth game in parts, with random horror sequences, fast paced prose and lots of action. 

My characters are deeply flawed and unaware of their powers in the beginning and of how the world works. You wonâ€™t find any info dumping, but a gentle weave of information. There is a lot of a talk about alternate dimensions throughout the book because my main character gains the ability to walk between dimensions and travel anywhere in our world and others, using that to become the greatest thief/vigilante in the world, but only after she walks the labyrinth and gains the power (midpoint). So there is a huge emphasis on character growth, humor, ride or die friendships, with insane personal stakes, mystery and a bit of romance. 

You can definitely sense my fascination with archeology in here too. With huge sections spent exploring crypts, tunnels, with a labyrinth at the midpoint, and a race between several planes of dimensions at the end. A lot happens in this book. 

Check out my first chapter: Voices in the Void (word count 5600)
