Ah that’s hardly the point. I agree the military worship in America is over the top. And clearly more Irish people die working on building sites than working for the US military, because there’s almost no Irish people working for the US military. My point was that it seems like a stretch to say you’re more likely to get killed while working on a building site than for the US military. When we’re talking about veterans discounts, you’re talking about lads who fought in wars like the Vietnam war where 60,000 US troops were killed. Loads of those guys were conscripted and treated terribly by their country. 

Again, above scenario is obviously ridiculous and ignorant of your one to come looking for a military discount in a foreign country. I just don’t think it’s fair to make out like US veterans haven’t had a dangerous occupation (whether the wars are justified is completely besides the point).
