My point was these sort of in-theatre sneak shots understandably breed mistrust towards the medical profession. Even if theirs is their own 'fault' it is absolutely no excuse for violating someone's privacy in a situation where they should expect it.

The person is in a vulnerable state, you can't consent or object when you are unconscious and unaware that you're being mocked by your 'caregivers'...
