There’s actually quite a few illnesses that can be transmitted between mammals, it’s just most of them tend to be fairly innocuous for most species. The problem is the more they’re transmitted the more likely they are to mutate and the more likely you are to end up with something not so innocuous. There’s actually entire labs dedicated to studying and attempting to prevent exactly that sort of transmission. Beyond that I agree with the rest of what your saying for the most part, and my point was not that this one fox was likely endangered here, because your right it probably wasn’t. My point was that overall we as humans should avoid interacting with wildlife when possible for a multitude of reasons. There are many things that can be done to try to preserve our natural ecosystems and many of them boil down to reducing human interference as much as possible. The sad fact is there are shitty people in this world, and there are also just misinformed and ignorant people. We can’t control what the shitty people do, but we can educate the misinformed and ignorant. That was my point in mentioning that it’s best to avoid interacting with wildlife, not only for their safety but ours as well.
