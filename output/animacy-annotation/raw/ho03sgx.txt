I understand you, but i think you are mixing terms. 

Violence. Fighting. Combat. Attack. Murder. Assasination.

They are not synonimus, they are different words that represent different actions in the world.

Assasination as the premeditated and often paid action of killing another creature without the chance of defending itself is inherently evil for 2 main reasons:

1) other creature is unaware and helpless; even if they react, they were heavily hurted in advance which give you a huge advantage on the subsequent fight

&amp;#x200B;

2) there is a goal behind this act which is not related to selfdefense, because the natura of premeditation of this act.

&amp;#x200B;

There are another forms of violence which are not inherently evil, but assasination is.
