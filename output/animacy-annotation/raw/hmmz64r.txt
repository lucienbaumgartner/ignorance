I was there when they rugged the ‘v1’ token, and it was 100% it happened. I assume most here didn’t know about that. I learned some lessons too though I lost almost nothing on V1 (as soon as I hear a dev say ‘I have to go to the doctor’ during launch I sold immediately at almost zero loss lol). 

One is that some people were saying in telegram the team was a know scam team. I dismissed it as fud (and still technically don’t know they had a history), but should take claims like that more seriously. Hell even on here I was posting I knew this team scammed this literally token weeks ago, and I’m sure some dismissed as fud. 

The other is this team did a really good job hiding their initial rug. Banning people on telegram. Having little other social media presence for people to alert the scam (that knew). It hard to rug a token, relaunch, and fool new people because they couldn’t find out. But the takeaway is any token that has such a small social media presence, and lack of information sharing, is probably hiding something. It was sure frustrating for me watching people hype this (and being banned from their telegram lol) knowing they were unaware, and even worse for those who lost money
