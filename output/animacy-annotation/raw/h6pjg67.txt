I've seen some of your posts before, and you're way more educated on history than I am so I'll give way to you.

Obviously there are rarely identical reoccurrences in history (literally cyclical to the point of being identical copies) but, as you say, a set of conditions that generally results in similar outcomes.

My memory is hazy on the book but it tended to focus on the theme of:

- great societies came about by asserting their dominance via the sword (for example, the Arabs exploding out of the Arabian peninsula and coming to dominate the complacent Middle East, despite the Arabian peninsula being a relative backwater)

- they reach a crescendo of power (once there is, for example, no more drive to expand). Martial strength is praised and held in high regard by these societies

- peripheral powers eventually rise up and bring about the downfall of the dominating power, the dominant powers having become too introspective and ignorant of the dangers on their frontiers

Obviously this is very loose but I find this pattern of history to be quite striking and it is a decent framework for looking at this kind of thing, imo
