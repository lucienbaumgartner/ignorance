So you’re telling me to be complacent and ignorant of any problems? (According to your toilet water logic by the way.)

A consumer asking a company’s product to be slightly better is entitlement? You say complaining isn’t going to do anything so you’re telling me to just be ignorant? That’s just dumb. Because no problem will be solved that way either.
