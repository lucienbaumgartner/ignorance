From what I’ve gathered, loads of them aren’t even  very medically trained for educated. They wear the medical looking outfit as part of the medical staff uniform, but that’s about it. 

It’s still baffling to me, to work in a field and be proactively blind and ignorant.. that is like being a mechanic that refuses to use motor oil to fill the engine, because they heard your back-up camera will stop working.. or something totally unrelated.

And there is no doubt a large group did actually get vaccinated but hides it to stay employed. but then again social media and news shows the loudest idiots.
