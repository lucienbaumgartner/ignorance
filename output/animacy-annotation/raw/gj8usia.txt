So I went online to look at reviews of Done.  I came across this and wanted to share my experience.  It seems to be the same story, over and over, and my experience is no different.  I signed up and had my appointment, the doctor was really helpful.  My script went through to the pharmacy that night and I picked it up the next day.  Adderall 10mg/twice a day (I see a lot of people have been prescribed this).  That was a month ago and now I'm having a hard time getting an appointment scheduled to see a doctor about changing the medication. The customer service people respond to my emails but are completely useless and unaware of all the issues I have.  The website is a complete blank when I log in, yet they keep telling me to access the website for refills and appointments.  I just got my first months membership fee waived for the trouble.  But to tell you the truth, I have dealt with a lot of the same crap for treatment in the past; High turn over rate of doctors, bragging about their exceptional care for clients and then getting shuffled through like cattle or ignored completely. You're just another number in a stack of papers with many others.  I tried this route because why not?  Atleast I didn't have to put on pants to go get ignored in someone's office. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
