Except the people that supposedly understand the Bible seem to be behind the so called worldly liberalism. 

Plus, the argument is super simplistic and ignorant of reality. You can be liberal and Christian, so it’s still such a varied understanding and perception of morality as the so called “world” anyway. It’s merely a viewpoint, and can parsed through another. 

Another things is still the objective/subjective view of morality you keep arguing. Even if there is an objective reality, we like Paul only see it through a glass darkly. All we are left with the glimpses of God and Their love that we notice (a lot of time with some degree of misunderstanding). All of our parsed through that subjectively (especially when discussing how to live it out).
