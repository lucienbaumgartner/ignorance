NTA 

Your grandmother was rude, dismissive, and ignorant. That is why your parents are fighting with her. She was totally in the wrong, and treated you abominably. Your parents need to let her know what she did was wrong, and why it wasn't ok, and not to do that ever again.

When someone, even their parent, your grandparent, isn't behaving well towards your child it is a parent's job to correct the behavior.

Don't feel guilty at all. Be proud of your accomplishments! Congratulations on your new school! I wish you success! Let your parents handle grandmother.
