I want to just put this one down and walk away, but the fact that you've already been to r/aznidentity means that if someone as ideologically independent as me doesn't talk to you, you're just going to slide further and further down the extremist hole.

1. Yes, there are ignorant and racist Chinese people in the world. That is not all Chinese people.

2. Whether or not other people are racist and ignorant, that does not give you license to be racist and ignorant. If you think you are truly superior to "racist and ignorant" Chinese, then you have to make an effort to be less racist and less ignorant. That means informing yourself, and keeping your prejudices in check until you can form a more educated opinion. One of the most helpful things for me to learn about Chinese people was living with them and visiting their country, both things that improved my opinion of them.

3. The fact that there are some Chinese people who really respect your culture means that at least some Chinese are people with a moral high ground on you. So you can't logically defend your position of being superior to all Chinese. At best, you can only put yourself on equal morality to your average Chinese who just listens to gossip or CCTV news and pegs their mindset without consulting intellectual sources of information.

4. Although often blinded to the reality of the world, Chinese people are still *really* smart. I once had a guy go off on me about how bullshit it is that Taiwanese feel superior, despite a number of sociological, economic, and historic reasons why they are at best more fortunate, but not inherently superior to mainland Chinese. His logic was tight, everything checked out from what I learned in my graduate-level studies (courses I took while studying for my BAs) on Asian relations and political history. He might have been a nationalist, but he had good figures backing up his nationalism. You don't.
