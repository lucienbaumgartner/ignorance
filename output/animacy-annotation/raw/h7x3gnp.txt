&gt;I get what the op is expressing in his post.

Evidence of our discussion suggests otherwise. First thing you did was respond to a strawman and it hasn't got much better from there. 

Your responses to his specific examples of deception (which weren't even a part of your original response) seem to be flippant and ignorant of the context. (eg: "Well *I* can follow gods law, it's not so hard" in response to God literally admitting he gave crappy laws that couldn't be lived by)

&gt;I'm disagreeing about that's what it means. 

You weren't really addressing the points at all.

&gt;You nor[sic] know anything about reading I guess? 

You should really double check your spelling and grammar when you insult others reading ability. 

&gt;Why do you struggle with so hard with what's being expressed? 

Irony overload.

&gt;I'm done with this conversation your what what ever logic is beyond my understanding

Is it just my crappy reading ability or did you just type 'what' twice? lol. Perhaps the problem is the way you communicate your thoughts to text? Food for thought.

All the best to you.
