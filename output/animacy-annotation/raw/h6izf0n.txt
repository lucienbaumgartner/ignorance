&gt;It's funny how quick some fairweather fans are to jump ship on an otherwise elite talent because of one piss-poor performance. He's been pretty consistently elite.

WHAT?! I don't think I could possibly disagree with you more.
He blew his 3rd save in a row, and the fanbase had horrifying flashbacks to 2019, where he put up a 5.59 ERA, a 1.379 WHIP, 26 saves, and 7 blown saves. Your comment is incorrect and ignorant of reality, Mets fans have every right to fear this dude's dark side.
