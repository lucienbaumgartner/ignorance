All good, I appreciate the kind approach to the answer. I never played E7 so I was unaware, and many highlighted how it has a selector once you get in. Even then, just from my gacha experience giving a selector out of the gate still is uncommon from my perspective. Azur lane, Girls Frontline, Blue Archive, Arknights, Alchemy Stars all ride the high percentage SSR rates, so you are stuck rerolling as a F2P until you get who you want. 

I just feel the ability to choose your ssr out of the gate with no special event time constraint is something worth noting.
