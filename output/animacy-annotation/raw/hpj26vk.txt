No one is standing there with a gun to their head forcing them to drink it.  I'm getting damn tired of coddling the willfully ignorant and blatantly stupid.  If they want to poison themselves who am I to talk them out of it?  There's no sense prolonging the inevitable and giving them more opportunities to drag us down with them.
