All of the above man. 

Not enough beds.
Ignorant and apathetic administrators and corporate decision makers.
Nurses who are tired, burned out, and fed up risking their license for little pay. Or just tired of risking their license and livelihood over abysmal and dangerous working conditions. Nurses are the scapegoat whenever anything goes wrong.
