&gt;!I found a shard that named her Agent Orange and said she was still undercover and unaware of her memories being manipulated so I'd say she is more then what she says. Would explain Jefferson's paranoia over her after you tell him. He suspects her. Also the fact that after you chase the Van and deal with the Mealstrom, on the rooftop there's an AV thats camouflaged by light refractive optics. Makes you know rhere's a lot more to this!&lt;
