This is NOT representation for females. This is representation for trans women. She is not female, and that headline is pure clickbait. She is a woman, and her achievements are impressive and awesome, but pretending that this is an achievement for the female sex is baffling and ignorant (and disrespectful to her). 

If you were to separate this out by sex she is male. By gender, she is a woman.
