That's an interesting take on ME4. Definitely the easiest way for them to continue on from 'Destroy'. I feel if you tweaked a few details, you could still make 'Synthesis' work. The ending makes it seem like its the ultimate peace that will never ever ever end, but they could still make it about the individual races, as well as some new ones. Each race gets a msssive technological boost still, but now we have a chance to interact with all the various species in a whole new light. The concept of militaries and mercenaries could either still be prevalent or be a concept that's becoming lost, brand new species from various unexplored systems can now be introduced and have to either contend with the fact that they were forced into 'Synthesis' without their knowledge or just the classic "We are new and unaware of things" story, and having The Reapers still be alive and also synthesized could lead to some brilliant storytelling.

I have faith BioWare can make a compelling story out of all three endings, but if we need to have a sequel, I just wish it were still off of the most interesting one. I understand that BioWare has not had good times recently and continuing Shepard's story would be massive for them, but this could be an opportunity similar to Andromeda but with more emotional weight. You're not just some random people now, you're the legacy of the greatest heroes of the universe, the ones who did the impossible and merged organic and synthetic life. Thats a massive shadow to have to crawl out from under, but it would make such a good story.

Additionally, I think it could be pretty neat to have a prequel. I know prequels are not very popular, but The Milky Way has a lot of really interesting history. It could be interesting to relive it
