&gt;If you lost then your   
&gt;  
&gt;entire  
&gt;  
&gt; team - you included - simply did not play as well as the enemy's entire team

So when I have a jungler that steals farm from laners and people going 3 top, what am I meant to do?  


What am I meant to do when I have team mates that dive 1 v 3 into the enemy goal and die?   


Its unfair and ignorant of you to place blame on people when there are instances when it ISN'T their fault. People have vented and complained about things because they actually happen.
