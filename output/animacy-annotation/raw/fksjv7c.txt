It's an unprecedented global emergency. I think the US population is surprisingly cooperative right now and understands the seriousness. I'm willing to bet many people saying that are actually scared to get sick too and would never act like that.

 There's no reason to break the rules and go out when there's nothing open and no one else out. You'd be ostracized by the community for being so selfish and ignorant that you'd be willing to risk public health as well as your family and yours. 

We may be the land of the "free" but we also have a brutally giant police force present. We gave them power to take action and answer later with the government on their side so most people are rightfully careful not to put themselves as the enemy of the law. I can't fathom what reason anyone could have to risk spreading this virus and enduring the consequences.

I sympathize your frustration and anger, I'm extremely upset about the shortage of absolutely vital medical equipment which has also effected hospitals. But mandatory lockdown for public safety is a last resort for our government and their just as effected as us. Measures taken to stop this virus are good. The good news is it seems like many states are working to help get everyone financial assistance asap, at least I know my state's governer (MA) is fighting for it.
