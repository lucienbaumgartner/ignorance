Yes it is legal and valid proof that you are 21. I would say it's definitely worth it to get a horizontal ID though. It will save you some hassle from unaware and paranoid bartenders. The penalty for serving someone underage can be pretty harsh in Ohio and a bartender who's unsure would rather refuse service/lose your tip than lose their job.

Assuming your ID is legit, I would definitely serve you though. I'm familiar with both Ohio liquor laws and ID policies.
