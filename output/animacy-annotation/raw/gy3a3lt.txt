Yes, we’re strict like that :P but the safety of Singapore also means that Singaporeans are so spoilt, pampered and unaware of potential dangers overseas. I went to the US for an exchange and I had to remind myself not to leave my valuables unattended on a table outside, even if I’m just a few feet away from it. My US friend almost choked when I told her that we regularly leave our laptops, bags and wallets unattended on tables in school back in Singapore 😐
