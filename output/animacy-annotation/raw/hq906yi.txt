I found out about this from a That Chapter episode. One of the photos of his money transactions had one that read, “To: Sylvia (you’ll tell me your real name some day)”

🤮🤮

As a stripper, the worst people are the ones that think knowing your real name is the key to something that will lead straight to your heart (or let’s be real, vagina). It’s sadly normal for them to ask, “Is that your REAL name” immediately after the initial name exchange greeting. They’re so egotistical and ignorant that they don’t care about your safety at all or even think to realize why stage names are standard. It’s so creepy if they learn my name off hand or search for it immediately how they’ll get this sparkle in their eyes and mutter it under their breath to themselves as if knowing what your actual first name is means you want them to be your partner now. 

This case alone shows you why stage names are so important. Because you get needy narcissistic pychos who will kill even their own families to keep contacting you.
