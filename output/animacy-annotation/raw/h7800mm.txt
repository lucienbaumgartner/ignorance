Be prepared for accidental destruction. Theyâ€™re clumsy and unaware of how big they are and will run into things and break things with their tails. They love attention and can be wonderful cuddle bugs so I recommend a lot of affection (if permitted). Be consistent with feeding and remember that twisted stomach and hip dysplasia are major risks to Danes. Most of all, enjoy your new friend!
