My blood boils just reading this lol I’m 6’3”, 27 and I can usually laugh off or ignore comments but in a doctors office?! By a professional at work?!

People are so unaware and inappropriate it’s crazy. I think as tall women we have a really unique perspective into this. Most other abnormal (idk a better word for it) obvious characteristics on people go uncommented on but for some reason height is totally “okay” to constantly harass people on.
