What blows my mind is how frequently the post refers to Martin's comments as "angry" when they are neutral, or "a rant" when it's one tweet. 

Bitch please. My most popular tweetstorm was _112 tweets long_. (got about 1/2 mil total impressions. I don't know what an impression is but not bad for someone with like 150 followers). That's a fuckin' rant. 

His response to the craftsmanship comment is perfect, too:

&gt; Complaining about “craftsman” as a word is petty and ignorant of the English language.

If I was in his position I would not be nearly as polite about a woman who makes probably a quarter million dollars a year who was accusing me of oppressing her because of word choice.
