Pratchett wasn't a TERF. lol 

Literally, this entire story is about TERFS trying to posthumously claim Pratchett as someone who would agree with them, despite the man displaying nothing but love and empathy for all of life's underdogs when he was alive. 

Oddly enough, it is helped along by people who are so fucking stupid and unaware of the man's work that they actually HELP THE TERFS BY BELIEVING THEM. 

So, well done, you are now on the side of the filthy lying TERFS. If I were you, I would work HARD on being less of a reactive tool.
