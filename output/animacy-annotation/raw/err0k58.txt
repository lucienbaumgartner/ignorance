The fact you think a college degree basically transforms 'dumb/bad' people into 'smart/good' people is so incredibly misguided and ignorant that it lacks a proper response. You're either too young to know better, or you actually went to college and you're trying to justify the debt, regret, etc. Either way, good luck in life.
