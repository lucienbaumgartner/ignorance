Yeah I agree, we should expect an entire CULTURE to give up PART OF THEIR CULTURE. 

Pretty modern if I do say myself. How about we ask all the black people of the world to stop complaining about the white man slavery. Or how about we ask the Christians to give up Christmas. 

Lets even ask the Jews to stop harping on the holocaust.

I can't tell you're a troll or actually this ignorant and moronic. Yes let's ask a culture to give up their culture...like that's never caused any wars or genocides.
