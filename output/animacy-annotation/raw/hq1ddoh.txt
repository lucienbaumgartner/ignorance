I would only like to say that the amount you posted, to me, does more than well enough to prove that this is something that is just as worthy of discussion and re-investigation as I first mentioned. 

&gt; Life which has no systems by which it could be aware of those things, much less systems by which it could become aware of its own awareness.

See, I don't have a problem with that. I have a problem with the inherent bias of living things trying to draw the line on where it stops and starts AND the inherent bias of believing that the universe, and its capacity, is able to entirely sensed by us. 

Wasn't that long ago we realized there were colors we just couldn't see. 

I don't see why your so stuck on what's been defined by science, when science is CONSTANTLY redefining. 

I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm saying I believe GREATLY that our idea of life, consciousness, and, (even though I wasn't speaking on it), self-awareness are supremely ignorant and human biased; stupidly so. 


Not long ago, I feel like it would have been very hard to make someone understand that our definition of time and space are completely redundant in a grand scope. 

If we weren't so ignorant, we wouldn't have made 2 words to describe what is essentially the same exact thing. 

So, I'm not seeing why you have a hard time accepting the thought project. I really don't.
