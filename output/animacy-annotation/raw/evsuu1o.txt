I think the Bible is the story of creation and Christ as written by men. The morals and context of the time poison it.

The Bible is a set of stories handed down throughout time to describe the world as it is known, and establish the earliest law and morals. Many were imperfect, if not outright terrible. 

Others are the tenets of modern, secular, western morality.

When I read about slavery in the Bible, I also think of Paul calling government a part of God - my belief is that this was written to ensure he was not viewed as a threat to Rome as he traveled around the Aegean Sea. 

I was agnostic for a long time, but the words of Christ, which opposed human nature, brought me around. People talk about being forgiven, but teaching me to forgive others has literally saved my soul. 

Jesus was a liberal, but not a politico. He let Caesar have his own money, but He never told his apostles to push for Caesar to feed the poor. He was not a lobbyist.

Blindly reading the Bible is dangerous and ignorant. That being said, I believe the same of ignoring it. It is the oldest record of mankind, including government and morality, that we can possibly find.

Despite the terrible evils done in the name of religion, I don’t believe you or I would have ever seen this Earth if it had not been around to temper the worst instincts of humanity.

Finally, I still believe that secular folks can be just as moral and upright as anyone else, and there is obviously no question that some “Christians” are terrible people.

The world just isn’t black-and-white.
