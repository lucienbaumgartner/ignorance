&gt;So you admit you are wrong on all counts then?

No. You're incredibly biased and ignorant of military reality.

&gt;You can cry about being technically wrong all you like, just remember you were being a cunt and were proven wrong.

Not at all. You're the only one acting that way. You're the only one who kept drawing out tangents to circle around the main point that Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia. But no matter how hard you try and twist it or how far you shove your head up your ass, Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia.

&gt;&gt; Ukraine doesn't have the capability to produce advanced weapons, they've always depended on imports.
&gt;
&gt;Im not going to let you change from Anti tank weaponry, which you specifically mentioned; to "advanced" which is a vague undefined term. But you are provably wrong already:

You are severely underestimating what it would take to stop a Russian tank brigade which would be supported by Air Cover and infantry.

&gt;Can you just admit you dont know anything? Its sad how uninformed you actually are.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yea they did the same in Iraq and Afghanistan it amounts to absolutely nothing. It's all political posturing, because they can't actually help.
&gt;
&gt;When you think Iraq and Afghanistan are comparable to Ukraine, you really aren't worth talking to.

I think Russia is much more capable than Saddam's army, Al Qaeda, or ISIS. Really not sure what you're missing there
