You’re right, I hadn’t and it was dismissive and ignorant of me to say “nobody” says these things. (I’m also in mobile and hadn’t tapped the img to see Ryuji, but haven’t seen any of the other name-calling yet)

That said, I still think the controversy is sort of manufactured. Most ppl who don’t play the game don’t care about the characters, and this seems more like an attempt to trigger the fan base.
