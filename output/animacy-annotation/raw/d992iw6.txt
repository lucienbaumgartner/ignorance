1990's CCCP collapses, US politicians begins to collude ever more directly with global corporations.  Laws are weakened for corporate profit.

2000's terror allows passage of laws that forfeit rights in US &amp; Europe.  The new russia gets hit with sanctions as they refuse outside corporate influence. (Still corrupt)

2010's russia's only major income is oil sold to Europe, if pipeline is built in middle east russia will collapse to corporate control.

Syria lies in the way of the pipeline, US is channeling ISIS into Syria by announcing attacks to destabilize country for the kill shot.

US near total unaware and compliant citizenry due to immigration and total social media and MSM control.
