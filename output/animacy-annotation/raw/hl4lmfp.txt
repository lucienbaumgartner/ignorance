Scumbag Americans. As if 20 years of US invasion, propping up corrupt governments, not releasing Afghani money, and blood spilled didn’t have anything to do with this. 

Instead they blame the Taliban and the Afghan people for this. Well I guess you’re right because they let themselves get taken advantage of by the US. 

Even in defeat, Americans are still arrogant and ignorant of the world. Really amazing and truly lucky they have a massive ocean separating them from the rest of the world lol
