A country as culturally conservative as Japan would need to take several years, even generations for them to acclimatize to the idea of foreigners/westerners being heavily interested with doing business with them. Even after the Meiji period where Japan had started opening their doors for international business, they still are very much culturally conservative and unaware of the culture of the West.
