&gt;So you're saying that roughly 1/9th of the population is an irritating Eminem fan?

nope never said that. But a great percentage are. 

&gt;Yeah, basically mate. You were a bad fan, not everyone is, talk to the fucking mirror, don't blame the whole world, Jesus.

ye this argument is just not gonna cut it. You're gonna have to go back to the drawing board and figure out another one. 

You're basically trynna say no one can have an observation, cause its just projection, which is stupid.. ik you know that. 

this is you being unaware and probably young, or you just pretending to not notice the stans, because of your love of Eminem. 

Either way makes me inclined to believe you are one of those stans.
