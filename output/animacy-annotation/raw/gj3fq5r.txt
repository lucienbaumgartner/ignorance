Nah, I don’t think they are all racist and this is coming from an angry liberal lesbian that has a very strong disdain for Trump and everything he represents. My sister is a Trumper, because she likes Republican takes on taxes. She has a half black child and a half Dominican child. She is not racist in the least. She likes guns and lower taxes and doesn’t know much else about what Trump has done. Uneducated voter. She also told me that I am severely uneducated and unaware of what is going on in politics because I don’t read Parler or believe a thing Trump says. She is anti politicians because she thinks they are all corrupt, which she is right about, but then leans to Trump because he’s not a politician. I’ve been educating her lately on him and she’s like oh hell no that’s fucked up I guess I really don’t know all the stuff about him. 

She’s slowly coming around but it’s hard. And she’s still on it that she doesn’t trust any of them and they are all sneaky. She thinks the election was rigged. She’s an extremely smart woman, just got brain washed a bit by the Trump lies. 

She was at the Capitol but I called her when I saw they broke in and she left once she saw them going crazy and acting violent. She got angry at us at first calling them terrorists until she saw they killed people and the extent of damage they really did and now she’s like I had no idea they were gonna do that. I believe her.

She went there to support trump and the election fraud and had no idea these maniacs were plotting this. She’s changing her tune slowly about him. I hope to make her a normal republican and not a Trumper.
