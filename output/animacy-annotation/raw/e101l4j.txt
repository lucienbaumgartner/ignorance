Yeah, you are correct. Believe it or not, a lot of people were unaware and uneducated in late 2000s/early 2010s about racism. I was in middle school at the time and we thought a lot of racist stuff was HILARIOUS. (It's not) This was simply because a lot of us weren't educated. The internet/social media culture was just starting to blossom. (Like pre-SJW era). A lot of regrettable and rude things happened. Luckily, I've since been educated on how racist/stereotypical humor isn't funny. I'd assume the same changes happened with Shane. People evolve, mature, and change as time goes on.
