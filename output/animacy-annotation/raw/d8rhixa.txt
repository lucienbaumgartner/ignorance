I will never forget the way my dad's skin looked right before he died.   I kept asking the nurses why he was so red and sticky and they just kept saying that it was fine and not telling me anything else.  Now I know that they probably knew it was what some people's skin looks like before they die and just didn't want to make me more upset.   I will never be able to forget the image of my brain dead dad before being taken off life support, who the day before was talking about what we were having for Christmas dinner.  I chose not to watch him be taken off life support because at that point I considered him already gone and his body was just an empty shell that used to contain who he was.  I just wish he were here to give me a hug most of the time, but I wish I hadn't had to see him in that state.  It really sucks to see the most important person in your life dying before your eyes.  Worst part is he was laying on the floor unable to move for about 12 hours and I was downstairs asleep and unaware that anything had happened.  I blame myself.
