&gt; That doesn't mean you should blindly hate people for expressing their opinion

How are people so blind and ignorant that they can't see that it's not simply that I "disagree" with these people? They are a threat to this country and to democracy. It's not my fault if you're too blind to see that.

I disagreed with countless people during the Bush administration, and I never acted like this. Does that not tell you something? It's not mere "disagreements" that are causing this hatred. Please try and understand that.
