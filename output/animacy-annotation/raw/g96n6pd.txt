You will have to look up those experiments, one clue is "what would you do"! When you see a woman yelling and pushing a man on the street most people would ignore them but when asked they would think he must have done something to deserve it! When it's the other way, cops would be called or the male abuser would be confronted! If you need logic for the way people are conditioned to blame men more you are truly immature and ignorant! That is why they were conducted as social experiments! You can't find the answer by mixing chemical!
