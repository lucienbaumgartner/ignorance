That was my thought as well.  As far as we know Robyn has never had a job, she is not formally OR self educated, she is truly basically ignorant and uninterested in the world around her.  How could she possibly home school her kids?  She speaks of her devotion to the “culture” of polygamy but remains completely removed from the financial resources needed to support 18 kids.  Clearly even basic math is a struggle for her.
