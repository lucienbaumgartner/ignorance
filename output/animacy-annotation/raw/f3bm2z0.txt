The vast majority of blizzard's market share is not Chinese. A huge chunk of that market is boycotting them now. This was a bad decision. Idk why you want to pretend it makes sense. You being cynical and unaware that boycotting works is your only justification for why this is actually smart for blizzard. Most of the world isn't in China dude. Pissing off everyone else for that market is dumb.
