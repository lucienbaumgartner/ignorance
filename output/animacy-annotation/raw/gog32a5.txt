Hit him with the biology angle: 
It IS his fault you’re having a girl. A biological woman will ALWAYS have xx chromosomes and will always give an x. A biological man will ALWAYS have XY. So, if he gives another X, you now have XX which becomes a girl fetus. If he gives a Y, it becomes XY which becomes a boy fetus... 

It’s much more involved than that but that’s the basics. If you want to drag this out, hit him with that knowledge! I seriously hate when men or their families act like the woman giving birth controls the sex of the baby. Shows me at the very least, they’re uneducated and unaware of basic animal reproductive biology.
