Did you forget about my apparently very bad at tracking hound dog? Now we will be able to more realistically ascertain your location! Or we will wait for more clues to drop while you are unaware, and vulnerable.

Pretty much. But that is okay, it keeps you careful I suppose. But apparently not very careful in my case. I tend to binge then take breaks, and binge again. Works for the most part.
