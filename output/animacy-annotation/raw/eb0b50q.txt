Who the fuck wouldn't want to know they were being cheated on???

1) u know ur friend/whatever is being cheated on so are followed by guilt
2) ur friend/whatever is unaware and vulnerable to their cheater
3) if it ever got out they wouldn't trust anyone because their friend/whatever didnt tell them that their partner was being deceitful and disgusting
4) the cheater gets away with thinking they can do it consequence free
