This reminds me of [my own experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/b3nrc1/a_manifesto_about_women_having_too_high_standards/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and it’s really sad that they’re that unattractive and unaware that they somehow try to make themself believe that women are doing something wrong, either morally or pragmatically, by not giving guys like him a chance if they’re not attracted to them.

I see many responses about “niceguys have high standards themselves so he’s hypocrite”. While it might be true for many niceguys, I know many guys settle for unattractive women just to get intimacy and sex. That’s why they don’t listen to us, because they ARE willing to settle and now believe women are supposed to settle as well for that reason (which is BS but they don’t get it due to their lack of EQ). I won’t assume they aren’t willing to settle but they just need to know nobody owes them a chance.
