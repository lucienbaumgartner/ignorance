&gt; The question I have for you is; how can you still support Clinton even after all of the covering up of her crimes against America and against humanity.

I'm not the OP but I'll take a stab at this. 

If you assume that bad stuff happened but a conspiracy has successfully covered up all the evidence, you can believe whatever you want. She killed Vince Foster, she's secretly a lesbian, etc. A lot of the accusations against Clinton are as credible as 9/11 trutherism, and some of them come from the same people. On the other hand, if you actually care about what there's evidence of, she's a little too cozy with Wall Street and that's about it. I've linked to [this](http://mightygodking.com/2016/08/25/why-i-find-it-hard-to-be-worried-about-hillary-clinton-being-corrupt/) before and I think it's pretty good. The blogger comes at it from left of center, so he doesn't bother discussing the mass murders and waging war against America that she's often accused of, he's just focusing on allegations of corruption, pay-to-play, etc. Tl;dr version: it's reasonable to not like how hawkish she is or how cozy she is with Wall Street, but there's just no evidence of anything extraordinarily bad.

I googled your "an unaware and compliant citizenry" quote. You do know that you're taking it completely out of context, right? Podesta's correspondent isn't proudly bragging that some Leftist cabal has produced that. He's despairing about the general American public who have defunded and ignored Civics class in high school, which you can tell because reality TV stars are considered more competent than politicians. Call it condescending if you want but it's simply dishonest to say that Clinton and friends want that. Most evidence about Clinton's crimes holds up just as well.
