I've never seen anything other than grinding in clubs. Best to just keep to yourself while in a relationship. You're personally allowed to allow your partner to do anything you are comfortable with. However what OP did is absolutely not ok. And is disrespectful to his partner. It's not pathological jealousy to not want your parent dancing with others in a club. That's normal. I have to wonder how young you are. Your response definitely seems immature and unaware of how a mature relationship should function.
