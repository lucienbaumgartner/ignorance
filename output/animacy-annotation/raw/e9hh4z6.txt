Linji is telling Deshan that he is, at present, asleep.

That can mean anything, but it seems to me that Linji is chastising Deshan for speaking while unaware and unenlightened. He’s saying Deshan shouldn’t be saying **anything** without the foundation and confidence and truth of being “awake”—enlightened.
