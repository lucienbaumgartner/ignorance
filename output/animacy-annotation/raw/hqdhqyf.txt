1.  This is no different than the "why didn't she just apologize" comments that ignore that she did

2.  She fucking does delete every time this shit happens.

3.  I was everywhere; trolls are even on  her patreon; the trolls are on every social media platform, even shitting up tv tropes forums and shit like that. The forums of every fandom she's ever mentioned, and lots of youtube channels.

4.  Curl up in a ball and roll back into your hole if this is the kind of contribution you feel like making. Vapid, ignorant, and dismissive.
