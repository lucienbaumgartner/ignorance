&gt;but you only believe in God as a means to justify your preconceptions of justice, so you don't need to think about it or change your opinions on it

Wow, that's assuming an awful lot about someone who you've literally never met before.  How could you possible know that I only believe in God so that I can hold onto my preconceptions of justice.  It's not possible that there are other reasons I believe in God?  What an ignorant and uneducated thing to say.  

And you clearly didn't understand my previous comment.  My valuing of justice is not a rational exercise and thus cannot be defended rationally or "vindicated" as you put it.  I don't value justice because God tells me to value it...I would value it either way because that's what I am.  I'm a person who values justice.
