I don't have a problem.  Me pointing out foolish things you've said doesn't make me being the one with a problem.  You thinking an exoskeleton will rot is a problem. You thinking someone using every part of their meal,  down to the literal Skelton,  is somehow disrespectful is a problem.  You thinking he should have used plastic instead when plastic is so bad for the planet is not only a problem but proof of how profoundly ignorant and unwise you truly are.  Honestly,  how stupid do you gotta be to think,  he should have just thrown away what he didn't eat into the trash instead of actually not creating more trash.  No, you think it isn't only better to create more trash but have a company produce something,  package it,  ship it,  just so this person could make some art of something he already had.  A process that would use a lot of resources, produce a lot of pollution,  and for something he already had. Your ignorance is baffling and you should be ashamed of yourself for being so immensely stupid. May good have mercy of your ignorant and unwise soul.
