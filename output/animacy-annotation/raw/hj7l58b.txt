I am due 11/29 and both holidays are off the table. Family can come one month after baby is born, not a month after my anticipated due date because what if I go late?! It sounds like our mothers are the same and unaware that they actually hurt more than help. I'm sorry you have to experience this but it sounds like you're doing a great job of setting your boundaries, stay strong! Best of luck to you and your family.
