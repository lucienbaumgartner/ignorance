So what exactly is mayor suppose to do?  Fire all police who don’t live in the city, only hire police who live in the city and make it a condition of employment that they must live in the city their entire career?  

These police have the right to choose where they live.  If they can afford to live in the suburbs and choose to do so, that is fine.  

In Ohio you get taxed by the school district you live in and the one you work in.  I don’t live in the school district I work in and on every paycheck I see two school district taxes taken out.  

If New York State and Syracuse in particular don’t have this tax, this man has an argument he can make.  If they do have this kind of tax system, his argument is stupid and ignorant of the tax system.  I’m not saying he is a bad person, he is very passionate and wants things to improve, but he would have more success if he was better informed.
