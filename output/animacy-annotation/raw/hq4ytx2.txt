&gt;IGNORANT and BARBARIC 

These adjectives still seem to apply given your description. What doesn't apply is "evil".

This is generally true with past historical practices, in my experience. Taking into account their ignorance of scientific reasoning, scientific knowledge, and their living in violent times, the apparently brutal actions of many people in the past make a lot of sense. Of course, there was murder, rape, dishonesty, and sadism that can't be exculpated in this way, but we have those today.

There really is some truth in Plato's idea that all evil is the result of ignorance. Not the whole truth, but some truth.

If people in the future learn that personhood begins very early in gestation, then they could legitimately that our societies are ignorant and barbaric, but not "evil", unless e.g. it's discoverable via some facts whose relevance we're only missing out of moral weakness rather than epistemic incapacity.
