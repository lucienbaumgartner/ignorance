He knew what he was doing was wrong. He didn't stop when you asked him until you had to start crying. This is a massive breach of trust, disrespectful and ignorant of your boundaries. As others have said, this is rape.

Find someone who will buy you flowers and take you for romantic meals out without raping you first.

I know you say you love him, but are you prepared for this or something worse to happen again if you forgive him or stay in a relationship with him? Because my gut feeling (and my own experience) is that once a man has raped you once and you've let them get away with it, it's likely to happen again.
