Any activity that’s within 15 miles of home is done in the van. The kids love taking it. It’s a blast to drive. Drives like an early 90s car. no power steering no real weight to it. Very noticeably that you are driving it or going fast. Unlike new cars where you are going through 90mph and feel very safe and unaware of speed.
