&gt;We are talking about a teen who probably thinks the way she does because of her parents. It's not her fault she was raised that way. I mean shit have you ever met a racist baby? Probably not because it's a learned behavior.

What sort of argument is this? Putting things like that, you could absolve any and all sorts of behavior. Hell, I could use it in an effective way to prove that someone like Floyd, who was born in institutionalized poverty and racially charged conditions which removed many opportunities from his life at a young age had very little choice but becoming a petty delinquent. And in the end, he was murdered for it, much to the satisfaction of that woman. Consequences to your actions and choices are important, regardless of your age. If you are right, and the reason she tbehaves that way is because her parents failed to raise her properly, protecting her from deserved circumstances as she comes out of age is not going to do her any favors later in life. At one point the coddling needs to stop and she needs to learn to behave in society.

Besides, it's not as though she's entirely innocent and ignorant of the vileness of her behavior. She several times acknowledges that other people are not going to like what she has to say and belligerently dismisses their concern. You cannot possibly have kids if you believe that allowing a challenge accompanying misbehavior is going to result in anything else but a learned belief that you can be walked over.

Moreover, we are talking about a man whose LIFE was taken from him, and here you are clutching pearls over a white, privileged, entitled woman losing her *first choice* of university? She will be fine, she can choose another and hopefully not be a braggart about it and go on living her life more quietly and maybe acquire a better understanding of consequences in life.
