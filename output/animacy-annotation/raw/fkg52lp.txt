Boiiiiiiiii, Intjs ARE LITERALLY THE MOST COMPATIBILE function for Enfps. My best friend is an INTJ. Our cognitive functions align really well and from my experience, I recommend the following. 

*DONT'S/ Negatives*

1. DON'T OVERTHINK OR OVER ANALYSE your interactions with an INTJ. They CAN sense this and it does put them off or annoy them if you're making it especially notable and trying to overcompensate if you misinterpret their responses or try to assume their intentions. 
2. DON'T rush things with an INTJ, if you do, you might lose the relationship. INTJs despite showing love/attention quite impulsively in a relationship, prefer a slow burn. The pace of your relationship seems quite ideal, as ENFPs and INTJs both value the 'Friendship to Romantic Pairing, "trope"/ situation. 
3. DON'T get clingy. INTJs VALUE THEIR SPACE and if you're an ENFP your love and attention for others, can come off as overbearing sometimes. Don't overwhelm your INTJ, they might distance themselves from you without notice or explanation if they feel suffocated. That's why long term relationships with them should be slow and progress little by little, so as not to overwhelm them. 
4. INTJ can sometimes seem emotionally unaware and cold to ENFP

*Positives / DOs*

1. DO be vulnerable and intimate. INTJs sincerely appreciate the authenticity and intimate, deep discussions that ENFPs love to have. You will find at an interpersonal level, you truly understand each other. 
2. Both functions are abstract and highly intuitive. ENFPs' ability to psychoanalyze quite accurately and observe is admired and a capability shared by INTJs.
3. You can teach and learn from each other.
4. INTJs respect ENFPs moral awareness and ENFPs value INTJs rationale.
5. Like and understand each other's communication style.
6. Make decisions and judgments in a similar way.
7. ENFP reacts positively to experiences INTJs give them
8. ENFP gives INTJ plenty of options and freedom.
