I'm in college but I'll pass on African american studies, at least as a major. I actually want a job when I graduate, not just tens of thousands of debt and a useless degree. You said pretty sure, not probably, but even if you'd said probably, that is just as ridiculous. There is absolutely no evidence to back up your claim. Just because you think most people are racist, doesn't mean they are. You have 0 evidence to back up your claim of racism for Gus, except calling him a "bootlicker" which could easily be explained by his traumatic upbringing resulting in a need for acceptance, or his awkward personality in general. He has not said it done anything that indicates he is a racist. I did not jump down your throat. You are the one making personal digs at me. All I said is that the word racist has been thrown out so much and the meaning has been so diluted that it doesn't have the weight and seriousness that it should have. Being an actual racist, not just some awkward guy who wants people to like him, is one of the worst things a person can be. It's hateful and ignorant. That isn't jumping down your throat.
