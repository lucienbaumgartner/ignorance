Yo you don't have to be a fucking asshole about it. I asked an honest question because I didn't know? If that's the way you treat people that are unaware and curious then no wonder people act the way they do towards you. I wasn't trying to be rude. Saying someone who identifies as female at birth or identified as a female doesn't tell me if you had a penis at birth or not. Fuck off with you're high horse shit
