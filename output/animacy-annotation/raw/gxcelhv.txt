Those cases and their usage by organic farming companies have long been debunked. Bowman purposefully planted them and knew they were transgenic (since he tested them with glyphosate) and was trying to bait out a lawsuit. So there was nothing innocent about the situation. 

There's a reason why you can never find a case where someone actually innocent and ignorant of the seeds they were planting is the defendant. Because it doesn't really happen. 

Farmers aren't stupid, they know what they're planting on their fields.
