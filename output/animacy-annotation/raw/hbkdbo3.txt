It's not that simple. For most people, religion has little to do with the truth. What most people are looking for is a channel to express their "spiritual/religious impulse" through symbols and metaphors. Organized religion is the first available option waiting for those who wish to express the inexpressible. A stage of looking for answers externally before looking for them internally.

Where there is demand, there is supply and religous organizations are the first external entity to respond to that demand.

It is only a small percentage of people who are willing to sacrifice their comforts and longing to belong to honor the pursuit of the "truth". Most will not let truth get in the way of their beliefs because the truth often leads to more questions than it does answers.

The cognitive dissonance is a result of an attempt to protect and preserve what truth will take away. Atheism in and of itself does not add, replace or restore purpose. Islam serves a specific purpose while Christianity caters to another. The belief system adopted is reflective of the current state a person is in. Using a "factoid" or two to derail or dismantle a person's belief is irresponsible and ignorant of the impact it can have on someone's development.

There's a scene in the movie "The Matrix" where it is mentioned by Morpheus that they try not to "wake" a person up too late in their lives once falsehoods has already settled in.

It's a sensitive process and attempting to force a person to accept "your findings" in an abrupt way is nothing short of immature.

I'm not saying to resist arguments with believers who wish to engage in them, but in a conversation discussing "why" they do what they do, this is my understanding on the matter.
