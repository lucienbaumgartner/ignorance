I feel so bad for Republicans. They're so stupid they don't even realize what they're doing to themselves. They are almost literally letting their idols walk them off a cliff in throws, they've completely basterdized the integrity of the party and our entire political and education system, they're the epitome of being brain washed/mind controlled, and they're so unaware and thick they genuinely think they're the only ones who ARENT being taken advantage of, manipulated, controlled and killed. They don't even seem to understand this virus is pretty much only killing their voters. I feel bad for the people who vote republican because there is just no reasoning with them, their entire basis of thought is blind faith. They don't realize their politicians are literally killing them and trying to keep them poor and stupid, but that's what a 30 year systematic attack on the public education system did. They're just scared stupid people who think they're doing the right thing, just like anybody else. It's just that they can't see how far their understanding of the world has been twisted by their idols (not leaders, idols.) And you can't reason with them since they worship their controllers. They don't even see they're being rounded up and killed basically by the people who are supposed to be protecting them and it's depressing to me. I wish I could help them but they don't want help, they literally want to die on this hill. Poor, stupid stupid people.
