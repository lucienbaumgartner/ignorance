lol, you're using a lot of italics thinking that it makes your points more valid but in reality it just looks like you're trying way too hard.

you seem to be unwilling or unable to understand that what the woman did is irrelevant so i guess we're done here. maybe you're just really young and unaware that harassing people is against the law. either way i would recommend you trying to learn something from a place outside of reddit at some time because your long irrelevant rants about the woman allegedly giving him an std show you're just failing to grasp what we're talking about in this thread.
