Generally I am fine with censorship in cases where characters are sexualised for the the sake of being sexualised, but censoring this character' humongous boobs isn't exactly a good thing because it interferes with the plot.

The whole deal with this character is that she is a dragon who came to the current human world and therefore needs to take on a human form in order to blend in with the people, but her current look is due to being completely clueless about human behaviour, etiquette and what is perceived to be a normal human 'look'. In the manga, the ridiculous size of her breasts are often used in conjunction with that clueless trait to show viewers just how ignorant and naive she is while getting used to life among humans. 

By shrinking her breasts down to more normal sizes, it waters down a good deal of the "clueless dragon" plot point.
