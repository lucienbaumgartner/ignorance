It is also BB, even Spica but he is a complete rookie so I would give him a pass, but still find it quite questionable that TSM fans are constantly mentioning Smoothie staying for the next year, his comms are massive issue. Or even worse case scenario, these players are all actually so unaware and incompetent that they need every little thing on screen to be called out.
