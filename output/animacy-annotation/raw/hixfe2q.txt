&gt;It’s not as sensitive as something that can straight up be your lifeline.

Dude.

You said that posting a dumb CaC pic is "not the smartest thing".

I disagreed with that and gave an example if what would ACTUALLY be a dumb thing to post.

How hard is this to understand? The point is that posting a CaC pic is extremely unnsignificant. Stop getting hung up on semantics.

&gt;You can do something for fun, but what OP did actually involves other people simply by it being a post on a subreddit.

You scroll through your frontpage. You catch a glimpse of a post you don't care about. You keep scrolling and move on with your day.

This is what thousands of people do everyday. Follow in their footsteps.

&gt;He posted on the sub and got flak for it. He can either try to change his content to better satisfy the people here (granted I think I’m one of the only people who actually suggested using other hairstyles, so there was absolutely a lack of constructive criticism), just not post this content at all because he can enjoy it alone himself (aka he won’t get flak for it), or he can get all uppity and insult people even when the worst they’ve done to him is “your avatar is unoriginal” and respond to his excess hostility.

Or everyone can be considerate? OP posted XV content which is allowed on here. People can choose to engage with it or not. If this post is not for you then just leave. Not everything is going to be tailor-made to you.

&gt;Wow you actually brought in the hitler argument unironically when I, in this very comment, tried to point out how silly that would be. What the heck? If you need to bring hitler into a comparison argument without actively pointing out how silly hitler comparisons are in the first place, you need to take a step back. Cmon, mate. It’s such a lazy and poor comparison choice that only makes its user look silly and unaware of what they’re talking about.

It's a simple comparison. Going by you not understanding my earlier comparison I guess this one's on me, so I'll spell it out for you: being tame in comparison doesn't necessarily mean much.

&gt;^minor ^note. ^I ^posted ^clip ^of ^stamina ^break ^inputs ^on ^this ^sub ^not ^for ^fun ^but ^rather ^because ^I ^wanted ^people ^who ^didn’t ^know ^how ^to ^do ^them ^properly ^yet, ^to ^learn ^them ^more ^effectively. ^I’ve ^posted ^screenshots ^showing ^info ^for ^others ^to ^discover ^as ^well. ^Not ^everyone ^posts ^solely ^for ^funsies.

Making your own posts is completely different though.
