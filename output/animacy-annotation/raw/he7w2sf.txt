Maybe. I just think asexual/grey/demi people seem to be very happy once they accept that about themselves.

Yet there was a time when I was very separated and unaware of my own sexuality and that wasn't a very happy moment in my life. When I started to feel happier I also noticed I started to feel more feelings of attraction blooming as well.
