I like that Lerika was nice to Christall but I hated how she can be two-faced. She seemed like she would befriend everyone and talk shit about them in her confessionals. At least she was consistent lmao. Btw do you think Christall is racist? I personally don't think she is racist.. I think she is just socially awkward and unaware and just says stuff without thinking it through. It doesn't excuse her behavior of course but hopefully she learned from this season how her behavior was perceived and makes positive changes.
