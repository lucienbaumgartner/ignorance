In 9th grade, I went to a special high school for people who could score really high on this test.  The school was about 70% Asian students, and pretty much everyone was considered very smart.  In English, our teacher was this sassy, but funny black woman.  She would crack jokes all the time, but would be like John Leguizamo in that she would quickly switch from being funny to being extremely serious.  One day, she was in a pretty lousy mood because no one was raising their hand to answer her questions.  Then she started complaining to all of us for being lazy and stupid (despite us being the top 0.5% smartest students in the NYC).  She then calls on this Korean boy named David, and quickly says "what's an adverb?"  She said it really fast, and in context, no one understood what she was saying.  David looked really confused, and didn't say anything for a few seconds.  The teacher then went off on this long session shaming David for being so stupid and ignorant that he doesn't know what an adverb is.  She didn't even give him a chance to answer.  I remember the look on David's face when this happened.  His skin went pale, his eye sockets sucked in, and he was on the verge of crying.  I hated her so much for that.
