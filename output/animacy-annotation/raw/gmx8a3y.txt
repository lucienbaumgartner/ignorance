That may be true and then again it may not be. Prior to WWII, the Nazis were understood to be heavily armed and capable of anything and everything, which as it turns out was a complete fabrication and an exercise in public relations. If Britain nipped that in the bud early on, WWII would have never even started. 

However, China has a few things going for it - the sheer size of its population - even if each one of them were to throw a shoe, a rock or a potato, it would be costly, damaging and deadly. And then there's the large number of investments abroad - ex. China basically owns a big portion of Africa, which is an enormous continent that vastly exceeds that of North America, and most are unwilling and ignorant of the types of resources it contains and the sheer size of it. They also own key infrastructure points across the globe, many tied to energy, shipping channels and ports, and basically we are fucked one way or another because in a resource war, we'd be at a disadvantage.
