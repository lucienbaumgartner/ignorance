Read carefully. 

Who said communism is green? Read again buddy, I never said communism nor socialism is greener. You’re making shit up now lol.

I wouldn’t say im a communist lol, maybe a progressive I guess but I’m just a human who wants a fair solution for most people if not all assuming it’s possible. Doesn’t matter where you lean politically, both sides have their fair share of idiots, but the GOP is outright frightening and on a whole other level of stupidity.

Socialism is all over the US. Taxes in a way are a form of socialism yet the 1 percent doesn’t pay their fair share. Taxes pay for several public programs, and all public programs are socialist by nature. Medicare, social security, I mean it’s in the goddamn name, not to mention public schools, public hospitals, law enforcement, fire fighters. The whole idea of we the people … for the people by the people … that is what this country was founded on. Then capitalism said fuck that, for the money, by the rich. The idea of this nation has been subverted long before Citizens United(the irony) but that act was the final nail in the coughing which basically states companies are people and since they have more cash, we’re prone to listen to them more”.

You sound capable of being smart but I bet you’re young and unaware of a lot of shit. You think you know a lot and shit you probably are capable of it but right now you’re messy. You’re inferring shit instead of reading what im typing. Probably in high school (i could be wrong), im not much older lol.

I personally don’t mind nuclear energy. Storing nuclear waste is a whole different issue though. Maybe shoot it out to space? But with modern methodologies we should be able to make nuclear reactors safer than ever. 

Last comment dude, you’ve been wrong like 5 times and you keep trying to find a flaw, only for me to notice 50 of yours. This is ridiculous.

Communism is bad no matter what, there, you happy? 😂

Edit: I only stated such bill was brought up in congress. Never did I express support. Dude, join a debate class and sharpen up, you’re horrible at this.
