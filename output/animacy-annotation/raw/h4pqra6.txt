I don't think Carlos pushed Gaolang out.

For me it was more like, Gaolang overextends/puts too much power into the right straight. Then, Carlos uses that momentum/energy from that right straight + his own weight + his pulling strength + Gaolang being surprised and unaware of what's going so he didn't resist much. Is what all led to Carlos ringing out Gaolang.
