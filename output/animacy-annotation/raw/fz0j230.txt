oh no.  I'm rage at the people for being so intensely stupid about it all and for twisting the reality and the facts and the data and the science, and being so horrifically selfish and ignorant that the government a) needs to mandate and b) is afraid to mandate because so much of their base is in the population that won't do the right thing.
