Most of these guns are purchased in states with no gun control and illegally transferred across state lines. 

So your comment is stupid and ignorant of reality. Nation gun laws would fix most of those problems.

Aide from your stupidity... Do you think gun control failed in Australia? 

They had guns &gt; got rid of them. How many gun deaths do they have now? 

Just total idiocy and ignorance on your part.
