Not only are most Australians unaware and uninterested, looking at some of the replies on these threads, quite a number of them actively LIKE the fact that visa holders (or anyone, as long as it's not them) are excluded. Idk it makes them feel all tingly inside that they're in a special club or something with extra privileges.

This pandemic has truly brought out the worst in us.
