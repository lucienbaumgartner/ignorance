Yeah, it's funny how their first assumption is always that you must be uneducated, ignorant, and unaware (and/or that you're just evil, mean, and hateful). What they don't seem to realize is that so many of us traveled through liberal feminism first before getting to where we are now with radical feminism, gender criticism/abolition, etc. Many of us used to be liberal feminists. Many of us used to be supportive of trans activism. Many of us used to wring our hands over the "TERF" panic as well. We don't really need to read their articles and blog posts - we've often already read them! We have reasons for why we disagree. We aren't doing this just for the hell of it. Frankly I've done more reading as a radical feminist than I ever did as a liberal feminist. My time spent as a liberal feminist was primarily wrapped up in regurgitating what I was hearing from others and trying to force myself to be okay with things that I wasn't actually okay with (like porn). I've learned a hell of a lot more as a radical feminist. 

Sometimes they honestly remind me of my Republican father who assumes that I'm dumb and ignorant and thinks that if I'd just read the "right" articles (meaning his biased conservative news), I'd come around to his point of view. Both my father and these liberals seem to operate under the assumption that everyone who doesn't agree with them 100% must just be so stupid. It's honestly really insulting and simplistic.
