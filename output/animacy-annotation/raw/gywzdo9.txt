that's not what this means, relax.

most protests i've been to don't tolerate this kind of shit. i've seen someone protesting against a cause i was marching for eat shit on his bike and people *he was protesting against* ran over to help him. so your comment is ill-informed, entirely reductive, and ignorant of how most well-intentioned people actually act. hell, i brought fire retardant spray with me in case anyone tried to light a business on fire when I marched.

but, of course, it's easy to simplify folks who think differently than you into a category of "they attack people" to help you discount their cause. despite the fact that folks on both sides have extremists and bad actors that neither of us want in our ranks. the trumpers have folks assaulting capitol police; pro-palestine folks have these fuckwits. these actions have **nothing** to do with the actual causes at hand. some people just suck and they exist in any movement.
