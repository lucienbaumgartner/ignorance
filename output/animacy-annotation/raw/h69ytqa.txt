Very Swedish specific but:

A bank (f√∂reningssparkbanken) at the time had option to set up account for different clubs. We had a gaming club that would be eligible for some grants but we needed an account for it to work. None of us was over 18 so I went to the bank to ask if that was still doable and got told no worries, just come back with some paperwork. Paperwork done and went there, was told it was not possible to do without an adult to sign the papers. Pissed of but decided to do it I managed to get my dad to come along (assuming banking hours are equally shit everywhere, basically forcing working people to take time of to get to the bank). So in we went and they had no idea what I talked about and could not set up accounts for clubs at all. Same fucking guy behind the counter each time I went as well.


A mail order (now online) Swedish store for "home textile" and clothes (Ellos). Always had huge discounts on a few things. We decided to order some stuff for our new home and went with them since they had a really good deal on some sheets and towels. Got those and added a few other things that we would usually not order but since delivery was being payed anyway when ordering the cheap stuff... So we get confirmation and everything seems fine. When the package arrives all the cheap stuff is missing and was sold out but they still sent all the other stuff. And iirc there was some clause when buying discounted items that returns where not possible. I think we got the smallest thing we ordered at a discount and that voided the returns for the order (probably could have fought it tbh but was young and unaware of my rights). Their support was impossible to get a hold of as well.
