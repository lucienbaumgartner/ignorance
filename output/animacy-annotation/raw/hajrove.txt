I like what Grant Morrison said about us being intersections in time and that we are bound to the fourth dimension (time) to grow larvae (our bodies?). It doesnt really offer an explanation, but it does show you how weird and harmonically balanced this existence is. 

I think that were all here to give consciousness meaning, and were all essentially the same thing living out exhaustable possibilities. We could very well be the masters of time, but we are infantile and unaware of our potential because time is an incomplete process as of this moment.
