I finished Part II today and checked for the first time game reviews a few hours ago. Since I purposely avoided searching anything related to the game (in order to avoid spoilers) I was completally unaware and surprised by the amout of negative feedback it got. I think that a lot of people didn't really grasp what the game was about.
