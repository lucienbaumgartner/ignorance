Statements like this really don't sit right with me. We vilify racists and bigots because they make ridiculous generalizations about an entire group of people. Aren't you doing the exact same thing here? I mean you literally just said that all conservatives wish violence upon minorities, and I honestly can't get behind that idea. Do we disagree? Absolutely. But to then assume that simply because someone disagrees with you that they must have secret fantasies of carrying out violence on others is a pretty wild assumption to make.

Now let me be clear. I know there certainly are bootlicking scum who cheer on violence towards minorities. We know who those people are. They are the racists and the bigots. But to then say that our conservative friends and family members are the exact same is pretty disgusting, if I'm being honest. I understand the frustration with conservatives who choose "All Lives Matter" over "Black Lives Matter". But let's not try to claim all conservatives are bloodthirsty psychopaths simply because we disagree with them. How would you react if someone said all liberals secretly love killing babies simply because we are pro choice? See how ridiculous and ignorant that sounds?
