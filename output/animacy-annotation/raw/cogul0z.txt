I thinK we have a different situation and are acting differently now. I say that because I can tell through your tone that you say those words to yourself everyday. Not that I don't, but I have already done that. I "self improved" more than I have in 24 years in 4 months. I am the "best" I've ever been and I don't give a fuck if she knows that because I do. That said, love can be unconditional and very real. I moved away for a year to SF and we broke up on a couple months later. I'll be back home eventually and when I am if things work than they do. Absence made my heart grow fonder and lord knows that she is just naive and unaware that the pain of distance caused this. Who knows what will happen? All I know is that I will continue to be the best human I can be and if we end up together we will be the best humans together. That doesn't, by any means, mean that I do not and will not continue to love her. It just means I do not let it define me, not for now. I'm not going to rush to "move on" or find another girl. I'm in love, heart broken and too busy to give my heart to someone new (yes my penis is suffering but whatever). I'd rather be alone and this awesome than fake happiness with new girls.
