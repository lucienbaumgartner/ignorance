&gt;And Allah can't be the same as the Christian God, because the Christian God incarnated as Jesus, whereas Jesus in Islam is just a prophet.

Does this mean Jews and Christians don't believe in the same god too, since Jews don't believe Jesus was God? Jesus was a jew, so which god was he talking about? Muslims believe in the same god as Christians and Jews; what you are saying here is essentially "only Christians believe in the god of Abraham" which is frankly absurd and ignorant of history.
