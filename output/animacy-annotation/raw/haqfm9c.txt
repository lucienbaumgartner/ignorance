Why would I want to remain friends with someone who is so fucking self centered, naive, and ignorant that why won't go get a FREE vaccine for the deadliest communicable disease in the world right now? You mean the ones that are helping the delta variant to spread, and will very likely contribute to an even deadlier one down the line?

No, I would ditch anyone who didn't take the vaccine yet. They don't deserve friends or kindness. It's been YEARS of this anti-intellectualism, ignorance, selfishness that have metastasized to every corner of that crowd's psyche. And it's fundamentally incompatible with the world we live in. If I could exile every single person who continues to perpetuate (and even GROW!!!) their fucking "movement", I would pull that level in a HEARTBEAT. Hell, I'd Thanos snap them RIGHT NOW lol
