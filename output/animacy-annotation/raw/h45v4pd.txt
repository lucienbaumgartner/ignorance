I’m utterly amazed that this guy can make this argument with a straight face. He’s either blindingly stupid and unaware of this being an obvious false equivalency on multiple levels, or he’s knowingly trying to dupe his followers. There’s demonstrable scientific proof of the virus. There’s a demonstrable *lack* of evidence that proves the existence of any god.
