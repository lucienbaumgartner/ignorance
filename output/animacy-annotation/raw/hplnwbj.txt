My friend you are coming off as so ignorant and selfish. Truly naive like a child. We are running out of resources on this planet. Worst inflation in 40 years. Health care and higher education is a scam that bankrupts you after one surgery. Covid cases skyrocketing again. More than half of millennials love with their family because they cant afford to live on their own.

Why don't you want a world where everyone is granted equal opportunity? Capitalism by definition means stepping on those around you and sacrificing them for your benefit.

Just because you are okay with hurting others to succeed and you have money, you really dont care about making the system better to others? I'm the one trying to initiate necessary and helpful change. I speak out for green and progressive candidates meanwhile you want to do nothing and watch the world slowly collapse, encouraging a system that has so obviously failed us by 2021 standards. 

And for the record I am a rich man thanks to bitcoin. I actually don't have have work at all. But I choose to oyt my wealth toward making the world a better place anyway. 

Hopefully you will become a good person too someday.
