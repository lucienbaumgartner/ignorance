Hey, I'm half Italian and I live in Italy since I was a kid and I can assure you this is absolutely possible, a similar thing happened to me some years ago and I'm not even biologically a female (but at the time I didn't know, rip). Sure, he hasn't been forced with violence, but the situation forced him to present in a feminine way. Idk how it is in other countries, but Italian relatives are shit. They are most of the times really close minded, ignorant and religious and consider it weird if you are a 20 female and you don't use make-up. He said, in a comment, that his family basically ignores that he's trans and treats him like his agab, so he just didn't want to upset his family so he avoided every problem presenting in a feminine way.
