This sub seems really small compared to other mental illness subs like the ED ones. I wonder why it is. The one for botched plastic surgeries is pretty huge, it seems that there is an awful number of people with BDD out there (many undiagnosed and unaware of it) and it's really sad to see how small this sub is and how little support (or not support at all) we receive.
