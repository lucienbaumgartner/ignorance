&gt;Culture War issues that impact .1% of the population

Democrats don't do this.

&gt;Making every white person out to be a racist.

Nor do they do this.

&gt;Making people who commit crimes the real victims

Nor do they do this.

&gt;Running on laxed borders to thinking that’ll get the Hispanic vote, when they don’t even want that.

Nor do they do this.

&gt;Student loan forgiveness, which most Americans outside Twitter and Reddit disagree with, particularly those in areas where they need to make inroads as a party.

This needs to happen and you're just flat wrong about it. The majority of Americans support blanket loan forgiveness. 

&gt;Having your primary runner up literally call himself a socialist.

There is nothing wrong with being a socialist and only someone who is uneducated and ignorant of what socialism is would have a problem with it.

&gt;Having blue areas pass stupid feel good bills that promote crime, like not prosecuting petty thefts and eliminating cash bail.

Democrats don't do this. 

&gt;Goal post moving on minimum wage. Nearly all agree it needs to go up, but most don’t think $15 is realistic.

Anyone that thinks $15 isn't realistic is again uneducated on and ignorant of the issue. 

Seeing as most of what you said is blatantly false and the rest of it betrays a POV in direct conflict with simple empirical evidence on fairly simple issues, I'd say that Republican propaganda is precisely the issue. 

Someone would have to be intentionally dishonest or drunk on misinformation to say that what you wrote here is a fair depiction of the Democratic party.
