&gt; I don't think you're bothering to read my replies anymore and have just resorted to knee jerk reactions.

I did read your reply but you said you draw your line at people so I understood it as you think it's morally wrong.

&gt; I already said my aversion to eating people isn't that it's wrong but more so weird.

So you're saying it would be ethical to have farmed humans as long as they were happy and died an instant death? I don't want to misunderstand your or strawman you, but I mean this stance makes it hard for us to have common ground. You're saying murder and possession of humans is ethical as long as the human is happy and unaware of their death. 

&gt; So are you going to become a Jain then? We seem to agree that it's the most ethical path to take for the majority of cases.

No, we don't. I agree that exploiting bees for pollination is wrong and will do my best to stop supporting it and I agree that we should try to minimize crop deaths as much as possible. I don't agree that plants themselves shouldn't be killed. 

Will you stop paying for animal products since we both know that the animals in the supermarket, in restaurants or even in local farmers markets didn't live a happy life, were abused in many ways and were killed in slaughterhouses where they knew what was coming?
