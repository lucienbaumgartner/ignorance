God I absolutely hate shit like this. It's so deeply classicist and ignorant of that fact. I could write out a whole analysis here but I don't really want to. I've just heard that this era of British broadcast was marred by deep, deep aesthetic classicism underpinned by the idea that the entirety of the country was "middle-class" now, which was true precisely in its aesthetics (what was acceptable living). This bit reads to me as a bunch of ignorant, middle-class British people clowning on illiterate Americans for laughs, with the horrible underpinning of national head-up-your-own-ass pride that "we are not THIS absolutely stupid in the UK!" If you want a good dialectical analysis of this, Folding Ideas' video on chicken nuggets is a really good starting piece about it. Mind you-- these people are stupid, but it's intensly descriptive of the character of a person and of an institution to characterize it like this-- even of me to call them "stupid". "This", though, as in for laughs with moral superiority inherently tied to it rather than anything better (even a misguided spiritual lamentation would at least reveal your own troglodyte attitudes).
