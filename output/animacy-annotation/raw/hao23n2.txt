All my shadow people tend to look like they don't notice I'm there, like they're just chilling and unaware of my presence.

Although one time I saw a shadow man, he looked at me and then started dancing ðŸ˜­ I text my friend "ayo dis mf got some slick moves" but it was in dph language so he didn't understand it.

I see the spiders allllllll the time tho, I saw a huge one crawl up my dog, then they both disappeared and I just sat there confused for 10 minutes, it was maybe the size of a of two hands, but fuck seeing one the size of the building... helllllll noooooooo.
