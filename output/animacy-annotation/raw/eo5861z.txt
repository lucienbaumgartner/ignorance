I dated a guy for a while who was so selfish, and ignorant, that he constantly brought my self esteem down to better his. I won't go into detail but at the end I would be crying in the bathroom, while he either ignored me or basically told me I deserved it. Its a lonely, isolating feeling and it makes you feel like no one likes you, and youre unworthy. 

But now I'm in a loving relationship with so much confidence. My life is going great, I've met new friends, new talents. You'll get there. It'll take a little time but in 6 months and a year you'll look back and be like "wow what a shit show. It's made me who I am today but I'm so glad, and I feel so strong, for leaving". You now get to discover yourself, make your own decisions, and you no longer have that anxiety about his phone or what app he's on. You're free! 

Now's a good time to lean into something positive you haven't leaned into yet. Really focus on school, or a job/get a small job, or really lean into some friendships you have neglected. Cry out the breakup and don't bottle it, it's okay to feel. But you are worthy, you made a good choice, and you'll be a strong and independent woman again like before this mess, or even moreso. Message me if you wanna talk or anything!
