I had this happen to me. It was a couple,  I told them that they were arrogant and ignorant, that there was no official language in the US. They respond by telling me to “go back home” I asked them how long their family has been in the US. They said since the 1920s. I told them  that my family has been here on this land since before The Gadsden Purchase, way before it was the United States, so this was my, “land” before theirs and to fuck off and go back to their homeland.”
