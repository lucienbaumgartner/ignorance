Yes, youre an old man. Shocker. You yearn for things of the past, like an old man. "BaCk iN mY dAyS" looking ass old man. Also, im not a child, im 19, mongrel. Like you said, i got my rights. Call me disrespectful, ignorant and horrible all you want, your old, your time will pass, while the youngins destroy all that you love, you old geezer. And dont bring up my parents in that light or imma smack the shit of you and your old wheelchair, need medical assistance having ass. 4.0 gpa, best college in my country, while youre in here, moping about how "present bad, past good". Go fuck yourself, not memeing. And i dont care if my vocabulary is like a barbarian while yours is like Shakespeare, you wannabe smart guy. Yyoure still catching these hands, and i hope you got that insurance. Ah, what am i saying, of course you do. You bought insurance when it was worth dimes on a dollar.
