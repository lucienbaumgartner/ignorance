It makes previous generations look like monsters just because they were trying to protect their families by segregating, harassing, assaulting, and killing people because of their skin color. Please don’t teach our children that they come from a long line of bigots and Christian hypocrites, and that we’re too stuck on some of the traditions that they passed down because they both make us feel safe and entitled, even though they are still racist. It’s our right and freedom as deemed by our country that we are all created equal, but some of us are more equal and you shouldn’t be allowed to take that away from us by forcing our children to be better educated, less ignorant, and knowledgeable about the facts of history.
