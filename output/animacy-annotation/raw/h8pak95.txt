So what, they only wanted to send virgins to fight and die for their country? 

Moronic virginity checks before marriage, ok, stupid as fuck, misogynistic and ignorant of how female bodies work, but you still can see *how* they are thinking.

The military only wanting virgins though - how does that even compute?
