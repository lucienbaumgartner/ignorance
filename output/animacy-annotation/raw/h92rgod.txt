What I expect from someone with a fucking large platform like her you ask? Maybe to at least ONCE acknowledge the shit that other people are going through in this pandemic and to DO THE RIGHT THING aka wear a fucking mask to protect themselves and most importantly others (we all saw on her stories they don’t so that).
Her whole attitude toward the pandemic, being like „im so uninformed“ or „i guess there were outbreaks“, has been so selfish and ignorant that people are upset about it. And rightfully so, since she could actually use her platform to raise awareness and encourage the right behaviour in these times.
