Booth is incredibly closed minded. I'm on season 11 of a rewatch and some of the seasons that I loved when they originally aired were almost impossible to get through because of how bigoted he was in the early seasons. He grows as the show progresses but even then I have been quite disenchanted by Booth this rewatch.

Angela is quite honestly the worst chatacter on the show. She could leave and there wouldn't be much of a difference.. She adds nothing. She's needy, whiny and inappropriate. Her whole "I'm an artist and belong in Paris" shtick was the worst. Didn't like her when it originally aired and she's worse on the rewatch.

Brennan... Oh Brennan... Such a love/hate relationship. She's very high and mighty. There's a difference between being unapologetic about your beliefs/where you stand on issues and being rude and not apologizing for being an ass when someone else ends up being right. She never learns that difference. It also bothers me that as an anthropologist (and her constant reminding) who has a deep understanding of different cultures and social normS she is so dismissive of anything she can't relate to. In one breath she defends cannibalism as a sacred ritual for some cultures but laughs at the fact that booth believes in God. How can you be a professional in the field if you are so judgemental and ignorant of your own culture?? I love her but I don't always *like* her.
