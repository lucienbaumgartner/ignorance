This bothers me too.
Is information widely accessible though? For everyone? Just asking the question. The media we consume controls the narrative. The things we buy determine the ads we see, which determines the posts we see, the channels we watch determine the kind of "news" we see, which shapes our political viewpoints, which shapes what we buy and how we consume. We all create our own echo chambers online.

Applying real critical thinking in the face of this can be a real challenge. An alternative is to simply opt out, in which case we are kept ignorant and unaware. That does seem like an easier way of living, it actually seems like the path of least resistance for being a human in this day and age. I think that goes a long way in explaining why democracy is so broken in Western society, and why we have the political leaders we do right now.

"Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'"
-Isaac Asimov
