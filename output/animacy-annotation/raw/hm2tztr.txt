Ok I hate the this narrative that Targaryen fans like to spin that Dany did the North a favour. She did not. The fight against White Walkers was a fight to save all of humanity, including herself. Not just the North.

If anything, it is the North who did everyone a favour by making them aware of the situation. If not for them, everyone would be caught unprepared and unaware and dead against the Night King.

Dany did the North no favour at all. It was a fight for her own survival. The only favour she did was to Jon, when she stupidly flew across the wall to save himâ€¦ and that was a personal favour coz she was hot for him.
