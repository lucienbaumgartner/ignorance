Of course I'm thinking purely through numbers and stats; we're discussing balance. OP is asking why the monk is considered underpowered which means they're asking about numbers and stats. 

RP isn't able to be balanced as you mentioned here, so discussing it is moot. All classes have loads of way to be RP'ed and RP is always dependent on the player so WoC cannot really balance around it outside of maybe providing some ribbon abilities to RP around. 

While the game obviously has an RP focus to disregard the numbers and stats is, in my opinion, very short-sighted and ignorant of the way people play the game. Many people, even in DnD, do not want to be playing a character that feels a lot worse than their teammates when it comes to damage output, combat usefulness, etc. This is what is being discussed here, the shortfallings Monk has that can make the class mechanically weaker than the other martials without the DM setting up specific opportunities for it to shine. 

I apologise if I sound confrontational, but I don't really see why balance has to be disregarded just because there is also RP. If the classes were more balanced in regards to numbers and stats you can RP just as well as you always have, and balancing the Monk class changes nothing in regards to RP. I always found this line of thinking quite selfish as it sounds like "I don't really care for balance, so don't balance the game" when, quite obviously, a lot of people do care for balance AND RP.
