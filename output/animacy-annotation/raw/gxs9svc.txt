Blood test, hormonal test or intolerance/allergy test might suit you. I struggled (and still do) for years with diet and changed it around so many times trying to figure it out. Only thing that helped for me was introducing particular supplements and vitamins and cleansing products with specific ingredients that I needed. I have noticed a massive change in my skin and recovery, I now for the first time in my life feel somewhat positive about the future of my skin. It’s very frustrating and ignorant of people to simply brush off a constant struggle you have to deal with by saying ‘oh just fix your diet’ or ‘oh just wash your face’.
