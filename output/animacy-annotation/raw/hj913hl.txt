She sounds like a nightmare honestly. I think you guys dealt with this in a nicer way than I would have. 

She is a freeloading, unaware, and selfish person when it comes to the rooming situation. Her boyfriend isn’t better either. And don’t worry about them holding a grudge, nearly everyone else is in your side THEY are the outliers here. 

I would make things as uncomfortable for them as I can.
