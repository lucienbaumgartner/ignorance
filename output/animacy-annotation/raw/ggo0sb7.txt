Apologies for any mistakes, I’m on mobile and this is my first time writing 

I (25f) currently work as a vet tech at a local family owned animal hospital. I started there October 2019 and they were short staffed even then, Covid hit shortly after and even more people were unable to work. Everybody works 4 ten hour days so there’s always a day with somebody missing, I work until 2 pm everyday. The hospital has only had to shut down for one day since this all started and the appointments have not stopped coming in, there are exams booked out weeks in advance and the wait list is long. We hired Debra (60f) in July 2020 and Andy (30sm)in November. 

I’m an easygoing person and I get along well with everyone including the other techs, doctors, receptionists, and the kennel attendant, but Debra drives me nuts. 

She’s genuinely a nice person and works earnestly but she’s also constantly undermining me, questioning my decisions, and doing the wrong thing at the wrong time so I end up doing a majority of the treatment work while she does laundry or fills prescriptions. 
She’s also very slow and unaware of what’s happening on the schedule. 

Debra has been a tech for longer than I have (which is admittedly not very long), but there are concerning gaps in her technical skills and medical knowledge. She’s terrible with blood draws and injections, she doesn’t know how to do cystocentesis (using an ultrasound and a really long needle to get a sterile urine sample through the bladder) or shoot good x-rays, can’t enter charges and labs properly, and I’ve been bitten while she was restraining an animal. It’s been five months and I still feel like I have to babysit her and hold her hand through the simplest tasks because I can’t trust the quality of her work. I’ve brought up my concerns with management a few times but nothing much has changed. I also feel bad because she’s older and does need a little more time with certain tasks. I try my best to focus on my own work and I try not to care about whatever she’s doing but her mistakes can affect the flow of the entire day. 

I don’t like finding myself adopting an “I don’t care” attitude and I accepted a new job as an ER tech today and gave my notice. Me leaving will significantly impact my current hospital since I work closely with the practice owner/DVM and tech for a majority of her exams, I also monitor surgeries and dentals on certain days. I know I don’t have an obligation to stay but vet med is a tight knit community. 

I feel bad for leaving in the middle of a pandemic because I don’t want to work with Debra anymore. AITA
