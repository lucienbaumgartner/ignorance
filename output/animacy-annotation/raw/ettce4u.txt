Yeah, it’s not like the media did a piss poor job of covering policy or showed an empty Trump podium while she gave one of the most impressive foreign policy speeches of her campaign.

Frankly her being not Trump was good enough for me. Sad the American people are so gross and ignorant that it wasn’t enough for them.
