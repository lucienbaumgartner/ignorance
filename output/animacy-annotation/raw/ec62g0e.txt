That’s kinda what I was worried about with the whole carrying thing even if I was legally allowed. This was by far the dumbest criminal I have ever seen. both of my parents had their phones in their hands the entire time and he didn’t even say anything. On top of that he kept such a far distance and paid so little attention that both of my parents would of had a easy clear shot. He was just so unaware and sloppy just the fact he had a gun in his hand made him a threat. He could have accidentally shot someone at any time
