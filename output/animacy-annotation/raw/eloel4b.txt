*direct* democracy can be criticised for that but America is not a direct democracy because it is a Representative democracy.  (please don't give me that "b-b-buh muh constitutional republic" line, they can be both at the same time).

But if one was to hop over the point virtually every single libertarian would be in favour of electoral reform to make their respective institutions more representative and more democratic. The difference I've found between American and other libertarians is that American ones are so fucking stupid that they struggle to even comprehend the very basic principals of democracy and it's different variations without shifting immense goalposts. They are also so fucking brain dead and ignorant that they consistently fail to understand that other voting systems exist out there in the world that differ from FPTP.
