I think the Morgan/Kass feud actually improved both of them as characters. They both got hilarious soundbites about each other, and Kass herself said that Morgan didn't bother her because she ultimately was a harmless pillow who was too *lazy*/apathetic to antagonise anybody.

Kass's SPV about Morgan was one of the best: "Morgan is an old dog that nobody wants to take out of its misery, the lazy one that lounges around and should be put down".

And the thing that clicked for me regarding Morgan was when Kass herself said on RHAP that Morgan bothered her the least out of everybody (Kass reportedly had way more fights with Spencer/Tony) because "nobody can take what Morgan says seriously: she says these strange things, then shrugs, and eats papayas to sustain her papayas -- personally, I think she's a joke and a harmless one who adds to the season by being ridiculous".

Morgan is basically Heidi in that way: Christy-Kass may not have liked them, but these conceited women are way too unaware and earnest in their convictions to be anything if not comical. Female spins on the male archetype of "Drew-esque egotists who think they're amazing but are jokes".
