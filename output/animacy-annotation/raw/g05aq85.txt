My top list worst roads and drivers, so far:

1. Bosnia - the worst tunnels in my life. No light, holes, water... Drivers are not mean, they are jusy clumsy and unaware that you are cycling next to them.
2. Western Romania, along with border with Serbia - bad roads, lot of trucks that pays no attention to you, drivers that respects no rules, semi suicidale mission  on a bicycle.
3. Serbia - Very bad roads, no respect for the rules, extremely clumsy and annoying drivers, corrupt police, combo ðŸ˜‚
