It seems extremely easy for people who regard themselves as good, and truly believe they are good, right and doing the right thing, to be subverted into being truly evil, ironically blind and unaware of their own self righteousness and hubris as to act in complete opposition of how they believe they are. 

Itâ€™s mental gymnastics, and we are witnessing it happening in real time on this website. Whats ironic is these people think politicians, pharmaceutical reps, doctors, scientists, anyone, is above this kind of depraved mentality.
