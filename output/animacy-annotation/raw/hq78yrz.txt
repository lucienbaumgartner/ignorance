&gt;So please piss off with your stupid ignorant and blatantly Hinduphobic statements. 
Wow. Me, casually calls out against ALL religious discrimination, becomes "Hinduphoic". Great interpreting skills man. 

&gt;India has been a Hindu nation for thousands of years
And did you really think that would've stayed like that for the rest of time. People migrate to different countries and continents throughout history. That is how different societies are formed. I'm not normalising invasions or genocide, but if we take any history around the world invasions have been going on from the beginning of man itself. But most of us evolved as a civilized species and learned to co exist now. So just because some people stupid fanatics who belonged to some different sect invaded us in the past doesn't mean we have to go around wiping out the entire group who follows the same religion now. It's just humanly wrong. Be better than those stupid people from the past.

&gt;And it was during those times that India was the richest, most prosperous nation in the entire world. It was Hinduism and it's way of life that led to such prosperity.
And do you think everything perfect back then also? No discrimination or any kind? No casteism? No colourism? No discrimination based on rich and poor? No fights against different kingdoms, clans or groups? Everything was picture perfect before these barbaric Muslims and Christian set foot on this peaceful land? I'd say you're the one who's "stupid ignorant" if you really think so. Nothing was ever prosperous anywhere. Humans have been fighting like this since the beginning of time. Ever since they started forming different clans and groups. But now we are more intelligent and developed than them and we  truly have a chance to put the past behind us and co exist as a society.
