I am in no way experienced in social engineering by any means but I believe the first two steps would be:

•1. To mandate Native American studies in the early years in order to influence a contagion of apathy and understanding into the barbaric means the native peoples were terrorized with. I put this 1st because too many people seem unaware and unconcerned with the social problems Native Americans face. 

•2. All treaties and agreements be honored with priority and a focused and honest determination to complete agreements with any ongoing land disputes. 

The Native people have to experience an acceptance that is trustworthy and lasting. A willingness to believe in them and a show of desire to learn some of their knowledge.   

I've grown up living right next to a reserve and my life has always been integrated with native people. I can say as a witness there is an abundance of racism and separatism that exists, by pure ignorance, in the minds of many. But not all, and that gives great hope. There are beautiful people and evil people in all races. I don't understand why that is so difficult for some people to grasp.
