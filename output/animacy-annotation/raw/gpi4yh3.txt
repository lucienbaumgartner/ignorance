NTA. Your girlfriend survived cancer, she gets to look however tf she wants to look (which is true without having survived cancer as well). Your family is more pressed about her hair than her well-being and self love. Iâ€™m sorry theyâ€™re being so vapid and shallow. I am so, so happy you stayed in with your gf and had a nice day to yourselves. If your family continues giving you an awful time about any of this you have every right to go low-to-no contact with them. They are sounding really toxic and unaware of how hard cancer is. Please keep taking care of yourself and your gf, it sounds like you all have something genuine ðŸ’—
