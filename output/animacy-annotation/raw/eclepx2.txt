&gt;I guess you can credit him for being honest, and he is looking for help with it, so I donâ€™t want to shit on him....This person seems like the uncommon person who does that. 

In what way did I suggest this person isn't allowed to be human, isn't working on himself? I feel like I pretty clearly said I credit him for working on himself, and that what I am really worried about is that many male therapists with a similar "fantasy" (or other fantasies based in gendered power dynamics) aren't working on themselves, because they see nothing wrong with themselves. In the end a fantasy like this harms these clients if one is unaware and unable to check themselves -- and how many men check themselves? I do not want to be harmed by my therapy as it is very expensive, lol. I don't want to pay to be the female object of a heterosexual male fantasy. So this post provoked some anxiety in me.
