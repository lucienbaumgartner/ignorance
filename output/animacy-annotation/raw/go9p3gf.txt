You talk about how on each trip to the dark tower Roland is hopefully making character improvements and the reason he gets looped back is because he isn't who he needs to be yet to achieve control of the tower; yet you also talk about how he needs to realize choosing the tower is choosing damnation, so he needs to choose to quit the quest after saving the beams.

Is there a scenario for you guys where Roland learns the lessons he needs and develops his character enough where he achieves control of the tower? Why is the tower bothering to refine him if not to allow him access?

When I read through the series a second time, in my mind whenever Roland made comments about "I don't know how I know, I just know...", it was because he eventually reaches the tower and has knowledge or access to knowledge he wouldn't otherwise have. It would also allow him to project that knowledge from the tower to himself or the tet members when necessary, even if anonymously. Some examples are when he takes/knows the jawbones have magical properties but couldn't explain how he knows; and in the Dixie Pig when he speaks to Jake to get him moving - here especially there's no mention of Roland telling Eddie while they're in Maine that he contacted Jake telepathically nor was there much awareness of how the split up groups were doing, they seemed isolated and unaware of each other's progress, but that message could easily have come from a Roland sitting in the tower. What do you think?

P.S. Thank you both for this journey to the DT. You are so insightful and have illuminated so many things I didn't previously see on my trips to the tower. I look forward to Season 2 and beyond!
