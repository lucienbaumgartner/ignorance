Lol okay sure man ignore the rest of the world

I’m not making excuses you clown, I’m just saying that veganism on it’s own ain’t gonna solve shit and many people ACROSSS THE DAMN WORLD can’t afford it.   Again maybe you should realize your American microcosm doesn’t represent the world as a whole.   The world is crumbling.  We need change.   Just spouting that veganism is possible for everyone is simple minded and ignorant of the realities of the globe.    I have an anthropology degree and took a course on nutritional anthropology and we discussed this topic and adjacent topics in the class, and for many cultures veganism isn’t currently possible.
