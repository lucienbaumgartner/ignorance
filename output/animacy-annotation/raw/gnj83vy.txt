As an elder millennial I don’t let stupid stereotypes get to me because I understand that folks will always be judgmental towards folks in a different group than themselves. No generation has exclusive access to being shitty. Letting such silliness/shittiness aggravate me at all would only serve to drain my energy and focus from more suitable pursuits. If you’re so judgmental and ignorant that you have to judge folks based on what time period they were born in then that’s your loss. Lookin’ at you too, boomer-haters. Just everyone mind your own damn business and treat others how you want to be treated, or at least treat others how you wished you treated yourself.
