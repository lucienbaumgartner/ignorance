Ok I just saw from your profile that you’re in high school so I understand why you’re trying this whole “facts and logic” approach and throwing around the term strawman incorrectly. Your view of women as a group that “plays the victim” and “uses excuses” is very unhealthy for you and the people in your life. It’s simply not true and it tells me that you either haven’t had a significant relationship with a female, or you had one that went poorly and you’re immature enough to equate that person to their entire gender. I hate to say it bc I know when I was in high school I’d hate to hear it, but you have an extremely limited understanding of the social relationships between men and women, the different difficulties they face in life, and the history of extreme sexism that still clouds our social perceptions of periods. I just encourage you to be aware of your own limitations in understanding privilege as it can take a lifetime to fully comprehend your place in the world and the advantages you’ve had compared to others, no matter your age.

You have a lot of misguided ideas about women that will likely take awhile to resolve, so I encourage you to start now. Your comment about how women could just choose to bleed everywhere if they chose to and how men find periods “gross” just reflects how little you’ve thought about what having a period must be like. Like it’s genuinely just a ridiculously stupid take. You owe it to yourself, the women in your life, and your future romantic life to correct the sexist views you hold. Because you are sexist, that much is irrefutable. Making blanket statements about an entire gender “making excuses” and “playing the victim” is just ignorant and bigoted, I hope you grow to realize that.
