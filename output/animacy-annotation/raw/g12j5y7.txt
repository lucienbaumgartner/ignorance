Why on earth do so many answers to my questions or statements boil down to: "But what about Joe Biden? Hes senile and bad too." Can't people come up with rational arguments? No wonder your politics are so polarized, it all feels like a screaming match between preschoolers. Just because I think that Trump is a liar, incompetent, arrogant and ignorant that doesnt mean that I like Biden. And why are so many people being apologetic about their respective sides in politics all the time? It's like they are so polarized that they can't accept criticism of the guy they like and take it as a personal attack? End of rant
