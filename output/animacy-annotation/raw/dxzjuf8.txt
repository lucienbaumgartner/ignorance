The current plot thread goes down like this:

**Alaskan Deal:** Locke contracts the crew to oversee a weapons trade in Alaska with the Butcher, but double crosses them both to the FBI. The gang escapes on one of the Butcher's ships.

**Diamond Heist:** The gang robs the Garnet Group vault to cut off Locke's funding, as the Group still has ties to Murkywater. They bring in the art thief August "Duke" Lindhurst to help.

**Reservoir Dogs:** Bain sets up a job with the Cabot crime family in Los Angeles - a jewellery store hit. It turns out to be a police sting, and while Mr. Brown is killed the gang and the Dogs escape. However, Bain's hideout is raided, presumably by a secret group known as the Kataru, and he is captured or killed. He tells them to trust Locke before losing contact, and Locke tells the crew that the betrayal in Alaska was just a ruse to keep them out of Washington DC for a while.

**Brooklyn Bank:** Following a hint from Bain, and a clue from Duke, the gang hit a Harvest &amp; Trustee branch in Brooklyn to find an item buried in the bank's foundation.

**Breakin' Feds:** Locke discovers that the Kataru have Bain - or at the very least, his corpse - and are planning to trade him to Commissioner Garrett in exchange for a strange item in his possession. This item is related to the one the gang stole from Brooklyn, and possibly even the Dentist's loot from the Golden Grin. The gang sneak into the FBI headquarters to steal the item from Garrett's office before the deal goes down, though they have to make sure he remains alive and unaware.

And that's where we're at for now. Nothing new has come up about Kento, though Jiro has new safehouse lines where he believes the search for his son will come to an end soon.
