But humans don't just exist. I know I don't. I do things. Have opinions. Behave certain ways.

Those are the things that are worth judging. Being wealthy and uncritical and unaware of how lopsided our global economy is would count as something worthy of negative judgement in my mind.

&gt;There is 100% no reason to feel guilty for the sins of our forefathers

Do you denounce your forefathers or do you defend them? What institutions have they handed down to you? What resources? What legacy?

Sorry to break it to you but none of us can wash our hands that easily of what happened in the past. Even if you totally renounce the actions of your forefathers, that takes a lot of work, just look at all the work the Germans put in after WWII.

But few people ever renounce their forefathers and most carry on their legacy. Sometimes, uncritically. Which is something definitely worthy of condemnation.
