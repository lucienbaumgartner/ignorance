Yeah yeah, keep denying it. People like you just contribute to making the world a worse place by spreading racism. And I don't know what's worse, that you are pretending that you aren't racist, that there's the possibility that you are actually so stupid and ignorant that you don't even understand that you were saying racist things, or that you are just a troll wasting your pointless, pathetic existence inciting hatred and division in society.
