Will future generations look back at this year in absolute shock as to how stupid we were? 

I canâ€™t help but feel that this generation will go down in history as the most brainless, selfish , anti intellectual generation of all time.

All the information and education every required to fix so many problems, but so anti intellectual and ignorant that we just fuck it up more.
