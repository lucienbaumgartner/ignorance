I feel like they meant something along the lines of someone who said a slur because they were dumb and unaware of the meaning, versus someone who is actively trying to be offensive.

like for example, if you dig around my online history deep enough, you'll find comments from me that are...*fashy*...to say the least. I Believe i'm doing a good job in making sure i never fall down that hole again, but the worry looms that someone might, for lack of a better term, "expose" me, an ex-fash, versus someone who is actively participating in shit like that
