What are you even talking about? I'm not even complaining about stupid drivers that can't pay attention to what's happening around them, I just allow for everyone else being unaware and unable to react and keep myself out of danger that way, and I'm very happy ignoring the so called rules of the road so long as I don't endanger myself or others. 
No I'm not worried, I just can't stand pompous buffoons like yourself with your hackneyed trite petty bullshit crying about cyclists that cause less congestion and less accidents and less damage and less pollution than fat self righteous Clarksons the nation over.
