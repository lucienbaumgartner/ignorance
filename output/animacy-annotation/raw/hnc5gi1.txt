What you're describing sounds like a natural reaction when surrounded by people who don't align with your new views and self-awareness.  I went through a transitional phase where I walked away from a lot of relationships because they no longer aligned with my new way of living.  The other selves weren't wrong to be interested in gossiping, binge drinking, and chatting about things that have no relevance (etc.), it was just that I changed/evolved and no longer was interested in those topics.  The challenge, initially, was to not look upon the other selves as people who are ignorant and stupid.  I mean, isn't it obvious, in retrospect, that we are all one?  Of course it is, but until you're ready you won't see it.  In time, it's easier to be gentle and loving to those who are still asleep and unaware of our true nature.  What helped me was a time of isolation.  I lived alone.  Only interacted with people at yoga.  Spent a lot of time in the woods and walking under the stars.  As I strengthened, I was better able to love and accept that others do not think as I think.  Slowly, I became better at honoring "their" experience and perspective as a valuable instance of the infinite.  

I'd also encourage you to not judge yourself for reacting as you reacted, even when acting bitterly sarcastic.  This reaction is a way of rejecting what doesn't align to affirm what does.  As you strengthen, if you orient towards the positive polarity of non-judgement and love, then it will be easier to interact with those who are still asleep with feeling the need to judge or condemn them.  After all, most of us were asleep not too long ago and I would not wish to be judged by those who I sought to emulate.
