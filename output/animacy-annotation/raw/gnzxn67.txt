I mean corporate consumerist propaganda worked and was inculcated generationally. People ar dumb and unaware of the world and influences around them that govern and shape every facet of their lives. You become slaves to the system naturally because that's the "norm" nd that's the scariest part. Because then we seem like the ostracized and the lost because we're talking facts. 

We are ALL being duped, they're happy to have people fighting EACHOTHER over race or whether or not $15 fucking dollars MINIMUM should be allowed while people are shocked millions of people are sill making 7.25 an hour. 

It's disgusting when you really think about it for a minute. And we haven't even gotten to the fed yet and the corruption there with the manipulation of stock markets, lying inflation isn't here yet cost of everything is up and only increasing daily while package quality and quantity decreases, banks laundering criminal money openly while we all slave for billionaires like bezos, the corporations (wal mart, nestle, Amazon etc) and make them and their ceos richer while the world burns.
