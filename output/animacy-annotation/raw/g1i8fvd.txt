He Had A Family, he had something to life for, do you think he would just fought back knowing he more than likely would die?  
And the other one, the past is **PAST you just move on,** i'm a descendant of people from the andes that were slaved and i'm not wanting every white people to get killed because it's past it's history, it's like saying "we should kill all the jews to repair the middle eastern people", do you see how stupid and ignorant that sounds? the people in BLM most of them they just don't want more racism in the world, not some stupid ass shit like "kIlL aLL tHe wHItE peOPlE" 

People like you make seem the whole movement look bad and the worst thing of all is that you're not even black

Do you should be really talking about this? What would a black person think about this? a white female talking about something like this? ([where do i get you're female](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/i2a9je/as_a_female_im_disgusted_that_you_people_are/)) but that's most likely to be a lie, if you want to die that is suicidal thoughs call the suicide line  1-800-273-8255 if you're in the US, but don't undercover it as a "BLM issue" hell you can dm me if you want but for real don't post this type of dumb shit people will notice and research
