Sure, and I absolutely agree, but belittling an author like Jordan (whom I've admittedly have a nostalgic fondness for) and labeling Wheel of Time as a "paint by the numbers" piece of work, is obnoxious and ignorant of the impact of those books and the wealth of originality within them. Sure, the "farm boy is the chosen one" has been done to death, but much like the original Star Wars trilogy, there's a lot more to it than that. Sure, it doesn't have the complexity or scope of Malazan, but the books aren't written for the same audience either.

I'm not looking for conformation of my opinion, but criticism can be given a hell of a lot more eloquently, and a critic should be better than just: "This is the pinnacle of writing, this is trash". The entire review reeks of "I am very smart".

Finally: I honestly agree with him, in what I think he's trying to convey. Malazan was a revelation for me and brought back my love for fantasy, and yeah, if I read Wheel of Time today, there are passages that probably bore me and feel more predictable, but I will absolutely introduce them to my son and daughter, because it's a fantastic epic in it's own right.
