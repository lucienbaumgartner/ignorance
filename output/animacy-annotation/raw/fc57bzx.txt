We had a squirrel on campus that someone had fed french fries to, and it would follow people around, chittering and shit trying to get food out of them. It was not friendly. Youâ€™d be leaving your dorm, blissful and unaware, and then this fat demon squirrel would follow you, screaming bloody murder at you until you either have it food or ran away. 

We also had seagulls that would dive bomb people and take their sandwiches. College was fun.
