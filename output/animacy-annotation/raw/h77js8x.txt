No, you absolute walnut, I was reacting to the third aspect of language: social signaling.

You led by trying to demonstrate that respecting non-standard pronouns could be abused by a pompous ass demanding 25,000-letter pronouns, then demanded to know Where The Madness Will Stop. 

When I showed that childish gambit the respect it deserved, you began venting your paranoid persecution fantasies of a world where Big Jewish Trans makes you say 25,000-letter neopronouns in Yiddish or be accused of transphobic microantisemitism. 

What precisely am I to conclude from your continued antics? I'll give you  options:

1. You are a linguistic conservative offended by neologisms and you've decided to target one that's associated with a small subset of trans people instead of the countless neologisms created by every other part of society every day. In which case, why?

2. You're trying to build support for not using neopronouns for political reasons. Personally, I know all of two people who use neopronouns, and I know thousands of people, so if this is the case, I think your politics are weirdly specific and am not sure wtf those people did to you. In which case I'm judging you pretty hard. 

3. You're exhaustingly self-important and ignorant of basic sociolinguistics, and you want language to work like some kind of formal system instead of a messy complex mishmash with high stakes where you can really easily piss people off with ignorance and carelessness and suffer real social consequences for it, which is, uh, the fucking human condition for the last 11,000+ years. 

4. This isn't actually about language at all but about power in society, and you're trying to assert yours big-brain style because you feel threatened by an idea and need to jerk off on some strangers.
