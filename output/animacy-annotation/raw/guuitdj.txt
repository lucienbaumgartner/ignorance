Just what I fucking needed to see! I went CT 10 months ago from 10-12mgs Xanax a day completely uneducated and unaware of the consiquences it's been a long road and a steep learning curve I'm still not 100% yet but I am getting there and will come out the other side a stronger person, our greatest gifts can come from our most difficult times, thank you very much for those words and keep on trucking! much love brother x
