I know what he means though. Compressions aren’t the gold standard of care, they’re the very most basic expectation. You need to maintain circulation, that’s a given. But beyond that, all of the emphasis is on identifying and shocking shockable rhythms as quickly as possible, to the point where we have AEDs in pretty much every public place and civilians are expected to use them. It’s pretty ignorant and nonsensical to say shocking doesn’t save lives when it’s literally the most important treatment.
