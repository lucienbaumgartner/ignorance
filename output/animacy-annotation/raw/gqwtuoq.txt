I am not sure if you have misread my post, or have only focused on a few parts of it while ignoring the rest. Showing recorded facts and trends is not "pointing fingers and name calling". This post is not about defending a side, or labeling good guys and bad guys. This post is a look at what is happening, and where historically such actions have led to.

People like yourself who viewed this as a challenge to defend something, is exactly the type of person you seem to be accusing me of being. As long as your mentality exists; one that is eager to jump on to a team, and when caught with destructive and offensive action, makes a "call to unity" while blaming everyone else and changing nothing, then large conflicts will happen. "Both sides"-ing is not a solution here. Civil war is not inevitable but it is only such a high possibility because of people like yourself who un-apologetically commit to divisive behavior, and when called out, complain it is unfair to do so.

This was never a post against Conservatives or Republicans. This is not a post championing Democrats or Liberals. This post is a post against destructive behavior that leads to civil conflict. It is a post citing the results of bigotry and racism pushed through relentless propaganda from a person with a lot of political power. Which side it comes from is irrelevant. That fact that you defend it is worrying. As long as people like yourself are committed to uphold such behavior because it happens to come from your team colors, to jump to platitudes about harm coming to both sides while refusing to acknowledge that only one side is promoting harm, this outcome becomes a greater possibility. You are divisive and ignorant of the entirety of how a conflict unfurls.
