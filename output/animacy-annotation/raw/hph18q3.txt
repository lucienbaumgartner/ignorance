I need to ask this: Have you been in an emergency before? More so a natural disaster? No fucking way 99% of people would do the bare minimum. Most, if not trained or havent been exposed to such situations, will panic and will lose sight of what to do. And its natural that most will experience a panic.

Had to let that off, you sound like ignorant and naive
