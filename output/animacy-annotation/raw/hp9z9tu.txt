Oh dear - you want to talk about the correlation between deaths and GDP. Like people’s lives are less important than capitalism. 

Let’s talk about if Australia experienced similar statistics to the US. What would that look like for us? 

I did the math.

Approximately 3,800,000 would have been infected with covid.

Approximately 61,000 people would have died from covid directly.

And approximately 300,000 people would have been afflicted with long term covid, be permanently disabled and no longer able to contribute to GDP.

Now what would that do to our economy, hm? Make it better? I think not. 

Think carefully before you say such ignorant and disgraceful things.
