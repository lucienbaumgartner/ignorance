Exactly, because of this, because you have to follow the doctrine of the church, I myself would be an "ultra-Catholic", but I am not, I am someone who is not a hypocrite. I am the first to spread the values ​​of the church to the letter on this social network. But do a favor and don't call me a fool. If you notice I have said that they are called ultra-Catholic, etc., it is because of an annotation for someone interested in the subject, by the way, you have said that the term ultra-Catholicism as well as ultra-left and right are used in politics, so don't be stupid and ignorant and Read better, I have written that they were part of a government during the Franco dictatorship (their position was conservative, Catholic). I recommend that you read it again and do not answer the message again, I will not waste my time answering questions and absurd and annoying messages. God bless you...
