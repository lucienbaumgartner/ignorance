You’re really stupid and ignorant of literal science :) 

You said armpit hair was gross and unhygienic. Why is leg hair or eyebrow hair not unhygienic and gross?

You “think” shaving is more hygienic despite scientific evidence against that. Why do you believe it when it’s simply not true?

Not shaving your armpits is absolutely nothing like not using shampoo, toothpaste or soap :) we have hygiene reasons to use those - shampoo cleans your hair and removes oil / grease. Soap kills germs. Toothpaste protects your teeth from decay. Shaving doesn’t do any of the above, or provide anything helpful to the body, in fact, it’s more harmful to the body to shave. 

tampons are actually unhealthy too - pads have a much lesser risk of TSS. Period pants are even better. 


I’m annoyed because you insist other women are somehow gross and unhygienic for listening to actual scientific evidence, instead of nodding your head like a good little doggy for a fucking razor company of all things.
