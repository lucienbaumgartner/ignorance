-Hillary Clinton took money from and supported nations that she knew funded ISIS and terrorists

&gt;“Clintons should know better than to raise money from folks whose primary concern has been supporting the NIAC, a notorious supporter of the Radical Islamic Mullahs. "The Clinton’s have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cash...putting money ahead of principle.”

-Hillary has a public position and a private position on many on policy matters

&gt;"But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position.”

-Paying people to incite violence and unrest at Trump rallies

&gt;"I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these ass holes to pop off, it’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know? You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you."

-Bribery: King of Morocco gives Clinton Foundation $12 million
to have meeting with Hillary, 6 months later Morocco gets weapons

&gt;“condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter. CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.”

-Hillary's campaign wants "unaware" and "compliant" citizens

&gt;“And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”

-Top Hillary aides mock Catholics for their faith

&gt;[to be a Catholic is] "an amazing bastardization of the faith. They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations”

-Latinos are "needy". Latino outreach is "taco bowl engagement"

&gt;"Needy Latinos and 1 easy call.”

-Rigging the primaries against Bernie Sanders (DNC favored Hillary)

&gt;“Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess. Specifically, DWS [DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz] had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign to do things because they’d either ignored or forgotten to something critical.”

&gt;“[Bernie is] someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.”

&gt;“He isn't going to be president.”

&gt;“[F]or KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”

&gt;“If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct. They’ll probably complain regardless, actually."
