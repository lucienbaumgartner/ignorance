After everything that came out yesterday i was leaning more towards, "okay he might have acted inappropriately, but it does seem like its being blown out of proportion." But seeing this? Nah, im 100% back on the "fuck this guy" train. Entitled, bigoted, delusional little shit. The funny part is, hes most likely so sheltered and unaware that he really does believe the majority of his generation supports trump. I doubt hes got much of a clue what the real world is like outside of his rich, pretty much all white school.
