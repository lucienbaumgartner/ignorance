&gt;so are the folks with mask exemptions also imbeciles

As a healthcare professional, I can tell there are very, very few good reasons to have a mask exemption. Even when you have one, you still have to respect the rest of sanitary measures.

&gt;or the people rthat cant get the jab? would you call them imbeciles

The people who can't get vaccinated are the reason all the others should get vaccinated. This is the best way to protect them. This is also common knowledge which you have decided to overlook like most unscientific people who only believe what suits them.

&gt;also, science is fallible.
  

  
history will show you are picking the wrong team

Science is not fallible, humans are. In this case however, so many humans studying the same thing and arriving at the same conclusions are extremely unlikely to be failing at coming to the right conclusions. You are in denial of something you don't understand because you don't have the knowledge, yet you are so certain you're right without any knowledge of the matter nor proof of your claims. This is exactly why the government feels you need to be controlled, because you obviously cannot make the right choices by yourself. You're an ignorant and selfish child putting others at risk and as such, your privileges are being taken away. When you actually want to be a responsible adult, they'll give them back to you.
