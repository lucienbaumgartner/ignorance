You're saying the same thing I am there. That quote literally says:

 Generally, all vasectomy procedures can be safely performed with local anesthesia alone. 

And I said: 

You are under an anesthetic. Just not one that knocks you out.

The difference is:
local anaesthesia is where a small area of the body is numbed and you remain fully conscious â€“ often used during minor procedures. general anaesthesia is where you're totally unconscious and unaware of the procedure

I don't see what I said wrong here, can you explain? 

I also said I think it's worse to be awake when your testicles get snipped. Sorry, but that feels true to me.
