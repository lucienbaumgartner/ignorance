His argument against Veganism is identical to his argument for voting for Biden and its such massive cognitive dissonance I wonder if its just that he emotionally dislikes Vegans.

Also, he said the other day that Jewish isn't a race. That is completely wrong, by that logic the Holocaust wasn't racist and neither are anti Jewish Neo Nazis.

Its the same logic the right uses for "Islam isn't a race so hating Muslims isn't racist"

Racialisation proves both of these things to be false and ignorant of the way people use race.
