A very famous book has a scene very much like this, so reading it might give you some insight: [Hyperion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion).

Given what I know of the book, and other modern day cognates, let me try to explain what the quote says to me. Do you know about fundamentalist Christians in the US that try to bring about the apocalypse through their actions? These people foment war and suffering so they can bring about the apocalypse. Why? Because they believe that if they bring about the apocalypse that it will cause events to happen that are detailed in the Christian Bible. The gist of it is: the righteous (meaning good Christians) will go to heaven and the rest will be damned to a Hell on Earth. These people are fucking nuts, but they capture the feeling I get from this quote.

Imagine someone, a man by implication in the quote, who has nothing or has lost everything. This person has been driven mad by his losses and sheer amount of suffering he's been through. He, in his madness, wants vengeance. He wants things to change so that he can be on top. So he prays for storms. Storms could be literal storms, or they could be great change, or war, etc. Things that would upset the status quo. He's got nothing left to lose, so he wants to watch the world burn; because anything is better than what he's living through now.

Now, to do a bit of ripped from the headlines, imagine a simple man doing what his ancestors have been doing for many years in the past. He's  a laborer, maybe a farmer, something like that. Suddenly he doesn't have a job anymore because of the "global economy" whatever that is; he doesn't understand. Suddenly he doesn't have anything, or so he convinces himself. Where's the pride in his work? Where's the respect and the money he used to get for doing his job? He hears from others that others overseas and far away have taken his job. He also sees immigrants coming to his country and taking skilled labor; nothing he can do or understand. But they, they get the respect and the money he used to have. So, he wishes for a great change to take place to force the world back into the world he knew. In his madness, he prays for storms. And he thinks that those storms will bring him peace; that is, make it so that he can have what he thinks is his again.

These men, cast in a modern light, are the poor and ignorant that are getting left behind by modern economies that have no place for them. These are your Trump voters, your Brexit Leave voters, etc. These are your arrogant simple people that just want back what's "their's". If that means a lot of other people pay the price, they don't care. They can't care, they don't understand. In their madness, they get their storms, imagining it will bring them peace. But all they  get is ash.
