Some of the revelations the leaked Hillary emails brought are below. Some of them are just crooked bullshit. Others are outright illegal, with evidence of wrongdoing.

**Hillary has public positions on policy and private ones**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927

“But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position.”


This leak is a big one because anything she tells us that she will do can and should be considered questionable. Whenever Hillary tells the public a position, a goal, or what she will do for America, there is no way we can be sure if she has an opposite, private position.

This was one of her private paid $225,000 speeches to Wall Street. Behind closed doors she is telling her Wall Street donors one thing, and the American people another thing.

**Paying people to incite violence and unrest at Trump rallies**

“Engage immigrant rights organizations. DREAMers have been bird dogging Republican presidential candidates on DACA/DAPA, but they’ve learned to respond. There’s an opportunity to bird dog and record questions about Trump’s comments and connect it to the policy.”

“It doesn’t matter what the friggin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker” (from https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY video of Clinton paid staff)

"I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these ass holes to pop off, it’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know? You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you."

"Bird-dogging" is a term coined by high level Clinton staffers who openly talk about it in the video.  They boast about inciting violence at Trump rallies, paying for every “protest”, manipulating Americans through the media to think that Trump is dangerous, and tricking people into thinking Trump supporters are violent and bad.

They laugh about paying off mentally ill and homeless people for years to incite violence against conservatives.  Truly despicable.  And they pretended to be Bernie supporters while they were "protesting".

They admit to starting the Chicago riot where police were seriously hurt, and admit to shutting down the freeway in Arizona, partnering with Black Lives Matter. We even haveproof that Hillary paid people to shut down the Chicago rally.

Inciting a riot is illegal under 18 US Code § 2102.

They also think 50% of people in Iowa and Wisconsin are racists, as they state in the video.

Robby Mook, Clinton Campaign Manager, mentions the Priorities SuperPAC in a leak, which is implicated in the video.

Bob Creamer (who was fired) claims in the video that the campaign knew about everything.  Bob Creamer visited the White House 340 times and personally met with Obama 45 times.

**Hillary's campaign talks of need to re-evaluate how they approach their previous "unaware" and "compliant" base**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599

“And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking – and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”


 **Hillary deleted her incriminating emails. State covered it up. Asked about using White House executive privilege to hide from Congress.**

"They do not plan to release anything publicly, so no posting online or anything public-facing, just to the committee."

"That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over. It also includes emails that HRC had that Sid didn't.”

“Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will.”

"We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of."

"That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over."

The State Department was:

(1) Coordinating with the Clinton political campaign.

(2) Colluding with the press to spin it positively.

(3) Doing so BEFORE they released it to AN EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Clinton campaign was always a step ahead of the committee investigating them. Shameful.

Nick states "Just spoke to State" He goes on to reveal that State colluded with him about which emails are being revealed to committee and that the State plans to plant a story with AP.

Shows intent to withhold emails from the subpoena.

 **Bribery: King of Morocco gives Clinton Foundation $12 million to have meeting with Hillary, 6 months later Morocco gets weapons**

http://www.army-technology.com/news/newsus-approves-157m-tow-missile-system-sale-to-morocco-4736092

“condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter. CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.”

“She created this mess and she knows it… HRC said she’s still considering.”

State Department tried to bribe FBI to un-classify Clinton emails (FBI docs)

https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view

http://nypost.com/2016/10/17/state-department-brokered-deal-with-fbi-to-declassify-clinton-emails/

“[Redacted] indicated he had been contacted by [Kennedy], Undersecretary of State, who had asked his assistance in altering the e-mail’s classification in exchange for a ‘quid pro quo,’”

“[REDACTED] believes STATE has an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the CLINTON e-mails in order to protect STATE interests and those of CLINTON,”

"[Redacted] advised that, in exchange for marking the email unclassified, STATE would reciprocate by allowing the FBI AGENTS to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden."

Hillary Clinton dreams of completely “open trade and open borders”

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmFhxFke

“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders”


This was stated at one of her $225,000 paid secret speeches to Wall Street that she has tried desperately to hide… This email contains those speeches in those attachments.


During the 3rd debate, Hillary tried to pivot away from this damning topic by stating she only meant energy. Read the quote for yourself, energy is just one aspect of her open borders policy.

 **Hillary Clinton took money from and supported nations that she KNEW funded ISIS and terrorists**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828

“…the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.”

“Clintons should know better than to raise money from folks whose primary concern has been supporting the NIAC, a notorious supporter of the Radical Islamic Mullahs. "The Clinton’s have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cash…putting money ahead of principle.”

Hillary's Chief of Staff admits in the 2nd link that foreign interests sway Hillary to do what they want her to do (money for mandatory appearances).  She also admits that the "Friend of Hillary" list is available and rentable to people who want to influence, but that it’s too sensitive to talk in email.

This leak shows Hillary knows Saudis and Qatar are funding ISIS, which is an enemy of the state.  After knowing this, Hillary accepted tens of millions in donations from these terrorist-funding governments (of course they are getting something back in return). She also supported arms deals to them.


These are just a FEW things the emails revealed. There are many more. Not even all of them are public yet.
