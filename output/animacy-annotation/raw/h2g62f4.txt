Do you even know what a race is?

Most white people aren't rednecks, most white Americans aren't even rednecks. Just like most Australians aren't bogans.

That you can't see 400 years of abuse by a governments that were 99%+ white people wouldn't breed distrust in the African community to authority figures is just stupidity.

That you're trying to deny the points I've been making by feebly grasping for anything that could be interpreted as a racial slur (as pathetic and ignorant of the word as that may be) says this conversation has gone past the point of value.

Had no value at all actually.
