Ok I owe you a better response than what I gave you. 

&gt;Not to mention the people’s stubborn inability to understand that billionaires play a different game.

Yeah so? They didn't play a different game to become billionaires, apart from taking risk. Most business fail within first year. That is why we have so *few* billionaires (cca 600). Most of them (2/3) are self made. And you know what? If you would become one, you would act exactly the same, don't be fooled by your self righteousness. Everyone dislikes paying taxes, and at least you have a progressive income tax in US. The top 25% of richeat people in US are responsible for 70% of all taxes collected. They do pay less (average tax rate) then what they should according to their tax bracket but so does everyone else. Average tax rate for the bottom 50% is just 4% while the lowest tax bracket is 10%. On the other end top 1% average tax rate is 26% while it should be 37%. They pay more in taxes then anyone else, both in absolute terms and relative. 

&gt;Hell no! If they want to buy an island, will they have it available? Yes they will.

What do you care if someone buys an island? You jealous? I will come to that later.

&gt;And they will be able to do that in the way that they will pay no taxes in the process.

And if they are US citizens, believe me, they are going to pay that tax. What richest people do more effectively then others is to legally avoid paying income tax as much as they "should". You would do the same. No one likes giving away money. The way they do it is by not having any income. They don't need it, because their private life can be financed by a company and hence be represented as a business expense. It is very hard to distinguish what is actually private and what business because it is all *life*. This may seem dumb to you but it is true. The thing is, you can do it too. But it is a bit risky, and many business fail within a year. So most people opt to just take a job which is more secure, but it doesn't have the perks of owning a business. It is a trade off. 

While there are people who avoid taxes altogether by misreporting what they owe or earn, if they get caught they are going to pay much more and spend some time in prison. Since tax control is essentially random, some of them are going to get away with it. However, we are not talking about them.

&gt;Stop with this bullshit “tHeY hAvE it AlL in StOcks”. They have the wealth. Tax the f***ers already.

It is not bullshit. The distinction you objected to is not trivial. They are taxed already. Now, you could argue that the 600 billionaires should be taxed with a special, higher bracket and that is fine. One should be cautious as to downside of it like hampering the entrance of new billionaires into the pool - which is bad. You might disagree, but this is a bit counterintuitive. You actually want more people to get rich. Eventually you want everyone to be rich. And they are getting rich. Now this is a bit debatable in the US now, but the thing is the solution is not obvious because every economic policy has unintended consequences.

Anyway, to get back to stocks vs cash. Stocks are not taxed as of now if you don't get dividends (and most people owning stocks do not, because they do not actually own them - but that is another story). You pay taxes only when you sell them. On the other hand, the money in your account is taxed. One of the reasons for this setup is to make you spend your money. Because one persons expense is another one's profit, and this drives the economy up. People buy stocks because money sitting in a bank account is eaten by both the taxes and inflation. Money invested as stocks should rise bt 11% on average. If just owning stocks was taxed it would be bad for most people, because it would become a liability not an asset. Which is bad for investment funds which is bad for retirement funds which is bad for you. And don't forget about the other side of that equation. Every stock sold is fresh capital for a company, that they can invest in more workers, new technology, research, expansion and so on. Cutting that pipe could hurt the economy. A lot. Now, you may say some special rules should be in place for *extremely* rich. Possibly. But just beware that every action has a reaction and unintended consequences. And no one really knows what might happen and to what extent. 

And why the distinction is not trivial? Because the value of stocks is virtual. It is whatever the market (meaning other people are ready to pay for it) says it is. There is no "real" value of the stock. There are ways to calculate the value of a given business (their capital, what company owns, profit they will make in next five years) but the stock price can easily go below this value. And how should someone (being rich or regular) who owns stocks pay a tax on those stocks? If stock prices rise (and they do on average) you would need more and more cash from *somewhere* to pay that tax. As I said, stocks suddenly become a liability, a hot potato. Most middle income people would get rid of their stocks to avoid paying extra money, that would have to come from some other source.

And now the final question. Why do you care if someone owns an island? Or have billions? Well, the Marxist theory, that is still popular for some reason, although completely proven wrong both in practice and theory, says that billionaires took that money from you - the workers. Standard economic theory says that money was created and *added* to the economy. And since we are talking about stocks and not actual money, that value is virtual. What would happen to the price of the stock if Elon decides to sell his share all at once? Right. It is not a zero sum game. Some people are getting richer faster then others, but no one is taking anything from you. We evolved to be suspicious of someone who stands out, because in a hunter gatherer tribe someone who has more then the rest must be cheating. 

Anyway, when I told you to read more, I meant books. Basic economy. History of economic thought. Economic history. Basic finance. History. Biographies. Psychology. Sociology. Statistics. I know my comment sounded smug. But "tax the rich already" comment showed you are wrong and unaware of complexity of world you are living. And the way to better yourself in the world is to know more about it. 

All the best, and good luck.
