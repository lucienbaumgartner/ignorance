Genuinely curious and unaware of what "Charlotte is definitely in the ballpark" means due to not having ever seen this expression before ; based on your overall message, it seems to indicate that you don't consider her that great overall (except in the DPS department) compared to other knights, is that it ? or is that used to say that she's, at the contrary, a top tier knight in your opinion ?
