You're full of shit. 
Trump's election made the whole world roll their eyes and recoil at the idea of American leadership. 
He made America itself a punchline, and gave our political enemies genuine proof in regard to the decline of our education system.
It will be decades before our allies stop laughing behind our backs at the fact that enough people were so goddamned fearful, and ignorant that they were willing to think an outgoing reality television star, and consistent liar could run the world's largest superpower.
Much less that there were still people willing to reelect him after his impeachment.
