Idk about this specific issue. However there are lot of young people, both girls and boys who are unaware and naive as to what occurs backstage/ what groupies do. The reason girls are the ones getting raped is because they’re obviously the ones getting invited not the guys. Its hard to judge unless you put yourself in their shoes. 

Its the older people’s responsibility to not take advantage and offer lines of ket. Like who the fuck offers ‘lines’ of ket. If you have any knowledge of dosing you know thats a one way trip to getting super fucked up. There’s no other reason someone would do that other than to take advantage of the person
