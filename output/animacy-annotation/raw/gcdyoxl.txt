Ahhh you edited it. I was wondering what all the fuss was about. 

Well as someone with a high affinity for the agency perception—I don’t especially see liberals as being free of attribution bias.

I believe it’s multi-directional on a line between agency and environment.

Where one can be too biased toward agency, another can be too biased toward environment. 

Realistically you’re also pointing out the general population’s inability to recognize nuances. 

In fact, I can say with absolute certainty that an environmental attribution bias exists. 

The belief that one has little agency has a tendency to lead a person into depression or other forms of mental illness.

Just as having too high a perception of agency may lead that person to develop narcissistic tendencies or other indirect expressions of mental illness. 

If good mental health is defined as balance—and it is—then we can also see there’s an ever increasingly larger problem between both political parties to maintain moderation in all things. 

So I would say both parties remain relatively clueless and unaware of their respective biases.
