Thanks for beating me to it with the link!


Yeah… that whole “my state is cool and important and those other states are lame” is reason #56753 why America is fucked. 

In this example, it’s even worse bc PP is self-righteous AND ignorant of history 😩

I’ve lived in suburbs, semi-rural areas, small cities, huge cities… and I don’t think one is any more important than the other.

They all have value (and most have beauty) unique to them. Every place has a story.

Knowing more is always better than knowing less, in my opinion.

But American brand is all about being better than somebody else so “Omg why would I care about *OHIO*?!” surprises me none.

Anyway, thanks for the backup 😉
