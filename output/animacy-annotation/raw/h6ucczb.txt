Can you imagine 'master and commanders' but in the height of the battle between the 2 ships, it become clear that the one ship is under duel attack.... The remaining ship goes to board, confused and unaware of the new enemy they now face. The last survivers manage to steer their ship to a jungle covered island with an old abandoned fortress or already gutted hunting ground.....
