That ones that arenâ€™t are utterly feeble-minded and ignorant of their own creed, which is built on nasb and is utterly bereft of the guidance of the Ahl al-Bayt, which is why you see anthropomorphism of Allah and degrading His Messenger to elevate Abu Bakr and Umar, among other faults.

I do not see interest by and large among Sunnis for unity and therefore I fail to understand why the Shias in this subreddit are so insistent on it. It is of zero benefit for us.
