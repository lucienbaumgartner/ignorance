There's a bunch of sources there. It's a very complicated subject. I don't have all the answers.

I don't think there are an equal number of murders. There are many factors contributing to criminality, like lead exposure, gang mentality (honor culture), childhood trauma, etc. But there are factors that put a thumb on the scale (over-policing, etc.).

The meme boils it down to "black people bad". It's dehumanizing and ignorant of material circumstances.
