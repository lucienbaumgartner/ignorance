Many Americans call criticism toward the United States as being envious, trust me, we criticize them because they are arrogant and ignorant of the outside world. 

Utopia? A utopia is not possible. A utopia legit means "an imagined place or state of things in which everything is perfect."

Many countries in Europe such as Sweden, Norway, Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland are actually better than the US in terms of freedom and living. 

The US is absolutely not the best. First, best in what? They are the best at imprisoning people and being greedy. Maybe sending a man to the moon and starting wars. All that does not help the living conditions to be better.

What I also find ironic is Americans defend the very things that make their country bad, they defend their gun rights as "freedom" and try to say their health care is better and faster as defense for the $100000 medical bills. Even if their healthcare is the greatest, one appointment can cost an Average American's three year salary.

In terms of living quality and freedom (ironically), US is not even in the top 20s. This should be noted different states and cities have different living standards, but overall the Average American life is not that great, especially considering certain areas.
