If America chooses Trump again we're fucked. Doomed. There's no coming back from doubling down on Trump. If the best we can do is be evil and selfish and hateful, then it's over. If people are so shortsighted and ignorant that they can't marry a better reality, we are done. 

Bernie has to win. We can't overcome four more years of Trump. This is the end of America or a sad, twisted blip in history.
