Not that you need another vote and I doubt you’ll read my comment but I felt compelled to share anyway.

It’s a vulnerable time, even if the birth goes extremely well recovery feels like healing from a war and everything slows down. Of course we had brief visits with loved ones during that time but there is absolutely no way I would be having houseguests stay at the house for any extended period of time during the first month. Even the first 3-6 months would be a tough ask. Also that’s just under normal circumstances and idk if you forgot but we are still dealing with a pandemic and you really want to risk a newborn being around people who just traveled long distance? I don’t care how careful they think they are, they each better have a negative covid test in hand before they even come through the door!

It was ignorant and rude of your family to invite themselves during such a time and it was beyond ridiculous you didn’t think to consult your wife first before agreeing to such a thing.
