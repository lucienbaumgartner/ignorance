&gt;whoa whoa I never said anything about adults! Haha how crazy that you would think I said that, right fellas?

You are just babbling. 

&gt;These articles on Russia wanting to invade are all generated to manufacture consent to engage Russia now  
&gt;  
&gt;Except they have already invaded the Crimea and have troops and advisors in the Donbas. This whole "manufacturing consent" conspiratorial nonsense is for subreddits full of students not adults.

I am pretty comfortable with what I wrote. 

You then wandered off into the distance by trying to make it about the idea that "manufacturing consent is real" or words to that effect. An irrelevant trajectory. 

You appear angry and ignorant of the discussion. Both of which are incurable.
