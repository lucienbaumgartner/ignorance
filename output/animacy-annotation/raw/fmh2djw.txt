When ever there is even a whiff of f&amp;^%ery by the usual suspects this quote from Ivey to Podesta in, yes, those emails, comes to mind.

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

Especially now, the "compliance fading" and "this problem demands serious x2 thinking" is forefront. I think the thinking is over and the plan MAY be engaged now.
