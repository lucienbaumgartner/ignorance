I mean that’s just objectively false and ignorant of the world at large. I mean we even have rich immigrants coming across the border seeking safety from their government or some other entity that has power in their country (I.e. People escaping the Los Zetas in Mexico). Our country isn’t perfect by any means but at least (for the most part) your safety is guaranteed regardless of social position.
