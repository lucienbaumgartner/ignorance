&gt; The shit with Cohen and Mueller is definitely suspicious - I didn't bother to look up if they've ever offered an excuse

Nope.

&gt; Including the remainder of your examples, they want good TV, they want ratings, they want to make crowds look big, the news look important etc.

Well add on things like [Donna Brazile helping Hillary cheat in debates then getting fired from CNN](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnn-drops-donna-brazile-as-pundit-over-wikileaks-revelations/2016/10/31/2f1c6abc-9f92-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html) then getting immediately hired by the DNC.

[Look at the bevy of information from Wikileaks about the media's collusion with the DNC](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/), not the least of which was a [strategy document discussing how Maggie Haberman at Politico (who's now at the NYT, of course) tees up stories for them on command](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3125945-Story-Memo.html).  There's more than what's in that Greenwald/Fang article but it's a pretty good summary.

It makes you wonder if ['being quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry'](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) involves exerting control over information and brokers of information.

Edit: lol they're fucking with Bernie again now, theyre apparently reporting with no evidence that he said a woman can't win the election.  It's 2016 all over again.
