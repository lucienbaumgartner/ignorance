You should feel sympathy *for the plight* of the mentally ill… for the fact that the situation and events occurred, and the innocent who suffer as a result of their actions, but there’s no need to feel sorry for the ignorant and sociopathic themselves. They may be victims of propaganda and psychological warfare, religious conditioning, a traumatic upbringing, the defunding of education, etc, etc, but at the end of the day they’re adults who made their own decisions and took “personal responsibility”, and their decisions have directly caused the suffering of countless other people.

I’m sorry that an animal ran under the wheel of my car, because it didn’t evolve to avoid cars, but I’m not gonna feel personally responsible for the development and implementation of cars, or that I was driving the car when it ran under the wheels. I didn’t “choose” for that animal to die. I’m just flowing with the steam and getting by with the best of intentions.
