I don't see why I shouldn't link a legit hacker. I have video evidence, and also looking at his profile you can clearly see all the messages from people he has griefed. If anything, people deserve to be made aware so they don't also fall prey.

You clearly want people to be unaware, and unable to defend themselves. Hackers deserve to be exposed, and if you are a hacker, trying to defend your own profile is infinitely more low than anything I'm doing.
