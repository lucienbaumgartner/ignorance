&gt;this doesn't really make sense because it's more of a cultural issue rather than it being more of a convenience to be ignorant
&gt;a French person isn't different from an American 

The previous comment made perfect sense in the context of geography, which has a role in defining and shaping a nation's culture. I *sincerely* hope you won't deny this statement. Also, a Frenchman and an American are different people, hence the distinction. 

&gt;you're acting as if France is dependent on needing to know German or English, they aren't 

Nobody said that France is dependent on needing to know German or English. The previous comment simply states that because France shares borders with multiple nations and is near many others, the French have an incentive to learn the languages of people with whom they share borders. It's an advantage, not a dependency. 

&gt;It comes down to better education and more of an incentive for people to learn different languages 

I'm not so sure about the better education bit. Are you referring to K-12 or University? The previous commenter said that the incentive for Continental Europeans to learn different languages stems from the fact that their nations are particularly small and share borders with many other countries. As stated, it's an advantage to keep the peace between you and your neighbors. 

&gt;but it's a bit pathetic and ignorant that so many Americans struggle to even speak basic Spanish when a significant percentage of their country speak Spanish as their native tongue

Despite the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most used language in the United States, there are 50 states that have different demographics entirely. As you'd probably guess, there are more Hispanics and Latinos in the Southwest and Florida. That's about 6 states out of 50. Middle and high school students in these areas tend to learn Spanish for 4-5 years.
