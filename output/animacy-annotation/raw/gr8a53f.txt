I've never heard of anything so stupid. You're using two different terms describing different states of mind and you equate their meaning like you've never looked up the meaning of a word even once in your life... How lost can a guy be. 

Here let mirriam Webster set you straight.

12a: filled with or expressing great joy or excitementhigh spirits

b: intoxicated by or as if by a drug or alcoholhigh on cocaine

Nodding out means someone is overdosing and has nothing to do with being high. High means being healthy (in regard to opiod dependancy) and feeling good enough to participate in life not shut it out. 

You've clearly never been high or just can't use a dictionary, either way you're extremely ignorant and unaware of the meaning of the language you use.
