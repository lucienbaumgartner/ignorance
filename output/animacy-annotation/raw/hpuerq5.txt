I’m sorry but this insistence by the legalise gang to call what’s going on in Ireland ‘a war on drugs’ is incredibly ignorant and frustrating. What happened in America was brutal and almost genocidal. The same kind of punishment and profiling and lack of healthcare has never happened here, let alone is it still happening. 
Drugs being illegal isn’t the war on drugs, it means something else.
