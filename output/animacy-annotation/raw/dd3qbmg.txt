I am referencing one of the Podesta emails in which "Global Cultural Strategies" sent an email to John Podesta containing the following message; 


"I'm certain the
poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the
conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, **drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.** The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging."



Unfortunately I cannot link to the email here because /r/politics have removed that ability, but you can search for it yourself.
