It's hard to narrow it down to which lie in all of this is the biggest one.... but maybe it's the impression being willfully given that what happened in 2016 has been normal for decades and decades

It used to just be called propaganda or psy-ops... the misleading term "election interference" wasn't added until 2016, and they took that a step further and called it "election hacking"

and the unaware and compliant citizenry falls for it
