Always do some research. It was clear as day end of jan 2020 it would be diffrent. Dont become to comfortable and ignorant of the danger, just because the recent virus didnt pan out in pandemics.

If a fire alarm makes 5 false alarams, you should still check the 6th time and dont automatically assume its a false alarm.
