So as it stands we know that spiderman is going in a new direction. Not an end but a change you don't know the terms of the deal between them and neither do I  where did you get this one more movie shit from?

Would three spideys 1 strange 6 villains plus anyone else they wanna throw in be too much?? yes. Is marvel brain dead and unaware of this?  look at their track record with marvel movies of course they're not. Do you think marvel are willing to throw all the love they've garnered to put a middle finger up to sony no they're driven by money and that middle fi ger doesn't get them any. Disney isn't some redditor sad because they were proven wrong by someone on the Internet they have one thing in mind and they've shown they know exactly how to get it. 

The only people who are ruining anything is people like yourself ruining the movie for yourself  ruining the suspension you should feel, or over hyping and setting yourselves up for disappointment. And worse spreading your weird unsubstantiated opinions like you know something no one else does.

You know practically nothing, your guesses based on  your own facts which drempt was feige whispering in your ear. 

If you want to speculate on possibilities sure it can be fun, hell I ran through like 10 different ways the spiderman movie could play out earlier today with a friend who like me loves mcu and comics. (We watched the venom movie which prompted it) 

This is to pretty much everyone on here claiming one thing or another like they're somehow a genius with insider knowledge. And that is all I have to say on this matter
