That's just rude and untrue... I'm all for shitting on admin when it's deserved but at least by me in NJ most admin were longtime teachers that got their masters or doctorate in education or related field (which is business oriented sometimes). 

People change fields all the time as well as its very apparent on this sub, I don't think it's really nice of you to bashing admin that were maybe in the same shoes as some of the teachers here who have a foot out the door and are looking to change professions entirely. Just because people go outside their initial field or profession doesn't mean they were "a failure", that's highly offensive and ignorant of you to say, especially to the many teachers by alt route here on the sub.
