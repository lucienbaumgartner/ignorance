Oh, absolutely. But my point is that a.) there is plenty of blame to go around (e.g. the recent history of hospital closures in NYC) and b.) there are all kinds of other, similar catastrophes that are happening at this very moment. Imagine if we were willing to shut down all of society for a month to tackle type II diabetes, for example. 

We are, generally, unaware and unprepared period full stop. Corona is just making us reckon with that.
