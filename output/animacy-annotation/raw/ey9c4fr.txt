Using religion or a god to mask or deal with pain isn’t a form of healing, it’s a form of brainwash. You are going off of unproven faith expecting everything to get well with no explanations. This doesn’t heal and prevent further scars, it makes you much more unaware and defenseless.

A man burns down a pastors house, luckily his family has a okay. Even though the pastor and his family is okay, they are now homeless. The pastor forgives the man and expects god to bring him good in return for forgiveness. He never finds it, and his house gets burned down again. He spirals out of control in a never ending cycle battling between himself and his faith. His beliefs just made the issue worse.

Another man burns down another mans house, like the pastor, his family survives, but unfortunately, they are now homeless. The man never forgives the arson. Once the man and his family gets a new house, he buys a gun. One day the arson comes back and without hesitation, the man shoots and kills the arson. The man and his family are saved, and can continue to enjoy their new home while the pastor continues to claw at god. Even though the pastors issues are now solved, he will never know why. He will never know it wasn’t an act of god but an act of a man not held behind faith. He will believe god saved him and continue to live life this way.
