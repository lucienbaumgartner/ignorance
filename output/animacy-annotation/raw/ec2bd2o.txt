I really like this point, but I think they could have easily incorporated it without Lane *getting pregnant against her will* and also *becoming terrified of sex because it was so unpleasant*. 

One thing that has always bothered me is that Lane says the sex was awful/uncomfortable but apparently Zach was having a good enough time that he could reach completion. It can of course be extremely difficult to voice your feelings when having sex (especially if you’re  beyond inexperienced and unaware that its not supposed to feel that way and can actually feel good!) so I get that maybe Zach thought Lane was into it/couldn’t read her signals because it was their first time, but I’m still concerned that he apparently didn’t manage to make the experience safe and comfortable for her. Super weird plothole considering how loving and caring he’s elsewise portrayed to be around the time of the wedding. 

Tl;dr: I agree with you about Lane/Mrs.Kim dynamics but still hate how they got there.
