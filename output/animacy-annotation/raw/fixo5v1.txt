They’re immature idiots who stayed immature idiots after popping out kids. Carseats are NOT. HARD. The hospital will even show you exactly how to set it up and adjust it. If you’re so lazy and ignorant that you can’t be bothered to learn something that prioritizes the safety of your child, than you don’t deserve that child.

One of these shows is going to have a child death on their hands before it’s over. That’s the risk you take when you purposely pick the trashiest teenage moms you can find for drama and ratings.
