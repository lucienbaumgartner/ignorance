He deserves to lose them now. I said here back when he announced he was taking back control of playcalling that it would cost him the team and it's already happening after 3 weeks.

I strongly believe this guy could have been HC here for the next decade if he wasn't so unbelievably arrogant and unaware of his limitations. The team respected him. Even during the 6 game winless run they kept going and turned it around. They didn't fall apart like with Trestman. He could have been the Bears Mike Tomlin but he needed to be the star of the show instead. The team is  starting to see how arrogant and "ME instead of WE" he actually is. 

If he isn't fired on January 10th I can't watch this shit again in 2022.
