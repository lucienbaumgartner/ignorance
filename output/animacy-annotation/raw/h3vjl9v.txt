You're speaking to my soul right now. 100% agreed on all of this. 

&gt;sometimes the misrepresentation is so warped and ignorant of history it almost seems willful.

I also think this is bolstered by those prolific but not really feminist "leftist" men who have the same wishy-washy criticisms of feminism ("I know what you *mean* by toxic masculinity, but...", etc). Like it definitely also supports that already unearned confidence to see someone that you misappropriated all that language from critique that same language, often with the same ego-based criticism. And all of this while still not understanding the history/fundamental arguments of feminism.
