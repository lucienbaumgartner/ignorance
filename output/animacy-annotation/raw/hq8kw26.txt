Ikr. I found it funny that the film even pokes fun of Leo for this. He’s a lifestyle ideologue who thinks he’s morally righteous with climate change and activism when really he only chases hedonism. They even made his role super cheesy and pretentious like a lot of his films, and had his character cheat on his wife for younger models—like Leo. 

I like how everyone who downvoted me thinks that they are in some secret group that understands the underlying meaning of the film, and that everyone else is ignorant and denial, when they can’t even see Leo is a classic narc. Even when the film satirizes it. Lmao. Yeah
