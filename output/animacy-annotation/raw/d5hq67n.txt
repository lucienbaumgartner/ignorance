True.

But watch the video, at 0:05, which shows the front entrance to the home.  There's a whole lot of wide-open by the front door where the shooting occurred.

Also, combined with returning home, late on a Saturday night with his girlfriend, makes me think that his situational awareness was relaxed and unaware.

And, I don't mean to impugn the man, rather, given the circumstances, I can self-identify my own weak areas.
