What's my insult, saying you're an artist and not a writer? 

I don't think I'm wrong, since you don't understand the core notion of graffiti. 

Was I? 

Yeah art is all forms sure. 

But the specific one you're talking about has a central theme of covering and competition. 

There's a reason why actual writers call it an endless marathon:you never "win" at a finish line, the best you can do is pull ahead of some others for a while until the pack passes you anew. 


All I did was explain a core concept of graffiti and say that most who try to force a false distinction and call stuff "street art" are often disconnected and unaware that competition and covering is part of the game, instead of decry it like you were doing. 

You're calling people "dumb idiots" who don't "get it" when it's you who don't get it.  And you're the one insulting them for you not understanding, Mr "I'm not here to insult, art is art "

If that were true you'd be saying the opposite, that all tags are equally valid.
