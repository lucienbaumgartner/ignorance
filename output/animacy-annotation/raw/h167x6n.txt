I think you're very naive and ignorant of the situation if you think it's about "trust". The EU engineers a disagreement over a certain part of the deal, huffs and puffs and then suggests aligning with EU standards as a "solution". Over and over and over, this is the play. And then if you refuse, gg no other solution is possible. "Align with us is the only way out of this". How convenient. The exact same situation as what happened with the Swiss recently, and they eventually got sick of it as well.    
  
It's not about "trust", the main goal is slowly sucking countries further and further into the EU's orbit via the backdoor, because the commission's ego can't accept "no" for an answer. If the EU genuinely felt the UK was too untrustworthy to do deals with then why is it trying to do a deal?
