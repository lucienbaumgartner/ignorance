Ok that’s brill! I haven’t caught her doing it again but I’ll see when I get home. She’s swimming fine, no other signs of illness, stress etc. and the only time I caught them doing it was at night time before the lights are out. The water was also a little colder than preferred so maybe that’s it? Idk to be honest. Water is perfect tho, ph is still 7.2,gh and kh are constant, nitrite and ammonia are 0 and nitrate is 10ppm. There are still new as well so I’m kinda excusing it atm because they might be still unsure with their environment. I would be worried if it happened in one two weeks yaknow? Still tho anytime I tried to get a vid she would know if I was coming from a mile away, it’s not like she’s completely unaware and unable to get up. I’ll maybe feed them a pea tomorrow incase it’s anything constipation related and see from then on? Also they are staying up a lil bit later than what they would in the pet shop. Lights went out at around 6-9pm but lights go out at around half 10-11 at my house, so maybe they’re just tired? Idk but I will keep you updated if there’s any other issues that I can see, thanks!
