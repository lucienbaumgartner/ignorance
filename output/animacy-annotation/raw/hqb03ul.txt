Chiiiiild. Class patterns are REAL! Reminds me of someone’s comment on “year theme / year intention” about giving up middle class fakery lol. 

Even when I become “owning” class, I was raised poor and those values and lessons are embedded in my worldview. The same goes for those raised unaware and fortunate. 

WAMP wamp wamp
