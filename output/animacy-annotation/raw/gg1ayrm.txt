It sorta kinda makes sense if you put yourself back in 1776 in your mind. Lets ignore all the race and sex issues for simplicities sake. The bulk of the population was fairly uneducated, and unaware of the goings on of government. They didn't have instant news, they couldn't quickly look up the context of a trade deal, treaty, etc. In that context, it kind of makes sense to have "statesmen" act as a check on the presidency to ensure we weren't about to install a completely unqualifiedly bafoon....

But yeah, as often is the case, theory and practice don't agree. So today? Get rid of it. Popular vote nation wide (or if for some reason we insist on keeping the electoral college, states must allocate them proportionally to the vote rather than winner takes all)
