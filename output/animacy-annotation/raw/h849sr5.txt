True, I did just state that purchasers are part of the problem. What I did was create two groups: One group knows there is a problem and dont care that it exists; the second group do not know there is a problem and thus are not aware that they are making the problem worse. Both groups are likely uninformed and unaware that they are paying for a service that would be free if they werent participating.
