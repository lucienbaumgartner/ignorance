Anybody can copy and paste articles from biased news sources online like you've done. Yes. The US dollar is currently the world reserve currency and the US dollar token is currently the cryptocurrency attached to it. 

Again you're missing the point. 
I'm not being na√Øve and I told you I don't need to exchange any of my tokens. I never will. I use my cryptocurrency right now to this day to buy anything &amp; to do everything that I want. I don't use any other form of legal tender (except fiat to purchase crypto)

I just recently purchased real estate on a smart contract in the United States with cryptocurrency (XLM) 

This will be my last conversation with you. I did not realize I was talking to a communist that does not want financial freedom or fairness in the world. 

You'll continue to be broke &amp; unhappy but just remember that J from Reddit tried to help you but you were too ignorant and dependent on your government helps that missed being apart of the future. 

Good day
