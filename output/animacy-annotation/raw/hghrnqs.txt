&gt; My point is that you can only regret things where you know you made some shitty mistake.

And mine is that she voluntarily said something hurtful. If (by my concession) I can say that she didn't know them to be hurtful when expressed, missing the effect the words had on their own life partner is also a form of disrespect.

&gt; If you are entirely in the dark and unaware of how your actions affect others, you're not going to regret.

Hard disagree. People voluntarily saying hurtful things on purpose know they have said hurtful things even if they never see the other person apart from that millisecond.

&gt; On the case that maybe she's not aware of the harm, yes, maybe she needed more empathy or just to pay more attention, and this is why these things might need a serious conversation for her to realize it and correct it.

Nicely said indeed.

&gt; And in that case going on some petty revenge to address it instead of just talking to her is a bigger shitty thing to do than what she did to him, imo, because he is definitely aware it is shitty. 

And my argument is that she's also aware. We choose the words we express. Yes, I can agree with you that petty revenge isn't a solution in the slightest. But I'm not putting her above him: the first person to have said something hurtful is her.

&gt; Yes, disrespectful people who do mean things intentionally are everywhere, that's correct. And revenge is intentionally shitty for certain, and would put him exactly at this terrible person spot that we can only speculate whether she is or not.

To better express my point: I'm not speculating about it. I make an observation of her objectively shitty actions.
