&gt;Dr Peter McCullough 

One misled doctor vs. the entire community? Sounds like you're just looking for confirmation bias wherever you can find it. His claims were thoroughly vetted, debunked, clarified and exposed as unsubstantiated. The guy is proof that intelligence can be compartmentalized, and that even educated people can be ignorant, and quite paranoid. 

Yet when he's debunked and his claims vetted, you guys just say he's being "targeted for pushing against the narrative." If what he was saying was true, then why wouldn't a plethora of doctors *across the world,* agree with him? The only way you can answer this question is with layers upon layers of loosely connected conspiracies and conjecture.
