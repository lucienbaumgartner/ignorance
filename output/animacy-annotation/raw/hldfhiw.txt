Nobody calls temporary farm workers expats, they are known by people of the US as "immigrants", even if they just come to work for 6 months on a legit visa, people will call them immigrants or illegal immigrants. It appears expats is reserved for persons from the global north or developed world for when they want to immigrate but not be called immigrants, as that is for "foreigners", not them. 

It's actually quite a classist term. A highly paid tech worker can be an expat, and will insist to call themselves such, while a field hand or "lower class" worker will be considered an immigrant. I consider myself an immigrant because I live in a different country than i was born in, simple as that. Calling yourself an expat is pretentious and ignorant of the reality of global migration for many people.

And due to the strength of thier passports derived from neocolonial geopolitics of the past, they do not need to go through a lengthy visa process when immigrating to the global south, so feel they are not "immigrants" but "expats" who are welcome anywhere. (Except moving to Europe from the US, where much paperwork is needed to move and stay there). Glad Mexico is cracking down on those "expats" who have for years abused their visa privileges to work and live without paying taxes.
