Legality has nothing to do with wages, they are based on your productivity, not what you can force your employer to pay you.  


Again, wage rates are a factor of YOUR skills. If you have too few and poor skills, then what do we do about that? Force employers to pay you MORE than you produce? How would that work? Have you thought this through?  


You're not going to read anything? You seem very confused and unaware of basic econ or market functions. If you refuse to learn, how can we correct that?  


Dude, the left has lied to you, and you have been very naive, it's time to fix that.
