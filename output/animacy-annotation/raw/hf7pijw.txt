What radio silence? Effort to acknowledge the anni? They announced rewards and they gave said rewards. A group of what few thousand redditors voiced out their disgust and they think they're owed a public apology by Mihoyo. That's what echo chambering does. Meanwhile players who don't even go to Reddit happily claim their anni primos and spent it on Kokomi. There is no fire. Just a bunch of man children and memers review-bombing apps.

Imagine not being a Redditor and reading a post from Mihoyo apologizing that they didn't give enough Primos. What impression does that give people who are completely satisfied and unaware of this "fire" you're talking about? That Mihoyo fucked up their anniversary. That Mihoyo bends to a few entitled players who voice out their entitlement. That they'll give out free stuff if you throw a big enough tantrum. That's absolute shit PR.
