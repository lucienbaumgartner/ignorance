I agree. Whatever happened is truly horrendous, but I think 400 people just describes the size of the crowd present. 

Sources have already reported that some members of that group were actually trying to help - but too few so that they were overwhelmed by the aggressors. However I imagine that a significant portion of the 400 were present but uninvolved and unaware of what exactly was happening.
