Honestly, you're going to lose most of the appeal of the Advantage/Disadvantage system. Players are going to start scrounging for any source of advantage they can get, and ways to impose disadvantage on their enemies. Adv/Disad is intended to avoid tallying up how many +1, -2, +4, -3, +2 modifiers each side can come up with; if you start to tally up Adv/Disad you're taking a step back towards that paradigm.

As for how it will play out, I think generally speaking you're going to end up with a lot more rolls being made at advantage, mostly on the player's side. Players have the entire round to try to come up with ways to eke an additional source of advantage while the DM is going to need to juggle the entire combat and probably can't take the time to make deep tactical decisions for each monster.

You'll probably see a somewhat slower combat as people look for ways to maximize their rolls and avoid rolling disadvantage or straight, and as people need to look up and adjudicate how many different effects grant advantage or disadvantage. Attacking a restrained, unconscious, prone opponent 5ft away- is that 4 sources of advantage (restrained target, unseen attacker, unconscious target, prone target) or should it be 2 sources (restrained target, unconscious target) since the unconscious condition includes the effects of prone and unaware of surroundings?

The most impacted class is definitely the rogue, as now they are more likely to lose out on sneak attack. Next is possibly the barbarian, they have the easiest access to advantage with Reckless, for both themselves and their enemies.
