I agree. I'm related to several of them.

But, to be fair, there are nut jobs on both sides. I think one of our biggest problems - not just in political/social discourse, but as a species in general - is how exponentially more difficult it gets for us to admit the faults of our respective sides as we become more convinced of our own "righteousness".

Honestly, what keeps me close to the centre is how insane and unaware of reality the extremes of both sides are.
