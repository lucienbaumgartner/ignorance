I haven’t said anything that’s sexist, I said things that got under your skin because you’re fucking sexist. Let’s have a brief recap shall we? 

You said

 “you came from your fathers testicles” 

I responded with 

“you come from your mother and father, jack ass” 

in response to you deliberately misinterpreting the point I was making and trying to twist it with your lack of medical knowledge when you knew exactly what I meant. That’s manipulation, it just didn’t pan out the way you’d hoped. 
You then respond with

 “it actually starts with the sperm. You’re wrong. Do women grow sperm? No? So it starts with the male producing sperm? Right? Do you have a mental disability or something?” 

Wrong dumb ass! You’re completely wrong and even commenced to goading me about it with other comments, thinking you had me on that.  

Maybe look up the definition of misogynist and then see how fucking stupid it is that you called me that. 

And how utterly fucking dense you are for calling me fat when you have no clue what I look like. I’m not fat, I’m in very good shape, I’m a personal trainer, but nice try. 

You manipulate my words and call me a manipulator. 

You say something ignorant and entirely untrue and ask me if I have a mental disability when what I said was accurate. 

You call me a misogynist when you, in fact, are. 

So that begs the question, are you fat too?
