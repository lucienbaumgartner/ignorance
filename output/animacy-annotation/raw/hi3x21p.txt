In my opinion, there is no "neutrality" - if friends ignore their friend doing awful things, they are enabling it.

If I do something morally wrong, or hurt someone, or I'm being an asshole, I want my friends to talk to me about it. Often in situations you don't see the forest for the trees (or the trees for the forest, how was it?) and friends should keep you in check. 

It can be insanely uncomfortable for friends to do that. People want to stay out of conflict and only see the good things. Sticking up for other people is definitely out of the comfort zone for many people. I can also imagine your ex is fueling this. It's lazy and ignorant of them to dismiss you. 

That said, friends are friends for a reason. They share similar values, have similar coping skill etc. So they are your Ex's friends for a reason. I had to learn that also. It sucks, it hurts, and it will hurt still in a few years. 

BUT you are going to find friends that share your views and your morals. I know this. You got this!
