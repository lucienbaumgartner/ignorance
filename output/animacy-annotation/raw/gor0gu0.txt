Your statement is objectively wrong and invalid. There is no single "American culture in general" - what a laughable statement.

Violent, gun-toting criminals who [murder each other over social media fights](https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2021/1/29/22256964/carjackings-chicago-abuse-neglect-minors-teenagers) are not representative of "American culture in general" - they're not even representative of the neighborhoods where they live. 

&gt; This isn't a problem isolated to certain communities.

This statement is completely wrong and invalid, your'e obviously uneducated and ignorant of any research on violent crime. An overwhelming majority of violent crime is [concentrated within specific neighborhoods](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/summer16/highlight2.html). 

Violent crime is absolutely concentrated in certain communities.
