Yeah my life is good but I'm aware that it can and should be better. Majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Millions of people are facing eviction. There are miles long lines for food banks. And then I think about whats going on in the world, not just my country. The genocide, murder, torture, starvation of other people. Sure I'm glad those things aren't happening to me but I can't just push them to the back of my mind. To be happy is to not think about all the suffering going on in the world. And I know I'll be downvoted for my 'pessimistic' view of the world but to me it's realism. When people take the time to be grateful for what they have, to be happy; in that moment they're forgetting about all the suffering going on in the world. And then we don't do anything. We don't march in the streets, we don't scream about injustice. We do nothing. We become complacent. The only way to be happy is to be ignorant of the things going on around you.   
And of course it's not healthy to be constantly thinking about these things. It's good to take mental health breaks. Yes think about what you're grateful for, but don't stay happy for so long that you stop thinking about or caring for other people who are less fortunate than you. If you can do both, then God bless you. I certainly can't. However I suffer from depression so maybe thats why. I have had a random lapse in my depression though. For almost a month the chemicals in my brain were balanced and I was happy, but I had forgotten everyone elses pain. I would rather be miserable and care about others than be happy and unaware of the suffering around me.
