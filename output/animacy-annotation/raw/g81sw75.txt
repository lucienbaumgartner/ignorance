Though it isn't useless economically, it is useless for just about anything else. Also, fascism as a whole is just as Anti-Monarchist as communism considering that in Italy, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Manchuria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Yugoslavia it was fascists that A. Took power from the monarch, B. Deposed the monarch, C. Betrayed the Monarch, D. Put a gun to the Monarch's head and made them go along with the fascists, E. Kept the monarch uninformed and unaware of what was truly going on, or F. Kept the monarch as little more than a prisoner.

Look at Hitler, sending members of the Bavarian Royal Family to the concentration camps and having the Tsar of Bulgaria killed and wanting to assassinate the Pope, or Mussolini subverting the King and eventually forming his own republic, even Franco was ultimately just a Dictator who wanted to be in power until he died. See also the puppet regimes installed by the Nazis, made up of men all too willing to sell out their own nation to save their hides. All of them are cut from the same traitorous cloth.
