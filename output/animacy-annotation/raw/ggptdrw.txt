I’m still new to Reddit, so in other posts I’ve seen people describe the company in which their story takes place rather than actually name-dropping it (eg. saying “a company where red shirts is the uniform”; “a famous soda company with cursive writing as the logo”). I assumed it was proper practice, so for lack of knowing better and due to the fact that I am new and unaware of typical Reddit verbiage and norms, I did the same just in case.
