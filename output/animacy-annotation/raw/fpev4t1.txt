My view has always been she screwed over so many little people, she could only get the interns going. Even when Heather try to help her, so sincerely and was so hard working on Sonya’s behalf, I couldn’t believe how dumb Sonia was and how totally unaware and Ungrateful she was for all the help she was given. Now Leah is going to come in and break her down and I love it. “The Morgan yacht has fucking sailed Sonja”
