We have a friend who has gone utterly over the top with panic. She’s complained bitterly about hoarders, but she herself is a hoarder. She has enough food and bog roll to keep the army feed and wiped for at least a week; yet she goes out everyday — masked up to her eyes to buy more.

We’ve tried to get her to see sense (via a WhatsApp group), but she is so vapid, moronic and ignorant that it’s pointless. She literally cannot see beyond herself. I wonder if she is not the only one and thus we have mad raving groups of Karen’s buying everything without truly understanding as to why.

I hope your situation improves soon OP.
