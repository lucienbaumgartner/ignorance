I'm asking you to refrain from using "us vs them" terminology here. 

You used the word 'nut job' for Nida, who is a victim/survivor of sexual violence and abuse, in a different comment section and now you are using the word 'nonbelievers' to “other” people who disagree with you. Otherizing your fellow human beings who are advocating for human rights and raising their voice against injustice and cruelty won't help you 'protect' khilafat or jamaat in the long run. You are coming off as extremely ignorant and hypocritical.    


Don't forget that in Islam haikuk-ul-ibaad come before haikuk-ul-Allah. There are  a lot of Ahmedhis here who want to see structural changes within the jamaat system to end this type of systemic abuse and discrimination. There is NOTHING anti-ahmedi or anti-khilafat about that. Use your 'God-given intelligence' to empathetically analysis the situation at hand.
