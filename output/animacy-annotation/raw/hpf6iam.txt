You’re being willfully ignorant and obtuse. 

I don’t have to make up an example to state that I believe that Twitter and platforms could lose one of these lawsuits, and cause a massive change in how social media works. 

Nor do I have to explain how absolutely elated I’d be if and when it happens here (it’s happening in other countries, fuck yeah let’s go!!!!) 

Go gatekeep somewhere else and keep your insults to yourself cool guy. All you’ve said is you think social media is untouchable, easy peasy I think you are 1000% wrong wrong wroooooong.
