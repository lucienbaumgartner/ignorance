Many of us have provided Valve all en@age-based solutions, all d2@s-based solution, all variants between them, with websites, forums, number of members etc., documentation and decompiled cheats **since moment zero**.  They just did not care enough, and with the complicity of /r/DotA2 mods have sweeped it under a rug so that the community could remain happy and ignorant that "there are no cheats for dota2" and later on morph into "it's not wide spread".    

Years ago a few topics managed to break the firewall only because it was a russian community figure raising awareness.   
What happened? Fucking Valve started giving matchmaking bans instead of straight-out VAC that could be quantified and tracked, that's what happened. And funny thing, many bloody obvious abusers had the audacity to complain on reddit fooling many into support that lead to their mm bans reverted shortly after!   
And mods resumed shadowbanning related posts like usual.   

Last week, profiting from the sexual scandals wave, yet another cheat topic break the firewall. I'm guessing patching the known-for-years-5-years-old-could-exploit-holes is a result of that, but I won't hold my breath, I'm sure many of the literally hundreds of d2^s based cheats are back up and running by now.  

I fucking won't give them undeserved credits. They care about money and that's all there is to it.
