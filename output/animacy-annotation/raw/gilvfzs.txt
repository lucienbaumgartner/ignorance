This meme maybe the most idiotic meme on this sub in a while. Democracy was just attacked but apparently it's funny that this guy's life doesn't change whether we have a white supremacist as president or a president that actively wants to help people in need instead of spread hate.

People like OP that equate our situations being the same with a white supremacist president who incites violence to Biden are so ridiculously privileged and ignorant that it makes me sick.
