I used to vote republican based on fiscal policy. The last almost 10 years have made it impossible for me to feel like a decent human and ignore the social issues, and the Republican Party itself is getting more and more extreme. I think the only ones still able to vote Republican, that consider themselves socially liberal, have to just be ignorant and uninformed. Sorry.
