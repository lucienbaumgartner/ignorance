jump straight up, not into the shooter. have arm(s) straight up as well, maybe a slight lean/reach for the ball at most. No contact with shooting arm/hand with your arm/hand if the ball is in the act of shooting. This is the general rule of thumb for any kind of shot, whether it's a layup or a jumpshot. It's really fucking simple and people who have never played real organized basketball usually think that there is absolutely no contact in basketball. if the guy is running full speed, jumps for a layup, and his body hits yours, that's not a foul. There isn't much you can do with people who are simply unaware and ignorant, just give him the foul so he stops crying and move on. Hop into another pick up game or have him on your team lol.
