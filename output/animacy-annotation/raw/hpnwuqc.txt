Are they still all unvaccinated? If so, how does that change anything? If you weren't willing to have guests at your wedding without the shot why would you want to be around those same people for Christmas? 

And let's be real. These are grown ass adults that have decided to be ignorant and selfish and have proven they aren't worthy of your time or the headache they cause. The fact they are now trying to guilt trip you just shows as much. Don't let shitty people make you feel bad for making smart decisions.

Personally, not only would I not go, I'd cut contact with anyone trying to give me a hard time about it.
