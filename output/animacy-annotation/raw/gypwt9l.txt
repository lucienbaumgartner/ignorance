I think it's because they learn about the Revolution in elementary school and are taught that the founding fathers wanted freedom from England and part of that freedom was freedom of speech. Then, because they are stupid and ignorant of any country outside the US (hell, a lot of them are ignorant about most of the US, too) they know absolutely nothing about modern England and think they don't have free speech or aren't allowed to criticize the Queen or something. This is reinforced by being told nearly constantly since childhood that America is the best country in the world because of our "freedoms". Lots of these people legitimately don't think other countries allow free speech.
