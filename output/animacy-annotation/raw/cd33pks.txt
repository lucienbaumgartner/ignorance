Watching my grandmother die of a rare cancer in her blood vessels and slowly forgetting who sister and I were. But yesterday when I was visiting her in the hospital, I opened up her bible for her ( she is very religious and unaware that my sister and I are agnostic) and marking her favorite passages in her bible were photographs of my sister and I from when we were children. My aunt mentioned how my grandmother read those passages everyday and looked at our pictures every time she was Lonely or sad. It will be very difficult to say goodbye to her, but her time here is limited
