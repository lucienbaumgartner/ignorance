This has nothing to do with them being bi. This has a lot more to do with their personality. It sounds like they're a bit egocentric, and unaware of their partner's feelings.

You should really talk to him about it. When someone acts like they aren't dating around others, this is a red flag that they may not be out to the general public yet, and asking about it may help them vocalize that.

Additionally, if it's just who they are, I would honestly leave. Again, this has nothing to do with them identifying as bi. There are plenty of folx that identify as gay that do this as well, whether they're out or not, and you need to take care of yourself.

Please don't generalize identities. A better way to ask your question might be, "Why am I dating someone who doesn't seem to recognize our relationship?" The detail that they're bi can be added, but it's not a great way to make your headline because it's really alienating to anyone who may identify as bi.

Hope you and your s/o can work this out, but it sounds like you may be better off ending this one if they aren't willing to talk about it.
