What a pile of human garbage.

I have a close family member who worked very closely with Paul before he got into politics. Said family member is a very level headed, calm guy who gets along with just about everyone and rarely has a bad word to say about other people unless he truly means it. He thought LePage was one of the most arrogant, ignorant, and downright cruel people heâ€™d ever met.
