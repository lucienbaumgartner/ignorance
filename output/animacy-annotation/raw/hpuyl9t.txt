A little bit of COVID will indeed kill some people. There are families who are gathering with elderly grandparents or people who are medically vulnerable over Christmas who don’t want to catch COVID from you. It strikes me as pretty insensitive and ignorant that you can’t be bothered to perform a test that takes 30 seconds to administer in order to keep vulnerable populations safe.
