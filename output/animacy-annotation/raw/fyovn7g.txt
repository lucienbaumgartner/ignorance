Nope, that’s not what anybody is saying. What we’re saying is that anyone, whether they live a healthy lifestyle or not, is susceptible to catching coronavirus, and are also fully capable of passing that virus on to other people; either in their own household or strangers they encounter in public. 

To slow the spread, everyone should wear a mask, because they could positive for COVID-19 and spreading it to others even if they are asymptomatic and unaware that they have it. 

No amount of healthy living will protect you from contracting it. Your good health may aide you in fighting off the virus, but it will not protect you from being infected because you have no antibodies in your system to combat a new virus. 

The very small action of wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus. If EVERYONE wears one, regardless of their health/lifestyle choices, then the virus has fewer opportunities to spread, until it dies out in the people who are carrying it. 

So no, that isn’t ‘literally the logic people are believing.’
