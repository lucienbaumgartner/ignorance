Oh heck yes. I was my mother's parent even when I was a child, and did the bulk of the housework/cooking/parenting my brother and I. I have often said that, when my mother or her siblings visited, it was like the roles were reversed and I was the parent and they were the children (they act like children and the more of them that are together, the younger they seem to be, arguing and fighting and crying and trying to talk over each other).   


I think that's part of the narcissistic personality disorder; they're emotionally stunted somewhere around the toddler level (think how selfish and unaware of others the average toddler is because of their developmental stage) and really hollow in general.
