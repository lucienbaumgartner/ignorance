I think its a mixed bag with him. I think early on he endeared himself to the population as being a good person in a tough situation. As the pandemic continued I believe that waned and I personally dont like him. Early on you could make the excuse that he was maybe thinking he could work from the inside to help steer the policies and response of the PC's but its become clear that even if that was the case, hes completely toothless and has carried water for the PC's and their ignorant and downright negligent handling of the various pandemic waves.
