Yes, just like Trump, all of Corbyn's problems were the media, or vast conspiracies, or basically anything besides the fact that he was fucking incompetent and tone deaf. 
     
It's a year later, and he's still dying on the "anti-Semitism was a problem, but not as bad as they make it out to be" hill.  
     
And on the other side you have Starmer, livid because he can't believe that his predecessor is so self obsessed and ignorant that he will actively prevent the Labour party from moving past the anti-Semitism issue.  
   
It's like if Bill Clinton jumped into the 2008 election to remind everyone that he did not have sexual relations with that woman.  
   
It's ego before country.
