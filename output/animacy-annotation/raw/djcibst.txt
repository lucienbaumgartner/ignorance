&gt; There might be some chatter but where the fuck are the protests?

There were protests, but they could only do so much.

&gt;You should been out in force protesting the system.

We did. Just because **YOU** are clueless and unaware that they happened, is a reflection on *YOU*, not us.

&gt;But you are too indoctrinated by been spoon fed drops of luxury to keep you complacent.

That's been the case for 50+ years, and *not* just in the U.S.

&gt;America is bending over and letting the republicans fuck them over while getting distracted by trumps bullshit.

Apparently those folks *like* taking it in the ass. We'll see what happens after they lose their healthcare, or there's no one there to provide aid after the next natural disaster. They're going to learn the *hard* way, and I'm not too terribly broken up about that.
