How about the ones where she took money from the same people who are funding ISIS and other Sunni terror groups


“...the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.”

“Clintons should know better than to raise money from folks whose primary concern has been supporting the NIAC, a notorious supporter of the Radical Islamic Mullahs. "The Clinton’s have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cash...putting money ahead of principle.”

Or the ones where the DNC and Hillary Campaign paid people to cause unrest at Trump rallies

Maybe the one where the campaign talks about wanting "unaware" and "compliant" citizens

“And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”

Or the ones where she mocked catholics for their faith, or the one where they tried to bribe the FBI, or the one where hillary is caught on tape talking about rigging the Palestinian election.Or the one where Latinos are "needy", and and describes Latino outreach as "Taco Bowl engagement"

Or the one where they prayed for shooters in news stories to be white. Or the one where the DNC and hillary camp collude against sanders.

There are so many of these, but i'm willing to bet you won't even take the time to look into them. In fact you probably won't even respond to this comment because you are more concerned with "owning" people on the internet than you are the welfare of this country.

You make me sick that you are willing to turn a blind eye to all of this because Trump exists.
