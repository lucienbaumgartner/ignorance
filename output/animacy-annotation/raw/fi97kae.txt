Guy is fucking 20 years old. For perspective, 10 years ago he probably got his first boner. 5 years ago he might have lost his virginity. Now he literally lost his life.  He's legit a little baby still deciphering who he wants to be and his impact on the world.

and I know this is a sidenote, but imagine rolling up on that same exact person who made you feel like a complete little bitch. Totally demasculated you, slapped you in your face. And fucking filmed it for all of his friends and shit to see.  I'm not sure if Pop hunted him down or just bumped into him, but this person was just completely unaware and vulnerable. The sheer power and pressure you must feel with an entire crew behind you is almost like a complete metamorphosis compared to what you were before. If only, just for  moment, you could make that person feel the weight of shame and weakness that you had to bear for 7+ years because of them. Give em a real taste of their own medicine. So tempting. You gotta have a code of morals or some shit to prevent you from doing that, and he's probably dead in center of developing that.
