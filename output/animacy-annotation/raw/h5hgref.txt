Lol I call handling alcohol being able to know when not to drink so I can STILL DRIVE A CAR instead of giving up DRIVING FOREVER because I’m a slave to a fucking bottle you pathetic sad man. Get over your coping and self congratulations and face your addiction. I was trying to be nice but idiots like you really make me mad you’re so sure of yourself and feel self actualized but you’re so so very wrong and unaware of your real self, literally blinded by your drunkenness. I’d love to see you this confident sober your mind would have another thing coming.
