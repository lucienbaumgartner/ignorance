Most people will agree it's stupid. The "racist" stuff in to kill a mocking bird is literally the point of the book.


California is not "the left" nor do they represent anywhere close to the majority of people who lean left politically.

Crying about the left like a singular entity is not only ignorant and inaccurate but juvenile.
