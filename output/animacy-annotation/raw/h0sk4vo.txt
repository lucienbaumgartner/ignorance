There’s a book series, the first of which I think is called Dust, where basically people are living in a post apocalyptic wasteland via a giant and deep column shaped hole. Like, 100 stories deep, 1000ft wide. But that’s like their whole life. 

Why? Here’s the point. &gt;!Turns out there are basically 100 holes like that, all independent and unaware of each other, and one is supposed/expected to outlast the other. In doing so, they find an old hurried TBM that’s oriented such that once get it running, they can drill their way to the surface and it pops them right out in the non-wasteland!&lt;. 

Idk, just made me think of that
