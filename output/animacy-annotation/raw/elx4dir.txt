I respectfully disagree. Taxing the rich won’t make my boss pay me what I deserve based on the experience and capabilities I bring to his business.

As a female in a male dominated industry, I have personally experienced pay discrimination. If it weren’t for a loud mouthed coworker, I would have been unaware and unable to address the situation.

Yes, corporations and the wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes. Yes, livable wages should be standard. Yes, business also need to be reporting pay information to allow oversight and enforcement of equal pay for equal work.
