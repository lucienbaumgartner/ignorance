If you shout "5G causes COVID", you are actively harming the discourse in such a significant way that shutting you up is the best option; not a **good** option, but the best option *you've* left us with.  When a statement is so harmful and ignorant that it has the potential to *cost thousands of lives*, it's time to shut the fuck up, or someone will do it for you.

If you people had any self-awareness whatsoever, you'd recognize that maybe you don't have the expertise to be commenting on such a complex issue with an air of authority.  Outside of your bubbles, we recognize the act of non-governmental censorship is preferable to letting this dangerous, ignorant bullshit go without a response
