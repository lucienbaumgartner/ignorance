NTA: I'm multi-racial and have a mixture of both of my mom and dad. It was rather racist and ignorant of your BIL's girlfriend to assume you were not "the real dad" when she was corrected the first time around and also ignorant to assume you were the help rather than the dad/husband. Yes, even some people such as your BIL girlfriend whom put out tweets on social media about BLM and seem like an ally in the social media world can still be racist and ignorant in the real world. 

Definitely did not overact and definitely NTA but your BIL girlfriend is definitely an AH.
