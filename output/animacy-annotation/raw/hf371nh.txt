Thanos teleported to the Stone.  Why do you think he would know or care about Ultron itself?   He wasn't interested in Ultron, and obviously had no idea who actually had the stone.   We have already seen that Thor, using an axe, thrown at well below light speeds, and having zero infinity stones, came within a foot of finishing Thanos, who had all six stones.   Ultron, who is already as formidable as any Avenger without a stone, has one to face a much slower reacting and ignorant of Ultrons full power Thanos.   Also, Ultron felt  no discomfort, or pain from using the Stones and required no focus or snaps or concentration to wield them.  Thanos obviously did, and that's going to make all the difference.  Ultron is much faster, and doesn't suffer from living creatures overconfidence.   Thanos is shown, in every instance of his interactions when trying to gain a stone, to love talking about it, and messing around with his opponents.   This was the first time we ever see anyone just flat out attack Thanos without any hesitation, and with the power to kill him.  Thanos came to Ultron to get the stone and flex his power.   Ultron didn't bother with any of that.
