I get that, but to me, erotic roleplay is sexting. I can't find a line between them because it's essentially the same thing.  Maybe I'm wrong and ignorant of the erotic roleplay genre. 

I really feel for the op, but in this kind of area, you have to set very definite boundaries, and your partner has to know if you say stop, it's over.  Delete that shit.  That's where the cheating came in for me.  She said stop,  he lied and kept going.
