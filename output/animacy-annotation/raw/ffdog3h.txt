I've been feeling like this lately. I used to be unaware of a lot of problems in my life (emotionally I was affected but I dissociated a lot, and didn't logically see the problems as I do now.)

I feel like I used to be a zombie in an apocolypse, and while being a zombie was a negative experience, having a zombie brain made me quite unaware and therefore unable to do anything about it. 

Now I'm awake and mentally free to see reality for what it is, and I'm standing in the wreckage that surrounds me, looking back on my previous experiences and realizing how screwed up they were. Having to clean up after a zombie apocalypse is a whole nother kind of messy and painful! I do understand that saying "ignorance is bliss."

I try to stay present and imagine how fantastic life could be in the future, as well as remind myself that recovery is not linear and its normal to have days that are filled with regret at starting the healing process. Sending hugs &lt;3
