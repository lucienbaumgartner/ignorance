&gt;some laborers actually prefer to have regularity of payments in the present in the form of wages or salaries

Some do, but most don't have that choice in the first place. And in practice most of the risks are transferred to the workers because of limited liability and corporate welfare, while most of the rewards are reaped by the capital owners.

It's also the result of over a century of propaganda and of various systems designed to force workers into wage labor. When wage labor was first introduced, most people saw it as the oppressive and unfair system that it is. It took a lot of effort for the ruling class to change that state of mind. One of the main reasons people "choose" *relative* security is because the increase in the cost of living has them locked in debt. The overwhelming majority of people cannot own a home without going into decades-long debt. At which point it becomes prohibitively risky for them to quit the wage labor system.

&gt;Actually yes and the fact that you don't recognize effective control and only emphasize formal control is a shortcoming of the entire communist  worldview. Capital owners cannot force purchase of the product of that  capital. There is good reason that an adage of market economists is that  "the consumer is king." 

I'm not a communist. Explain to me *exactly* how a person with no capital has any effective control in a free market system. Capital owners can force people into purchases when they have a monopoly or an oligopoly, and can manipulate people into purchases even when they don't have that. And "*Serve the people !*" is the motto of the Chinese communist party, that's not an argument.

&gt;Capital owners aren't the bosses. Consumers are the bosses.

You are quite delusional and ignorant of history if you actually believe that.

&gt;Besides, millions of average Americans invest all of the time.

About 84% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% in the US. Over half of it is owned by the top 1%. And the majority of the people on the planet don't have any stake whatsoever in the stock market. Insignificant stakes are also nothing but placebo. Owning 1 share of Apple does not give you any meaningful control, nor does it constitute any meaningful income or wealth.

&gt;No amount of capital accumulation will make a venture profitable if consumers just simply aren't buying what is being sold.

The vast majority of the wealth on earth is directly or indirectly derived from land. Land is a finite, and currently shrinking, resource. Land is needed to live. It is impossible to survive on your own without land. This allows capital owners to extract rent, and forces everyone else to submit to them. You don't need to be efficient at all when what you own is inherently valuable and people cannot live without it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The median income in the US is quite high and the size of the middle and  upper classes is growing and is larger than the bottom income brackets  that delineate poverty. 

The median income in the US isn't even half of the average income. The size of the middle class is completely meaningless because the definition is arbitrary. Looking at income is also intentionally deceptive. Wealth is the far better metric, but income is always used because the numbers are not as bad and are more easily manipulated. Half of the US owns less than 2% of the wealth. The same amount owned by the richest 50 Americans. When looking at the entire world, the top 0.6% of humanity owns significantly more wealth than the bottom 95%.

&gt;They do not choose between "food or no food", but specific units of food now versus specific units of something else as an alternative now.

If you acknowledge that people don't choose to eat food, how can you fail to understand that it means food consumption isn't a choice ? Having a choice of different brands of food doesn't mean that eating food is a choice. People are forced into food consumption by biological imperatives. They -have- to buy from the food industry. If the entire industry used bad practices, people wouldn't be able to boycott it. They couldn't choose to stop eating food. Demand for food is inelastic, which opens the door for monopolies and oligopolies. And in practice it's exactly what happens, the "choice of brand" often means a choice between 2 different products ultimately owned by the same entity or a very small group of entities. The very fact that millions starve to death when food production exceeds global demand by over 30% is proof that the food industry does not follow market laws. Such a massive production surplus should make food affordable to even the poorest individuals. It doesn't because the price of food doesn't follow theoretical market laws, because food consumption isn't a luxury.

&gt;Luckily, I can be both without contradicting myself.   
&gt;  
&gt;You don't really know much about libertarianism.   
&gt;  
&gt;You're just wrong. You don't really have any clue what you're talking about here and I don't have the bandwidth to help you.   
&gt;  
&gt;Not if you understand economics. 

How can I answer such strong logical arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Besides, even if we accept your misunderstood cartoon version of  libertarianism, when communists start talking about "the common good",  what they mean is "the thing I want for me and my friends." 

Once again, not a communist. What I meant was the common good as defined by utilitarianism. I was pretty unambiguous about it.

 

&gt;The failure to internalize externalities is a failure of the state to enforce rules against harm. A libertarian environmental legal code would arguably be far more restrictive than the current one.  
&gt;  
&gt;Externalities also aren't limited to market systems, so using them as a criticism of markets is just disingenuous.

States have successfully addressed externalities to a far greater degree than any market ever has. That's why people in countries with strong environmental regulations enjoy much cleaner air, water, and food than people living in countries without strong environmental regulations. Markets had 70+ years to fix the poisoning of the air by leaded fuels. They didn't. Governments stopped it. The market answer to externalities was tobacco companies producing fake medical studies denying the health impact of their products, despite knowing about it for decades, or oil companies producing propaganda denying man-made climate change. 

Externalities aren't limited to market systems, but market systems don't have any way to deal with them, whereas other systems do, which is a legitimate criticism.

That's how game theory disproves market theories. Individual entities acting in their own self-interest does not necessarily lead to the best outcome, even just for those entities without accounting for externalities. It's objective proof that some form of central coordination is needed to reach the most optimal outcome.
