His life is absolutely fascinating. Emperor when he was only 3 years old, then loses that title, was most likely bisexual, was virtually a prisoner in Manchukwo while he was “emperor” there, his first wife died of opium addiction, was taken prisoner by the Soviets, then made a figure head of the defeated imperialist past during the Mao era. He was so pampered and ignorant of how things worked that he got lost after he finished his day job in the 60’s of literally sweeping the streets he used to own. He’d address unsuspecting Chinese citizens by saying, “Excuse me, I’m Puyi, the last emperor of China. I’ve lost my way home, can you help me?”. Both a monster and a brat when he was young but in his later years humble and fragile. Fascinating man.
