&gt; There are no corresponding issues for a 'white advocacy group' to concern itself with...

Utterly and abjectly false. [White British boys do among the worst in the education system](https://i.imgur.com/HlAOu2q.png), have higher rates of all kinds of anxiety / depression disorders leading to higher suicide rates. They have virtually no positive characterisation in media (unlike black Britons who get pretty universally characterised as either victims of racism or "heroic"), get to enjoy their history and culture being shat on constantly as one of supremacy and slavery, are viewed as ignorant racists and bigots if they're working class by our elitist upper class (especially from the left wing). I could go on.

I don't want racial advocacy groups but the idea that you couldn't start one to serve legitimate injustices on grounds of race towards white kids in particular is dumb and ignorant of copious amounts of data. If you value education in this country it is considerably worse to be of a white ethnic background.

In fact you thinking as you do is evidence of just how easily such an organisation could make fools of the people who oppose it.
