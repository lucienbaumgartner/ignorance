This really hits home for me. 

Today I drove my father and then pushed him in a wheelchair to see my mother in hospital. 

They’ve been married 49 years and never been apart for more than a week until Covid. 

My dad has spent the last 9 weeks in hospital and three days before he was released my mother was admitted to hospital. 

Today the doctors called to say she’s unlikely to survive until Monday. So we went to say goodbye. 

She was totally unresponsive and unaware that we were there. I said my goodbyes. 

Then I watched my 81 year old father stagger from his wheelchair, kiss my mother on the forehead, then stroke her cheek and say:

“Thank you for being my wife.”

There was nothing more to say and now we await the dreaded phone call to say she has died. 

What a perfect final sentence, just sheer happiness for the 49 years together. No resentment for having missed out on anything just pure love.
