Not sure regarding the women in the video; but in general, people with Dissociative Identity Disorder can present with voices (which can be co-fronting alters [alternate egos]).

While sometimes these alters can take on negative roles and be critical and malicious in nature; there are such that are basically: the younger child, sort of trapped in time: some, where they maintain the sense of trauma and abuse: some that are introjections of caretakers: and some that act as supportive egos, who help keep oneself functional (in regards to executive function). 

These types of alters, are sincerely helpful... and not bad for the person to experience or interact with.

But generally speaking, there are almost always persecutors and some malevolent forms of alter egos that present in DID.

That's a solid site that I was given reference to: from speaking with an individual who has DID.

Helped me understand how it develops and the nature of the overall condition. Predominantly the fact that the old name [multiple personality disorder] is no at all representative of the true disorder... It's not about personality, although from the outside; if you were unaware and myopic, you might see it that way... It's sincerely, founded around the aspects of dissociation, as a means to cope with abuse: and it's far from a cognitive choice, it's much, much more pathological in nature.
