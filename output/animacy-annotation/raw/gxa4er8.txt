The story behind the saying is that it was attributed to Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution. The common folks were rioting because they were too poor to afford to buy bread. When she was told of the riots, she said, “Let them eat cake!”

Now, I had a teacher who told us that Marie Antoinette was rather sheltered and ignorant of the cost of living, being a royal of the time, and had no idea that cake was actually more expensive than bread, and that what she said was actually very incendiary to the peasants. 

I’ve also heard that she never actually said the phrase in the first place. 

Anyway, the phrase, “You can’t have your cake and eat it too” rose out of, “Let them eat cake”
