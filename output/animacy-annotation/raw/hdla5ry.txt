The 4th one gets me because these are the same people who, when you bring up real controversial issues of our times where its bold to take a stand (abortion, reparations for slavery, hell even just stepping away from that, just talking about Kaepernick and BLM makes these guys aggravated).  But they really can do enough mental gymnastics to believe that they stand tall on the right side of history, as fighters for a just cause.  They're so sheltered and ignorant that quite honestly, to most of us it's just pathetic
