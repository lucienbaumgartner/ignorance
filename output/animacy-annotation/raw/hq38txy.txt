&gt; They have a good common ground of understanding in the most prominent concerns that relates to the average Muslim.

That is the point of my comment. No they do not. Hadith does not equal hukm nor does it even equal fiqh. 

Cherry picking hadiths without context and then presenting the opinions of people like Ibn Uthaymin (an anthropomorphist) and the controversial Ibn Tayimiyyah and his students as what the average or all muslim should follow is just ignorant and worng.

Again you cannot even explain their usul yet you present link to well known deviant site that was banned in Saudia for years. 

Did you he was arrested in 2017 and was released after kowtowing  MBS?
