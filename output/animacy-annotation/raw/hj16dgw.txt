Not when people use those views to justify hatred, bigotry, violence, etc. To many people have attempted to, and are attempting to, remove rights of individuals while using their religion to justify it. It's simply the club you belong to, and to many bad apples have ruined that club. By continuing to partake, fund, and expand these organizations and beliefs, you are participating and encouraging the negative side of it. People can make the argument "not all Christians" all day long, but even if the minority are using your religion to justify doing horrible things, and the church isn't actively removing or denouncing these people, then in the end the religion as a whole, and those that follow it, is the problem.

No one gives a shit about people believing in fairytales. It's the damage that believing in those fairytales has done to the world that makes it absurd and ignorant that people still believe in them.

If religion hadn't been persecuting people for hundreds of years, no one would give a shit. But it has, and continues to to this day. No one is required to "be nice" to people who hold views of organizations that actively seek to oppress them.
