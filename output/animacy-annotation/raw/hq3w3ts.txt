You come in here calling me "incorrect and ignorant" and are shown to be wrong. You're also wrong about this. I have nothing against homosexuals, but the numbers are quite clear: the policy is effective at saving lives. You've been wrong on everything you have said. I've provided you evidence to verify you are wrong. Just because you yourself might lie about everything in your life to make yourself feel better doesn't mean other people do. The numbers bear this out, as since the policy has been enacted very few infections through this means have been documented. To reverse it would be, quite frankly, homicidal.
