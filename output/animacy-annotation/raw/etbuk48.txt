The whole 'America is run by evil capitalists who just want oil money!' meme you see on the left is so bloody stupid. Even if we assume that all of US foreign policy is driven by a desire to get cheap oil, assuming further that demand is driven because the Koch brothers are paying off the government so they can watch their billions stack up is so utterly shortsighted and ignorant that I have a hard time believing people can get so excited over it.

Are these people aware that without oil the entire country would grind to a halt? The level of catastrophic damage that would ensue? A foreign policy motive of getting cheap oil is *not* because fat cat capitalists are trying to line their pockets, but because the country would *fucking die* without it.
