I’m currently a superintendent for a commercial general contracting company and I specialize in hospitals. I’d say I’m good at my job, and there are aspects of it that I like. Investigations for new infrastructure, planning of disruptive activities around occupied spaces, solving problems with out of the box solutions and having executive decision authority. What I absolutely cannot stand is waking up every morning to report to the jobsite at the literal anus of dawn, telling people to pull their masks up endlessly, to lock the door, not to smoke on campus, to tell them they are doing it wrong because they don’t have drawings, printing people drawings because they don’t have drawings, telling people that they are doing it wrong because they can’t read drawings, and dealing with uncooperative people who are completely unaware and inconsiderate of the health of the project as a whole. I also don’t like that I always have to be there, and that I’m always the guy who you call and who has to go fix it and watch everything all the time. Weekend work? You gotta be there. Third shift, gotta be there. Sometimes I wonder, am I just being a millennial little bitch? Most of the time I think, maybe this role and/or profession just doesn’t suit my particular personality type and let me use my strengths to their fullest potential.
