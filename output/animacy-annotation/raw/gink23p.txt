exactly, i get that this is a teenager oriented sub and that there are sketchy people who lurk in this sub. however, members of the subreddit  want to feel free and safe in this subreddit, but it’s nearly impossible to make it entirely safe. making accounts is incredibly easy and it’s difficult to actually permanently ban someone; some action can be taken by the mods(although apparently the mods suck and won’t take action), but it will never make this subreddit a perfectly safe place. 

Im not quite sure of the whole story that occurred here, and how the 14 year old girl was stalked, but it could probably be avoided with basic internet safety, right ( don’t immediately downvote me here; i understand that it is a lot of pressure and confusing to children getting manipulated and harassed by someone, which would cause someone to make mistakes or the wrong decision)? internet safety protocols like not providing any personal information, and then blocking and reporting any suspicious accounts or individuals. OP’s post said the pedo threatened to make 12 more accounts, but why couldn’t the victim just block all of those accounts? the victim could also create a new account of her own; karma is way less important  than getting harassed by creepy individuals. now it is true that some people may be frightened and unaware of what to do in that sort of situation, so this comment and OP’s post will hopefully provide people with good advice, so that victims and people who may become victims in the future will have more confidence in what needs to be done.
