Why do I have the impression you're a Scandinavian teenager or something? It's like you're trying to be racist but know so little that the best you can do is just...really weak.

Also, "blackies"? I mean I guess you're going for patronizing and paternalistic, but a diminutive nominalization of "black" is more cute than hurtful. It's like an infant in a tiny klan outfit: you want to be angry, but it's so disarmingly stupid and unaware that you're not even mad. You just kind of wonder who dressed the kid up in the first place.

Anyway, I understand now that you assumed I'm black and then tried to insult me with sarcastic pronouncements predicated on 19th century stereotypes. You're just embarrassing yourself, though. Do better.

Maybe go meet an a actual black person, or read a book, or something. That was pitiful.
