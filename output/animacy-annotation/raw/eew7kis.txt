I have a low IQ yet you're the one who still doesn't understand? LMAO.  Have you never played COD before now??? How on Earth can you say that both players experience lag at the same time?? I've played with MANY foreigners (France, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, UK, etc) who aren't noticing any lag at all yet I see them skipping around because their connection sucks and is given an advantage of lag comp. They totally understand this yet you can't and I'm the one with the low IQ? GTFO. I've played with fellow Americans in my party who were lagging and I wasn't. You seriously need to learn about lag comp and how it all works. I would bet my last paycheck that you aren't experiencing lag on your end but other people are seeing you skip around like crazy. You are being given a lag advantage so you don't notice. This makes it easy for you to kill and hard to be killed. This is COMMON knowledge! FOR YEARS!

(1) What you pay for a game doesn't guarantee you ANYTHING. (2) There is a REASON player 2 gets what you don't. Stop crying about it and talk to that person and figure that difference out. That's the only possibility.  Clearly it's not 3arc's fault if the other Chilean can get the lists. That person did/is doing something different than you. Find out what it is AND DO THAT TOO. It's really not that hard.

Honestly going to stop responding now because you are so thick-headed, arrogant, and ignorant that it doesn't matter what anyone says, you won't listen. And neither will 3arc. Your inability to have normal conversations with people is astounding. Love to stay, but I gotta go play the full version of this game that I paid for. Bye Felicia. ðŸ‘‹
