Interesting post. For the sake of some dialogue let’s have an educated conversation.

You mentioned that the “regulated physiotherapy” profession protects the patients from harm. Can you please elaborate on how physiotherapy regulations protect the patients? What physiotherapy assessment or interventions are specifically causing harm to patients? After you provide your answer I will share mine, as I am more then aware about the complaints that are sent to regulatory bodies in North America. Spinal manipulations should not be your answer as they are not an entry level skill in physiotherapy education.

Also, I realize that your post is likely fueled by some degree of frustration or anger, either towards chiropractors or a need to justify your own profession however, your edit is a load of crap. To say EVERY chiropractor does spinal manipulations that are unnecessary is a straight up lie, and simply put, extremely unprofessional and ignorant of you. That’s the equivalent of saying all spinal surgeons are terrible because all of them perform unnecessary surgeries. It’s the same as saying all fsmily doctors are terrible because they prescribe opioids.

I would highly recommend you reconsider your stance on another profession because justifying your biased personal beleifs and applying it to the entire profession is very wrong
