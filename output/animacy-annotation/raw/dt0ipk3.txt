Not all do. Many who become aware of the problems switch to buying humanely raised meat. Some don’t because they don’t care enough to, and some can’t because of financial reasons. Some switch off chicken, beef, and pork entirely and eat seafood because fish and shellfish do not have the nervous systems to experience suffering to nearly the same degree. Some turn vegan, some turn vegetarian and only eat eggs and dairy from humane farms. There are dozens of ways that people stop supporting inhumane farming. However, perhaps the ones you are mostly thinking of simply aren’t really aware of the problems. 

If you can accept those, then the only thing left to disagree on would be the numbers and definitions. For that, we can use [this](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017) which says:

&gt; 75% of US adults say they usually buy animal products “from animals that are treated humanely,” despite estimates suggesting fewer than 1% of US farmed animals live on non-factory farms.[5] This suggests a psychological refuge effect where people justify their animal product consumption by incorrectly assuming they are eating ethically-produced food.

There are other useful facts in there, but I think this is the most relevant. While they would clearly be wrong about where they are getting their meat from, what is important is their belief in this case and how it affects their choices. If I believed the meat I was buying was humanely raised, but it turns out I am wrong and unaware, that doesn’t make me hypocritical, but it would make me ignorant. To be hypocritical, I would have to know that the meat is not humanely raised and still buy it.
