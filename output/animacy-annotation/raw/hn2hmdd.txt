Did you read my comment? Thanos didn't have time to react
[Here's what the director said](https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-thanos-death-mcu-what-if)
So Thanos got speedblitzed because he was either arrogant, weaker, or both.

And no, superman can't do that since his Heat vision can't blow up planets like infinity stones do.And it doesn't even matter because this discussion has nothing to do with superman.

&gt;What? That is literally just nick fury stating how unaware and unprepared they are of being like that existing and if there's more. It shows their lack of knowledge regarding beings outside of their planet. That doesn't mean that Thor is invincible and nick fury is just setting an example

He literally says that they are hilariously and hopelessly outgunned.
