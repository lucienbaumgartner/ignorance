If you're not conscientious about your surroundings and start a fight that drags on and gets third partied, that's you fault for being foolish and unaware of your position and that of your enemies; now, I'm not going to argue that it takes 0 skill to third-party, but, that's a reality of a BR game; while on the other hand, starting fights around many opponents in a free-for-all setting like a BR is asking to get killed shortly after and being able to have non consequence for poor decision-making will degrade its competitive integrity.  Part of being successful is knowing when, where and what fights are worth taking. If you're looking to be rewarded for brainless aggression there's a new Call of Duty Game out every 9-12 months!
