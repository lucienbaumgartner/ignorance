Post and conversations following are about the arbitrary suppression of speech, that don’t align with narrow viewpoints and don’t allow for conversation. A basic principle of Peterson.

Don’t come here quoting someone, when you clearly don’t have the slightest inclination or what you’re saying or trying to get across. You just sound ignorant and pompous. 

Go to bed, or use some brain power so you can actually grasp the ideas of Peterson, rather than pseudo-intellectually regurgitate them
