I bought a house in California with money from
NFTs this year. You can call them worthless all you want, but to me you sound ignorant and closed minded. You don’t have to be a sports fan to see it’s value. Same with art/NFTs. Makes me wonder where the hostility and anger comes from. Jealousy? Like how bullies pick on smart kids. Why? It’s not about the smart kid. It’s about the bullies mental health and self esteem. Weird times.
