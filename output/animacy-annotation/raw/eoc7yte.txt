I caught genital herpes from a man who had HSV-1 (the "cold sore" virus) but was asymptomatic and unaware that he had them. 

Unfortunately, HSV-1 (which most typically presents as cold sores) can be passed genitally. In fact, about half of the new genital herpes cases are caused by HSV-1 because people don't realize that cold sores can be passed, because someone is asymptomatic, or otherwise. Because HSV-1 isn't meant to "live" or thrive genitally, it often presents with one initial outbreak and many people don't have outbreaks following that.

It's my belief that any form or location of herpes should be disclosed, whether OHSV1, OHSV2, GHSV1, or GHSV2.
