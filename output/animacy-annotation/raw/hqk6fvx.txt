No terrorism is directed at an entity, usually government, but can be towards corporations. People are unintentional victims of terrorism. This was planned murder the victims were chosen bc of their connection to the shooter. To think the shooter did this to prove some right wing agenda is ignorant and harmful. The dude was mentally ill with a gun.
