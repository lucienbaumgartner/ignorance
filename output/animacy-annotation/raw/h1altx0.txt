Call it my soccer elitism I guess. Like I said, I'd pay the fine. Watching Inter Miami soccer because it's a new local team doesn't mean someone watches soccer. It's obvious none of them watch any soccer whatsoever except for Mike and Whitty, and they watch the Premier League only. Listening to him talk about Messi coming to Miami was pretty naive and unaware of just how many endless transfer rumors there are in soccer. Every single player has been linked to every club, especially good players. I agree the juice isn't worth the squeeze. But it's a sport I care about, and Greg Cote doesn't know anything about it, no matter which rumor he copies and pastes from another website.
