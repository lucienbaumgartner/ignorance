I never got the notion that Ted was supposed to be a naive or unaware character. He's exuberant and optimistic and is 100% a people person. He knows people and how people think, sometimes even better than they know it themselves.

Sure, he's aloof in the sense that he doesn't do a lick of research about the game of soccer and just shows up to work day after day completely unprepared and ignorant of the game/culture/rules. But he has so much trust in his people skills that he just knows that it'll work out if he gets people on his side.
