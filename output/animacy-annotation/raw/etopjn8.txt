Ahh. So you also have a father that is on the "fake news" bandwagon and that you have realized that's it's best to omit politics from casual conversation as it will almost always leadnto an argument in which you're just young and ignorant that doesn't know anything?  Or is that just my relationship with my father?? Lol
