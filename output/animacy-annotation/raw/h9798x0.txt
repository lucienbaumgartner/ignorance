Exactly.

So much debate is in faith. Not to actually try and see another side of an issue but to prove that their views are right.

I like to think of myself as a we read and intelligent person. If there are issues, whether it's political...social...religious....ect..., I look I to both sides. 

The "crisis on the border"......the predominant GOP/conservative stance is that violent gangs are coming to steal all the wealth in the US....which is just racist....or that failing countries are causing their ppl to seek a "better life" in the US.....

Ok.....well....are there criminals that try to cross the border, sure, are some ppl fleeing from failing countries, yes....BUT....why? The US government is why. It was the result of predominantly republican policy in the 70s/80s that destroyed the government and economic well-being those countries...the democrats are also part of the problem but to a lesser extent.

There's a lot to be mad at. 

So when some goof ball says they are sending rapists and murderers to the US and you toe that line? I don't have to be nice to you, because you are racist and ignorant of the reality of the situation.
