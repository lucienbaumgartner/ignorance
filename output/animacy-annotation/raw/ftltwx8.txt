&gt;He can adopt a child but it won't be his, PERIOD.

... I have no words to describe just how insensitive and ignorant that is (EDIT: towards adoptees, *and* OP). With the number of shitty biological parents in this country, and you _fucking dare_ to say shit like that?

&gt;who are we decide what's the worth of having a kid is to OP?

I didn't say anything about the worth of a child to OP. I said that having children or not doesn't determine OP's worth - in a society which is well known for toxic masculinity, and unfortunately *does* place a lot of worth on the ability to have biological children.

You need to 1) learn how to read, and 2) get off your high horse.
