You won't get far with someone that entitled, immature, unaware and somewhat unhinged. You can either tell her about way she acts and how it makes you feel(she'll most likely not take this well and spazz out or she'll realize her ways and start to gain perspective magicly) or cut her off. She seems like someone you need to babysit and she has emotional dependency and at mid 20s...yHikes.
