I'm sorry, I can't tell if she is just new and ignorant of best business practices, or if she is just awful and trying to get you over the barrel. I would assume the first but keep the second in the back of your mind. 

And like I said, she may try to hold your images hostage, but don't let her. Small claims is relatively cheap to file and you don't need a lawyer (at least it is like this in my area). I'd be willing to bet a judge would side with you based on the contract (the way you've described it).
