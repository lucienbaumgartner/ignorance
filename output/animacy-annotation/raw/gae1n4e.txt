I think the best way to present this ethical conundrum is by using the trolley problem.

There is a trolley barrelling down the railway tracks. In their path are dozens and dozens of people tied to the track. You are standing next to a set of points that will take the runaway trolley to a different set of tracks, but on those tracks is tied an adolescent child, who will die if you pull the lever. What do you do?

Now, let’s change that scenario, and say that there are two runaway trolleys, and if you pull the lever, there’s a 30% chance that the points will move late, and consequently, one trolley will continue on its path, but the second will go down the second set of tracks, killing the child but not saving the dozens of people.

Now, let’s flip the order, so it’s the child who’s tied in the path of the trolley, and the dozens of people who will die if you pull the lever. What do you do then? 

Now, let’s take this scenario, but imagine that the child is your daughter? What would you do then?

Now, imagine that in order to get to the lever that will change the tracks and save your daughter, you have to personally kill a bunch of people guarding it. What do you do then? 

Now, let’s imagine that everyone on the tracks were unconscious and unaware of their fate, but you know that if your daughter on the tracks were conscious, her decision would be for you not to pull the lever. What would you do then?
