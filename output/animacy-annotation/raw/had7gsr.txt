You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means. Free means without cost. Your care definitely has cost, you just seem disconnected and unaware of what that cost is, who pays, and how it's paid for, so you seem to believe it's nothing. Do you think a 10K surgery just magically dissapears over an imaginary border line? The truth is that it likely costs 15K in Canada because of the buerocracy and lack of competition.



You pay taxes every year whether or not you go to the doctor. That is same thing as medical insurance. A politician fooled you into calling it "free". The cost is hidden all over, including inflation, the invisible tax, but worst of all quality of service. When the government caps doctor's salaries, they stop getting competitive. Competition drives innovation and creates new opportunities to better serve.



Now that you mentioned it,, I'm glad we live in the only country without universal Healthcare. Universal Healthcare is worse for citizens, not better.



 I know that when I need something, I can get it right away, I don't have to wait. I know that the quality and service will be world class. I know that when I stay healthy and don't use Healthcare facilities, I save a ton of money. I don't need to pay for my neighbors who may not be so cost savvy as me.  I know that when I don't like what a doctor says or the treatment options, I can go to a different medical facility where I get better results.
