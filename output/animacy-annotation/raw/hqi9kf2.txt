TLDR: 
1) You get partial immunity from being infected,
2) Joe Rogan has already been infected, 
3) has less reason to take a vaccine with side effects since he is at lower risk,
4) calling someone ignorant and stupid when you donâ€™t understand their position or the logic behind it makes you no better. 
5) Be open to other people making different decisions otherwise you become close minded, and ignorant from lack of knowledge
