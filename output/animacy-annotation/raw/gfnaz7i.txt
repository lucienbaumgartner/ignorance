They should, but honestly, if you believe anyone's word about their status you might be a little simple
The idea of making a risk assessment based on that is kinda silly because even if a person is not lying when they tell you negative you have no way to verify that or to know if that person is actually positive and unaware of it
The risk assessment should always include an assumption that every new partner is HIV positive
