As a man with insight I’d say definitely not the first one, maybe a bit of the second one, but mostly I think it’s just because they get turned on by the thought of a woman knowing that they’re getting off to her, like a form of exhibitionism. I think it’s less about trying to make a woman feel something and more just creating a scenario that makes themselves feel extra naughty or something like that.

At least that’s the way I feel like they think (or don’t think) about it based on how I think I would feel in the situation. I think you have to be a very special kind of unaware and inept to think it’s showing a woman respect. I also think most people aren’t just that malicious for it to be about making a woman uncomfortable.
