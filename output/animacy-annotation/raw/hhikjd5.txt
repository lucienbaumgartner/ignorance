As a Christian the way these "religious" people have been acting makes me angry enough that I don't want to have anything to do with them. If they actually believed in even the most basic principles of their "God-given immune systems", they'd want to use the vaccine to train that system to be a better fighter against diseases, not leave it unprepared and unaware of a possible threat. Going unvaxxed is like trusting a "natural talent" athlete that never trains or even works out to win the Olympics. (Also devolving into a rant here but I'm absolutely sick of seeing this ""righteousness"" excuse as a cover for stiff-necked ignorance and destructive pride.)
