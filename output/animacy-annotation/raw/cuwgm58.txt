&gt;I'm not really interested in your subliterate pocket dictionary contortions.

Then maybe you'd be interested in the fact that the "medical definition" includes suffering severely from hunger. You're not an intellectual, you're clearly just an angry person experiencing distressing cognitive dissonance at being confronted with a reality that doesn't support your preconceived notions.

&gt;The "medical sense" of the word isn't something you get to invent. Are you just stupid and unaware that there are actual clinical criteria for such a diagnosis, or are you merely dishonest and wish to ignore it?

There's no such thing as a "Medical Sense" of a word. There are "Medical terms," which is what I think you were *trying* to say, and "starvation" is a *medical term* that **includes suffering severely from hunger.**

If you want to contest the *literal medical definition* of starvation, provide your sources which exclude this criteria, else, shut your neckbeardy mouth, and get your head out of your fucking asshole. You've effectively conceded this argument.
