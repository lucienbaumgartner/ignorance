&gt; ...so there is no point in memorising it. If randomly i needed to know the boiling point of ammonia, i wouldn't rely on my memory from 8th grade, within a few clicks i would have it in front of me. 

Sooner than later, you will risk yourself not seeing the importance of knowing basic things because all you rely on is the internet. It will also give strength to the delusion that everything should be kept at a need-to-know-basis, and you might slowly lose touch with having and enjoying core knowledge of a certain subject. You could also argue, that someone will become arrogant and ignorant, that they don't see any application for it in the real-world. That's just not true. It's kind of the other way around, by knowing less and leaving things to learning by free will, you risk giving people less insight into your environment.
