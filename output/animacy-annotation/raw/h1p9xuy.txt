Look, I know a lot of POC (and I am myself of South Asian descent) who were mocked for their names growing up. Having their names mispronounced, willfully ignored, or given degrading nicknames that were more "pronouncable" or "normal" (I.e. white-sounding) and I want to be nice, but it is incredibly disrespectful and ignorant of someone to appropriate a name from a culture you have no claim to, doubly so when members of that culture or ethic group are being actively persecuted.

To OP: I am glad you have gained self-acceptance, but please, consider that your queerness does not shield you from your privilege as a (presumably) white person.
