It’s kinda upsetting to me how few white players have said anything. I get it they’re athletes and it’s not their job to speak out on social issues, but is this really such a hard topic to say anything about? These players love to preach that hockey is for everyone when NHL PR forces them to, but Aliu drops a big article about racism in hockey, and an unarmed black man is choked to death for a non violent crime, and everybody is silent except for the black NHL players? Are white NHL players so stupid and ignorant that they can’t comment on the lob of a topic about racism being bad? There’s a reason why young black kids choose to play basketball and football in hockey and it’s frankly because no one in hockey actually gives a fuck about them
