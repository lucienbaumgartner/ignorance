&gt; They also don't seem to care nor consider the ramifications their actions have.

This is the part that gets me the most. They say I'm a "scared sheep"  for getting vaccinated, that I'm "living in fear" (lines regurgitated directly from a pundit's mouth). They will never be convinced otherwise. Never mind that some of us care enough about our vulnerable neighbors to tolerate a little risk in order to protect them. Never mind that for many of us, it's more about doing right by others than protecting ourselves.

These are the same people who won't get vaccinated because they're AFRAID OF MICROCHIPS or WE DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. By their own logic, shouldn't getting vaccinated be considered brave? Aren't *they* the scared sheep?

They are literally removing themselves from the gene pool in the name of...what, exactly? A completely impotent political "resistance"? It's like they really conceive of themselves as enlightened freedom fighters while they consume 24/7 far right media hand over fist and take it as gospel.

Conservatives are so hypocritical and unaware of their own idiocy that we almost need a new word to describe them.
