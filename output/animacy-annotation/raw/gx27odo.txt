Thanks for a humble reply; I am fully unaware and ignorant to whatever ritual or religion this is a part of.

I know that Taoism and some other Asian religions will often leave food tributes so that their deceased love one may eat on their way to the afterlife.

I’m not all ignorant I guess, and I have to say that it’s a very real possibility. An unlikely possibility but one nonetheless.
