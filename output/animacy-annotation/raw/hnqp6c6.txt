I spent 10+ years in Catholic school so it is very much a part of my story and who I used to be and still am in some ways. I know for a fact that throughout history Catholics have appropriated many things from religions and cultures and made them into their own or twisted them into something new that better suited them. Jesus wasn’t Catholic, and yet you consider Him your Messiah. Catholics don’t own His message and they have no business telling others how to worship and yet they do. How many Catholics only use their faith as a status symbol, including most church leaders and nuns/priests? As a recall from my former school days, almost all of them are guilty of this. Your post is highly hypocritical and ignorant of the reality we live in. 

I’m a pantheist now with some pagan-leanings, and I used to be an atheist. If the Catholic Church can reclaim a pagan structure, remove all former symbolism, slaughter the people who refuse to convert, and then (attempt to) rewrite history? Then I will take their symbols and do whatever I please with them. Culture changes with time. And karma has a magical way of giving back to you what you gave to others and same goes for what you take. Stay mad about it or move on and accept it for what it is.
