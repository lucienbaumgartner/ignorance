I am never saying she didn't act out, especially with things out of his control. I'm saying she changed her behavior, and that Connor rarely if ever actually told her how he was feeling so of course she thought everything was fine. She was literally confused and unaware of how she was being received. And your reasoning is that she picked a trinket when that's literally what everyone did. Cely put a pair of panties in for Johnny. How is she hypocrite? What has she asked from anyone that she said she wouldn't do? She wanted to be exclusive, Connor did not, so they weren't and she found someone new and he did not even though he says he would've been open to new connections.
