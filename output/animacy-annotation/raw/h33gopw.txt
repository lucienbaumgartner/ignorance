And literally the entire dating community disagrees on this point.  People can have whatever expectation of who pays that they want. But since the point of who *should* pay is disputed by so many, it in itself is not a good indicator of whether someone is cheap or not.  

I would argue, who expects anyone to pick up their $2 coffee anyway.  It's fucking $2.

I'm in my 50s. I've never had a date not offer to pay.  Like, never.  I have guys I work with that I can't go to lunch with without them insisting on paying for my lunch, so I grew up in the "guy pays" world.  But I'm not so decrepit and unaware that I can't see the world changing.  I would never in a million years date someone who is cheap and nitpicky.  It's a trait that is very unattractive.  My point is that if she is literally trying to weed out guys who are cheap, this isn't a good way to do it.
