A) It’s called an example


B) Imperialism is defined as “extending a country’s power over another country”, I would say an occupying force who are pompous and ignorant of the country they are occupying’s culture fits that definition. ADDITIONALLY, you told me that wizard101 is based on true events, well Britain’s occupation of Egypt was literally an example of imperialism. The fact that you told me to learn history but lacked the background knowledge on the topic of our argument says a lot about who you are as a person.


C) If you read the above comments, you would know that when I called the zafaria storyline an example of the “white savior” story, I wasn’t referring to the player, I was referring to in game dialogue. Specifically, there is a set of dialogue where the young white student who got lost in zafaria turns around and ends up having to help the natives grow their plants. This promotes the idea that natives are uncivilized and have to rely on white people to accomplish basic tasks.
