I’ve seen many posters attribute the phrase “separation of church and state” to mean that government is absent of religion.  That is patently incorrect and ignorant of history. Unlike many nations at the time of our founding, we decided to have no official National religion and not tie our government to an official religion.  We wanted freedom to practice religion, not a freedom from religion. That’s the distinction. The Declaration of Independence states that our rights come from a capital “C” Creator.  The act of founding the nation plainly recognizes a higher power and the founders recognized the importance of religious morality as guiding principals.
