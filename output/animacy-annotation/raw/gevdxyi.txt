The call for more clarity on both sides is a very important point that will unfortunately fall on deaf ears.

Booing the players taking the knee was an ill informed stance against BLM as an organisation and not a movement, I don’t believe these people are particularly racist but rather they are frustrated and ignorant.

That being said we shouldn’t take the moral high ground, we’re all ignorant to some degree and we should look to rationalise the opinions of others if we are to truly to seek change.
