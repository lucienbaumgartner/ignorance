&gt;Not believing

&gt;is still a belief. 

That is extremely inaccurate, incorrect, and ignorant. 

That is religious indoctrination 101, make the claim that not believing is believing and try to cast misinformation onto those that don't agree with you.

&gt;I'm saying it makes more sense to me to just agree that we can't know

This is atheism. 

Because atheism is just saying (I don't believe the claims theists are making for their god) and not (I believe there is not god).

I think you're mistaking atheism with anti-theism.
