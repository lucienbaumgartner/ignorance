I gotta be honest. Watching the video, it just looks to me like he is pulling her hand as you would the reigns of a horse, to get her posed more in front of him like the other girl. Why she recoils, I don't know, kids can be pretty unaware and uncomfortable in general. She just seemed surprised about being pulled closer.

But this didn't look like what you/Twitter post describes.
