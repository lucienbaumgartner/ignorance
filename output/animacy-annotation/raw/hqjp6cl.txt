I grew up in a town of under 3k and now live in a city of several million.

And honestly I think it's the other way around. People who stay in a small town their whole life seem more judgmental and ignorant of the way other people live their lives.

I think city people do have weird expectations for convenience, but honestly most people moving to a small town know there aren't going to be those conveniences and just need to have time to adjust.
