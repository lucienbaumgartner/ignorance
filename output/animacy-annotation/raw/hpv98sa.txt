I agree. Even Chris is an asshole in his own way. They're all fucked up. And they're all so...*stupid.*

Like how the fuck in this day and age are they this ignorant and uneducated. They all have phones and internet and there's all kinds of online classes and shit you can take for free. There's no excuse for them. They all just expect everything to fall in their lap.

Amy really infuriates me because of her stupid hillbilly talk (not a fan and I don't find it funny to be that willfully ignorant) but like the last episode she thinks she's ready for skin removal like bitch you're still incredibly overweight, you're not ready for skin removal!! Like how delusional these people are. 

But the most infuriating thing is Tammy's disgusting little snotty 3 year old angry pout. Like everyone around her is wasting her time. She's a fucking pathetic psycho that doesn't even deserve time on this earth. Not if you treat other humans the way she does.
