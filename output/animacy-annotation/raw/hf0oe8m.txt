Lol N A H 

I wrote more than just Nah but clearly you're confused and unaware of that, i explained myself before, but i appreciate you giving me the chance to explain again:

You're allowed to post pictures for whatever reason you want, so long as its within rules. This post has been up for a while, clear to see it hasn't broken any rulea. You are allowed to feel and do whatever you want with your post. She posted it feeling confident, read the title 'I felt pretty' kinda hard to miss. 

Does that mean she wants attention from you? 

Nope. 

Does that mean you are trying to MAKE people perceive you this way? Nope. 

But you don't care, you assume her thoughts and actions. You're the problem here, not her. If there were less people like you making her confidence out to be such a big problem for you then this wouldn't be a big deal. But nah, you are not liking this girl being happy, and it shows.
