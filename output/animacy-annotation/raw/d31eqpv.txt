I have no personal experience being a high roller, but the evidence is that businesses as a rule do not engage in unprofitable activities for no discernible return.  But I guess my lack of personal experience make me unaware and foolish while yours... um... whatever.

Also, I don't think you understand what 'self awareness' means.
