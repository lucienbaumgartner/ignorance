That’s sad I’m sorry to hear about your relationship. In my opinion I think some parents (like my mom) are uncultured and unaware of how fast our world in changing. I’ve seen 16 year old moms be a better mom than my mom was. It’s normal to be pregnant at such a young age wether you have your life together or not they still make it through. You can choose to be a part of my happiness or you can leave.
