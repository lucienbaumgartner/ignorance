I see what you mean about DJW and I certainly agree that he did have a lot more influence than an art director would normally have. Yet there are many in the fan base who keep whining about how “Wyatt ruined Ben 10” as if he had some kind of vendetta against the late Mcduffie, a man whom he was good friends with. And yet people hardly mention the actual writers like Matt Wayne or Charlotte Fullerton (who was literally Dwayne’s wife).

XLR8 is actually my favourite alien, I just love speedsters and believe that Fasttrack gets too much hate. In a universe as vast as the Ben 10 universe of course there are going to be species with the same abilities. I would prefer a more organic appearance for him such as the one in 5YL though. I’m interested in your ideas for improving him though, as it would be nice to have him be more different from XLR8.

I never fully thought about just how disturbing Omniverse Ben’s behaviour is towards the end of the show. He always felt aloof and unaware of the gravity of the situation. At least in UA and even AF Season 3 he gets serious when he needs to. I’d genuinely be scared as a citizen if this is whom the protector of the earth is.

Must be misremembering about Albedo. As for Kai, I really don’t understand why they needed her to have a weird attraction to Ben’s aliens. I really wasn’t opposed to him and Julie breaking up (she felt like a good first love interest but not his life partner) but...Kai was just terrible handled.
