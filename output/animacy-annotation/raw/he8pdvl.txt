It had everything to do with jobs... the parts of Gordias the average parts of the playerbase complained most about were the DPS checks. Why is it hard to hit DPS checks? Because jobs were so complex, unbalanced and players were bad at them. Bad and unaware of how bad they were. Remember the complaints about Faust? I do..

And why not? Because that is an awful way to distribute difficulty in a PVE MMO where the endgame is based around raiding... and would again kill the raiding scene in this game. If you want more difficult content, it's there. If you feel like you've mastered your rotation and can parse well in dungeons and casual content, then move on to harder content and try to do the same. When people get to the edge of that point, they normally stop complaining about rotation complexity.. because it turns out it is non-trivial and actually fun to optimize your DPS while juggling mechanics. This also gives the devs more leeway to design more interesting encounters. But if you're spamming dungeons and complaining because the skill cap on this game is too low.. I mean I have nothing to say to you lol.
