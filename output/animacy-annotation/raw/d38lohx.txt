We had no idea where we had to go to find the hidden swimming hole.  Local skaters suggested we take a back road and we followed it. It turned into a one lane patch of pavement that arrived to houses. I pulled over off the side of the road near a no parking sign. It was clearly government marked and in my head shined as a promise. We walked into the woods and onto steep rocks. But no water. We picked a direction and went that way, and finally came to the 15 ft quarry lake. It wasn't worth the while once we looked across the way to the 60ft cliff. We jumped off it and only after did I then realize i had no idea what was below the surface of the water. I felt off balance and worried about suddenly flipping any possible direction and i was scared and then i felt utter balance. Perfect stoppage of all time right before being completely engulfed in the cool water. I got to the shore and stepped to find a lacrosse ball sized blood blister on my foot. Weeks later I found out about the massive amounts of rusted mining equipment and huge boulders in the very lake we jumped into and I heard rumors of people dying on that very jump. But for that day I was unaware and alive. We cheered for ourselves, returned to my car to find a parking ticket, so we rolled a joint, and drove home.
