If I might ask, are we talking about platonic or romantic interests?

If platonic, then my advice was not to remove them from your life; but, to find *additional* new people unaffected and unaware of your prior betrayal.

If romantic, then if I may inquire, could you perhaps elaborate on the nature of the betrayal?
