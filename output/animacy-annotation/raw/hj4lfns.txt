"Go for the ones that don't need fixing but who are looking for a healthy relationship... You can't fix people who are totally unaware and unwilling to go to therapy." So true.

We need to be self aware, but so do our partners. We can only help each other grow so much if one is unwilling to reflect on themselves and dig deep.

I go back and forth on whether or not I want to remove my ex from FB, but I have not looked at his page in months out of fear of seeing him in a relationship with someone new... that would crush me. However, the other day I started to feel some some empathy for him for not being able to look at the root cause of his issues and identify it, because there lies the solution to why he is dismissive. I hope one day he finds the strength to go there, for his own sake and his own healing. Me - I'm an open book, and I wear my heart on my sleeve. But i need to learn maybe to share less of my feelings about everything sometimes and just focus on those things that matter most... pick my battles.

I love and miss him so much, but I'm just focusing on me. I'm the only one I have control over, and I refuse to beg and chase anyone, because I'm worth having someone who sees my value without me having to point it out to them. I know I'm a catch, so hopefully one day I find a man who sees it too and decides to stay. üôèüíï
