We do not have a police brutality issue in the UK that warrants protests in the middle of a pandemic putting those more vulnerable at risk.

Are you really that fucking arrogant and ignorant that you are willing to risk the lives of the most vulnerable in society and invalidate the suffering of hundreds of thousands.

Sounds pretty fucking ignorant to me.
