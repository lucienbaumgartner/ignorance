This comment highlights how unaware and blind men are to the lived experiences of women. Even if OP is not a woman, as a woman myself I would definitely be afraid of someone trespassing on my property. What am I going to do to stop them if they decide they want to hurt me? While unfortunate, it is true that a lot of people living on the streets suffer with addiction and mental illness. 

Being afraid of someone coming onto your property uninvited is valid, especially since they're crossing physical and psychological boundaries and invading what is supposed to be a safe space. God forbid you want to enjoy the property you pay for in peace. 

We also have trespass laws for a reason. If what this guy was doing was okay, it wouldn't be illegal.
