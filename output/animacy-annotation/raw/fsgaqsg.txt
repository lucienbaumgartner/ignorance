I don't necessarily agree with this. Even in terms of criminalization of homosexuality around the world the Catholic Church/states weren't the most responsible. 

Our upbringing has a lot to with our internalized homophobia, but the way we consciously accept or reject concepts socially build for us says more about who we are. The way some people in this sub talk about gay people is arrogant and ignorant that it seems they've never met a gay person in real life or have gay friends, to understands our complexities and varying interests. Also, fetishising straightness and masculinity is a whole other problem.
