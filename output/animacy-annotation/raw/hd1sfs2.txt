&gt;I think it's awfully arrogant of you to say only Indians live in impoverished towns.

I think it's arrogant and ignorant of you to say I said that. I said there are towns of rich white people and towns of impoverished natives. That's absolutely true. Furthermore, census data makes it glaringly obvious that natives in Montana are worse off than whites, OVERALL, in almost every metric, so your argument that everyone is just happy and co-mingling is fucking ridiculous.

Lastly, more people in montana would = better laws being passed to support natives and social support, and more people paying taxes to do so. Plus more economy to boot. There's tons of land just sitting unused and costing the fed millions to keep up on. But I doubt you know anything about economics... as your comment indicates you're the kind of ignorant person that thinks out of staters just move to montana to collect welfare and drink soy lattes.

And sure, some shitholes on the east coast have cheaper car insurance, you could go to Iraq or Bangladesh or something and probably wouldn't even need to buy insurance.
