I was totally hoping he was gonna take 1 step too far into the street and get hit by a car. Not to die, but just enough for him to feel the karma. 

A couple observations...I dunno why he felt the need to say the “on this date” thing like 4 times. Once sure. Twice even. But that many seemed ridiculous. 

I also love this selective science. Okay so you think covid is all a box and propaganda. Fine I’ll play along. How do you catch a cold? Regular flu? Ebola? It’s not magic. It’s human transmission.  These people don’t deny the flu exists or that colds exist. Yet he seems to think that you can’t get sick from close contact to people. 

Lastly...you can tell this is Canadá I feel like because as stupid and ignorant of an interaction as this was...it was still pretty cordial. 

PS does Kerrisdale cameras usually have that many employees? It seemed like a ton of people working there considering it’s non essential, mid pandemic and in a high end specialty shop.
