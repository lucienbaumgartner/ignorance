What I am saying is true…and basic knowledge…
North Korea was a Soviet puppet…I’m saying basic historical facts.

How is that a problem? We’re talking about the Korean War, not America’s policy or war justification in general. In fact the reason why the US got involved in the Korean War was to protect Japan. You do realize there are different justifications to fight a war right? It doesn’t have to be black and white. Oh and I also support US involvement in Tibet.

Just like you brushing off war crimes from the North Koreans and Chinese? It’s funny that all of these things affected North Korea, but yet they were in a better situation than South Korea for years afterwards…

Again, you’re just ignorant and blinded by your ideology. Learn more about this before speaking about it. Oh and I’ve worked with North Koreans as well; they don’t like the Chinese either.
