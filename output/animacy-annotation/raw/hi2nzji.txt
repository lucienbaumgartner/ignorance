Life is a miserable decline into tyranny because the average person is intellectually lazy and ignorant of history. We literally have proven “conspiracy” theories on record dating back thousands of years. The ignorant masses deny this to our public detriment. Literally 2,000 years ago we have PROVEN records of “conspiracy” theories. Julius Caesar plotted with Crassus and Pompey against the senate. There are numerous examples like this. The average simpleton will just laugh it off and pretend the world is EXACTLY as explained by CNN. It’s a losing battle man, I welcome the incoming collapse.
