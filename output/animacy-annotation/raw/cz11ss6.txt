At least two of these recomendations should catch your eye. 

**Anime:** {Kotoura-san}. Character: *[Haruka Kotoura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san)*. Abnormality: She's a true mind reader in a setting so realistically close to our present time, its science is literally unaware and unassuming that psychic powers actually do exist despite and due to their extreme rarity. 

* [My analysis of the show](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3cah9r/are_you_looking_for_a_slice_of_life_that_can_take/) notes more highlights to think about as you watch because everything does make logical sense or is otherwise understandable. This narrative is simply a master of "showing and not telling", and it's very fair about the details it reveals in accordance to their respective climaxes and resolutions.

**Anime:** {Scrapped Princess}. Character: *[Pacifica Casull](http://myanimelist.net/character/275/Pacifica_Casull)*, the titular princess. Abnormality: She's prophesied to be "the poison that will destroy the world" on her 16th birthday. She also should have died as a newborn but she "miraculously" survived (thanks to the Casull family who adopted her afterwards). 

* This one is much more action driven compared to the others, and it has a very unique twist on medieval fantasy in general.

**Anime:** {Gingitsune}. Characters: *[Makoto Saeki](http://myanimelist.net/character/82709/Makoto_Saeki)* and later *[Satoru Kamio](http://myanimelist.net/character/88429/Satoru_Kamio)*. Abnormality: Since they are the last true heirs of their respective shrine-keeping families, they have the ability to perceive and interact with supernatural beings known as heralds, spirits of dead animals who inhabit said family's shines ever since they became direct servants to the gods that the shrines were made for.

* While this show is Slice of Life and Urban Fantasy, it's more the former than it is the latter. It's a very unique and creative experience for said genres nonetheless, and it has one of the most beautiful settings that I know of.

**Anime:** {Castle Town Dandelion}. Character: *the entire Sakurada family* (except the mother). Abnormality: Each of said family members (*nine siblings* among them) has their own unique superpower because of their royal bloodline. 

* There is an interesting corollary at work here. They are not living in the castle but rather in a modest middle class suburb because the king is uncomfortable with upper class life in general. He also did this because he wanted his nine children to grow up with ordinary lifestyles among the common folk despite their abnormal qualities and ties to monarchy.
