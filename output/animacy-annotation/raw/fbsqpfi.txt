How is Fred worse? Mitch did the raping, Fred tried covering it up, but he was at least personally disgusted by it. Fred is, in a lot of ways, very much alike other people that worked on the show, and he shouldn't (but will) be the scapegoat for everyone's sins.  


Mitch was so stupid and unaware that he played victim up until the very end, and I'm guessing we'll get to see him playing victim and trying to shift the blame in season 2.
