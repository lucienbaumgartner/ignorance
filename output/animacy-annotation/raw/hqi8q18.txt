&gt;I was told that pic to drawing apps are better than original work because it's not a waste of time.

Sounds like you were talking to a buffoon. There are a lot of people out there with very ignorant and frankly stupid opinions. Do your best to not let them get in your head.

&gt;Is this really how many people perceive artists? Time wasters?

No, I would say most people like and appreciate art. And while many people may not believe in its viability as a career path, most people don't seem to look down on drawing or painting as a hobby. 

What is a waste of time anyway? What better thing would you do with your time? As long as you're enjoying yourself it's worth doing. Most hobbies don't have a purpose beyond personal satisfaction.
