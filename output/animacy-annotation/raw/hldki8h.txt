Jesus fuck, I wish people would have this attitude. Or as other posters have said (and I 100% agree) please feel free to comment and provide a disclaimer that *you are aware that you may be unaware of the base truth in the situation and you're perfectly willing to learn about it*. That, to me,  is a gorgeous and lovely attitude. Because you're trying to apply what you know and think and use the smarts you have, while you're simultaneously saying "I may not have the straight of this, HELP ME learn, pleaae" and then you're not being an obstinate shitlord about it. The original Dunning-Kruger paper was titled "unskilled and unaware of it" iirc. And just that one simple step of recognizing your potential unawareness and inviting education/discussion is enough to take you from social media ape to flexible thinker instantly.
