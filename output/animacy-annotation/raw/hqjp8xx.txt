I hope people read this comment above. Its exactly how the delusional will rationalize their positions. They truly believe that listening to know nothing journalists reading press releases is “the data as it comes out.” They don’t care about and they will never look at the actual data. They are too ignorant and too simple minded to even understand the issue with their own thunking.
