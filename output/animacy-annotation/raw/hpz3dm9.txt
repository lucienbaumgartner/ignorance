Listen dude you're getting your ass handed to you in the comments, just log off reddit and maybe do some self reflecting. You called people racist for pointing out facts. That's one of the ignorant and idiotic things anyone can think.

Now you're sitting here asking me if I went to college?  You cant even stay on the same subject because why? You got BTFO.
