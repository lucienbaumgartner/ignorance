This comment is incredibly short sighted and ignorant of the genocide of indigenous peoples that continues to this day. You believe the way kids are taught in history class in the US and it's clear you never bothered to listen to stories directly from indigenous peoples.

History from the side of the perpetrator will always make them look virtuous and justified.
