&gt;You missed the point completely lol got his ass. A man waving a flag isn't doing anything to you. Its actually less offensive then the prolifers, but here you are. And speaking of narrow minded, just remember who fights for freedom and who got it for you.

This is so delicious I just need to break it down to savor every little piece of it.

&gt;You missed the point completely lol got his ass. 

Your point was that an idiot jumping at imaginary persecution is the same as protesting abortion, and that protesting abortion is 100% right all the time.

Not uh... not a great point my dude. Not exactly rock-solid logic.

&gt;A man waving a flag isn't doing anything to you. 

Now who's missing the point? Sweety you know what the actual point was. You know. I don't have to explain it to you. Unless you're claiming that you're that big of a complete idiot... is that what you're saying?

&gt;Its actually less offensive then the prolifers, but here you are. 

Oooh, the "I know you are but what am I" argument. There's a reason people stop using that after 6th grade.

Tell me all about how much more harmful my "profiling" was compared to encouraging the general public to not only remain disease-ridden, but to turn it into some kind of paranoid violation of human rights? Go on. What, specifically, are you being restricted from?

&gt;And speaking of narrow minded, just remember who fights for freedom and who got it for you.

Uh... Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau when he arranged for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

You think YOU'RE the one making society more free by ensuring that it's disease-ridden, paranoid, and ignorant of the practicalities of what's actually happening in favor of a bunch of slogans and rhetoric? LOL
