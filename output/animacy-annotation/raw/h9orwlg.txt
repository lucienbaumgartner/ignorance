Yes i could, but trying that everytime i see a post like that is wasted energy. People are ignorant and won't take neutral/constructive criticism. So now i only discuss things by process of elimination, if i see someone hellbent and ignorant of other opinions, i wont try to discuss because they'll just be in denial. Someone who seems open to new ideas, i would try to strike a discussion.
