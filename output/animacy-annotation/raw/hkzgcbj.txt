A lot of people associate children with innocence. And innocence is in the same group as "good", since we place such high importance to the idea. Sure, kids are annoying and gross and all that jazz, but they're innocent! How can you hate something that is so blissfully unaware and small?! 

Turns out, a lot. I can't stand kids. And I dont need to give a reason. Pro tip: every other creature in the animal kingdom knows that if it is being too loud, they die first. Just saying.
