Its not possible to play Splatoon with the GC controller as current mapping leaves you unable to turn into squid form making the story impossible and in multiplayer a pretty huge disadvantage - you cannot refill more ink quickly so would have to wait for it to very slowly refill and cannot get around the map very well nor fast.

Its not like Splatoon or most games even use or need all the buttons, Splatoon would be playable with a slight remap though no motion aiming! Most games would be playable with a slight remap and I think its about time that remapping was built into the OS or whatever.

The real issue is marketing - they don't want to cause more Wii/U style confusion but I don't think they need to market the GC controller outside Smash, people more into gaming will know and make a decision to try it or not if there was mapping for all games and casuals will remain blissfully unaware and unconfused.
