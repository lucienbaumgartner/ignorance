Like ol boy epicsteak said. It’s not gonna “ wipe us out” completely. But it’s designed to be very good at accomplishing goals and it’s only goal is gonna be improving and prospering. If we get in the way of that, it will deem us useless and obstacle and find a way to weave us out. And oh my lord are we an obstacle. Humanity doesn’t deserve the beauty of earth. Literally just look at us in America. We are beyond divided . There are people out there that’s it’s hard for me to believe a human can be so ignorant and violent for no reason. Look what we have done to the earth, endless wars, poverty, inequality, rape, murder. We are the biggest obstacle to our future as a race. If we ever gonna have a chance to become a super intelligent species or a peaceful world or interplanetary species. AI is the way, because we are far too egotistic, materialistic, and an imaginary paper runs our day to day life and drive. Yes if there was an artificial intelligence with no feelings or ego or character, it will 100% deem humans useless to the prosperity of earth.
