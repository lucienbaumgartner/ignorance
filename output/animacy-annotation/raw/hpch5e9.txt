You're the one with the one-side opinion. All I've seen you basically talk about is how children are the awful people and that TikTok is 100% to blame. You fail to see how other generations of selfish ass holes have led to this new generation's mix of behaviors and the next generation of ass holes. 

Also it's very rude and ignorant of you to assume anything about me.
