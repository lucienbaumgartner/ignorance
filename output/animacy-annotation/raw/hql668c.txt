it is also an incredibly stupid point of few they have.  If you don't like it just leave? So if every teacher doesn't like it or even like a large number like half didn't like it and all left to different states, then what would happen to our education system here?  It would just collapse?  Completely short sighted, ignorant and plain stupid.
