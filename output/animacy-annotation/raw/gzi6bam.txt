Her character is the one I'm most fascinated by. Did she come to Earth because of the destruction of Titan? If so, she's one of those very people who ostracized Thanos and caused his descent into becoming the Mad Titan. And if that is her nature, is she coming to Earth with the best of intentions? Or is she still vain and ignorant of the plights around her? If it's the latter, is she going to turn out to be an antagonist? Or at least an anti-hero, forced to reckon with the guilt of shunning the man who would go on to kill trillions?
