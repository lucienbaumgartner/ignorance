You missed the entire point of the post. You didn’t answer the prompt with anything other than scorn and what you said is a perfect example of white fragility and rampant blunt generalizations in the face of every fictional example you used. You don’t know what as you put it, “Racism”, is because you have never experienced it every single day of your life. Which is what every white person ever has experienced, and is one of the reasons why POC are so frustrated. You have no idea if a black man automatically thinks you are racist if you say you hate him. You cannot read minds. That is called white fragility on your part. You provide no citations. No stats. No sources. You speak purely out of a place of frustration and non-existent disenfranchisement. No one is saying a person hating another person of differing skin color is racist. Lets say I hate Barack Obama for his bombing of people in the middle east. It has nothing to do with the color of his skin. Like you bring up, it is because of the state of my mind. Yours is in a state of bigotry. You are assuming black people are thinking things when they most assuredly are not. Minorities want equality, not as you put it “Getting into the place of majorities by calling them racist”. The fact you even imply that is inherently racist and incredibly wrong and uneducated. You are fearful of something that is not what BLM wants or what many activists in the POC community want which is incredibly sad and ignorant of you to feel. You put racism in quotes and capitalize it as if it is some fairytale, some distant idea that is non existent when you are blissfully unaware. You are in fact a living example of it.
