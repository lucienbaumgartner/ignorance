Hahaha the classic argument, that’s just like saying I’ve got a black/Asian friend so I can’t be racist, you really are ticking every rightist box. 

Of course there is so much evil in Islam, I’m not stupid I see that. But if you take into account the amount of Muslims in Britain and the amount of attacks it amounts to an absolutely minuscule amount. 

I’ve got family in London when the bombings have taken place but I’m not that stupid and ignorant that I’m going to defend a scumbag like Tommy who literally thinks every single Muslim is a bad person because he surrounds himself with a racist echo chamber. 

If you DONT KNOW EVERYTHING HES SAID THAN DONT DEFEND HIM 

Do you not realise how stupid you sound and how you’ve just totally invalidated your point?!
