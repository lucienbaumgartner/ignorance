I don't live with my parents, I just take him over to visit. I usually bring his bed with him and that is it. I only bring him over so he can see and interact with them. His biting is play biting, and of course sometimes he tries to bite harder because he doesn't know any better, but they don't make it any better by both being completely stupid and unaware of the fact that you're supposed to get away from him.
