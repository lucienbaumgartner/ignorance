Venezuela is a failed totalitarian capitalist state. Maduro was and has always been a liar who posed as a socialist just long enough to bleed the country dry.  The ones with actual populist ideals would be places likelike Iceland, Norway, or Finland, and none of them are "shitholes".

The shitholes happen when fake-ass "populists" like Trump and Maduro convince the most gullible and ignorant that he's on their side long enough that he can steal everything that's not nailed down once he's in office.
