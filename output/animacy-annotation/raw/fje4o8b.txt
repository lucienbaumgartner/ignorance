It's a shit hole.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape\_in\_Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Pakistan) 

Stop being a fucking idiot and defending a garbage nation with a garbage culture. Clearly you are a Pakistani or someone related who is offended that someone is rightfully calling his nations trash.

" The group [War Against Rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Against_Rape) (WAR) has documented the severity of rape in Pakistan, and the police indifference to it. "

" According to Women's Studies professor Shahla Haeri, rape in Pakistan is "often institutionalized and has the tacit and at times the explicit approval of the state"."

" up to seventy-two percent of women in custody in Pakistan are physically or [sexually abused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_abused).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Pakistan#cite_note-Goodwin-6) "

You are so stupid and ignorant that you do not deserve the right to speak.
