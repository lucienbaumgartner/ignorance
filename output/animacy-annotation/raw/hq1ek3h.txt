On the one hand, absolutely.

On the other hand, in the same way that slaves were kept ignorant and illiterate in order to maintain slavery, the masses of people are kept in survival mode / poverty in order to maintain capitalism/kleptocracy.  

I.e., the bourgeoisie classes like to keep the time for leisure / useless activities to themselves, because it's a form of peacocking their wealth and distinguishing themselves from the poors who can't afford to waste a lot of time because they're too busy working for survival.
  
To some extent, the prevalence of "rise and grind" mentality, while it is a sickness, is a sickness that's cultivated and a natural outgrowth of the poverty and brutal material conditions created by the capitalist/kleptocrat class.

TL;DR - Culture and mindsets are the fruits of underlying material conditions, and real change (versus superficial / pseudo change) requires attending to the roots of a sick society and not just the psychological / cultural fruits.
