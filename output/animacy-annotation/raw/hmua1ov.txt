So my takeaway from that article was that

1) it was a very interesting history of the death penalty in Jewish culture

2) The relationship with the death penalty is complicated, the obviously have an aversion to it but admit it has its place, while some rabbis decent, saying all capital punishment is wrong

3) How do you feel about targeted assassination of military targets? I think there is some parallels to executing a prisoner in custody(which gives opportunity for a trial) and executing a military target who is unaware and indefensible.(can't be tried).
