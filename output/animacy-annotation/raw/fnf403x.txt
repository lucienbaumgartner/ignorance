100% and I'm in the same boat as you...But right now people are scared, their livelihood is in jeopardy, their way of life is collapsing around them, and there is pending doom over the horizon...especially since we have a federal government that is so tone deaf and ignorant that it feels like we're completely on our own to fend for ourselves.

Let people hope. They need it right now.
