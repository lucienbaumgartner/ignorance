For me it's not that the people or necessarily bad, they are just thick as pig shit and completely inconsiderate.

When we had that bit of nice weather midweek round mine we had people blasting their shite music throwing empty stella cans all over the front gardens which are on a public street. All going on until 1am with little kids still running around screaming even though it's a school night while the parents are still pissed up on the karaoke. 

The very same people would give you their last slice of bread if you needed it the following morning, not bad people just completely stupid and unaware of anything outside of their own head.
