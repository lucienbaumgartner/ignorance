I have personally had my car keyed six days after putting a sticker on it in the Bible belt.

So please, tell me again how that doesn't happen.

Oh, and tell me I'm "insane" when you LITERALLY are so fucking arrogant and ignorant that you claim a fictional character is actually real.

Let me say that again so it sinks in what a dumb fuck you are: you *actually* believe an invisible, magical, fictional character *is real*.  

You dumb fucking idiot.
