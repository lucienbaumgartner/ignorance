True but  while Fauci has been going on podcasts/interviews/segments that genuinely ask the "why" of the policies and the questions behind the science, you have to look at it coming from Rogan's side who openly said that you do not need the vaccine if you are healthy which, on its own is a stupid statement. There are plenty wrong with this and two glaring ones are: Joe makes statements that are uniformed and can be quickly debunked by the facts that SARS-COV-2 exposure has a notable antibody clearance, people who have contracted it can be reinfected again (clinical cases have been available since 2020 so this isn't new) and Joe knows specific people who contracted AND got sick from this despite being young and healthy. 

Now, Rogan is a high profile enough person to have access to people that work clinically with this bug. So, for him to make an ignorant and idiotic statement despite having data out there that has been available for a while to warrant the necessity of a vaccine to control this pandemics was really careless and ignorant of him to do. A BSL3 bug will kill you and this one can mutate enough -and is already doing it- that health level and youth are no guarantee of safety.

Maybe it may make a difference to interview Fauci but Rogan should know better because someone who has a platform like that making a baseless statement despite having absolutely no research, drug development or medical expertise at all is pretty typical of why the country is still wrangling with this shit over a year into it.
