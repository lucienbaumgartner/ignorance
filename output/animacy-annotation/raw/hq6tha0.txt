I think a lot of people love the idea, because they don’t think too deeply about it, and they get off on the idea that THEIR god is going to roast the people they don’t like.  People reveal something deep about themselves when they talk about this subject, and a lot of what they display is pretty ugly.  

Personally, I’m just another person struggling to get through this life, and even though I’ve been wronged in a ridiculous way by a few people, I’d never send anyone, ever, to a place of eternal conscious torment without possibility of reform.  The idea itself is ignorant and sadistic.
