Nah, that's just something Americans are told so that they don't look further than their own backyard, so to speak. Most of us will never travel out of our home state, much less out of the country. And some people that want to *thrive* \- not just eke out a meager existence burdened by debt - have realized that it's not possible here for them. In their case, comfortable mediocrity is not an option. They are legitimately suffering.

There are so, so many folks who want to head out into the big wide world permanently and can't afford to because of crippling debt they acquired when they were young and ignorant and believed in the dreams they were sold at a steep price. 

It costs over $2,000 to renounce citizenship, as well as friends and family. America now has the highest fee to renounce citizenship in the entire world because it does not want its citizens to leave. It's twice as much as the next-highest country. Personally, that sounds...off.
