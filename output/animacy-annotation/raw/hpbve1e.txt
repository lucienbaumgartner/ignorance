I've had partners with HSV2. It really isn't a big deal if you educate yourself and take the proper steps. Regular testing has showed me that I don't have it, but I'm going to keep testing nevertheless. You suffer from a mindset issue more than the disease itself and I think you need to fix your attitude more than anything. 12% of adults have it, it really isn't a huge deal. If it truly is ruining your life then there are other factors at play here, because 12% of adults aren't in pure anguish over this. Fix yourself before making awful statements like 'end testing now.' It's truly selfish and ignorant of you.
