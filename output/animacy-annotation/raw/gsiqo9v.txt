That is just factually incorrect, and ignorant of how Brexit went down.

Trump was not running under the threat of incoming regulations from the EU, his aim was self-enrichment, which is materially different.  The anti-vaccine movement was not started under the threat of incoming regulations from the EU, and saves no one from regulatory oversight, which is materially different.    The genocide of Muslims in Myanmar was not conducted to protect the wealthy of Myanmar from incoming regulations from the EU, nor create a captive economy for plunder, which is materially different.  The online recruitment of Al-Qaeda terrorists was not initiated under the threat of incoming regulations from the EU, their aims support local politics, which is materially different

So, ummm, no. They're not "essentially exactly" the same.  You're talking out your neck.
