I mean, it's not my fault some of you people were so blind and ignorant that you didn't notice how pay2win the game would be before it launched. Seriously, you ignored the fact the pay2win loot box mechanics were shown MONTHS before the game released, in the alpha.

Don't try to act smart, because you aren't. Sure, what EA tried to do at launch was awful, but it's entirely on the players that ignored the fact that games have been doing it for years that EA thought they could do it in this game.

I'm not defending EA with that comment, I'm saying that the people who cried about that, despite having a long time to prevent it (yet being completely fine with the same thing in other games) are hypocrites
