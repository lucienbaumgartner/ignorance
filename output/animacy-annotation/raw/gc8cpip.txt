Holy fuck you’re on a roll with awful arguments (but you managed to fit in pseudo-big words so go to sleep tonight feeling satisfied I guess). Your argument against me is that because I’m not arguing against socialism means I’m ignorant “of the entire construct” (probably a better word to use than “construct”)? So I can only be right if I’m against it, or rather, I can only be right if I agree with you? How incredibly arrogant and ignorant that is, especially coming from someone who just attacked socialism by completely misunderstanding it—like not even close. Also, don’t call people out on petty insults by using petty insults. 

But sure. It’ll be the only win I have. Thank you, man. You know me so well.
