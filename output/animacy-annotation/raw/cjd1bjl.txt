I don't care what skill level your teammates are. The same things applies: Once Legion has Blink, she roams getting pick offs and ganks. If your team is so inattentive and unaware that they don't notice you blinking and dueling the enemy hero 500 units away from them and help, then you probably weren't going to win the game anyway.
