I did read that, and there's no sound reading of it that could interpret it as saying they (HRC or the DNC) want to conspire to create an unaware and compliant citizenry.

First off: the guy writing all this is [Bill Ivey](http://globalculturalstrategies.com/bio/), who's an Indiana State University professor of the arts, focusing on folklore writing and ethnomusicology. He's previously served as an adviser for the National Endowment for the Arts under Bill Clinton.

The letter is a criticism of the public fervour surrounding celebrities in the mold of "Kardashian and Trump". The "we all" in the letter is referring to all Americans.

Bill Ivey is an artist, not terribly wealthy, and had said in a previous email that his wealth connections had "aged out" (I'm guessing he had wealthy parents who passed away or are in assisted living now). He's not a high-level DNC guy, he's someone who's being asked for money and is promising only a small amount. [Snopes covered it here](http://www.snopes.com/clinton-compliant-citizenry/)

&gt; If these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this:

&gt; And as I’ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking…”

&gt; No “master-of-the-universe” conspiracy; just a lament that leaders and policy makers have not been sufficiently attentive to some of the basics that make our democracy great.

&gt; Bill Ivey
