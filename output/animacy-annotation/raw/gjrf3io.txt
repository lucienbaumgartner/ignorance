Forgive the other comments too, they are idealistic and ignorant of the financial strain on your mind. They are understandably, but nonetheless extremely wrong in thinking it is okay to go 5 years without contributing anything financially while expecting your partner to just accept your word on a gamble that it pays off. Your patience was actually incredible.

I'm very interested to know his reaction, feel free to follow up through comment or PM if you would like to share.
