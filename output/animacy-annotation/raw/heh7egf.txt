n-no.... they couldn't! o.o  


I am constantly forgetting that just because i've been exposed to the idea that 'dictionary arguments are bad' doesn't mean any other particular person has. Which, by the way, is another reason that philosophical discourse about the 'same old topics' is valuable and important. without a volume of discourse about an idea or without occasionally reviving a debate, everybody new to philosophy or just \*arguing\* would be lost and unaware of all the work that was done before
