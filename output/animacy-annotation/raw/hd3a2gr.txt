It feels really hard to wrap my head around that concept. Just because there have been OTHER times where I was really drunk and he verbally said the words "well you're drunk, I'm not trying to take advantage of you" and the rest of the night was spent watching t.v.

It just feels so much more likely that he didn't understand the level I was at. Is it possible for someone to just like...not realize their partner isn't consenting? He was extremely drunk as well, so I feel like it's possible he was just too stupid and unaware of reality as well.
