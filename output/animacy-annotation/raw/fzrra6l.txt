Why do you keep assuming I am someone that is of that mindset or political ideology. You're so bitter and ignorant, that shows you are right there. You know nothing about where I stand. Me calling you a name, triggered you and made you go off the rails. It is so unbelievably pathetic.

I'm not weaseling out of shit. You just want something your sick, delusional, mind sees that isn't there and you cannot grasp what  I am saying over and over in numerous ways, because you are mentally ill, which is why you wear diapers. 
Even if I was insecure, that is not the issue at hand, it is how tapped you are. I am not the one projecting and butthurt. Look at the paragraph you wrote.

It is shameful, someone should be getting you the help you need. You need psychological help. It is not normal or okay and your sickness will only progress and you will become more of a deviant. 

You're mad at the wrong person. I'm not what you are looking to project onto, this backfired for you. You are thin skinned and I see right through you. Just from the simple things you write. Just twisting what I say to try and sling it back on me, but it's just not gonna work, bud.

If this didn't bother you, as you claimed you would have stopped replying, six replies ago.
