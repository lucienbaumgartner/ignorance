I included bonus stories if you're into that sort of thing. All of these are from around 30 years ago. Woman I just met suddenly stuck her tongue in my mouth; as I was very drunk, it was kind of like I had taken too large of a bite of a slippery sandwich. 

Middle aged man pinched my 18 year old butt in an elevator in Munich, then leered and grinned when I looked over my shoulder at him; I exited at the next stop and took the stairs. 

Guy sat down next to me at a small party and started sensually running his finger up and down my back; I'm not gay. 

Guy at party told me I looked just like Kiefer Sutherland (I do not); as I was incredibly high, not gay and unaware that I was being hit on, I just said "Hey thanks man!" and that was that. I did not notice the awkwardness, but I believe he did.
