&gt;Sure, he's aloof in the sense that he doesn't do a lick of research about the game of soccer and just shows up to work day after day completely unprepared and ignorant of the game/culture/rules. But he has so much trust in his people skills that he just knows that it'll work out if he gets people on his side

I wouldn't say that exactly. Like you said he's less concerned about the rules of the sport than he is about connecting with the players. But I don't think you can say he is aloof and unprepared. Take the books he gave every player on the team. We only see a the titles of a few of the books but even from those it is clear how much thought he put into each one based on that player's personality and role on the team. He did this  for every player. That is a remarkable level of focused insight and preparation. Just not in the traditional ways of being a coach.
