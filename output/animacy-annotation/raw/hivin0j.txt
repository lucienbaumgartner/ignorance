What I would consider ‘appropriation’ (honestly it’s just racism, keep it simple and easy to understand) is more when you essentially masquerade as a person of a specific culture, knowing you will not experience a single negative while doing so, whereas if they were to emulate you, they would experience negativity.

Personally I think things like hair/food/clothing are universal, they have varying amounts of significance across a variety of cultures, and anyone one culture who claims to ‘own’ that, is arrogant and ignorant of the rest of the world.

Something like blackface however, is purely based on race/colour - and given that racism does exist in a large way across the world, it’s bad taste, and can be seen as using racism for your own gain. Which is just racist behaviour. 

I’m not sure if this is necessarily the ‘correct’ interpretation - But I think this is where it stems from, and people have just decided that cultures mixing is problematic, which is, in my opinion, a racist point of view.
