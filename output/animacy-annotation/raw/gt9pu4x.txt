I love how you're so uppity about your education and 'cultural sophistication' while simultaneously, *proudly* exhibiting a worldview so cartoonishly puerile and ignorant that you could be a character from Black Mirror. You are embarassing yourself. 

Anyone with a modicum of true class, intelligence, or sophistication would look at your little snit for exactly what it is - a spoiled child who doesn't have enough experience in the world to understand that their assumptions are have little basis in reality. 

The fact that you're acting like this in your 30's is laughable.
