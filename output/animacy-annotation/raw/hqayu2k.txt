On top of everything else ignorant and cruel about all those unfunny â€˜jokesâ€™â€¦ do they not know that â€˜Delhi Bellyâ€™ refers to Westerners feeling unwell because weâ€™re unused to the rich food in India?

Itâ€™s not even supposed to be an insult, per se: itâ€™s just a common way to explain feeling sick from the rich food. 

But they managed to turn an innocuous expression into an insult! ðŸ˜ž
