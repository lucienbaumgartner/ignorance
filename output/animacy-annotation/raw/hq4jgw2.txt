Oh wow, yeah this actually kicked off a bit of an epiphany in my brain. It’s a bit “woo”, but the best *analogy* I can come up with involves a *lot* of buzzwords, but since the most notable is “zeitgeist” I’ll allow myself the conceit.

In this case I think that the desire to create these distinct “tribes” is that some people have “stability” as a core value (think Westworld). They create these groups so they can perpetuate the status quo - continued erosion of personal rights to a consolidated power structure. As such power structures tend to project “stability” as a show of strength, in an effort to maintain power.

The thing is, “stability” is a good thing. So is “change”. Every ideal is needed in some capacity, a healthy society would have the capacity for both concepts to be represented equally. My conceit here would be to liken it to quantum superposition. 

Right now, our society is a bit imbalanced, I think it’s natural that people have more than one “core value”, and so there would likely be correlation between the various “axes”. It makes sense, given human history, that core values of “strength”, “stability”, “competition” would cluster together. 

The challenge is that the opposites of those values are *very* easy to frame negatively. “Compromise” becomes “weakness”. “Change” becomes “chaos”. And “cooperation” becomes “defeat”. This is something we can *see* in the talking points of the alt- and far-right. This *IS* how they frame those values *when being exhibited by the OUT group*. However, those who *exhibit* those core values *also need to value* the values of the other side. You cannot cooperate or compromise with someone if you refuse to accept the validity of their “core values”.

*SUPER* important note: This is not, and will never be a justification for intolerance. Intolerance is abhorrent to me (yes yes, tolerance paradox I know), but I also believe that reframing the ignorant and hatful as having those as “core values” you *are* falling into the in and out group fallacy, even just a *tiny* bit. Their justifications for their intolerance probably *are* more reflective of their “core values”, they’re just not applying the necessary *thought* in order to guide their *feelings*. Probably also opposing axes which we should try to balance (Hello MBTI, I was wondering when you’d show up).

I think I explained that well, or at least hope so. This is mostly for my benefit anyways, but I hope it provoked some thought (especially if you hate it!).
