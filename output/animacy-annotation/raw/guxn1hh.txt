&gt; And it could have happened. 

Could does not mean it is realistically possible. And for Canada it was not. Our society has norms that would not allow a strict government mandate to take place like we see in other countries. We cannot even make it through the current restrictions.

The laugh-out-loud comment is the thought that one-size-fits-all. It simply doesn't because the world is not black and white. What works in China may not work in Canada.

&gt;We already learned our lessons. You think covid is the first pandemic we've had or something? SARS, Ebola, H1N1. We've been through this all before. We knew what to do. We just didn't do it properly. 

No, those were different. Here is a link to help you understand how some of the previous pandemics related to COVID:

COVID was different than previous ones. We are able to learn from it and apply it to the next ones, however it is in an attempt to mitigate. Not solve.

If it was so simple we would have done it. It's not.

&gt;Everyone gave it a chance to succeed. This isn't our first lockdown. It's our third. 

We have never had a lockdown. We simply have had restrictions. 

And no, many did not give it a chance to succeed. That's just plain ignorant when you can look outside and see it, and when you can read the sub and read it for yourself.

&gt;Also, if you think our leadership are "the experts" instead of the actual advisors, scientists, and experts they keep ignoring, then you're the toxicity we all need to avoid.

&amp;#x200B;

Our leadership have the ability to discuss with the experts and put it into context within our society. You seem willing to ignore this because it doesn't fit your political stripe, and that's fine. But the hypocrisy you exhibit is part of the reason we have such a divide and your attitude only continues to strengthen others it their opinion - which like yours is also extreme and ignorant of reality.
