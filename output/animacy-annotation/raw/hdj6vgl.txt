He was also completely covered and bound by Stolas’ golden feathers during the end of his trip, trying desperately to escape them with a scream. Not only that, the chains still give me ‘rapey’ vibes. Like he can’t perceive actual, genuine and heathy intimacy, but as he craves it, he feels that Stolas is the best option. Not to mention the fact that throughout the series, Stolas seems incredibly narcissistic and unaware of the feelings of others. With Stella, Blitz and Octavia being the main three. Not only that, the idea of being bound to someone despite being called an ‘impish little plaything’ along with the only way you can access the human world is by having sex with them is not very, healthy… These kinds of things should not be looked up to. It’s obviously consensual, but I’m tired of seeing people treat it as some sort of ‘healthy’ and ‘cute’ relationship despite all the drawings and comics of Blitz and Stolas are usually done with a complete change to Blitz’s overall character.
