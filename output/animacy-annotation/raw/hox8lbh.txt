His [interview with Ezra Klein](https://youtu.be/pMOUiWCjkn4) was fantastic. Not only does he finally get called out for a lot of his intellectual dishonesty, he gives the whole game away at one point by admitting he starts every logical process *backwards*. He always assumes his religious beliefs are true, and he works backwards from that conclusion.

It's really fascinating to see someone sound so intelligent (because yes, he does *know* a lot) yet betray themselves as so self-unaware and illogical.
