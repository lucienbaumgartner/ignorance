I really hope the family of one the victims doesn't see this. Imagine your family member was killed be the indifference of some self involved famous person, and now there is a bunch memes and jokes that make the whole situation about how ridiculous and ignorant that famous person was. Those people died because that asshole couldn't comprehend their value over his own ego. And now their families are seeing their loved ones made even more insignificant because they are just the backdrop for a joke.
