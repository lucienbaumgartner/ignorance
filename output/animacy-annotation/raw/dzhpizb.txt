&gt;They are in no way endangering others.

About 12 months ago I had slowed down because of the rain one dark night and thankfully at the last minute noticed the young teenager on his bike, headphones in, no lights, no high viz jacket, no helmet, blissful and unaware that he had almost merged with the night. It freaked me the fuck out and I yelled at him as I drove past. 
I remember it clearly and the consequences could easily have been serious injury or loss of life. Think about the impact that might have on the rider, his loved ones, and a driver. Possibly forever. 

We use our streets together. How you ride or drive impacts others, and may endanger them.
