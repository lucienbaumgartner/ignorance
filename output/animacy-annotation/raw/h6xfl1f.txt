NTA. As a father with an autistic son that is prone to outbursts and doesn’t do well without me around I have to be conscious that my child will not be mentally or emotionally ready to do group activities without me there at the same age that other children are. 

It is not fair nor is it the responsibility of other children and other parents to bear the burden of my child’s behavior because I chose to pawn them off on strangers. That is irresponsible and ignorant of Molly’s mother.

While it is not convenient to have a child with special needs, it is your duty and no one else’s to care for your child and know the extent of their limits.
