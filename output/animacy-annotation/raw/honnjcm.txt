I have no idea who first started complaining about this, or who the author of the piece you mention is, nor do I want to gift them a pageview by looking it up; but I wouldn't be surprised at all, if it was some white person with no dog in the fight, or some third-generation Middle Eastern-American who's just looking to make noise.

I'm Mexican, and I've experienced my fair share of internet outrage over depictions of Mexicans, and Latin American people in general, in entertainment and foreign popular culture. And I haven't seen *one* Twitter shitstorm on the topic that doesn't cause me to roll my eyes, at how absurd, and ignorant of what *actual Mexicans* think, they are.

We're the first ones to parody our own culture. Yes, you can laugh at the ridiculousness of it. Mariachi outfits are fun, and so are ponchos. Nobody cares if you're white and celebrate Cinco de Mayo (people in the US celebrate that date more than people in Mexico, anyway). Have a pi√±ata at your birthday party, they're awesome. I laugh my ass off every time I see the [Trevor Noah bit about tacos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDk5ajNDgZc). Taco Bell is not real Mexican food, but it's your loss if you think it is; I'll be over here eating *real* tacos. If someone gets offended by these things, they're just looking for attention. Ignore them and move on.

Go check out /r/polandball. That's the attitude towards culture and stereotypes that everyone on the internet should have. We all laugh at each other's craziness and quirks.
