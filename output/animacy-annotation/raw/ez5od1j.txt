Billions of you ignorant morons believe in some form of invisible, magical wizard you call god, despite having zero credible pieces of evidence supporting the claim it exists.  In fact, you believers are so absurd, close-minded, and ignorant that you've accepted "Just take my word for it" as the single biggest reason to believe in this potentially life-defining idea.  Perhaps recognizing the fact that "Just take my word for it" is an *incredibly* stupid fucking reason to believe anything like this, you came up with a fancy word to help you feel less like the gullible fools you actually are: "faith".

Now you're easy to control and manipulate. You'll happily kill yourselves and others, or protect pedophiles from justice, all for this magical wizard.
