&gt; I dont think all trump supporters are racist though they either are ok with racism or are unaware and ignorant of the many many forms racism can take

I agree with a lot of the things you've said but this is patently false. I know LOTS of Trump "supporters" that are far from racist and condone it vehemently. That being said, they think the good that Trump brings to the table far outweighs the offensive things he's said. No candidate is perfect, we all know that, so you've got to take the good with the bad.
