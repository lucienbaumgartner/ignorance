The 30 year old boomer is a state of nirvana. Being blissfully detached and ignorant of the strife of the modern world, secure in some middle management position and only really worrying about missing the game on, and whether the weather could harm the weekly grill.

I cannot wait to be in this position. Get up at six, Crack the tab on my monster energy ultra, and fire up the ride-on mower.

Is there any true higher marker of success?
