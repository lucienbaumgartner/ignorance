Yeah OP, YTA.  
Given the fact that you didn't know anything about the girl, you have no gauge of how much she might see something like that as a violation. As a woman who would tend to be flattered by a guy putting effort into tracking me down, I find this creepy.  
TBH, if I were you I'd sit her down and tell her, stressing that you're letting her know because you feel some amount of regret about it (expressing regret for your actions would make you seem less unaware and creepy). If you's do have a future together, it's probably something she deserves to know.
