You literally just said that if you’re dead and have completely functional organs that someone else who’s alive who might need one to live doesn’t deserve one. You signed their death certificate with your own selfish blood. When the entire majority of the world disagrees with you but you’re American, it doesn’t make you right. It means you have the thick skull. 

Stop trying to connect things that have no connection. No one said they get your property when you die. But when you die, if you have no one for it to go to, it gets taken. That’s how it works on 100% of the entire world. If you don’t like it, go get your own world I guess?

You’re also saying this in a country where that’s one of the single only consents that isn’t “implied” already for some odd reason. You’d know that if knew anything about US consent laws in general, but it’s clear as day you know nothing about your own laws or social structures. Otherwise you would apparently be avidly anti-US. 

Your post you just made out yourself into a corner that cannot be gotten out of. Sadly you won’t see yourself in that corner and think your winning because of your “thick skull”. Unless you admit you’ve been proven wrong, there’s no point in continuing this argument because it means you’re unaware and unwilling to learn of your own societal structure.
