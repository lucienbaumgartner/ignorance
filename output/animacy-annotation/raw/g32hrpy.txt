Even if you consider Welsh a dead language, being bilingual is good for your child's mental abilities and improves their chances of learning more languages later in life. Are you so selfish and ignorant that you'd rather your child not speak Welsh for your own comfort? That's verging on narcissistic behaviour there. 

Beyond that, you agreed to raise your kid bilingually and are now trying to reneg on your agreement because you don't want to learn a "dead language"? The language has been harmed by exactly that attitude.
