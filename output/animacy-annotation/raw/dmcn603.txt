He's good when he stays out of politics and news and focuses on history. I recently watched a video of his where he says the reason Asian guys (specifically Chinese) don't get non-Asian girls is because they're all just shy.  Like somehow fixing the disparity of Asian men dating out is a matter of socialising. How unaware and delusional can you get?
