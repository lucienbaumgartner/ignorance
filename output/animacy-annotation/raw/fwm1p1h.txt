Realistically, OP's problem is being caused by sexism AND normal people. Everyone has to deal with being babied by people who know less than them. However that doesn't mean she can't complain about the half that's being sexist. It's frustrating and there's no "fix" for it, so people vent about it.

&gt;When I used to pug, most people were bad and unaware that they are bad, which is a shitty combo. So I rarely pug these days because of the same issues that OP describes, but I a man.

That sets off some red flags though. Everyone is good at different parts of the game and everyone has different ways of approaching problems. For example if the tank dies some people will just wipe as soon as they can, others will burn all their DPS cooldowns and stand their ground and go ham, others will try to kite the mobs away from the tank's corpse and bust out their engineering resurrection item. However people are rarely on the same page and these plans will all fail if not everyone is in-sync, so the "just wipe" people will assume the "kite and ress the tank" engineers are fucking morons who are simply "bad" and beyond help.

Just lazily calling people bad because they think differently is how you get condescending toxic players.
