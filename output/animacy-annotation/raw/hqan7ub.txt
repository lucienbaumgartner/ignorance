A lot of people don’t realize how racist the rural south is. We’d like to believe that these people evolved and became enlightened and more tolerant. The truth is that racism is *rampant* in rural areas. I grew up in southwest Georgia and the *average* white person in my town would be courteous to African American people to their face but—in the presence of only other white people—would routinely refer to them as the n word and talk about them as if they were subhuman animals. I want to reiterate that this was how the *average* white person I knew behaved. I felt like I was living in crazy world and left as soon as I could (2006). The few times I’ve been back—especially in the last four or five years, they’re even more bold in their racism. I suspect Trump has triggered something in them—told them it’s okay to be racist and ignorant and that they should be proud of it. But it nonetheless runs rampant in those parts. 

Now this is anecdotal and perhaps my small region of the rural south is extra racist but that was my experience growing up.
