"'WHY I'M BULLISH ABOUT CRYPTO THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN CASH IS WORSE'

And there we go with the strawman and the ad hominem, making me out to be some cultist influencer when nothing I said resembled anything of the sort. It's almost like you already have your own idea of who you want me to be, and you're twisting the situation to support it.

The person above stated that cryptocurrencies drew their value from being untraceable and unregulated, so I provided a short list of things that actually give them value. None of that has anything to do with being a shill. I also never stated that they weren't used for crime, but that crime was not their primary use anymore. Which is absolutely correct. So what, is it less about people being willfully ignorant and more to do with them not being able to fucking read? My apologies for giving you too much credit.

And for the record, every accusation you made goes equally for fiat. We just ignore that part because we're so used to it.
