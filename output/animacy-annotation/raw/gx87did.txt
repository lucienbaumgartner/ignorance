How disrespectful and ignorant of them. I don't think I have to read the other comments to know that they have already pointed out that not understanding the distinction between MD and PhD makes them seem incredibly ignorant. This is the kind if behavior I would expect from a family of uneducated rednecks, not medical doctors. Did they not also all attend undergraduate university taught by esteemed PhDs? It's incredibly telling about their character if they would go through 4 years of being taught by PhDs and still consider themselves above them. All of society agrees that it is appropriate to call someone with a PhD doctor. Personally I value a PhD (especially in humanities) a lot more than an MD. An MD qualifies you to do a job, albeit a high-paying job, but that's it. Being a PhD means that you have written a dissertation that advances your field at least somewhat and that you are on the forefront of human knowledge in that particular area. It's incredibly valuable to grapple with humanities questions. 

And this is my own personal opinion as a humble philosophy BA - I think it brings you to a higher caliber of living. It's one thing to wake up every day and do a job until you die (which is ultimately what most doctors' jobs boil down to), it's another to fill your days with virtuous rational activity of the soul (Aristotle's words not mine) and tackle life's biggest questions. Most philosophies would put a life in the humanities as a life better spent than one doing the mundane work of fixing people's bodies. Not saying MDs aren't important, just that in the grand scheme of things their job is merely part of the arms and legs of society, whereas being a PhD is being the head.
