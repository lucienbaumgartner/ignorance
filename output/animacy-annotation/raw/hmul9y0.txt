You should really go back and see how “reasonable and peaceful” the law enforcement and seething racists were during those protests.There’s a ton of photos and info out there that may change your mind on this. Dr. King asked for them to remain peaceful even in the face of all that hatred and violence and we’re commenting on a video that’s very current. I don’t see much change since then…Do you?

In every stage of advancement of American society a lot of people get hurt and die. That’s the way we are. This is not a civilized society and anyone whose ever had to fight for it knows it. It’s always the privileged and ignorant that seem to think that it can be done peacefully. 

It has never been that way since the inception of the country. History has proven so.
