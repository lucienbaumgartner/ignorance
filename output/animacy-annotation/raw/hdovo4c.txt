I was a very unaware and dumb 7 year old kid. I was playing in the living room when my parents were watching TV and had their eyes glued to the TV. Well I saw the second plane hit and instead of being concerned or distraught by what I saw I instead pretended my hand was a plane and pretended to fly it into the wall that was suppose to be the WTC. I still remember how mad my dad was when I did that and how he told me that what just happened was a very bad thing and I shouldn't be doing that. Looking back I feel somewhat ashamed about it but I also realize that I was young and unwise to the ways of the world.
