Rednecks don't drink coke, they drink Busch or Coor's light. They also don't have the intellect or the attention span to watch baseball (hence, nascar).

It's like when they threatened to boycott Nike. When's the last time you saw a redneck wearing Nike?

These hicks are so stupid and ignorant that they are a danger to others around them, and we need to stop pretending otherwise in the name of "being nice."
