&gt; I don't read for your version of political/social enlightenment, I read for entertainment and escapism.

Sort of sounds more like you don't want politics that disagree with your own to show up. Any well done, or semi comprehensive world building is going to involve politics. Masking it only serves to weaken the coherence of the world because that's not what happens in real life. Well unless the story stars an ignorant character completely unaware and uninformed of the world around him and it keeps that narrow viewpoint for its entirety...

However, that isn't to say that you don't have a point as some authors push politics to the point where other aspects in the novel are impacted and it basically becomes a soapbox for their views, devoid of its own substance. If that's what you were referring to I guess I can agree with that
