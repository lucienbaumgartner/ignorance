NTA. 
At no point did you force them or tell them they should adopt. You just asked. And yes, maybe you shouldn’t have on Facebook given you knew they had no desire to adopt but it is a valid question. 
To me the nephew and his husband are the assholes. The statement that he doesn’t want to adopt because he doesn’t want to deal with other peoples “bad genes” is ignorant and honestly ridiculous. I agree a child is a child and a parent is a parent. Having conditions on the way you would accept a child into your life just gives me the impression that if you can’t have children in the exact way you want that you don’t want them at all. 
The husband says that adoption isn’t their first choice but it’s clear after being invested well into 200k with no child that your “first plan” isn’t working. I think you may be the asshole if you had said something like that but you didn’t. You asked and left it alone. 

And further your nephews statement about being “entitled to have biological children like heterosexual couples do” feels like a way to use his sexuality to guilt you into feeling bad for suggesting adoption. Infertility issues are by no means solely an issue encountered by the LGBTQ+ community. Nor does simply “being heterosexual” offer the ability to have children. There are millions of men and women every year that struggle with infertility and to use his sexuality simply feels like a way to manipulate your feelings just because they aren’t willing to acknowledge the fact they may not be able to have children biologically. 

I am of the opinion the entire idea of needing biological children is selfish honestly. Though I understand people have their own values and desires for their lives and they are entitled to that. If you had insisted or tried to force them to change their minds I might have said YTA but you did not do anything like that.
