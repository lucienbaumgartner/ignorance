When I played Oblivion there was a somewhat abstract haggle mechanic that had you read facial expressions and  you had to choose four methods of haggling. The trick was to pick the ones they like when their effectiveness was at its highest and the ones they donâ€™t like when it is lowest. Sometimes you found yourself in a lose lose situation. I always felt it was unrealistic, I mean, how could the player character possibly be so dense and unaware that he is making the seller angry? Seeing this dude haggle proves to me it that some people are just cursed to live real life with the Oblivion mechanics.
