Outside of the insane bullcrap that our cities don't have trees (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) it's even more ridiculous to me that they somehow looked at suburbs with a satellite image and thought "wow awful" that right there is more than most Europeans will ever own, ever, in their entire lives, but this idiot is so cognitively dissonant and unaware of what they're looking at that they somehow thought it was bad???
