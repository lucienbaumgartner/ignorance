My aunt was engaged to a guy who took up playing the violin because his future stepson was a musician.  He played a song at Christmas, a duet with my cousin, which my cousin had written, and he was so terrible and unaware of it that most everyone there was having a really hard time holding in the giggles.  When he married my aunt, he hired several members of the symphony orchestra to play at the wedding, and no shit, he got up there and played with them.  They were wincing at the sound of those sour notes, and some of the wedding guests left the area.
