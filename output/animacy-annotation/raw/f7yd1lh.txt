I had a moment two days ago where I was worried I might be really stupid and just didn’t know it (Dunning-Krueger effect). I feel like I’ve been so not self aware most of my life and I was thinking back on some things and wondering if I might be below average in intelligence. 

My daughter was showing some photographs of me at her age to a friend. I noticed one of them and remembered the dress I had on was handmade by me (Didn’t know how to sew before I did it, didn’t remember how to do it after it was over) and I started reasoning with myself and being less harsh. I have a degree and I do rather technical work. I’ve even taken and passed  a calculus class just because I wanted to see if I could do it since I had to start at basic algebra.  I reasoned that I can’t be completely stupid. 

Do you (or anyone) feel you go through periods of being “stupid” or pick up things easily, do fantastic work, then forget how to do it after?  Is this just a cognitive flow kind of thing?  It’s one of the things I’ve been trying to be easier on myself about. 

That being said, I still occasionally think back on things I’ve said and done and think “oh no...” when I realize I’ve been that person we see in a movie that is self unaware and ridiculously embarrassing. The exact person no one wants to be. It’s hard to be good to yourself sometimes.
