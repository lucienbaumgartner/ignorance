Totally disagree. If they had arrested one or the other  of them when they responded to the dispute call they'd have been overstepping. G and B were separated for the night and the tragic incident did not take place until something like 2 weeks later. These young adults were responsuble for themselves and their behaviour. 

In fact, I think it's pretty arrogant and ignorant of you to say that was a fuck up.
