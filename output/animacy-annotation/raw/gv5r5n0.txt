To visit my grandfather when he was dying.  We spent ages trying to find him, because the hospital had had to move him to a different ward and had not updated the list at Reception; then when we did find him, he was practically unconscious and unaware that anyone was with him.

My brother and I stood beside his bed awkwardly for about ten minutes, without any words at all, and then went across the road for lunch in the pub.
