The main criticisms I've seen have been...

* Re-used jokes ("there's a solution you're not seeing", drinking Orange Juice to refuel, etc)

* Re-hashed concept (whole episode follows a very similar structure to Raising Gazorpazorp)

* Sidelining the women characters while making unoriginal jokes about women being sidelined in the real world without a hint of irony (Beth probably knew more about horses and their semen than anyone in the President's circle, but instead of actually writing her into the plot of the episode, they wrote her to be annoyed that she wasn't in the plot of the episode)

* Incest/bestiality jokes that fell much flatter and felt more immature than they did in previous seasons

* Rick being uncharacteristically weak and unaware of what's going on the whole episode

There's other things as well but I can't remember them atm. But yeah I feel like if you read the reaction thread in good faith there's a lot of valid criticisms in it.
