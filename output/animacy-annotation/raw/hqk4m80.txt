Yes this. There are so many people who just don’t understand what the RF is, how it works, or UK culture (and in many cases seem unable to grasp that the UK isn’t just the US with an amusing accent). For instance there was someone on Twitter in the affair hashtag yesterday who was criticising the UK for ‘missing the opportunity to make Harry and Meghan king and queen’: sometimes I might engage if I think it could be helpful for other readers but it’s a waste of time to try having a sensible, informed conversation with people who are so ignorant and so uninterested in learning.
