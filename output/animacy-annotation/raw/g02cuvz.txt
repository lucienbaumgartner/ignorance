Okay - so i say again - I've listed "flaws" of the same caliber in TLOU1 - but for some reason that game gets a pass? My point is that you've nitpicked little things that really don't amount to anything - games (and movies) are filled with shit like this - ive pointed out several in TLOU1. Why? Because narrative media is contrived with shit whose sole purpose is to push the narrative forward. Everything you've mentioned has a justification within the logic/narrative of the game.  


(1) Jordan wants to interrogate Ellie because he knows theirs a larger plot at hand. 

(2) joel and tommy lived a peaceful life in Jackson - they spent 4 years there. You dont think 4 years isn't long enough for them to relax a little?

(3) I dunno about you but when i played this scene it was a pretty one sided battle.

(4) People survive gun shots to the head all the time. Ive seen it happen. Look up Phineas Gage if you dont believe it. 

(5) Women can exercise up until the day they're giving birth. A pregnant woman could climb that wall just fine. The animators just didn't want to create a whole new animation path for one character model - for one specific spot in the game - because that would be a waste of time. 

(6) the narrative isn't about Ellies relationship to those other NPCs. Its about Ellie and Abby. The fact that she kills all the NPCs just makes the point of the story even stronger - the cycle of revenge only begets more violence. 

Are you really trying to make the argument that TLOU2 was bad because you saw a 7 month pregnant woman climb a wall and "crush" her baby? You don't realize how petty and ignorant that is? 

I've still yet to see a flaw, or a period for that matter.
