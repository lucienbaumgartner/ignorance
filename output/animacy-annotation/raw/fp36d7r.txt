I don't think you want help, like all people that make this kind of posts you just want others to tell you that it's not your fault. IF you really wanted to improve then you would have posted your build and explained exactly why your teammates were BMing you.

This is a troll post, you just want attention. If you want to improve then ask for feedbeack on your build. You had the chance to post it in the OP but you did not.

I'm tired of seeing people that really have no clue of this game complain while they are so selfish and ignorant that they don't realize they ruin it for others. I have never seen anyone make this kinds of post actually and sincerely ask for advice instead of bashing their teammates. While yes, it can happen that your temmates are toxic from what you said they were focusing on your build. Post your build and then we can see whether you should be Bronze V or not.
