Your analogy heavily implies being selfish and uncaring of others is predominantly a right-wing quality, and that those people have just lost their way. Might as well say people who lean left and happen to commit acts of selfishness are significantly more right than they realize, and it's because they don't have the mental capacity to deal with their own actions not going in line with their ideologies, or vice versa.

Isn't that just calling people dumb and unaware of whatever the fuck they want, but eloquently? As if you knew what drives people to do things and process ideas like they do. Quite arrogant if you ask me.

I'm not sure if this kind of thinking is meaningful in and of itself, or helpful in any way to the situation of people failing to understand each other, which seems to be (at least part of) the problem over there nowadays.
