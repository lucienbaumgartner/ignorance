A fetus is a living being. Not a baby, and not nothing. Somewhere in between. A fetus is alive, but is incapable of emotions, pain, processing, is unconscious and unaware of their surroundings, and cannot survive outside of my body. The only relation a fetus has with a baby is that they are both of the same species. "My body my choice" applies here because the fetus is literally inside me, actively taking my energy and resources, and is completely unconscious. My body and my desires are much more important than the body of my fetus.
