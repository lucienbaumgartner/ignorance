I'm not ignoring anything you've typed.

You're simply angry and ignorant of how the law works. 

If your name is on the lease, you're liable for the rent to your landlord. That's it. End of story. Nothing to change that.

If you stop paying your rent it will do nothing to get you your money back. It will put you into debt with all consequences that come with that.
