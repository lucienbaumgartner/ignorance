Everything you just said isn't true if you spend 5 minutes researching the universal Healthcare systems the MAJORITY of the world has.

America has some of the worst Healthcare outcomes in the world. Our infant and postpartum mortality rate is outright shameful. 

Also what the hell are you talking about "you get better care if you pay." MOST people CAN'T PAY ANYTHING. 

So even if your statement WAS true, you're saying that the majority of people and children shouldn't be able to afford ANY care, so you can pay for "better" care!?

Also it shows how little you know about single payer systems. Do you realize that nations that have universal Healthcare ALSO have PRIVATIZED Healthcare? 

Meaning if you want to continue paying for "better" Healthcare, that option will always be available to you.

So please stop spreading this ignorant and harmful rhetoric.
