&gt; It's better to be prepared than not. 

No, thats the point I'm making: the cognitive bias drives one to be overly prepared in a way that poses higher risk to oneself than the danger one tries to be prepared for.

And additionally no, no sane person actually attempts to be prepared for all hypothetical eventualities. Because thats very much impossible and leads to stuff like advanced fallout shelters stocked and built with the children's education fund. 

&gt; It's difficult to explain things to people who don't understand the culture or live here.

Obviously that's your prerogative to think. But it also leads to communities being stuck in their way, especially in their problems when they dismiss external observations as inherently false and ignorant of the culture and way of living. 

&gt; No one has a gun to protect themselves from a dog. 

perhaps, but that is the premise of the original comment I reacted to. 

&gt; I'm wasting my time here.

Well, as someone clearly doing the same; it feels a lot easier to do that when you have statistical and scientific arguments to make you think you're right in your opinion and solid reason to think that in the unlikely event that you can change someone's mind, harm can be mitigated.
