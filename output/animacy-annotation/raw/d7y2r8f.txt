I agree. Until we have a space fleet capable of force projection, attempting first contact is foolish.

Look at the discovery of the New World as an example. The various First Nations were caught unaware and ill equipped to repel an ensuing invasion.

If we contact an alien civilization without being prepared to keep them at a far enough distance to siphon off technology and knowledge through trade long enough to protect our own soveriegnty, we're doomed.

We need to colonize our own solar system, erect rudimentary defenses and send out vast networks of exploration vessels to find out what's really out there.
