&gt; Is it safe that the vast majority of these youtube “skeptics” are just grifters?
 
I suspect that the bulk of atheist subscribers are teenagers who are rebelling against their parents.   My impression of the average reddit user is a teenager who is bored between gaming sessions.  Given that, I doubt that their click-through revenue is very fruitful.

&gt; How can your full time job involve “debunking” arguments for God’s existence and yet remain so philosophically unaware and illiterate?

Amen.  The last that I saw, Aaron Ra and Richard Dawkins were philosophically illiterate.   As Dr. Feser said, Dawkins wouldn't know the difference between metaphysics and metamucil.  

&gt; In a way I kind of get it. Content regarding serious philosophical work would probably not get as much attention.

Yeah, serious students usually have a life ... running a family, working, or working on a real degree.
