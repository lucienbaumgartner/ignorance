Yeah which is fine, but the discourse on this sub got weirdly personal about Albertans themselves, not Kenney’s incompetence. Basically calling them idiots, selfish, and ignorant of public health orders, and clamoring to shut provincial borders to the plague rats. 


This sub has a huge blind spot when it comes to equating Kenney and other unsavory politicians with the actual people living under them. Something that never seems to be the case when we speak of Ontario, BC, or Quebec. Just something I’ve really picked up on.
