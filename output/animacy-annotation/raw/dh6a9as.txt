&gt; About the best thing Jarvis ever did pre-stone was hacking into SHIELD files. That's pretty impressive, but not 8-9 impressive

Really? Creating an AI when he is NOT an AI experts, that is able to hack into the MOST secure spy agency in the world? That's not a 8-9? What is, then?

They looked very organised, to the point of being individual. 

&gt; Why is the Skitter fight the only one where nobody gets prep time?

Let's say EQUAL prep time then. Where Iron Man knows what he is going against and so does Skitter. Again, Iron Man stomps since he can easily create amazing anti-bug counter-measures. Find Skitter through IR or Heat-seaking or whatever else. And then rocket her to death. 

The only chance skitter has is if Iron Man is unaware and Skitter attacks. But that's a silly comparison when we are comparing power rankings.
