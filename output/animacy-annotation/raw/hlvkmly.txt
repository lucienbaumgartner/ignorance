&gt;Instead of teaching the natives Spanish, the friars instead learned the local languages of the natives - this would prevent them from "putting on airs", i.e. becoming learned enough to argue with them  
&gt;  
&gt;it benefited the neglectful Spanish government and the landowning friar orders for Filipino natives to remain ignorant, illiterate and docile

This was true to a large extent esp. in the middle and late parts of Spanish rule, but the colonial period is so staggeringly long that I wonder if the motives and circumstances might've changed depending on specific place and time.

I've also read, I apologise if I can't remember where, that early Spanish friars (like in the first 100 years or such) learned the local languages not so much because they wanted the natives then to stay subservient and ignorant of Spanish law/policyâ€¦but mainly due to sheer practicality.

In many of the early towns often the friar was the only Spaniard (and sometimes he wasn't even there all year), which means for large regions in the early Spanish colonial Philippines the friar was the only Spanish speaker around anyway. It would be difficult for him to teach his language to *all* the natives *and expect them to retain it over time*, since only he, the very occasional conquistador, or the tiny handful of native quick learners would be able to help everyone else retain it. It was easier to learn the native languages because the friar could easily learn from and practice with the huge pool of speakers, so likely that's what happened a lot in early colonial towns from like the 1500s to 1700s or so.

(I won't discount that that maybe morphed into an excuse by later, more power-hungry friars for keeping later generations of natives illiterate and ignorant of the Spanish language too. Likely by the 1800s I do agree that thinking would be more common by then.)
