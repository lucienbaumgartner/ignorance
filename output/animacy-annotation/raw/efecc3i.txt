I transitioned on the job and I can confirm that it's fucking awful.  Coworkers are still screwing up my pronouns 7 months later.  Unfortunately, my employer's dedication to trans equality is nothing but lip service.  They have great policies for trans folks, but everyone is so untrained and ignorant that they just can't impliment them properly.
