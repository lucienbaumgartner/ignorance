&gt;Trump, who once said that U.S. spy agencies should “go back to school,” is now highlighting the intelligence services’work that led to the fatal air strike against Iran’s most powerful general. “There’s some dripping irony, but nobody thinks all of a sudden he loves us,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a recently retired 26-year CIA veteran who held assignments in the Mideast, Europe and Eurasia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following his order to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and the dangerous aftermath of Iran launching missiles at U.S. military installations, Trump said he would like to see more NATO troops in the Middle East because the problems there are international in scope.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Trump has nothing in the bank with the Europeans. There’s no goodwill. There’s no sense of trust — no sense that they can rely on him**,” said Derek Chollet, senior adviser for [security](https://search.myway.com/search/GGmain.jhtml?p2=%5EBYD%5Exdm257%5ETTAB03%5Eus&amp;ptb=142B9C69-C0E7-4B36-9E55-BC0FD7AF2FEA&amp;n=78595e11&amp;cn=US&amp;ln=en&amp;si=AID4-GS-MEar-US&amp;tpr=hpsb&amp;trs=wtt&amp;brwsid=cce04971-1140-4c19-a985-3d1e2d07cef5&amp;searchfor=derek+chollet&amp;st=tab#) and defense policy at The German Marshall Fund of the United States. “They are not going to be looking to do Donald Trump a favor.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Chollet, who likened the U.S. fatal strike on Soleimani to taking a **“baseball bat to the hornet’s nest,”** also said Trump has not been specific — at least not publicly — about what he wants Europe to do. Help him negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran? Sanction or punish Iran? Provide troops in the Middle East so he can pull U.S. forces out?  
&gt;  
&gt;“He seems to have forgotten the European anger over his decision to cancel the Iran nuclear agreement,” Carpenter said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“’A very important element of why Iran signed the Iran deal in 2015 was because they concluded that the U.S. was not going to attack them. Bush didn’t. Obama didn’t. They thought they didn’t need a nuclear weapon to deter the U.S.,” said Pollack, who is now at the American Enterprise Institute.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think this has suddenly changed Tehran’s calculus — that **Trump is so aggressive and unpredictable and ignorant — that they will look at this and say ‘You know what? We need a nuclear weapon.’”**

Intelligence agencies are deep state losers until you need them to prop up your own erratic actions. Check.

European allies are NATO losers until you need them to help restore order in a region you've destabilized further. Check.

Iran nuclear deal is a loser until your "aggressive, unpredictable and ignorant" behavior drives them to develop weapons to protect against YOU. Check.

No wonder those of us paying attention have whiplash.

(Fun fact - Kevin McCarthy just invoked the deep GOP respect for Gold Star families as he denigrated congress making an attempt to restrict further action without approval against Iran. Anyone else remember the Khan's?)
