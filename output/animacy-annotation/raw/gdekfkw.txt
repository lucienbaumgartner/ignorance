NTA-show your family the text, send it to everyone who has anything to say. Hell post it on every social media page. Also with a long text. Write every nasty mean and hurtful thing she has ever said. That you cannot understand how a person could be so cruel. And so selfish and ignorant. That you cannot understand these actions. That you cannot understand how people who say they love you, can support someone who emotional abuses  after your losses. That her being pregnant is not the problem although it probably hurts. But you are human and that is normal after loss and struggle. And how dare anyone judge you and expect you to take that abuse. I am truly sorry for the struggles you and your partner have face. ❤️
