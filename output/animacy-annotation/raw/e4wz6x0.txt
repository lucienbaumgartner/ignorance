It was the logical conclusion to a tragic life. The thing about Adriana is that she was both *fiercely loyal* to Chris, but also maybe not the most cunning/bright person... overly romantic and unaware that Chris would ultimately choose the mob over her.

The whole thing made me sick. The camera pans away at the last moment, like the director, or even God himself can't stand to witness what is happening.
