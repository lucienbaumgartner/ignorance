Your struggle with the other cryptos is less of a reflection of them and more of a reflection of your skills and abilities. I hold and work with ETH, ADA and ALGO and found ADA and ALGO to be 100x easier than ETH, but ETH wasn't that hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you have a CS, IT or Cloud Computing background 99% of this will be a struggle until a few years out.  Just like there is not 1 company in the stock market, there will be 1,000s of blockchains all working together and separately for many purposes. Its a big world, ALGO is just a small part of the solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

But talking down about other blockchains, because of your lack of knowledge or skill, makes the ALGO crowd appear to be ignorant.

&amp;#x200B;

ALGO is good, it has utility and will surely be able to compete in the short term. But if the community keeps thinking that only 1 coin will "win" they are immature and ignorant of what Blockchain tech is ACTUALLY going to do.

If you are not in it for the tech, you are in it for the wrong reasons.
