&gt; If you could use the same skin in CS:GO and Valorant it will make sense to use NFT.

lmfao i can't believe that people unironically keep saying that this would ever be a possibility. it's just so unfathomably illogical and ignorant of how 'things' work. people who say this stuff about NFTs have no idea how game companies or games work. it's all just buzzwords and buzzphrases that sound cool but are fundamentally completely broken and illogical from a conceptual standpoint.

&gt;Vale and Riot may not want to share databases or don't trust each other. So they could have in on the blockchain, both could trust that the data there is valid.

like everybody else has stated a billion times already, this is attempting to find a solution for a problem that *doesn't exist*. WHAT PURPOSE could a company have in needing a public database for skin ownership? who the fuck does that benefit? what 'problem' is this solving? there is no use case for two different game companies wanting to share skins with each other. this is not a 'problem' that the industry is having that NFTs are trying to a solve, it's a 'problem' that NFT pushers are COMPLETELY making up for the sole purpose of justifying their existence.
