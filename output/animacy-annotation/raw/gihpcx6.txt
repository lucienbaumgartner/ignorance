I have to say though, the line is fairly blurry on whether or not he was calling for violence. He never overtly did it, but by continually suggesting that the election was stolen and that they need to keep fighting, with no legal solution that would end with Trump in office... I think there is a case to be made for this. But you can also argue that Trump is incredibly stupid and unaware of the consequences of his actions.
