&gt; but you allowed yourself to be mislead.

Yes, the girl's being visibly uncomfortable was a result of my mind tricking me.

&gt; Are Joe Biden's actions weird? Yes. 

See, at least you're half-admitting that smelling little girls' hair, touching them against their will (and doing so after they show extreme discomfort) and rubbing their chests is not okay.

&gt; Kids being uncomfortable in front of world class politicans and a huge crowd, no way!

Word class politicians allowing their money, fame and power to get to their heads? Creepy old men being creepy? Powerful people being corrupt? Creepy people being in politics?

#NO WAY! 

No, but like, seriously, you're insane. Politics is chock full of pedophilia (fuck you, take 3 seconds to look this one up yourself and educate yourself.) 

Notice how this isn't even about Trump anymore. Through this comment chain you haven't asked any questions, you've merely brought up things you wanted to talk about (many not even being about Trump). This is painfully unaware and delusional self-indulgence. Most of what you're saying is irrelevant and the fact that you ignored all the sources I referenced (while conveniently referencing none yourself) just shows that, above all, you just want to talk. You don't have questions or beliefs you want challenged, you merely want to honk your own horn for the sake of it. 

For that reason (and not the deluded, mentally incompetent, socially unaware mental masturbation) I don't want to continue this conversation. 

Please start a new post and talk to someone else. I kept this going because I foolishly believed you were open to facts and differing opinions, but that simply isn't the case. Regards and much love.
