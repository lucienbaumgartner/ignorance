This 100x. Groups are mostly ass in combat. Very rarely do I feel at a disadvantage against a group because they're usually disorganized, unaware, and slow to react.  
The advantage of playing in solo is obviously in combat you never have anyone making extra noise and covering approaching footsteps, or talking over the sound of some guy opening a door, slowing your reaction in CQC by making you think about Friend or Foe.  
Really the only "problem" I have with groups is the Insurance system. If even one person survives, everyone gets their loot back; it's really annoying to know that as a solo player when you kill 4/5 in a group and everything gets dumped in insurance **and** they take your stuff.
