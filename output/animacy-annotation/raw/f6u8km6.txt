A good person is someone I want around me. They only deceive me temporarily in jest. Their honesty is neither desperate nor choked up. They can be either playful or serious in good succession. They can dive into a subject, or change the subject when it's dried up. They reference things without lecturing me about them unless I have expressed I'm unaware and interested interested in them. Their noise is not overbearing, but prompts me to make noise of my own.
