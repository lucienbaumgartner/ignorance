DOWNTOWN PORTLAND NOT ONLY SMELLS LIKE PISS EVERYWHERE, BUT IS ALSO FULL OF THE MOST UNAWARE AND ENTITLED DRIVERS/PEDESTRIANS/BICYCLISTS OF ALL FUCKING TIME.

ALSO, JUST BECAUSE I HAVE AUTISM DOES NOT MAKE ME A POTENTIALLY BAD EMPLOYEE. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK FOR A YEAR AND I GET DENIED FROM EVERYTHING. I AM REALLY GETTING FRUSTRATED.
