NAH, You are being invited to take part in the culture. You will almost certainly be taught/aided to do it respectfully as part of that.  (The clothes provided will be presumably suitable for the occasion, you will be told if you should do something like take off your shoes for a specific part.)

Cultural appropriation would be more like visiting India, buying some clothes  and deciding to wear them to a Scandinavian wedding.  Especially if you bought it for looks only and were completely uninterested and unaware that you'd picked something that would normally be worn to say a funeral.
