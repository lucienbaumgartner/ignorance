What a pointless, ignorant and childish comment...

First, criticism is healthy for a game, so "shutting up and leaving" kills games quicker than your toxicity alone already does.

Second, like i said and you would know if you could read, i like the game, but its content is severely limited and im not some GAAS fanboy that loves to repeat the same things over and over and over again like a mindless drone without standards i.e. you.
