Well, he’s supposed to be a breath of fresh air for the guardians and even the people of Spira as a whole. He’s refreshingly optimistic and ignorant of the church’s stuffy traditions. He’s basically just a kid who wants to go home at this point. He’s the kind of character who becomes better in hindsight the more you find out about the world. 

Yeah, his outfit is a bit weird, but, y’know... most early 2000’s fashion was. 

You’re getting to a point soon where the plot kicks up and the stakes get higher, so he’ll start to develop in response to that. But as of now, he’s supposed to be a bit of a brat. He’s selfish. He’s confused. He’s kind of self-centered and childish at first but he was basically a celebrity before this. He’s going through a lot. 

Are you referring to his monologuing thoughts? Those are meant to frame the story. After a certain point they’ll stop. 

Tidus is straight up my favorite fictional character ever, along with Yuna. He might grow on you!
