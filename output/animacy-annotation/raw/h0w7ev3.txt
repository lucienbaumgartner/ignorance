For someone who doesn't care, you've typed a great deal of nonsense all over this thread. Your point doesn't stand undisputed - I not only disputed it, but showed why you were wrong and ignorant of British history.

It's fine to be wrong, we all are sometimes. But if you react to being corrected by having a little angry fit and calling people names, it just makes you look even more ridiculous than you did already.
