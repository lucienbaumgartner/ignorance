BTW - if you want to hear an ear-splitting silence out of Morris (with its amp on eleven) - just ask him: 

Whatever happened to his celebrated involvement with Stamets' "I'm Innocent And Had Nothing To Do With Pollock's Murder" story, pointing fingers of suspicion at patsy voices on that certain hokey audio cassette tape.

Specifically as of that caper's immediate post-\*Harpers\* article stage (2013) where Morris announced to fandom his impending book all about it?  Complete with a publication contract (a 'funny' publisher for 'such a deal' MacSweeny's).  And photographs of the 'book deal' contract that he displayed on his social media.

Case in point, one inquirer here at reddit - given the 'ignore it and maybe it will go away' routine - OP u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019):

\*Morris wrote an... article "Blood Spore", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of "mushroom doctor" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: [https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/](https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/) \[In\] Podcast appearances he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning \[it\] into a book, as documented by his tweet: [https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856](https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856)  What happened to the book?\*

Book schmook - what happened to Morris' reply to that little question?

Oh wait - my mistake.  There never has been any reply. Not a peep out of Morris about it.  Look high, look low no matter where you go, all dead silence.

So there's just another Morris X-File, to go with yours. One of conspicuously glaring appearance.  

Especially in view of how suspicious Stamets' entire theater of drama is that it revolves around - all up into "It Wuz Cops Who Killed Pollock."  Staged with 'evidence' (that idiotic audio cassette tape) so apparently fabricated, so transparently faked (by all indications top to bottom) it makes the conjuring of the infamous Roswell 'briefing documents' - by a package with no return address (containing photos of the 'smoking  gun' papers) mysteriously mailed to gullible (if not complicit) 'UFO researcher' Jamie Shandera - look like the mastermind forgery of the century by comparison. 

At least there's a familiar modus operandi, tried and true as tested and applied in previous Scooby Do capers. A clear pattern the entire thing matches. But only to the tee.

[http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html)  &lt; Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI… crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers… 162 victims &gt;

As Schlessinger said, in an episode of UP AND VANISHED podcast - and compare with Stamets in Morris' "Blood Spore" profile as a Person of Interest (and Morris either a gullibly 'useful idiot' or knowing willing accomplice):

&gt;most victims who get killed know the offender… the vast majority of murders \[involve\] people closely connected…. There’s a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim… Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they’re smarter than law enforcement… when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said “I know not, I’m not my brother’s keeper.” That’s the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)… don’t follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who’s more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous \[example\], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. \[Until\] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader’s narcissism… &gt;

As in real life, so in 'true crime' fiction - it's a well worn storyline:

&gt;*The perp hires a detective* \[or "journalist"?\] *to SoLvE tHe CrImE in order* **to throw suspicion off himself**... *strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it (same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police)... \[it's\] an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was* \&gt; [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy)

The Beug/Stamets "Evergreen State Kollege" partnership has a record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics. Even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Case in point the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;*the student* \[never mind his name btw\] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended “The Hollywood Bandit,” a notorious Western Bank Robber – and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 [https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM\_HistoryFutureLR.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf) \[Psst - in fact &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound. The gunshot Sgt. Monta had heard was actually Scurlock shooting himself. &gt; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott\_Scurlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Scurlock)\]

To get Morris explaining whatever happened to his MacSweeny's BLOOD SPORE book deal - the contract all signed, sealed and delivered as shown off by Morris 8 years ago on his twitter page - only to UP AND VANISH without a trace - would take a subpoena.  

Failing that it's like a Christmas carol carefully unsung (lest anyone hear a sound out of him:  \*Si-ilent Night\* '

Or a Poe 'Raven' poem -

The silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token,

And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore"

With one tiny edit: no whispered word.  In place thereof - not a single peep from the Hamiltonian.

\*\*\*\*

So - long story short: 

Don't feel alone, no need.   You're not the only one.
