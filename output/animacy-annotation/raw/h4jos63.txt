It sounds like word substitution/replacement because of the aphasia related to her dementia. It's also a common feature for people with Primary Progressive Aphasia. 

Stress and frustration can make word retrieval more difficult and if she feels rushed or intimidated by staff she might feel that if she doesn't speak fast enough then her needs won't be met. Remind staff to give her enough time to take in the information and form a response. I recall one resident always substituted the word "papers" because it related to something she often said when she worked a secretary in her younger years. 

It's definitely a dignity issue because it sounds like they are mocking her. It's sad because having Alzheimer's doesn't mean she can't pick up on things like tone or attitude. Glad that you are trying to step on those things. I can almost picture the staff laughing while asking her those questions to try and get a rise out of each other. She might not get what they are trying to do, but she probably picks up on the fact that they are basically laughing at her. Usually the staff that do this are pretty insensitive and unaware of the impact it has. It must be frustrating that other staff don't agree that they should stop doing this. Try to educate them and if that doesn't work maybe you can put pressure on management to have some sort of inservice or further training.
