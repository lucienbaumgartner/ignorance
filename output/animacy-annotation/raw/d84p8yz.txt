This person needs to shoot themselves but because they are too cowardly to do it, I volunteer.

1. Learn fucking English. Or is it hard to type on that iPhone OSK?
2. Their shit makes no sense. It is a sentence fragment with no grammar or indication what they're talking about other than the way features are integrated.
3. PC has nothing to fucking do with this. iOS is a mobile operating system used only for iPad and iPhone and iPod. Apple's competition in the mobile market is the Droid operating system, and if this fuckwit didn't notice, they are still being *crushed* in sales by Android devices.
4. A fucking Maybach? The only way this analogy makes sense is if he/she is literally unaware and equating price to quality and assuming price makes something better. No one owns a 200,000 dollar Maybach, just like no one owns an iPhone, and both of them are overpriced pieces of shit that you can't really fix on your own with poor reliability records and shifty companies behind them. You aren't special because you have an iPhone - people are laughing at you.
