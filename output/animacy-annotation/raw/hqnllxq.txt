Sweetheart, I'm 61 and have been studying this for over 50 years. You should *never* "assume" something of someone about whom you know nothing. 

"Belief systems" were created to explain natural phenomena about which those humans knew nothing. They created "gods" who were "angry" and "rained down fire and brimstone" to explain volcanic eruptions. That doesn't mean there were actually "gods". Learning the reality of the natural world took the onus off the imaginary deities. 

The only way religions can survive is if people can be kept uneducated, ignorant and fearful of their own humanity.
