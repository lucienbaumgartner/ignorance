I've had a random lady comment on my dog running next to me while I biked on a hot day at the park. 

She made a comment about how she was worried about my dog---not me. As if, I was unaware and oblivious to the surrounding circumstances.  

Obviously, I'm extremely attentive to my dog's health while she's running next to me---especially when it's hot. I just ignored her and said, "She's fine! Have a nice day."  

Your lady sounds like she has some issues though, so I'd just avoid and ignore her.
