I was trying to make a point but you made it for me, moral arguments are worthless because yours and mines are different. It's an argument that cannot end. In my opinion the fact that the animal will be unaware of its death after the fact makes the very short period of distress before it meaningless. So what if it suffers it will be dead and unaware that suffering even existed in seconds. And then I get to enjoy its delicious flesh.
