In the truly twisted ways of the Chaos Gods, they knew Horus wouldn't succeed. The current version of the stagnant, corrupt, fanatical, xenophobic Imperium is exactly what they wanted. Big E thought he fought the chaos gods to a stalemate (he said as much himself, it was the only choice he had) but he just set up the Imperium for a nice long smorgasboard. The Cabal confirmed it - this was the worst possible outcome for everyone except Chaos. Horus, in failing, managed exactly what the gods wanted. And they blamed him for it. In the end, he died alone and unaware of his true role and how all his masters had played him. Yes, Big E giving him the blast was the greatest mercy the Big E ever showed.
