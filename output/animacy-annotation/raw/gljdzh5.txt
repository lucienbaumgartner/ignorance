This country is so incredibly wasteful and ignorant of wealth distribution. I agree with you 100%. The only consideration most billionaires have us not how they can give back to a failing economy but how they can amass wven more wealth. It's sickening!!! Furthermore they're career criminals who pay their way out of any prosecution. If we are to rebuild faith in our system, we need to start by holding the big wigs accountable for their illegal and/or unethical behavior, instead of marginalizing the poor and minorities for petty crimes they participate in just for survival!
