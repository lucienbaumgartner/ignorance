In my opinion most of James Gunn's humor is this.

Character A says stupid and/or crass thing.  
Character B asks a follow up question pertaining to the stupid thing they just said.  
Character A answers the question with a new stupid response, completely straight faced, and unaware of their own stupidity and crudeness.  


It's the kind of humor that you can enjoy when you're sitting with your friends, drinking a little, socializing just asking stupid questions for fun and laughing at yourselves. The problem is it doesn't work when you're watching a movie because the characters aren't your peers.
