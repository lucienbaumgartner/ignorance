They’re probably thinking of [“head pressing”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_pressing) which can be a symptom of neurological damage. But if your cat goes to regular check ups and they don’t notice anything then like you said it’s probably not an issue. I’m sure people don’t mean any harm by mentioning it just in case you or anyone else is unaware and better safe than sorry.
