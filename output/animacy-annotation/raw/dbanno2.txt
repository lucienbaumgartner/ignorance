/u/Galle_ is right.  I just went through and read a bunch of them and the quotes are taken horrendously out of context to make it look like they mean something they don't.  One claims Clinton wants a "unaware and compliant" citizenry but when you actually read the email it's just someone talking about how the lack of civics education in this country has produced the entertainment-politics blurring that Trump thrives off of.

I'm sorry, but it looks like you're the one who is ignoring the evidence.
