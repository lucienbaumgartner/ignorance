Dear This Person: 

When I block you on Facebook, it doesn’t mean you’ve “won”. It means you’re so dense and ignorant that no level of factual information or common sense will work on you. It means I’d rather spend my time hitting my head against a brick wall than try to convince you that vaccines don’t cause autism/that you don’t belong to the master race/that Fox News isn’t “news”, etc.
