When you ignore social distancing and don’t wear a mask, you are deliberately being selfish and ignoring the well being of everything around you. The fact that the Republican Party considers this to be a political issue just goes to show how immoral and ignorant that party is. 


The thing about science is that it DOES prescribe what is best for individuals. Have you ever been to a doctor? It’s literally their job! But instead these religious idiots would rather ignore the proven science, and instead have faith that their invisible sky wizard will save them. There’s a reason why the VAST majority of educated and intelligent people are more left-leaning, and the obese uneducated population is majority republicans. Republicans are killing this country with their ignorance, misinformation, and misplaced faith.
