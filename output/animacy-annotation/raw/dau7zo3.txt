You didnt make any points worth addressing, kiddo.  Your first point is just restating what I said while pretending you contradicted me.  Your second point is the same.  Your third point is just you acting like a moronic fanboy.  Quite frankly, your third point makes me think you havent played online or are just generally unaware and shitty at the game.

So, like I said, go back to your sandbox while the adults talk.  When you have something to contribute that isn't stupid blind fanboyism, you can come back to the grown up table.
