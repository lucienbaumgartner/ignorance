Jesus. That’s not true at all. It’s kind of depressing so many people are buying into your bullshit

It’s absolutely a valuable asset for those groups, but Bitcoin when it was the only crypto and there was the largest proportion of criminals using it was very low value. 

It’s objectively true that the reason it’s so valuable now is due to public interest, not it’s use for black markets. Just so disingenuous and ignorant of simple the incredibly simple history of crypto

EDIT: to add, crypto was way more useful as black market currency when it was relatively stable. All this stability from speculation is not something criminals running black market organizations want
