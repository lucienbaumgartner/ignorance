when I breastfed my first everything went well.
When I breastfed my second I failed to notice she was failing to gain weight, she was extremely skinny. She looked like a normal person in terms of body fat composition, not like a chubby baby. But I was blissfully unaware and happy with my decision to exclusively breastfeed because "breast is best" and "milk gives babies all the nutrition they need no matter what"  

At her 6 month doctor appointment the doctor is so shocked by her appearance that I was immediately ordered to switch to formula mixed into milk instead of water, and feed her cheese on demand to get her weight up. Really changed my opinion on formula's role in childrearing.
