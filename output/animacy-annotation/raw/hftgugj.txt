You can't just ban 'kill shelters'. That would push the already teetering system into a crash. Kill shelters are not some evil, insidious industry, and they exist for damn good reason. There are not enough resources, time, or people to deal with the unwanted and abandoned pets. That's the hard truth. Not to mention the fact there are thousands of dogs and cats unsuitable for adoption and dangerous to the public. The push to 'save them all' is severely misguided and ignorant of actual dog behavior and the realities involved in dealing with and managing millions of unwanted pets every year. 

Not to mention no-kill shelters are typically full to bursting, and simply rotate animals through or hold them for excessive periods of time that turn out to be extremely damaging to the animals held there. Those they can't take are sent to shelters that do euthanize.
