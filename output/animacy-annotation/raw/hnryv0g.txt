Not gonna lie, I tried it because I wanted to experience it for myself.

From what I know you are supposed to be completely unconscious and unaware of anything that is said. 

Well you don't know if it's gonna be like that till you schedule an appointment and sit down to start the transe. It wasn't like that for me, it was just hypnosis and you literally just say whatever come to you mind. You're making up a story as the session goes on, being convinced and convincing yourself it's really what happened when in fact it is very likely just your imagination coming up with something to fill in the blanks. 

It wasn't worth the $150 I paid to just "experience it for myself" 

The only person I'd trust is dolores cannon and she's dead and even then it might just be glorified hypnosis
