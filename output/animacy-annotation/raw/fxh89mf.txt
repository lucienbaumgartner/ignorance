I am an Asian person but here are my thoughts. 

I empathize with Jewish community because like you guys, the bigotry/racism/prejudice we go through is just completely ignored in society. I would probably argue that you guys have it worse in terms of being ignored because Jewish people are generally white and/or are assumed to be white and a recent comment I've been hearing frequently is "you can't be racist towards white people." People think because on average our backgrounds make a lot of money that we don't go through racism which both sides should be aware is complete BS. I would add that Asian people have a ton of poor communities. They have the largest population of people in poverty in NYC. It's pretty unfair to leave them out of it or allow people to be racist against them cause the rest are doing well financially. 

Many people were willing to help and lets be honest they were actually virtue signal and trying to look "woke" to help the black community, but nobody feels the need to help us cause they think we are fine financially and think we don't go through racism. It is disgusting and ignorant. It is disgusting and ignorant that in order for people to fight racism, they have to look "woke" in order to care.
