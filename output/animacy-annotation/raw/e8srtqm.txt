Not all frustration is the same. Valeera is a melee character that is not particularly strong, except against players who are so poorly positioned and unaware that any other hero would kill them just as handily. Chromie was pelting people for 3/4th kf their HP from a screen away with no risk, Valeera must bury herself in melee range to do her damage to you over the course of several seconds. These things are not the same and are not treated as such.
