Holy shit holy fucking shit. The more I read this thread the more disgusting, awful bullshit I see. This is the most disturbing shit I've seen on Reddit, maybe ever. 


Afghanistan was a very normal and fairly stable middle eastern country before Operation Cyclone, which you should know, preceeded the soviet invasion by 6 months. Everything that has happened to Afghanistan since is a DIRECT and INTENTIONAL plan from the American military and CIA. Suggesting otherwise is simply insane and reflects a genuine ignorance on the subject.

Attributing the rise of the talbian to a lack of national identity... no words can convey how hateful and ignorant that is. Reddit truly is the worst place on the internet. I am unironically considering leaving Reddit because of this post.
