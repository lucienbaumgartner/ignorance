Alright, so lets handle things off the bat.  This was your initial statement: 

&gt;Chip Kelly sucks, but Colin doesnâ€™t put up those numbers in any system except his.

So I refuted this, and you agree that your initial statement was wrong quite clearly:

&gt;2012 and 2013 sure

Okay.  So lets establish two things:

1. Your initial statement was ignorant and wrong.
2. You admit your initial statement was ignorant and wrong.

'kay.

So you want to say he regressed in 2014.  That's a new statement.  I'd say look up a man you've never heard of named "Vernon Davis" and that might give you an idea why there was a bit of a statistical regression, but I'll let you spend some time googling the history of a team you know nothing about before we have that discussion.
