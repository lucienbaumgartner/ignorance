I'm so sorry someone did this to you. People are damaged and deal with it in their own ways and many times these individuals slip through the system and manage to function adequately enough as mature adults to pass as one at times, and they often go on to hurt someone else. Please don't let this obviously broken, cowardly and/or at best, completely unaware and ignorant individual who victimized you affect your desire to find music. It's very healing, a part of all of us, and I'm sorry someone was evil enough to associate it with negative experiences that they inflicted on you. Music Therapy may actually be very healing for you. Take care and remember - she was like the opposite of a "good teacher."
