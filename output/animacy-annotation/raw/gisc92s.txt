Wait, did you actually think that traveling is only about going to pool parties and staying at hotels?

This is why I don't date people who refuse to travel. I find your outlook so incredibly ignorant. This is why I say that I find people who travel a lot to be interesting - people like you are so sheltered and ignorant that they actually think that traveling is only about pools and staying at expensive hotels!
