To say that hiphop/rap has done to music what Disney has done to cinema is ignorant and wrong. Rap has advanced music. The lowest lyricist in rap still makes lyrics 10x better than any lead vocals in rock, and puts a lot more meaning behind the bars (check out Swimming Pools or How Much A Dollar Cost both by Kendrick Lamar, and both phenomenal. Also, Only God Can Judge Me by Tupac Shakur.) Ontop of its vastly superior lyrics, hiphop has one major advantage, you dont need instruments at all, thus making it way more accessible to everyone. 

To be honest, and I really dont mean to be rude, I dont think you know enough about rap to take such a polarized, or strong stance about it. Id love to hear your opinion on this though, and hopefully we can have a discussion about it. Cheers!
