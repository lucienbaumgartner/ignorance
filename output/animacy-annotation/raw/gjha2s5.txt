&gt;It's unprovable fake science. Reason: Most of the claims made by the theory of evolution cannot be observed in real time or falsified. 

You have yet to provide any such claims and have repeatedly been shown that you are mistaken and ignorant of the actual science.

&gt;Yet, proponents of evolution say it's true because some guy wrote about it.

Or because it can be studied through scientific studies in paleontology, genetics and biology.
