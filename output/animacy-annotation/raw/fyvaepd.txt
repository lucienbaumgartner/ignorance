Had to scroll too far to find a comment like this. There's a fundamental misunderstanding that I wear a mask to protect myself. If I'm contagious, currently asymptomatic, and unaware that I am then I'm potentially protecting YOU from ME. 

Had a genuine conversation with some acquaintances who jokingly asked why I was wearing one when we bumped into each other. Thankfully what came out was, "because I care about you and wouldn't want to get you sick."
