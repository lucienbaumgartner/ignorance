guy is mentally deteriorating. possibly dementia? i work in mental health and he reminds me a lot of my geriatric patients. easily confused and unaware of surroundings, very dependent on others, making statements that make no sense.  things like that. i honestly think he should not be paraded around national tv like that. if there is something going on mentally its cruel to do that to him.
