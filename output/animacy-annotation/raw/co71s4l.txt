I kept screaming at my screen for him to just clear the fucking ball, he looks so slow and unaware that there are City players around (behind) him. Speaking of which, Ivanovic in the fist half also tried (and failed) to dribble the ball with Aguero pressing and nobody to cover him, how hard it is to just fucking clear it.
