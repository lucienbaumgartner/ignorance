What a coincidence! 

I often find myself wondering if the people who think fascism appears completely and instantaneously in one concrete form or that it "could never happen here" realise they're so complacent and ignorant that they actually pose a real threat to democracy. 

I also wonder if their smug complacency result from being literally incapable of understanding incremental change or whether they're just deliberately being shit-weasels because they support making the country worse.

Isn't it crazy how we're both just wondering stuff that is not specifically directed at any individual?
