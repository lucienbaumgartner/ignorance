An officer involved shooting is NOT a justifiable reason to loot, burn buildings or kill people. Anyone who commiserates with people who do that looting and burning and rioting are deranged morally bankrupt individuals. 

What the Trump supporters did was stupid, ignorant and reckless as well, but at least they didn't kill dozens of people, cause billions in damages and leave struggling minority communities across the country in ruins... and what the Trump supporters did was no different than the leftist protestors who stormed the Wisconsin statehouse in 2011, which was an action that was praised and lauded by the leftist media.
