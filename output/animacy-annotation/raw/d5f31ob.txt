Even if they are multi-world/universal across dimensions, the Chaos Gods are described as "dependent" beings; for example, Khorne, the God of Death and Murder is given power by each and every act of violence carried out. Similar effects exist for the other Chaos powers. The Outer Gods, as described, are generally completely unaware and unaffected by our existence (or lack of it).*We* (our universe) are actually dependent on them (a dream from one of them) to even exist. It works for the Cthulhu mythos because it makes the despair inevitable and any "hope" of overcoming completely laughable... Whereas if you could get the entire universe to live in peace and sing Kumbaya, you would definitely weaken Khorne and maybe even prevent his involvement in this universe.
