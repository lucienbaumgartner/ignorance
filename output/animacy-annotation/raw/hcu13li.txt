This gets interesting because, if we take the C5 dimension as being the same as the Haptives dimension, it seems like a blatant continuity error to have OA be simultaneously aware and unaware of how traveling works. This is yet another support base for the idea that the C5 dimension is *not* her first rodeo

Problem is the scarring as a physical construct. If C5 isn't the same as Haptives, then why would she still have scars? Why is she so hesitant to have people touch her? These are reactions and marks from something specific and previous such as the Haptives
