NYC resident here. I was all for vaccination and mask wearing throughout this pandemic for obvious reasons. But as the result of an ignorant and uneducated minority, covid is here to stay. Theres no getting rid of it. Im at the point where I just say “fuck it” and have completely stopped caring about covid restrictions. Im vaccinated, but if I’m going to get it, ill get it. Sorry for those I may infect and spread the virus too, but don’t blame me, blame the antivaxx/antimask/covid skeptic community.
