Okay that was pretty quick considering that New York is huge and one can lay low anywhere in the Tri-state area. This suspect wasn't trying to lay low though he was gonna keep smashing and stabbing anyone, for now his target are homeless people who probably sleeping, tired and unaware of there surroundings, unlike myself and others who stand on a platforms alert as fuck clinching a fist ready to hook off on the first sign of a treat. Homeless people feel safe in the subway and cars away from the cold and outside danger not knowing that they would also be in danger because of a young punk that ain't got nothing better to do with his time.
