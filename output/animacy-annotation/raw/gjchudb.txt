Is it though? We've seen Clinton drunk before. He's been chummy with Elliott while drunk. He's been navel-gazey and thoughtful about AIs while drunk. He's never been thoughtless and ignorant of other people's feelings and just walked all over people.

Now we are all starving for some drama in this drama-free comic, so maybe I should take what I can get, but Clinton's behavior on hte date was atrocious and out of character, and his failure to recognize now what he did is hypocritical in the extreme.

This is dumb and bad and if this is the only drama we can get maybe we should just go back to every character tripping over themselves to apologize for existing and rushing to validate every other character's slightest whim.
