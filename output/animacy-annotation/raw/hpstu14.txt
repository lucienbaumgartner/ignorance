&gt;Manchester City, Chelsea, United and Liverpool can all rival them today, hence the panic among Real, Barcelona and Italian elite about PL money and the haste to start some Super League. Real Madrid's president said it himself that super league is "needed" in order to financially compete, what lie are you talking about? 

You're talking about two fundamental different things.
Pep and then you repeated that few teams can rival Madrid and Barça in terms of **history**. Unless having money now gives you history, only Liverpool can truly rival those clubs.





&gt;No, that's ignorant and stupid. He has a contract with Manchester City until Jun 30, 2025 and if City didn't want to let him go, Torres would have to sit there until Jun 30, 2025 regardless of what he wants, just like Barcelona didn't allow Messi to leave despite him handing in transfer request.

???? Few teams are like PSG and Barça with Messi lol.
Ferran wants out, City receives an offer than meets its terms, Ferran gone. It's that simple.
Most clubs don't use clauses as a way to keep their player hostage, simply as a way to not get scammed.
City has gotten a very sweet deal for its what 5th striker? Why would they keep Ferran when he obviously wants out? It's not like they desperately need him or can't replace him.
