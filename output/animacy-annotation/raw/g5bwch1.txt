Thanks for this. To be fair though, I don’t do any of that. I never have sex, and I’m constantly cleaning myself (germaphobe) and  showering every day. That’s why I was surprised I got one.

I remember reading that it’s common in women, but a urologist saying a lot of it is myths.

Anyway thanks. I’m so stupid and ignorant that I always thought you could get it from what you eat if you got ill
