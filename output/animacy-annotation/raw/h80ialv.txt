Come again?
I shouldn't give up the freedom of being able to drive drunk to provide security to myself and others?
I shouldn't give up my freedom to to expect absolute privacy in my house and therefore no fireman or police officer should ever be able to make entry even if my house is on fire and I'm asleep and unaware of it?
No police officer should ever be able to look at social media or things that are being reported by other concerned citizens about someone who is openly threatening a terrorist act, because them investigating it would threaten my freedom of privacy? And all of these things would make our nation a better place?
