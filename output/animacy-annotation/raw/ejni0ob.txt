Of course he is both wonderful and horrific. Supportive and demoralizing. Thoughtful and ignorant. That is why you stay. If he was a complete douchecanoe, you would have left a long time ago because it would be obvious, simple and easy to explain. It's the dangling carrot of his affection that keeps you hanging on. That's a significant part of the cycle of emotional manipulation and abuse.
