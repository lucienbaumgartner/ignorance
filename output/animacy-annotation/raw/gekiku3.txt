Below OP posts the dress and says that the venue is a rooftop bar—I think this dress is fine for that as it’s pretty much a cocktail dress.

Otherwise, I would say it’s NTA because even if OP is dressed inappropriately, there are a million ways to handle it that don’t involve throwing tantrums. A simple “you would probably make a better impression if you dressed conservatively” would suffice. I don’t think OP is an asshole for club gear, just young and unaware of social faux pas. Her boyfriend acted extremely childishly.
