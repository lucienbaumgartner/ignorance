You may be right. Nothing is impossible. His wife may very well respond by fulfilling everyone of 1Kratos1's deepest wishes, and go get drunk at a strip club with him in celebration of throwing off the bonds of the TSCC.

I would say, given 1Kratos1's descriptions of his wife, and given the predominant attitudes of women (especially religiously-raised women) toward things like strip clubs, it is far more probable that she will react extremely poorly to the entire situation.

Regarding this:

&gt;Stop trying to put yourself above him, or even assume you know how to better handle the situation he's in. 

**Not above him**

Look, most of us have been there -- in that place where your utter rage at the incomprehensible lie you've been raised in and *helped fund* is stronger than your love for your family. [1Kratos1](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1klpef/wife_never_responded_to_my_email_about_polygamy/) [said](http://i.imgur.com/HOYax0v.jpg), "I think I hate the church more than I love my wife," so he's clearly in that place. He's thrashing about in rage and alienating his loved ones -- partly in the hope that they too will recognize the lie and leave with him.


**Situation**

But his loved ones have the right to their own path of self-discovery and their own journeys, and there is a more compassionate and patient way to go about this than intentionally poking at the most painful topics he can think of to bring up. 

And, quite frankly, I would assume he has the ability to be more mature and restrained than he is acting. He is in his 40's, he is a father, and he is a spouse. He has maintained an [LDS](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1j3axw/am_i_the_worst_of_the_worst/) [facade](http://i.imgur.com/lldmogW.jpg) throughout his marriage, indulging in "sins" such as smoking and drinking only when traveling. He claims he has never cheated on his wife. 

All this indicates a man who is capable of restraint and control. A man who recognizes that his own impulses are secondary to the well-being and happiness of his children and his wife -- the family he has responsibility for. This indicates a man who understands on some level that once you become a parent, you are no longer free to indulge selfish whims, or to opt in and out of a relationship (in some form) with the other parental party. 

**Everything he's done**

* But then, [he](http://i.imgur.com/xlucjMe.jpg) goes to strip clubs.
* He starts a subreddit that is not only pornographic ([NSFW](http://i.imgur.com/6cObHoc.jpg)), but which *actively disrespects* a key tenant of the religion his wife still follows by fetishizing garments (and possibly his wife's autonomy regarding her personal image, see note at bottom). 
* He brags about their [private sexual escapades](http://i.imgur.com/PEO43f5.jpg) on public forum. 
* He intentionally brings up Joseph Smith and [polygamy](http://i.imgur.com/D7BZPQd.jpg) in order to goad her into a shocked response, with no apparent self-awareness of how his own sexual peccadillos may be viewed by her. 
* He [mocks her](http://i.imgur.com/YCB3H2W.jpg) for turning to him for support, when the whole reason she's experiencing doubt and emotional difficulty is *because of his repeated attempts to goad her into disbelief on his schedule*. 

To put the time frame of this in context, 1Kratos1 initally posted in the exmo subreddit (stating he believed, but disliked the church) on July 26 -- 24 days ago. Within a few days, he posted again, announcing that after reading all the exmo links he no longer believed and now wanted a [step-by-step guide to get his wife out](http://i.imgur.com/lNvUGHT.jpg). Over the course of the past **24 days** two themes have shown up in his comments in regards to his wife, sometimes in the *same comment*:

* The need for time and patience and to let his wife process the truth in her own time.

* His impatience with her unwillingness to question the church and leave *rightnowrightnowrightnow*. 

It is reasonable to deduce that 1Kratos1 has reason to believe the topic of unfaithfulness in a marriage is a sensitive/ touchy issue to his wife, given his choice to focus on drilling in JS's polygamous activities (instead of, say, focusing on [racism](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/racism-and-the-mormon-church.html) or [sexism](http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/06/17/sexism/) or the fact that in JS's time there were also [prophetesses](http://katepapers.blogspot.com/2005/05/lucy-mack-smith-new-england-housewife.html) and [priestesses](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=1171)) as a means of introducing cognitive dissonance to his wife. Yet despite his willingness to exploit her discomfort with JS's manipulative and immoral sexual behavior, he is incapable or unwilling to acknowledge that his own sexual escapades could be viewed as problematic. 

Furthermore, he seems completely blind and unaware that his behavior (specifically the strip clubs, discussion of their intimate life, porn subreddit, and at least 8 years of lies to cover up his "sins") will actually discredit all the information he provides through association, and will further prop up her faith in the church. 

He hits every bad stereotype of an offended, sin-loving mormon who is using manipulation and deceit to tempt faithful mormons away. It's so spot on that part of me wonders if he's a fictional persona created solely to prove that exmormons are just as depraved and sin-driven as they liked to depict us in Sunday School. "Look, guys, I had this guy start a porn subreddit and brag about cheating on his wife, and they are cheering him on! I told you they didn't have morals."

&gt;This thread is full of unsolicited advice for someone who never asked for it. 

He has asked for advice multiple times, and he has ignored every bit of advice that counseled a path or model of behavior different from the one he was already set on. He clearly believes that if his wife leaves him, it will have nothing to do with his own behavior. 


&gt;Ya'll need to get off your high horses.

I disagree. I think one does not need religion to have values such as honesty, respect, or fidelity.

**As a side note** to the porn subreddit, 1Kratos1 mentioned at one point that his wife let him take naked photos of her. This places a new and concerning spin in regards to consent on some of the content 1Kratos1 submitted, which features a woman in a private residence in her garments.

All links NSFW and possibly lacking consent on the part of the woman. 

* [woman in garments; half-face showing](http://fap.to/images/full/47/190/1907715885.jpg) 

* [album with underskirt garment shots, a woman in a garment top blowing kisses, and a woman in a garment top with bared labia](http://imgur.com/a/DOP6T#UNMmWBs)

**EDIT** I would like to clarify that I don't have a problem with a person drinking, smoking, going to strip clubs, or viewing porn. I don't think those activities are, in and of themselves, immoral. I engage in some of them. I do have a problem with:

* Sexualized, [objectifying](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2013/08/subjectify-me-5-ways-to-tell-if-an-image-is-objectifying/), and likely non-consensual images being posted by 3rd parties. 

* Someone discussing personal sexual activities in a long-term monogamous relationship in a public forum without the consent or awareness of the partner, especially when everything the posting party has said indicates the partner would not be okay with what is being shared. 

* A long-term and sustained pattern of lying to one's partner about sexual behavior/ habits.

* Refusal to take personal responsibility for one's actions.
