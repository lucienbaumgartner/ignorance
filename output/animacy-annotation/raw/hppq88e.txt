I hear you. 

I am skipping my family Christmas dinner this year. I finally had enough. I hate people too. My family was always given a pass for being related to me. But when it came time for them to step up and be helpful loving family members they turned their backs on me.

And then they made plans for a Christmas dinner together. THEY made plans. And then told me the plans, and the dinner does not work for me on the date they are having it, but nobody checked with me before finalizing this date.  

I already blew off everyone else for being ignorant and dismissive and selfish. These are the last people I’ve been friendly too. Like you, I’m done with people now too.
