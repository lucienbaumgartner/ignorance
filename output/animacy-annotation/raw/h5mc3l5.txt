I have my doubts about what you're saying, after all, if they can control someone like that, why can't they control me?   


What I will give you, is that there are likely many people aware of what's going on with people like us, but they're given either:

1) A story that makes them feel better about what they do to us.

or 2) Are seduced by the mass of others to partake in these actions.

Mob mentality is real, so when people tell other people stories about each other, or befriend someone to bring into their group that seems nice, and or full of popular people, individuals will convert to those people's way of thinking. It's very simple psychology deployed by sociopaths and narcissists everyday, but because people are unaware of how they can, or are being used, many simply just operate under such conditions. I've seen the propensity in myself when I was younger, and unaware of truly terrible people, but many never grow out of such a state of mind.

You can see just as much reflected in some religious sects, cults, and even social media lifestyle communities. I suppose that because I haven't been mind controlled by technology yet, means that I should be open to the possibility that I could be, but I know for a certainty that you don't need technology to get a person to act against someone else. Take a look at what happened to the Tutsi, Rohingya, Jewish, or Black peoples in history, and you'll see how humans act when they've been given a reason to hate someone else.
