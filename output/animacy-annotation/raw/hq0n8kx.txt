[On 12/19 the CEO and general counsel sold shares, I know that doesn‚Äôt guarantee they believe the stock is headed down, but that‚Äôs what helped convince me. The amount of negative press they are getting, the interest rate hikes in 2022, the fact their next earnings report may not be where institutions want them to be etc. I bought $110 puts expiring September 2022 to let some of this cook](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rnci0n/buy_puts_on_lyv_ticketmaster_live_nation/hpvi1u5/)

[Good to hear some sense from a young guy about this. Way too many threads (since the GME effect) about 14-18 yr olds wanting to start trading as their be-all in life, and putting school and college education and career training sense behind in priority, seemingly.  And OP, skip the options. Way too dangerous, imo. If you're going to try trading, best do it with micro-futures, where you can get a lot of practice and screentime on sim and then tiny leverage at about $1.25 per tick, basically 1/10th the leverage of regular futures. I would just keep practicing and just keep it small if live while your priority to 21 is some college or career direction and training. It's like independent sports, very rare to get into the tiers that can make a living right away from teen years, and even then a consistent career can be highly unstable. So best to have a regular "day job" occupation, while trading is part-time or just put off until mid 20's or so.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpwk8la/)

[It made WSB go from 2 million following to 11 million. Which gave many a full sense, "trading is easy I should do it too" when reality its not. Its much like the casino, you will win the first few times, then in the end you will lose. Seen a lot in the past year, many just quitted after losing cash.  Not to mention GME thing also helped Wall Street more than it did hurting it. All banks reported high earnings from investment banking, of course theres other factors for it, but reddit did help. Plus the big guys that hold GME when it was like $7 or so made billions, one of them was Michael J Burry (made more than the short of subprime if I recall) who was against the movement.  Edit: Remember the whole Citadel is bad and everyone made fun of them for losing billions? Yeah they made it back, predictable, from the surge of traders thanks to the movement. The movement was really "noobs who don't know banking participated in a movement while pretending to know banking, just take money." Only Wall Street really knew what was going on and who would win. The only best way to hurt Wall Street are taxes, nothing else.

[Yeah I was there for all that, but I don't understand where you're getting all your info from. I don't remember people looking at GME and thinking trading is easy, people were just trying to hop on a short squeeze and make some money. A couple years back when Keith Gill bought his options people actually thought he was a nut job and that he was going to lose it all, but he actually did the research and knew the true value of the company.   Also, how did GME help wall street if it literally bankrupt an entire hedge fund? Archegos fell due to GME and it almost took Melvin Capital out as well. Hedge funds never closed those short positions, any time the price rises they are in the red, the SEC have said so themselves.  I'm not trying to argue or anything but it's interesting to see how people interpret everything that happened. As you can probably already tell GME is about 90% of my portfolio. I believe a short squeeze is possible, but I also just believe in the company. They have paid off all debt, raised half a billion dollars in capital, started opening fulfillment centers, made many other changes within their company, mainly focusing on e-commerce and are currently developing and I believe are very close to launching an NFT market.  It is literally the most manipulated stock in history, but it's a little annoying to see people blow it off as a meme stock or use it as a bad example when it is a rapidly transforming company with a bright future.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpu1fmm/)

[Archegos defunct because of GME? was there some related effect from it that soured VZ?, what Bill Huang (where he had been previously banned from asia trading) had most of his positions tied up in , and he failed to stick to his s/l and management rules until the five banks or so he had options overleverage with, who then had to force him to dump his positions, with the ones that waited and dumped later also suffered billions of dollars in losses alongside him.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpwjyai/)
