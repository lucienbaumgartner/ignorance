i talk about the research. and i privately talk to people about tips one could possibly do to get better, when they reach out to me asking for advice and or don’t. i also try to give people a lot of hope and correct ideas that are not true. 

i’ve never asked you to listen to me. but, you are ignorant and wrong about many aspects of long covid, so maybe it is a good idea
