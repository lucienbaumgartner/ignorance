I don't see how its taken out of context.  It looks very clear to me.  Also the last part where he says they have in general conspired to produce a compliant and unaware citizenry is telling.  I think you would be the one taking it out of context if you feel it means anything other than it clearly states.  This person wants an unaware and compliant citizenry and is lamenting that we are not compliant enough and feels it presents a serious problem. 

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking -
