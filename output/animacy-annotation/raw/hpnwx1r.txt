After considering that everyone has different sound preferences, and that a V shaped compared to a Flat shaped sound will be different.......The simplest answer to your question is that GENERALLY SPEAKING, people are very stupid and think a brand name like Samsung equals better/best/quality/louder/etc compared to a brand they are not familiar with. I have a coworker that thinks her Samsung earbuds will only work with her Samsung phone because they are both Samsung. She is literally that ignorant and dense to completely ignore how Bluetooth works let alone what it actually is. Sadly, there are a LOT of plain old stupid people who don’t know that “name brand” and “more expensive” doesn’t mean better......
