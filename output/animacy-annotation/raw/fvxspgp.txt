It's the existence of these workarounds (of which there are VERY many) which prove the stupidity of the change. Massive did it to prevent cheesing but it had the side effect of impacting badly upon the majority of the playerbase and they've ended up causing huge frustration to people who would never consider cheesing. The former group is far smaller than the latter, and the existence of the number of workarounds proves that the former group will just find another method. In particular, there are so many ways to reduce cooldowns that it strikes me as unbelievably short sighted and ignorant that they thought it would prevent what they clearly consider unintended behaviour. The alternative steps are barely more onerous - the game actively encourages builds which are designed to reduce cooldowns as much as possible! How could they forget this?
