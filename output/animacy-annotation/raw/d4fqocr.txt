I dont know the numbers for their damage and stats, but if the roadhog can get a headshot with his primary attack and the Reaper is close enough, then yeah one shot. 
I play a lot of Roadhog and if he's close enough and you blast them in the face he can one shot almost anyone.
I also play Reaper a great deal and i dont usually have trouble peeling a Roadhog unless i get hooked. Though i usually flank and catch tanks unaware and disengage when things get rough.
