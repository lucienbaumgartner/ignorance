Personally, I don't think Rubio is ready for anything.  He seems very untested and has an air about him of being unaware and very uninformed.  Cruz seems like a niche candidate for the religious voters, and somehow, dated and not marketable to today's voting populace.   Cruz would have done very well thirty or so years ago.  What he sells now just doesn't wash well.   Personally, if forced to pick between the three, I'll take Trump since he can show objective thought and Independence of will at times.
