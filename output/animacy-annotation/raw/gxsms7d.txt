I find it ironic that it seems like FFL's in this state with the crap gun laws we have seem to be the most ignorant and unaware of them compared to reality. Worse than that, they start telling others who know nothing and are new to guns that X, Y, or Z are illegal any you can't to that etc...  I understand they are over worried about NJ's laws but theres got to be a point at which they actually figure out the laws and what you can and can't do. 

Super frustrating and self defeating for the gun community here. Be knowledgeable about the specific laws in this state and fill out the NJ and ATF paperwork as the law requires, ie no "rifle" listed for a stripped receiver on a 4473 and then argue when the damn form you are filling out has instructions to the contrary of how you are completing it. I as a customer shouldn't know more details on how to complete the forms, the law, ATF letters etc than you who's job literally involves them every day.

On a side note, am I the only one who hates whoever started engraving "other" on the firearms? That has no impact on its legality and only serves to misinform.  I believe I've seen multiple posts about people being told by FFL's that its required or shops won't sell them without it, which is nonsense and seems only to enrich themselves by getting you to buy one off their shelves. The configuration of the firearm makes it an other not it having "other" on the receiver...
