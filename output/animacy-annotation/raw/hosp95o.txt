A so because I'm black I should take the word of Biden? If you think the only problem with the Dem party is just "not forgiving student loan", then you are so privileged and ignorant of BIPOC issues that you're a part of the problem.

In fact the very fact that you insult me and question my race for my statement alone while simultaneously ignoring and being ignorant of issues black Americans face, is exactly why you are as ignorantly racist as those on the right and why, I and other black Americans (not all) share the sentiment that there was nothing for us to lose under Trump, because the left has never given us anything either.

Biden is pro-segregationist, Kamala Harris in fact incarcerated as many black Americans as she could and gave them harsher sentences, they're just the kind of racists you like, the ones that quietly oppress minorities while keeping it out of your face, so you don't have to feel guilty about the privileges you enjoy.

You are no different than a white supremacist republican, and you've proven that by being incapable of reading. No where did I say it would get better under Trump. I did imply privileged and ignorant people like you would suffer just enough to wake up and finally help change the systems in place. You are so far removed from BIPOC issues you truly believe we're somehow better under dems in comparison to repubs, and instead of listening you chose to do what white racists do, insult others instead of understanding because you're incapable of understanding the actual plight of black Americans.
