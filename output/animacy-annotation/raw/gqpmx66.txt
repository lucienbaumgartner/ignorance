"At root, the fundamental point is that tyranny does not flourish because perpetrators are helpless and ignorant of their actions. It flourishes because they actively identify with those who promote vicious acts as virtuous. It is this conviction that steels participants to do their dirty work and that makes them work energetically and creatively to ensure its success. Moreover, this work is something for which they actively wish to be held accountable â€” so long as it secures the approbation of those in power." -  from the conclusion of "[Contesting the â€˜â€˜Natureâ€™â€™ Of Conformity: What Milgram and Zimbardoâ€™s Studies Really Show](https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/3264/HaslamReicher2012pbio1001426NatureofConformity.pdf;sequence=1)" by S.
