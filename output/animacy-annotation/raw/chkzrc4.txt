Mormonism is a very broad topic. It is further complicated because most mormons pick and choose among their broad canon of doctrine; the doctrine itself has been a moving target for over 180 years. Any given person may choose to be a literalist/fundamentalist or less literal and more liberal in choosing metaphor over strict dogma. The mainstream branch now uses standardized teaching materials in an attempt to keep everyone on the same page.

For a long time, the actual history of the Latter Day Saint movement has been hidden from most members. (If not hidden, perhaps, de-emphasized and whitewashed are better terms.) The information age changes everything. The truth about its origins and its founder are coming into focus. When that happens, member face the decision of whether what they have been taught matches the facts. One factor that keeps many attending is the social aspects. Whether it is true, or not, it is still a building that is open on Sundays where people can gather and sing hymns, pray, etc. Many *chapel mormons* remain ignorant and unaware that it may not be what it claims to be: *the one true church* on earth.
