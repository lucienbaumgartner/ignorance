I haven't experienced it to this degree because I pass as different races in different circles but the rest of the world is absolutely racist and ignorant of what it means to be mixed race because of how small of a proportion we are. This idea can be summed up in the phrase "the sum of the parts is less than the whole" that is to say as mixed race people while we can be described in terms of each aspect of our background in reality we have distinct cultural identities detached from our parents' races. Most of our time is spent looking from the outside in, and while it can be lonely it makes us very good judges of the racial climate in our countries and the world. 

I hate to see the loneliness you're going through and I wish I had an answer to it. I can say that I've met one other person who is a similar mix to me and we're very good friends so there is a light at the end of the tunnel. As for the rest of society though, there's no fixing it until they decide to take race relations and critically analyze the position they've put us all in.
