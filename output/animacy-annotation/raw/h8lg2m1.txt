Yeah, so that isn't going to work. You don't tell someone  to "brush up" on something without suggesting ignorance/idiocy. 

I didn't admit to being incapable of using the term properly. There is no need to lie now, its only digging the hole deeper. But hey maybe when you can actually formulate an argument instead of passive-agressively avoiding confrontation you could save face.

Also I love the "I know more philosophy than you" without adding a single thing to your comment. Very fitting for someone so bad faithed and ignorant of definitions like yourself.
