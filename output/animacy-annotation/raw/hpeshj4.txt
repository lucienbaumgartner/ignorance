The bible is a library written in many different genres, it also has various reading levels. It was written for Jews from millennia ago and you must understand what it teaches them.

After that you read to find out what it teaches us readers of the 21st century and specifically how it applies to your life.

"19 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 20 Above all , you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. 21 For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. " 2 Peter 1

"15 Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 16 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. " 2 Peter 3

Using individual verses it is possible to justify any previous belief and condemn or justify your own or someone else's behavior, so reading it alone without accepting conclusions from others with the statement "is correct because the bible says so" is not a healthy attitude.
