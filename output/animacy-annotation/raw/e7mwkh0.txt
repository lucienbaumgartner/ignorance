I dropped from plat to bronze. No lie! 

It’s because I stopped caring as much, but keep in mind that I was mid plat and got there through knowledge and experience. 

I’m 36, I work hard and have responsibilities. However I love playing OW. 

There are too many examples of why I dislike the community and competitive play. One of my favorite examples, and it happened last night, is when people blame DPS for not killing anything. 

I was literally in the middle of eliminating 4 players of the enemy team while my teammates were yelling at me. I don’t like to claim gold medals mean anything, but I had 4 and ended the game, victory included, with a 72% kill participation. That guy actually still told me that he carried me. I received a card for something like 62 elims and a “good job” McCree FROM THE ENEMY TEAM! 

The problem is that players are so incredibly toxic and unaware that they don’t see what’s happened in the kill feed/battleground.  I have more to say but I’m tired.
