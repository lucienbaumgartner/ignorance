the ghost of corbyns past you say, he's fading..

&gt;Your hatred and intolerance has made you blind. What do you think  happens when you call millions of people racist and ignorant, that they  are going to work for you? I received so much abuse on this sub, that  now I'm happy to see you humiliated.

Hatred can go both ways, don't stay into it too long, keep looking forward, like johnson said;

*We have a positive vision to get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential*

That will only work when everyone's included, the remain option, sadly, seems to have passed. don't become the US where everybody hates oneother but try to become a rejuvenated inclusive UK
