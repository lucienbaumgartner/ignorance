You are absolutely correct and I myself lost hope in 95% of politicians, however i studied the political theory and every politician knows that the real power belongs to the people because thier legitimacy comes from the people itself, yet we as a youth must know our real issues and set real goals and here are some of my ideas : 

- demand that the IMF cancels a good part of our debts so the government can invest in growth 

- an economic reform in which the monopolies are destroyed and more opportunities are created for the small firms and younger generations. 

- rebuilding our educational system Specially in colleges (not just IT) .

These are just some ideas that can be turned into demands there is more to it but if we don't push for more acts like this no one will , believe me if we stay desperate and unaware of our real issues and problems we will not be able to change anything.
