You have no proof this person is who they say they are or even that they are a woman. You have no proof of anything. The internet is entirely anonymous. I can claim anything I wish because this individual whomever they are or what they are does not know me.

You think I haven't been through this before? You speak despite being arrogant and ignorant of me. 

Every online encounter I have had with women ends the same way. They see my face and then they are gone. Your statements are inaccurate. Women MAY be interested provided they have no idea what I look like. 

This person is bored that is all. They are looking to entertain themselves at most then like everyone before then they will vanish. As I said I am not going to use reddit for that kind of thing. All kinds of weirdos on here.
