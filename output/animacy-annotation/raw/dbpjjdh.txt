I don't think that trying to convince them of anything is the best approach, if anything it may get the opposite results. Instead, have a sit-down with both your son and his gf and approach this from a practical perspective.

Start with feeling about how they have prepared themselves for the baby **practically**! Being parents may sound romantic for some teenagers, but a lot of them are completely unaware and unprepared for the practical challenges. What are they going to do about jobs? Do they know how much clothes, diapers, etc cost or are they expecting the parents to just foot the bill and play babysitter at their convenience? What about college, do they plan on going to college or what jobs are they planning for? What about college for the child? How will they start saving for it? 

Do not try to paint a scary picture, but rather a realistic picture, which will be scary enough on its own. Right now, it sounds like they are in the romantic phase of having a baby with zero idea about the practical implications. You need to be as objective as possible, because if they sense you are trying to push an agenda on them, them chances are they will be resistant to your advice.
