That fact that he said it when there was a 100% chance of no one ever finding out unless he said something (since he never acted on his feelings at the time and this was all in his head) says that he's not a racist. Did you not do stupid shit when you were younger OP because almost everyone has. The fact that he brought this up and how wrong it was shows how people can either let the hate consume them or change because of it. I almost did the same thing as him when I was younger. A friend of ours was jumped and beaten by some black guys so me and a few of my friends went to where it happened (some of us with weapons) ready to get some revenge on the first black guys we saw. Luckily some cops were also in the area which made us nervous and we left before we could do anything. Looking back at that now I see how stupid and ignorant that was and how we could have easily ruined our lives as well as the lives of whoever ended up being our victim. We were caught up in our own rage and ready to take it out on someone just for sharing the same skin color as the attackers. This was the only time something like this happened and none of us ever shared a thought like that again. Should our careers be ruined now for having a stupid thought when we were younger?
