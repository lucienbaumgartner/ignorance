What are your thoughts on the way they consistently deny having plastic surgery? 

That someone’s choices about what they choose to do with THEIR bodies is THEIR business and that being a public figure does not give anyone the right to demand a list of their medical procedures, what type of Spanx they’re wearing and who installed their extensions.

Let’s just clarify things here, this is not about the **Kardashians** specifically right? Saying that the reason you feel “icky” about them is because they deny it and they’re role models and I can only guess at how you must feel about say, Nicole Kidman, John Travolta, Michael Jackson and we could go on and on and on.

Not you or anyone else is entitled to demand someone’s medical record because they’re popular. Their bodies do not belong to you just because they’re rich and famous. And trying to legitimize it by saying they’re role models and people admire them sounds pretty hypocritical given the sheer number of models, actors, singers and other cultural celebrities that are admired by the exact same people and not asked to undergo an x ray to prove that they don’t have butt implants.

I don’t know where you got this idea that all these uneducated and impressionable girls that you say you’re concerned for actually exist. You say they have an obligation to disclose their cosmetic surgery to **the fans who are so obsessed that want to be just like a Kardashian** because these fans are naive and unaware that it takes strict dieting, constant working out, a team of makeup and hair stylists and any amount of cosmetic surgery to look like them? What? 

Are you going to stick with that? Because I challenge you to google “Kylie Jenner lips” and tell me  how far down the page you have to scroll to get to the first mention of surgery and lip fillers. It’s insane to me that anyone would say “if they don’t publicly list all their surgeries then how will the young women who admire them know that they weren’t born like that?” I’m guessing the hundreds and hundreds of hours that a camera follows them around from reality show to paparazzi. 

This bullshit has been happening for decades. Anna Nicole Smith. Janet Jackson. every Victoria’s Secret model, most of the women and men in Hollywood. The amount of privacy anyone is entitled to when it comes to their bodies is not determined by how virtuous they are, for God’s sake
