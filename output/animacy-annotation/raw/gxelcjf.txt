People who bring up the Elisa Lam case as some kind of mystery or supernatural event. The poor girl clearly had some acute mental illness and unfortunately died because of it. Making it into some kind of ghost story or impossible scenario is so insultingly dismissive and ignorant of mental health it just makes me angry.
