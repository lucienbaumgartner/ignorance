This episode is very important to me, because as we all humans start to question why people have to die, and how we run away from feeling, today's society teach us to be selfish and unaware that we all are sensitive beings and we nowadays are teach to do not be shown as vulnerable, don't over love and I think that's one of the main lessons that this episode sohw me, that feeling too much is good and it takes you to the good path
