Yeah I was in a completely different place, completely detached and unaware of my surroundings.

Don't get me wrong, what I experienced, I will take with me forever.
But I feel terrible for thinking that might be okay without being ready enough. I readied myself how I could, but my God nothing could have readied us for that.

I'm forever grateful to have such an amazing partner, and after that trip I'm fucked if I know how she still loves me. She says even though it was pretty bad, it made her love me more. She was just worried she was going to lose me.
She actually made a recording, and she showed me just last night. 
Just an audio recording, slowly leading up to the moments where I pissed myself and disappeared, wandering around, talking to my ex and getting aggravated (I was a part of a very abusive relationship and it's left me a bit damaged).
She made the call to kill the trip, and she did the right thing in hindsight.

That's understandable, I love the duration but like you said it's hard to fit that into the rest of the schedule, even more so with a family I'm sure. Shrooms fit that bill a bit easier. They are scarce where I am, I'm hoping I can maybe cultivate my own.
