This article will help you understand how gender and sex differ. To sum up quickly, sex is biological, gender refers to roles and traits determined by societies. This is also a hard fact to come to terms with and not something up for debate.

"The World Health Organisation summarises the difference between sex and gender in the following way:
Sex refers to “the different biological and physiological characteristics of males and females, such as reproductive organs, chromosomes, hormones, etc.”
Gender refers to "the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. The concept of gender includes five important elements: relational, hierarchical, historical, contextual and institutional. While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviours – including how they should interact with others of the same or opposite sex within households, communities and work places. When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health17.”

As you can see, those who confuse gender and sex as you have done are simply, wrong and ignorant. That really is all there is to it. None of this is unsettled. What we do see is misinformation spread by ignorant people, ignorant pundits, and that bad information poisons minds.
