So...didn't know about any of these incidents but I do feel that basing notions of queerness around a public figure's dating life post break in ian't the right path to take here. It feels biphobic, as at least some of these writers may well have been involved in same sex relationships earlier in their lives that we don't know about, and it is unfortunately still common to erase bisexuality in the community by making these kinds of statements toward people who lean more hetero in their attractions despite being attracted to people of the same gender. 

That said, my hope is that we see an influx of MM centered stories in the traditional sphere. FF stories have found a foothold to a greater extent than MM outside of romance and erotica, or at least that has been what I've noticed. I admit I don't have as much time to read as I used to, though. 

In any case, I find it tactless and ignorant that publishing trends in queer fiction appear to isolate MM stories to the romance genre while seeking to present FF stories as asexual in order to appeal to a cishet audience, and it boggles me that they've been so reluctant over the years to sell fiction with the explicit intent of marketing to a queer and/or trans audience. 

Honestly, I'm here for an influx of own voices narratives hitting the shelves and the work is definitely being done even if the heavy lifting isn't being done by the Big 5 houses, but it would be nice if the stories that gained traction were a little more diverse. And...you know...at least at times featured queer majority casts instead of one or two characters in a world populated by cishet people. Idk about you, but I have two close straight friends and the rest are queer. I feel like that kind of cast is a rarely represented in books in the genres I read most frequently.
