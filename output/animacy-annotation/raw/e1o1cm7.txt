Honestly... That sounds like he's kind of toying with you. If he knows you have feelings for him, and he's hanging out with you in somewhat romantic circumstances - and there is chemistry... I'd be careful, either he's just careless and unaware that you aren't just friends now that it's 'settled' in his mind, or he wants to have his cake and eat it. Either way, I wouldn't just drop into an accidental date with a friend I knew liked me, I'd be more upfront about my feelings changing. But 22 year olds can be fickle AF!
