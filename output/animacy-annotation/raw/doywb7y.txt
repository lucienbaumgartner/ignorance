It really irks me that people try to pinpoint one thing that caused Trump to get elected. It was a ton of things that caused it. 

* For 8 years, the republicans have been complaining about Obamacare to the point that many of their base was confused and unaware that Obamacare and the ACA were the same thing. This caused the republican base to be mobilized before Trump was ever nominated. 
* For 30 years, Hillary has been the target (warranted or not) of numerous investigates and slander campaigns. This caused the US population in general to just not really care for her. 
* In general, the trend has been that the republicans and democrats swap presidents in the White House. The last exception to that rule had a single term. This is generally because people have a short memory and a really poor targetting of who is causing their distaste for the trend of politics and it's always blamed on the president. For the last 6 years, a republican congress had blocked Obama from getting any real changes made, and people blamed Obama for it.
* External propaganda, largely Russian, was targeted at both sides in an attempt to cause discontent and polarize our nation. 
* Trump came in and fueled the fire under Hillary by being the biggest mudslinger to ever be elected.
* Hillary was just the worst candidate the DNC could have picked. Many people were actively voting against Hillary without regard for who the other candidate was.
* Trump mobilized the White Nationalists by being the first candidate in many decades to not openly speak out against them. It's not that he himself is racist, its that he didn't condemn racism. 
* Hillary didn't campaign in some key states that she thought were a shoe in.
* Trump told blatant lies about things he flat out couldn't do. (Yes all politicians lie, but Trumps were probably some of the most blatant) For example, coal miners wanted to hear that coal jobs were coming back. Trump told them that coal jobs would come back, but either Trump didn't understand that coal jobs are gone because the people who used to operate on coal no longer operate on coal, or he knew that and lied about it. He also told people that he had a tax plan that would hurt him greatly, but every bit of information that's been released about his tax plan shows exactly the opposite. 
* Trump spent the entire campaign further polarizing the nation by discrediting mainstream media. 
* The DNC behaved improperly during the primary which caused many voters to want to punish them and resulted in them either not voting or voting against the DNC. 

The list goes on. The 2016 election was probably the most fucked up election cycle to ever really happen in the US. There's not one thing that resulted in President Donald J. Trump, and believing that it was just shows that you weren't actually paying attention at the time.
