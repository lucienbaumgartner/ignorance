I will try to play the devil's advocate and say the stumping wasn't fair. If a batsman has not grounded his bat or feet, then it is possible that he is not in complete control. Keepers waiting for a batsman to overbalance while playing the shot in those situations is fair, in this case, the batsman finished playing the shot and was probably unaware and maybe lazy, but he was in complete control while playing the shot and after.  So one can make a case that Nev was just cheeky and held on to the ball longer than usual.
