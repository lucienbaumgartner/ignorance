They haven't shown enough merit to have earned a seat at that table and their presence is nothing but disruptive.  You don't build a party by jumping in at the very top.  You organize, you win small seats and grow your numbers by governing effectively and spreading your message.  In a two party government with a first past the post voting system the most a third party can accomplish is sabotage of one of the real parties.  In the case of the Greens it is the Democrats that they sabotage, and in the case of Libertarians it is generally the Republicans.  

I would normally like that the Libertarians sabotage the Republicans but they are so fucking annoying and ignorant that I can't even credit them for that.
