You’re being dense. The subjective merit of creative diversity of a franchise, and addressing a subjective opinion from a group of MCU fan on a qualitative subject cannot be measure.

Trying to use viewership metrics to judge the validity of the argument of variety in the MCU is profoundly naive and ignorant of the many factors that affect viewership and the impact that variety of content in the universe affects popularity. You are trying to use a cheap and lazy argument to basically say “Feige did it better.”
