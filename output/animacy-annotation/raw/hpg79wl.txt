You are free to "think for yourself" just as we are free to call you an absolute moron for comparing yourself to an ethnic group that was hunted down and murdered in the most gruesome ways imaginable. 

You are right that vaccinated people are still, to a certain degree, able to spread the virus, and even mention that symptoms are much less severe. But somehow you ignore the fact, that unvaccinated people, if infected, are a huge burden to our hospitals.

I listen to the experts, because they are experts. They have the knowledge and qualifications I don't have. Of course, they can still be wrong, but they are a lot more reliable than some random idiot on the internet. I'm baffled how any sane person can think, even for a second, that he knows better than somebody who has dealt with this shit for the entirety of his career. How can you be this arrogant and ignorant?

And no, it's not a "simple observation", it's at best a very, very dumb take of a person who doesn't even have a remote understanding of what was going on in Nazi-Germany.
