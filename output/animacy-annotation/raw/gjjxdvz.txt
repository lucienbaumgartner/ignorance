Sure. there's a lot more to a modern level of society than food, also gathering those crops requires people to output work, post scarcity implies people don't have to work any longer, basically everything is done by robots and similar technology and people don't have to do anything other than enjoy their lives. Personally I don't think it will happen because the elite will always want to be on top and will keep poor people poor and ignorant of what technology is capable of .
