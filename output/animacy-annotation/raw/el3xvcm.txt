Main character: Nervous and unaware that every girl in his life wants the D, calm but somehow "will destroy you if you mess with me/flips to crazy on a dime", odd backstory explaining in a ridiculous way how he somehow has some sort of extreme skill in fighting or combat, goes through some sort of metamorphosis from 5'1 110 pound nerd to 6'3 200 pound destruction machine...

It's been done so many times I almost laugh when I see it. Granted, there are some that do it well (Parasyte comes to mind) but my god, I've only ever watched a few series, and I've already noticed these.
