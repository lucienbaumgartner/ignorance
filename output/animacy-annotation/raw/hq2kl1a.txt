No one is blaming him for being pissed. Im not sure who you are. I don’t know how you grew up. I don’t know how educated you are or what culture you grew up in. However, I do know that people who have reached self actualization and are mature and responsible adults would never smash a phone in anger. That’s the kind of thing ignorant and irrational people do. The way he behaved is truly repulsive and abusive. I’m not surprised the girl is having issues with a father like that. I am surprised at how much time and energy you have spent defending him and that says a lot about you and what kind of behavior you consider acceptable. This man is not acting like a father. He’s acting like an enraged abusive boyfriend. The real issue is she’s behaving in a sexual manner and he feels entitled to control that and you think that’s defensible which makes me think you have some nasty views yourself.
