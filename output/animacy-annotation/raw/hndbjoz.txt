NTA; I am neurodivergent/autistic, and James does NOT get to speak for someone who is actually autistic, especially since I'm assuming he is neurotypical. It's also extremely demeaning, and automatically perpetuates the stereotype that autistic people are these unbridled, unaware, and irresponsible individuals that need "correcting." He's TA here
