I genuinely think if United just followed any random football fan's opinion on player and manager appointments they'd be doing a lot better than they are now. Literally everyone called on Ole being shit 3 years ago. Everyone here called out on United needing a defensive and central midfielder. Everyone called AWB being a shit RB when it comes to attacking ability.

It genuinely feels that United's upper management is just so isolated, unaware, and apathetic to football that any random armchair fan would do a much better job than they currently are.
