think of it like this, if it were real life and you were one of the characters watching Michael's shenanigans, it would probably be very uncomfortable and hard to watch. We know it's a tv show so it's funny, but Michael is so socially retarded and unaware that if he were a real person, he would be very hard to interact with or watch.
