I've had enough of your bullshit responses. You belittle me while elevating yourself above me. I ask a simple question which you still haven't answered. Your approach was to insinuate that I'm uninformed, ignorant and stupid. While making yourself appear fully  informed on covid and vaccines. What does it mater where I post. I happen to be a member of r/govermentoppression. It was also posted on my Twitter page, my Instagram page as well as my Facebook page. It was also posted on TikTok. At least I received reasonable answers from them. They actually read the post and stayed on subject. I'm done with you and your insults.  Goodbye.
