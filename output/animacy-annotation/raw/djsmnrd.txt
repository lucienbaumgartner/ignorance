In general, bureaucrats love unsolvable problems like this because they are a huge boon to government. They create problems to justify themselves and give themselves good reasons to spend all the money in their budget so it's there for them in the next year's budget. Also, as seen in the emails, Hillary wanted an "unaware and compliant" citizenry. If Muslims aren't unaware of what their national governments do and aren't compliant, as in sharia, I don't know who is.
