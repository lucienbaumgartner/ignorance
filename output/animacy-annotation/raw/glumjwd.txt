I interviewed at a major health provider for a tech related position. The position was a step up for me, but in the same field I was already in.... Get to the location, there was no lobby, no receptionist, and no signage. No phone number either. So I wander around until I eventually find the guy who is supposed to interview me. I had to ask random people until someone knew the name I was looking for. He was on the second floor, hanging out, seemingly unaware and unprepared to give an interview. The office they were in was "temporary" but it was the darkest, dingiest, most cramped office space I've seen. Each tiny cube had just enough space to rotate in your chair to get out of the cube (not a 360 rotation, more like 90 degrees) So the guy proceeds to try and find a place to "interview" me... no conference room available so he settles for the break room. People walking in and out, getting snacks, coffee, throughout the whole ordeal. One person stood around a bit eating yogurt while staring at us. After going through the basics he asks if I have any questions... so I start asking about what technology they use, how they organize data blah blah blah (I'm concerned about adapting to a new system). Every question I ask he replies with "what do you think we should do?" It was infuriating. He provided no substantive information and it was clear he didn't know... or he thought he was being tricky. I manage my own team now, have to deal with hiring and interviews. My company does all sorts of training and coaching for managers and even doing basic internet searches I've never seen "answer questions with the same question " as an effective interview tactic. I left feeling disappointed for wasting my time. Didn't bother sending a thank you letter for the interview. No opportunity lost. No bridge to burn.
