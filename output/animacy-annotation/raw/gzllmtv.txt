So now you're going to resort to ad-hominem attacks,

LOL are you really upset or even surprised someone would question your credibility with a username like TURKEYFUCKER?! 

If we're ending each comment with ironic ad-hominem after calling out ad-hominem: for someone so inconsiderate and unaware of other viewpoints/details, it's understandable you wouldn't consider how your username might affect your perceived credibility.

P.S I encourage others to do what they're most comfortable with. What a surprise you'd be against that (bonus ad-hominem for you)
