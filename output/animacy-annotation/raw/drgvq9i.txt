I'm missing integration. This is still viewing feelings as extraneous phenomenons. In my experience feelings are you. You in the most raw, primal form. Feelings are what you solely would be if you didn't have rational cognition.

You aren't having feelings because you are a player in a game with a narative. You are having feelings because you are instantly responding to the situation you are experiencing. Feeling miserable about having very little time before a deadline is you indicating to yourself that you can and should do better with your time management in the future. That it is in the form of feelings doesn't change anything about the validity of it.

Approaching your emotions as if they can be treated as a separate thing is causing most of our problems with emotions and feelings in the first place. If feelings are set apart as a separate thing and not as an integral part, it becomes to easy to ignore or suppress them. Feelings prompt us to action. Ignoring them makes us wander through life unaware and unmotivated.
