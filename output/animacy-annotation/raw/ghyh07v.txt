Mckinney falls state park is close to you has the homestead loop. It's a ~5 or so mile trail that's smooth and flowy. Can be busy with hikers so be cautious.

You could drop in to the Barton Creek greenbelt off south Lamar and crawl around trails back there. There can be some ledgy and very rocky terrain but there's also plenty of buff single track. Also lots of unaware and oblivious walkers and dogs off leash. Be cautious. 

There's also the South Austin trail network a bit further away that has over 80 miles of flat, rocky, twisty trails all rideable on a rigid bike.
