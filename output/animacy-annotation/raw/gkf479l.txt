If you weren't attempting to excuse this persons actions, why even bring up mental health in this context? How then is it any different to being selfish, deceitful or fraudulent? Are you really saying your just giving your own armchair diagnosis? Did ypu think this was a psychological treatment sub? 

People absolutely do harm themselves if it furthers their claims, to think otherwise is utterly naive and ignorant of reality. 

And i do hope tbat that's all this is, but i have my doubts...
