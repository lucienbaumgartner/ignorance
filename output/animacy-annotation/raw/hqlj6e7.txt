Yes, Sauron is deadlier than Durin's Bane. In fact, Sauron was the mightiest being in Middle-earth, far and large, by the time of the War of the Ring. There is a common stereotype that Sauron is bad at warfare and battles when statistically, all those battles he was either weakened from a previous intervention \[miracle interventions\] or wasn't thinking ahead enough \[he's quite prideful of himself\]. Balrogs are pathetic to Sauron's power, in reality, it's not A-B-C logic, it's a hierarchy, Sauron is a Great Maia, Balrogs only reach the middle-ground. 

It's not funny but seems correct to have Elendil and Gil-galad slay a Balrog. They are as much as warriors as Fingolfin and Húrin were. Despite the fact that Sauron was arguably not paying much attention to the fight, leaning on how his movements were in the entire battle, he was heading to Sammath-Naur, likely distracted and ignorant of what was going on around him. It's also implied that the warriors fought him on the slopes of Orodruin \[Mt. Doom\] remember that he **arrived in Barad-dur** so he must've **pushed back** the entire Last Alliance until he could no longer. Also the sword Narsil, at its greatest capacity, had a comparison somewhere to the Silmarils, so it was not a "normal sword" and Sauron was defeated unconventionally.

Sauron was either at his prime when he arrived and took the stronghold of Tol-Sirion **himself**, despite having Ulmo's power in the water, he defied it and waltzed in with no resistance. Or during the Akallabêth, when he took Númenor, and performed all those "surrenders" voluntarily, providing evidence he had complete control and power over the situation, not the opposite.
