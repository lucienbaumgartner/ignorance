&gt;So those with opposing views to yours are implicitly technically inept, politically unaware, and disengaged? 

Nope. That is not what I was inferring. 

It was simply identifying the demographic of the /r/australia user base and suggesting that its not a surprise that on the conservative/progressive spectrum that this medium of political discussion leans to the progressive side.

In much the same way that its not a surprise based on the demographics of the participants that AM radio talkback leans to the conservative side.

In both cases there is a natural tendency to lean one way or the other than is then accentuated, as more users seek out conversations with people of a similar ideology.
