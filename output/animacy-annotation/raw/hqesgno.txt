&gt; So there was no power dynamic in redlining? No power dynamic in slavery? No power dynamic with George Floyd? No power dynamic with discriminatory hiring and promoting practices?

Racism is a universal concept, you cannot define it by describing social dynamics that are specific to the United States, because they aren't present elsewhere.

&gt;Racist are constantly trying to reduce racism to people not liking… thereby giving them an out to be ignorant and dismissive. Just like you’re doing now.

You don't see the irony in this? You are using this nonsense definition of "power dynamic" to downplay your own racism and justify your hypocrisy.

&gt;Funny when caucasians try to educate blacks on racism and their own lived experience

See? This is the shit I'm talking about. You americans have racism ingrained in your brains. Every time you interact with someone else, you define that person firts and foremost by their "racial features" (which is an awful term that has basis in 19th century pseudo-science). White people here, black people there, asian people etc... 
How can you not be racist? 

And how is you implying that I cannot correct the incorrect things you say because I'm white, not racist? You are discriminating me because of the colour of my skin. The content of what I'm saying stays the same, regardless if I'm white, black, etc...

&gt;their own lived experience.

And the fact that you think that caucasians aren't racially discriminated is another problem.

Racism is not something limited to americans of african ancestry.
