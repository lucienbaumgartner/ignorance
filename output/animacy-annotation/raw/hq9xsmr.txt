&gt; Yes pressing the right arrow clearly posted beside the first picture is so confusing.

There isn't one on the normal Reddit website view.  It's just a tiny image that doesn't even indicate that they are separate image files.

Normal websites would indicate that there are multiple images clearly, and there would indeed be big arrows on the side so that you can move forward and backward through them.  Alas, Reddit designers chose to be more obscure.

And yes, it would be a whole lot better for everyone if Reddit actually designed things intuitively, but since they haven't yet done that, being aware of how a post looks to others can help you make a post that is a bit clearer with just a little effort. 

Or you can simply be confused and ignorant and not worry about how your future posts come across.

I'm just explaining the science, for you to use as you wish.  Learn from it, or not.
