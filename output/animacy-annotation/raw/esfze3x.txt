I'll answer your first point first. Say you're playing against AQ, and you kill all the drones that either Consumygal and Swarmygal spawn from AQs passive. By now you have 3 charges on AQ and you use them then drop your Glustyworp. Tadaaaa, you are now the proud owner of a 9 point Glusty, which is definitely not what you want, but has been known to happen, unfortunately for me. I simply mentioned a 9 power Glustyworp but it could easily be a 9 power Brewess after devouring a Harpy Egg or a Foglet. The point wasn't about the cards, it was about the power level of the cards. To swoop in and potentially steal a 9 point power card from your opponent is huge, as after beta cards are regularly held at around 3-4 power.  As i mentioned before, Tall removal simply takes a tall unit out of the game and into the graveyard, while Seize actually TAKES that big unit and gives it to you. How is that not a massive swing?

On to your second point. You think that simply challenging your narrow view, where you condescendingly boiled it down to simple maths without considering all the other factors at play which I mentioned in my previous answer, means that I didn't read your post and that I'm "disgustingly disrespectful and ignorant". That seems rather overzealous, don't you think? Especially when you don't really provide a counter-argument to the points I provided.  
And yes, it is incredibly easy to get 9 coins, hence why we have the Hoard archetype. I've listed a few ways already so I won't bother with more, but playing the game for the last two days has shown a variety of lesserknown ways to gain coins.

Feel free to address any of the points I've brought up, and I might be inclined to discuss further with you. Or I might just call you disgustingly disrespectful and ignorant, because this is the internet in all it's glory.
