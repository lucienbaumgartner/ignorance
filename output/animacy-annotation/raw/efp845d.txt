I think you like to lie to yourself and pretend people aren't ignorant of how weight loss works, and because it's mean to call fat people lazy and ignorant that it must not be true. 

Many fat people are indeed too lazy to make the change that would have them slim in a years time. Many fat people get discouraged when they lose a ton of water weight the first week then lose much less the next week so they think "why even bother" and continue to be a pig.
