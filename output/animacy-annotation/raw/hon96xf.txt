Explain to me why 80 million Americans are so uneducated and ignorant that they cant even for a second appreciate how fucked up the gun crisis is in your “country”. And would rather start a war and kill millions than give up their fun boom sticks. 

I mean they’ve been relentlessly brainwashed for generations by gun manufacturers, to regurgitate the same worn out and irrelevant “right to bear arms” horseshit. 

So i guess its not entirely their fault, but nonetheless theres plenty of opportunities for them to learn why that shit is so utterly deceitful and ridiculous so they’re still dumb pieces of shit imo. 

And before you start with the typical “the constitution isn’t horseshit, people died to protect that blah blah” bs, think about the fact that the reason it hasn’t been updated for so long to fit modern technology and ideologies. Is because all the gun manufacturers are making so much money from supplying tools of death to your citizens, that they got all the politicians in on it . And now your holy constitution is being and has been used for almost a century as a marketing slogan to sell more guns making the rich richer and keeping the poor powerless. 

You do realize some rednecks with guns dont stand a sliver of a chance against a tyrannical US government. A couple F-16s or warthogs could probably handle all of them combined. Bearing arms doesn’t mean you’ll protect yourself, you’ll just force the hand of your imaginary tyrannical leader and end up hunted and killed or just straight up firebombed. 

This isn’t the wild west, getting a couple of loonies together with pitchforks really wont do all that much in the way of toppling the government. 

“Right to bear arms” but inability to use braincells. The US is such a fucking joke you guys seriously need to sort your shit out, the rest of the world is laughing at you.
