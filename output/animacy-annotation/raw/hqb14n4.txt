Maybe these people should mock Italian opera as well. If something is not familiar to you, learn about it. Oh, I forgot that people are somewhat too lazy, ignorant and racist to even think about what's appropriate before posting.

As a Asian, I really appreciate that they put in traditional elements into the game. It shows how much they care about the details. Nobody is forcing you to play Yunjin, if you don't like it, then just don't pull for her or build her. Remember,  it's a CHINESE game developed by CHINESE developers. Feel free to go play something else for your liking if ONE character annoys the hell out of you.
