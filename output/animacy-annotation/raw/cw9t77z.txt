You know know what, I actually believe them when they think it's a relatively innocent joke. I don't think they thought "let's sexually assault" someone. I do, however, think they're so ridiculously stupid and unaware that it probably took an adult/empathetic functioning human being to tell them why what they had done was a bad thing.

Bewildering stupidity is no excuse, obviously. But fuck me it just makes the species look bad that there is a portion of society who ignorantly/"innocently" don't see why this is bad, because have no skills in empathy and have never known anyone to go through any real trauma. I'm starting to think that there needs to be a few hours a year in social studies that tell kids "putting things in orifices and touching genitalia is considered sexually invasive. Never, ever do it to any gender, unless they invite you to", because I do believe that they didn't think this was actually an assault.

Not sure if I've made my point all that well.
