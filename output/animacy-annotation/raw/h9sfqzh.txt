I just don’t think being against racism and bigotry is a political issue, either you’re a good person or a bad person 🤷🏽‍♀️ thats just how I feel. When I think of politics I think like labelling myself “left wing” “centre left” “communist” “socialist”. I don’t have the mental capacity to deal with the intricacies of such labels so I just don’t be a cunt. Politics is far more complex than the few social issues I have a better understanding of. I think it would be stupid and ignorant of me to go around toting a label when I don’t actually thoroughly understand politics as a whole.
