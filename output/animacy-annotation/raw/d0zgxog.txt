I don't think people can quite anticipate - even based on CivTemp - how different 3.0 will be drama-wise compared to previous iterations. 

Foreign policy is one of the easiest aspects of politics to trip on, and its role will be massively magnified in such a small world with an even bigger playerbase. On 2.0 people only had to deal with their immediate neighbours, if even them, and just mind their own business and internal stability but now there will be multiple groups setting up within shouting distance of each other. For the unaware and unprepared, the game will be hard.

We'll see a lot more of similar stuff happening, especially with the flow of new people that will (hopefully) only increase, even without people like eeshaw. The potential for manipulating new people unaware of the subreddit is huge, and will definitely be tempting for even less malevolent people.
