There's plenty of people who are ready and willing to engage in some PvP in several community PvP hotspots. When I'm in the mood to battle another player, I go there to look for challenging fights against prepared opponents. 

The fact that some people choose only to attack unaware and unprepared players who have already been worn down by the mobs is very telling, I think.
