&gt;Ah, still illiterate and ignorant of history:

Awwww little gamethug - are you still pissed over how much of a moron you looked like in our last discussion? :) LOL. 

The quote proves my point nicely. 

when did the dawson shooting happen? Oh yeah - september 13, 2006. When did this statement happen? September 16.  

So first part confirmed, i said this was in the public uproar after dawson. 

And what does it say? they will CONSIDER if these weapons are appropriate. Its on the table. It will be discussed. Harper and the rest of the CPC agreed. 

that was their statement after the shooting. Everything will be discussed. All changes to the laws are on the table. That was the official CPC response to the shooting. 

And nothing happened. 

Exactly as i said.  

thanks for proving me right again :)   I appreciate your willingness to look like a moron for my benefit!
