Someone was yelling at me about how they wanted America to burn and they were an ultra leftist so obviously they would want Trump to win to cause more suffering in America on a political sub.  They found a completely different and unrelated sub comment where I said I occasionally get into fights on Reddit and have to go back and read it again to figure out what someone is arguing with me about.

Apparently, this person thinks I must have autism because of how crazy I am, because I occasionally get into fights on reddit.

I was in awe of how stupid and unaware that person must be.  But, that is reddit for you.
