Perhaps you should reread OPs original post?

She believes saying a particular word is against her faith. Ted didn’t just say the word himself - he put her in a position where she had to say that word, on a regular basis, in direct conflict with her personal beliefs. And he insisted on doing it even after she explained how it affected her.

She tried to find a way around it, and her friends then complained about that solution. They all believe she should just ‘get over’ her personal issues because they don’t share them. 

This was never a case of ‘someone said something I found offensive and I wouldn’t let it go.’

I appreciate your sentiments, but I still believe you are wrong, and unaware of how your opinion is coloured by the religious aspect. Your stance - that people should suck it up and let things go, even when those things occur in what should be safe spaces and are perpetrated by people who have been educated about them - runs counter to most civil rights movements and is very outdated. The fact that you, personally, are happy to let some things go does not mean anyone else should follow suit. To use your own words - ‘the world does not revolve around you’, and it is not your job to set the line others should walk by.

Also…I never resorted to ad hominem attacks. Ad hominem means attacking the writer of an argument in a way that ignores the central point of the argument. I called you out because I think your argument relies entirely on your internal prejudice that pain caused for religious reasons isn’t as valid as pain caused for other reason. Pain is pain, and no one has the right to tell others when something meets the criteria of things they are allowed to be upset by.
