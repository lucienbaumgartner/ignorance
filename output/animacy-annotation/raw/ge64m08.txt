This is very true. They are too self-aware of their image now. One of the best attributes of a housewife in the beginning was their lack of awareness in general -but social media's popularity and influence has made even the most naturally unaware and non-introspective housewife super aware of how the public sees them and it changes what they want to reveal on the show.   


I kind of wish we could find a few gems who don't even have social media and put it in their contract not to use it. Pay them a little extra to make up for the lack of sponsorships/ads. It would make for a more genuine show.
