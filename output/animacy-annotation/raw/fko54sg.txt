We had this discussion in a film class on Central Asia.

I agree with a lot of people here, it's a funny and enjoyable film that highlights and ridicules Americans. Like I get it, Americans are so dumb and ignorant that they can't tell one post-Soviet country from another (filmed in Romania). However, it's at the expense of Kazakhstan, and for many people it's their only exposure to the nation, and CA as a whole. Borat was also released in 2006, when the nations were all still young and developing. For many people the crude depictions of Borat are the only thing they can associate with a country rich in history and culture. Not great for western consciousness, but on the other hand, keeps annoying tourists away I suppose!

My only other issue is that the little Romanian village is [still steeped in poverty](https://youtu.be/ywzQectJ_P0), yet their people are portrayed as backwards hillbillies, collectively mislabeling Romanians and Kazakhstanis. That neglect and lack of compassion for people enduring genuine hardship, well, makes it just that much less enjoyable for me.
