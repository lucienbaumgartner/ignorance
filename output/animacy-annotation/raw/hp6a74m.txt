well he never really left his office where he gamed. id beg him to just not game one day or night and be with me. he would get so mad . responses like: “why are you trying to control me, you just don’t like my friends” . i love his friends. hes had five monitors at his desk. would flip out if
i brought up how concerned i was that he wasn’t getting sunlight or standing up out of his chair. he played for most on our honeymoon. at the hospital. when we got home. i have never seen him take care of our daughter and focus on her. since day one she would just watch him play on his phone or computer. i dont know a single thing about games but i guess he played lots of online multiplayer stuff . stuff i felt really uncomfortable with our daughter watching. im not looking for a solution. up until last night i missed him so much i forgot how painful it was. genuinely believed it was my fault for not “accepting him for “ who he is. he would often say that to him. i thought i must have just been awful and unaware of how awful i was and thats why he had to escape. i didnt know there were others out there that experienced this and accepted it as real. do i
live under a rock? probably
