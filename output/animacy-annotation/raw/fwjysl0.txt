Itâ€™s pretty racist and ignorant that you blindly assume all Native Americans were killed and drove off their lands. If you took any time to do some reading about Canadian history you can read that a lot of First Nations in Canada were not defeated.  A large number signed treaties so that future Canadians could live in their lands.
