There’s such a tragic beauty to how both Johnson and Scott’s characters are both victims of amnesia and are both assigned identities by organizations that are using them in a larger game. Both are connected by the same condition and yet are unaware and unable to help each other, instead trying desperately to make sure the other thinks they know who they are and what is happening.

Just one aspect of this gorgeous mess of a film that I love.
