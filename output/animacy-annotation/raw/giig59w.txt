I don’t necessarily think she was faking being suicidal. She got a lot of hate on social media and I can understand why she would have felt like it would be better for her family if she weren’t in the picture. The pressure and scrutiny she was put under for a lack of judgement was enormous. I would imagine every person on this sub has said it done something so stupid and ignorant that they wish they could take it back. The only difference is, we aren’t on national television to be judged.
