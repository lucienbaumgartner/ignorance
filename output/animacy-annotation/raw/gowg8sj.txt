I predict they'll assign untrained and ignorant of the process people to do the audit.  They'll scream unfair from the very beginning because they'll be having to count the dreaded mail in or overseas military ballots.  Checking signatures they'll question everyone that did or didn't include a middle name or perhaps made it an initial.  They'll question whether the "i"'s got dotted.  Their whole purpose will be to gum up the process and place doubt on the results.  They don't want clarity they want chaos.
