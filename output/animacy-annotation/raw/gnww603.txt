It's not a strawman. If you think that the workers can't own the means of production and the state has to do it then you don't trust the workers or their abilities and you just want capitalism. Like, take Cuba for example, it's remained capitalist since the revolution yet it's been under embargo since then and the US has launched multiple attacks on their leadership so what reason do they have to keep control away from the workers? You can't call yourself a socialist and seriously think that a) the workers are productive or capable enough to own the means of production and b) think that a capitalist state will willingly give up capitalism eventually. If you think this is a strawman then you're either incredibly naive and ignorant of your positions or are trying to obfuscate the issue.
