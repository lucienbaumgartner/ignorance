\&gt;The Bible says as it was in the days of Noah, it will be in the end....

This is much too often parroted in YouTube comment sections. I used to eat that like candy. People like L.A. Marzulli, Missler et al. kept repeating this line to their followers, but does it refer to the watchers intermingling with humans like in Genesis? That's a huge stretch. I've become more pragmatic. Jesus, who indeed said it will be like the days of Noah, gave context.

&gt;Matthew 24:37-39  
&gt;  
&gt;But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

It's clearly referring to people being unaware of Gods coming judgement. Eating, drinking, partying, marrying, basically just living their lives and not thinking about God. Sure, the Nephilim were there in those days as well, but it's conjecture to say that's included in the end of times as well. The point is, people are just living their lives unaware and careless about the return of Christ. Depravity and degeneracy is on the rise and one could argue there's a decline of morality, just like in those days. Though one would say some would be very aware after 7 years of tribulation... but that's another topic.

Concerning Enoch, I'm skeptical as well. It's a fascinating book and it reads like ancient fan fiction really. It's not included in the canon for a reason. Peter and Jude refer to it, but that only means that.... people read books. At any rate, if another set of watchers tries to intermingle again, I don't see why not. They have free will after all, but the 200 original watchers are chained in tartarus. Might be enough of a warning to keep the idea of trying it again out of others' minds.
