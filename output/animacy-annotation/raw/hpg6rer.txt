Decently written and an enjoyable read. Reminds me of those Serena Joy-centric scenes in Handmaid’s Tale. And the ‘she-cession’ is very real and happening in most of the family groups in my extended family, and it’s turned a few wives and mothers towards the right in odd ways. Educated, open-minded people turning ignorant and conservative.
