His original apology was trash, he hasn't displayed any personal growth or shown that he has learnt anything at all, and his apology on the reunion was even worse than the first one.

Additionally, he hasn't specifically acknowledged his homophobic and anti-Asian racist comments, or apologised for these. Everything's been very deliberately kept so vague and swept under the rug.

He said on the reunion: "I'm an adult now \[deliberately misleading; he was an adult at the time\] and I cringe even thinking that I said those things ... We live in a generation now, where saying some things, even if you are of that culture, is just frowned upon."

a) He was 19. He was an adult. I don't know about you, but I can't imagine having said things this hateful and ignorant that that age.

b) "even if you are of that culture" is problematic in more than one way. One, it \*deliberately\* glosses over his homophobic and anti-Asian racist tweets. Two, it's clear from one of his tweets (the third one in the list below), that at that time he \*didn't\* consider himself "of that culture." It's again \*deliberately\* misleading to say that "saying some things, even if you are of that culture, is frowned upon" when his words were that it "upset" him that the N word is "not allowed to be said unless you are black" because it was his favourite word.

c) "We live in a generation now" - not that much has changed between 2011/2 and now. It wasn't ok then, and this is just another blatant attempt to make people think what he said wasn't that bad.

Here's his tweets, anyway:

"Something about Asians that just makes me want to punch them in the suck hole"

"Why when Mexicans laugh on the cyber web, they go "jajajajaja". Im gunna start doing that.."

"It upsets me that the word n---a is not allowed to be said unless you are black because quite honestly it's my favorite word. N--GGGAAAAAA"

"Theres this girl I see everyday@school,she looks just like the girl from the movie precious&amp;I'm not just saying this Cuz she's big and black"

"When is Justin Bieber going to realize that saying n---a and cussing and having big booty bitches in his songs is the cool thing to do #queer"

"When I'm up in the gym I just have bouncin on my di\*\* by tyga on repeat my n---a." \[asterisks are is, dashes are mine\]

"My girlfriend needs to wake up from her nap! @ jillianleee wake up Lil n---a!"

"They say money make a n---a act n---a rich but atleaast the n---a, n---a rich."

"Real n---a say word"
