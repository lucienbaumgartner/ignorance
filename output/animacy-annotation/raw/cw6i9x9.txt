Either Â£65 for Street Fighter 2 The World Warrior and then the same on Turbo Hyper Fighting on Super Nintendo when I was young and unaware that Capcom are really into re-releasing the same game slightly tweaked just after the initial release or...whatever ridiculous sum I paid to a wise eBayer who knew what he had at the peak of the hype of importing Japanese PSPs into England because it came with all of the things needed at the time to play homebrew. This was before custom firmwares.
