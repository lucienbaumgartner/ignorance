I’m a 4w5 and as shameful as it is to admit, I’ve done the same thing to guys in the past. Not my proudest moments in life. It seems like she’s in a pretty unaware and unhealthy place, so best advice I can give to your friend is to be honest with her about the way she is making him feel and then distance himself from her. Honesty and facts tend to put out the emotional turmoils us 4’s get ourselves into. She’s more than likely going to get defensive when he confronts her, but I think afterwards she will get the memo and stop contacting him. It’s going to take some strength and courage, but I sense your friend has it in him.
