I don't think there is anything to be excited for. Right now, you are alive. You can think, you can love, you can find pleasure, you can make art, you can accomplish things. When you're dead, what do you think will happen? Someone will come from stage left and explain everything? I think not. I think you will simply be gone, not a person any more, just gone. Not black, not "frozen" or asleep, just completely unaware and nonexistent.
