Then you're an embarrassment to the rest of us Asian Americans.  Christ, we owe Black people the world for every right we have as POC and it's a fudging shame that's enabled so many of us to be so horrifically ignorant and unaware of what's going on around us.  Police are NOT your friend, even if they arent always out for murder.  Even acting annoyed over a quota ticket is a luxury your friend does not have as a Black person.  Getting slapped with more fines than a friendly-looking white person for the same offense purely because of unconscious racial bias isnt all fun and dandy either, even if they DO get to walk away with their life.

East Asians fancy themselves white-adjacent and regularly discriminate against not only other races but other darker ethnicities.  A college education didnt stop the Chinese SanFran rave bro from telling me and the other "jungle asians" to stop talking our dirty language.  I'm gonna guess you still think your handful of lunchbox moments when you were young was the pinnacle of American racism.
