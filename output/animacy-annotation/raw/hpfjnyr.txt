&gt;I mean, being ignorant, filthy and needy is more based on how you bring them up.

It's not.  All kids are born fully ignorant to the world.  All kids have needs for food/shelter/water/entertainment/education/etc...  All kids are filthy, mainly because they're ignorant and uncoordinated. 

&gt; If you chuck a child in a shit household the child is gonna mostly be like the parents

Sure.
