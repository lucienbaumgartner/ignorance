&gt; Lolol still 8x less cases than NY. Epicenter my ass.

....Did you not learn about exponential growth in school? COVID spreads very fast, as in it grows exponentially. This means that Florida can potentially outpace NYC. 

&gt; Still no risk for anyone under 50.

[Wrong yet again!](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/04/13/covid-young-people). Even if that wasn't true, Florida is a retiree state, meaning they can get way more fatalities than other states. 

Seriously, you have gotten every single fact wrong. I'm just doing this for fun because you are so stubborn and ignorant that it's kind of comical.
