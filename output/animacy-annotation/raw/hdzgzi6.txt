I get it. It's also part of the reason why the outrage feels empty. Calling him papa mochi, ally to kpop, a trusted western host/celebrity, when he's always been an asshole is a bit shallow. There were some major blinders on. His role in The Prom where he portrayed a gay man and leaned into gay stereotypes and was bordering homophobic was in 2020.

It just isn't the move to hold him to high regard and esteem but be unaware and ignorant of his very open and public behaviors.
