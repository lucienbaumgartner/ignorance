I had basically this exact same experience. I'm decently secure but became Avoidant for a while due to trauma from abuse as a teenager. Once I dealt with that stuff, I had great relationships.

My last one of 6 months, the guy was so stunted, unaware and emotionally abusive, it was scary. He demanded/begged for us to be friends instead and saw no errors in his behavior. I walked away. He was a time waster and I was tired of it.
