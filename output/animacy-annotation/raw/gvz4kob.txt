Oh so your situation is like drastically different. Your post makes more sense now.

I wouldn't call your break up bad then, it's good ending?
Alot of people on this subbredit have like bad breakups and that's when I agree that like reaching out shouldn't even be a factor.

I will say, with reaching out and staying in contact with an ex ..for me at least, I wouldn't put my future realtionships through that, bc there is that connection and in your case your actively keeping your feelings alive for your ex... And I wouldn't want to cause a mess/heart ache like that for future people (it's not fair really)

But your situation makes sense after you explained it...and how you would like to reach out when things are less messy to get back together...bc it sounds more of a break than a break up.

We are totally different positions, like my ex reaches out religiously to me (the dumper) every few months and it upsets me bc I know who they are. I always ignore, bc I'm on a different path and could never see myself with someone so negative and unaware of people's feelings for their selfish needs
