Yes, this is it. People like her could be and often have been completely apathetic and unaware of politics in general because they have comfortable, easy lives and they think it's boring and are too dumb understand it anyway. But there is obviously something missing in her life that she's attracted to this crazy shit because it makes her feel like a part of something and has made her feel like a victim somehow. You'd think her church and her family and community would give her that fulfillment but I guess not.
