Excellent response. These times are unlike any other in history. The forces of darkness seem to have more power nowadays than ever before. These evil forces work with whatever is at there disposal in this world and they are limited by the minds and hearts of individual persons, human ingenuity, laws, and so many different things. 

I believe they love these days even more, because there are an abundance of people whose souls are unsaved. There were far less people back then. When it comes to America specifically, the freedom and carefree lifestyle with the technology and the many conveniences that people enjoy are but a plus to these forces and if anything, better for them that millions of people do well in this life the lose their soul. As long as they remain distracted and unaware that God is real and that their soul is in jeopardy. 

In essence, the country is but a vessel or a machine to real in as many people as possible into hell. The large majority of which will never see it coming.

I believe America will play a major role in the establishment of the diabolical new/one world order. Rampant sexually deviated and depraved thoughts and actions, confusion and lies surrounding gender, nonsense such as debates and court cases surrounding the idea of allowing someone born male to use a bathroom or lockeroom for females and vice versa, the bringing together of religions ( and particularly the blotting out and corruption of biblical doctrine, like for example the new age counterfeit Christ called Matreya), sexual images involving unmarried heterosexual couples  as well as gay/lesbian sexual relations and parenting portrayed in television and movies, Luciferian/Babylonian/Masonic imagery and subliminal messaging in tv, movies, music, music videos, on the dollar bill, and in video games, are among the many things that point towards this new world order that is to come.

Do not be surprised as to what is going on right now.
