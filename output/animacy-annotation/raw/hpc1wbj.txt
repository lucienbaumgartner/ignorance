yeah what we need is more tiers on our gutted universal-but-only-sometimes healthcare system. letâ€™s also stop providing care to athletes injured on the field, smokers with lung cancer, and all the fatties with heart disease, they knew what they were signing up for!

what an ignorant and narcissistic take to suggest denying people care (care that they also pay for!!) so you can ride your high-horse to the bar. a circuit breaker like this is literally the only way to stop community spread, unless you know of some secret vaccine that prevents the inoculated from spreading the virus
