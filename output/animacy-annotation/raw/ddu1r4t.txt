I keep seeing things like this and I have to say it everytime; your neighbors are not your enemy.  The amount of social engineering being conducted is staggering and the unaware and compliant populace is largely not to blame.  Violent factions like Antifa are enemies of the state.  Corrupt politicians are enemies of the state.  Funders and organizers of domestic terror are enemies of the state.  Rogue intelligence officers are enemies of the state.  Manbun-wearing hippie morons are not.  The masses are salavageable, but not if we polarize like this.
