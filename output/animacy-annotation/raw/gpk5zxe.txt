Perhaps it's the 10 months from March until January we sat here and dealt with republican majority rule and how incompetent and downright evasive it was in dealing with issue this thread in particular is addressing and to see members of that party shit on the dem party 2 months in because they haven't got their 1400 dollar check yet is embarrassing. 

It's embarassing to me to see the Republicans so obtuse and ignorant that getting 1400 in 2 months almost completely match the 1800 the Republicans gave them in literslly less than 1/3rd the time in charge and have the nerve to bitch about it as if the Republicans aren't dragging them when while in minority is horse shit .

You know what you're doing and it ain't gonna go unchecked.
