Thank you for your reply! Your suggestion is precisely what I ended up doing, so I thoroughly enjoyed reading it haha! 

From what I gather, the reader seemed to be very taken aback by certain issue that were discussed in my fanfic. Not necessarily the way they were addressed, but rather just the fact that they were addressed at all. Things like bullying, abusive parents, and the absurd. I don’t think there’s anything special about my story; tags were the usual: angst, suicide mention, etc, but still, the reader explained that they they felt “unarmed and unaware that this would be emotional suicide for me. I just hate this, and I really want to die.” 

Apparently it wasn’t the ending in itself, but rather the fact that such a sad story could even exist in the first place. I’d like to believe this person was simply young, and happened to run into themes that were hard for them to cope with. 
But still I think it’s an interesting discussion, how much responsibility do we choose to have.

Ultimately what I realized is that this person is in pain, for whatever reason, and even if I won’t be held responsible for the effects of my story, I can still reach out and let this person know that through this story there’s communication. We share how we feel, and that in turns makes us feel less alone, and there’s beauty in that. 

I think it all worked out just fine in the end. Thanks again for dropping a line!
