I agree about hating the "someone is starving in africa" comparative minimisation bullshit but claiming to have ptsd over what is a very light form of cheating with a guy your still with is alot to handle and I would be severely questioning any possibility of a actual diagnosis.. she can be deppressed and have anxiety and all that but actual ptsd ? 

I believe it could defintly happen from cheating but I would think it would be less about the act and emotional cheating but the lying and manipulation and possible gasslighting that would mess you up.

Also even if cheating counts as trauma and even if something this mild on the cheating spectrum is enough to count as trauma there is alot more to ptsd then just suffering through a traumatic even or being lied to by a partner and experiencing depression, anxiety and mistrust.

If anything in this situation would cause ptsd I imagine it would be the staying with the guy through choice or lack of however if she knows what oop went through and still choose to "trauma" dump on her and call it ptsd then that is incredibly fucked up.

I don't do the comparative bullshit on either side but usually with friends that no what I and others have gone through and have struggles themselves  usually find it really hard to see and talk about there trauma or diagnosis because they minimise it themselves and I have to convince them it's okay to be messed up over it and get help and take it seriously and talk about it with others including and maybe especially those who have had it worse in appropriate ways.

Suffering isn't about having it worse then everyone but about going through what isn't okay, 

However not being able to handle people over dramatising minor everyday immature drama (not insulting but it was normal age appropriate drama while I was living a whole different world and it was because I didn't judge I could see it wasn't health for anyone to be around to much and neither could provide support the other needed ) is the reason from a young child I couldn't hang with people my age it would either be young kids in a baby sitting role a few as messed up as me and those in there twenties and thirties+,  I "aged" out of being able to be around teenagers from like 14 and I'm only just at 25 being able to connect with my peers.

If she is still suffering from intense and severe ptsd, health struggles and loss of life it defintly isn't appropriate to be around someone who might be a little to self absorbed to see how not the act of sharing her pain but her way of expressing it is causing deep pain .

The other girl might not always be selfish and unaware and she may be genuinely truly suffering over this and need help without exadurating and working through stuff intensely with responsibility in therapy including bringing up other stuff she isn't ready to share but it's not a healthy match for anyone and if there is desire for the friendship to work through it she needs to take it seriously how she is effecting others.
