Oh I recently played my T29 out and was just farming Kingtigers. I got between 6 and 12 kills every match in RB. The Maus-grinders were real. Completely blind and unaware of the American Heavy sitting there. Driving across the open, stopping in the middle of the field, pushing around a corner in a straight line so I got plenty of time to shoot their side while their turret is still behind the building. And not one tried to shoot my lower plate. 

Don't get me wrong, the T29 is a very good tank and every pen is a one-shot with 200g of explosive. But I never had *that* many kills in it and I owned it when it was still 6.7.
