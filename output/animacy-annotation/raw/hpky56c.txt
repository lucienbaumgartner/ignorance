This is the other part of this problem, America, for the most part, thinks it's amazing.

It's not that there's nothing good or to be appreciated about the country, but without perspective and self-reflection, change for the better is far less likely. Having lived in the US for a few years, I've never seen such a level of ignorant and frequent self-congratulations.
