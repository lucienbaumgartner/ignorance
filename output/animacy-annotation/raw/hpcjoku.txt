I saw a tiktok today that put shit like this in perspective for me. They explained how purity culture and the concept of “innocence” and ignorance about sex and submission all are just encouraging p*dophilia, abuse, and r*pe. If people don’t know what sex or masturbation or anything like that is, then they won’t know that what’s happening is wrong. It contributes to p*edophilia because now the “perfect woman” is a child- innocent, ignorant, and submissive. Makes me sick. The transformed wife was written by a man.
I’ll post the link to the tiktok in a comment below if anyone is interested
