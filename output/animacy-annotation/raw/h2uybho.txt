I took a side gig in when I was in graduate school teaching nursing courses so I do know their curriculum. Youâ€™re way too cocky and ignorant of the world and I will not further entertain you. Maybe consider why nurses have to pass a basic dosage calculations test their first semester to not be dropped. I know many intelligent nurses and I would not refer to them for vaccine knowledge. Just beyond real the stance you take. /ignore and go away back.
