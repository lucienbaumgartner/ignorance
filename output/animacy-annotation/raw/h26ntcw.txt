I've been living in this hellscape since '05 as a Supernatural fan. I understand the idea of shipping and why it's fun. I also understand queerbating and why it's bad. But sometimes two dudes are just emotionally vulnerable with each other and constantly making that out to equal homosexuality is disengenuous, toxic for men in general who are already discouraged from being overly expressive, and ignorant of the rest of a characterization.
