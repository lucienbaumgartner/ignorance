What is the “it” that should be a part of the energy arsenal? LFTRs are necessary in India because they have no uranium supplies (it’s just an oddity of how the geology played out) but that’s not really a problem for anyone else. Fuel supply isn’t really an issue. No one (India exception) _needs_ thorium right now to power nuclear reactors. 

Gate’s startup’s (TerraPower, btw) reactor design uses solid fuel and liquid metal coolant (for the ignorant: not a LFTR). Their traveling wave reactor could conceivably breed/use thorium but it also doesn’t have to. Their current (closest to being built) design with GE will be uranium powered... because it works. 

Go back to your weird YouTube hole where everyone agrees with you. What you’re saying just makes you sound sheltered and ignorant of the real nuclear tech that’s going to make a difference in our lifetimes
