Uhh... I do know “what happened” because I just read it? Like tf? Lmao. 

Yeah, I don’t know “his side”. Very well could be he didn’t realize, very very unlikely though. 

Only people excusing this shit is people who excuse the bullshit they do when they drink and “blame it on the alcohol” like they are totally unaware and incapable of controlling their actions. I drink, been drunk, passed out. Never once have I excused shifty behavior because I was drunk. I did something shitty while drunk. Was a shit person. Not the alcohol. 

And yeah, OPs a shitty human too. Shouldn’t be drinking to the point of being black out drunk to begin with.
