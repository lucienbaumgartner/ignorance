Or your views are so obviously backwards, misogynistic, over the top judgemental to the point of dehumanizing others, belittling, and ignorant that multiple people associate you with types of human beings who fit that MO like incels. Everyone else is wrong but not you... 

You have a long life ahead of you kid. In the United States Americans don't smoke marijuana at nightclubs, there is guaranteed way to be thrown out than that at 99% of establishments because they will lose their liquor/alcohol licenses, and only a small percentage of people do cocaine in general.

If a person abuses drugs to the point it impacts their relationships and can't give it up, they are the very definition of addicts. Not ever person who smokes marijuana and drinks alcohol is some disgusting "abuser" of drugs and addict. That is a very ignorant and unenlightened view of others. At your tender age, if you decide to not drink or do drugs that is fine, but don't fool yourself for a second into thinking you are better than or not as "nasty" and "disgusting" as a person who does.
