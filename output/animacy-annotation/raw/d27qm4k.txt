&gt; that tells me hes Slow or dumb

Wrong on both counts. Smaug was arrogant, and unaware that *ONE SCALE WAS MISSING ON HIS CHEST* and Bard was also *a really fucking good archer who knew of Smaug's one weak spot.*

&gt; The movies are canon

Not even close. Unless you are specifically using the Jackson-Film version of LOTR+The Hobbit. Its like Marvel, the Universe 616 Comics are the "official" canon Comics, while the MCU films are a completely seperate Marvel universe. 

&gt; either way smaug died by a MAN, and he will die by another MAN which is GUTS The demon slayer, Monster slayer, 100 man slayer, which at this point guts can kill more than 100 more like 500 swordsmen. 

Again, titles mean nothing. A random scrub human from the SuggsVerse could 10/10 stomp any omnipotent god from Marvel or DC.

Plus, if Smaug is flying, HOW THE HELL CAN GUTS HIT HIM? Smaug can just fly 50 feet in the air and bathe the area in flames until Guts dies.
