Take them back where? They've snuck through France to get on boats, you can't just pick them up and drop them back off in France and say "here, you deal with them". They're not "allowed" into France any more than they are the UK.

This is the classic approach of throwing ideas out whilst being completely oblivious and ignorant of the complexity of international relations and foreign policy.

&gt; If the Navy cant do that then sadly some lifes will be lost to overall lower boat crossings and drop deaths overall.

Can you try this one again in English please? Maybe you could find a migrant to help you with it.
