why are you talking about the treatment when the point is they are Different XD 
you can’t even lie correctly, if you were actually working in the field you would have led with that, and you didnt. you are so stupid, ignorant, and egotistical you really think there’s something to argue about here when they’re Different. Google is free and thats not the only article that says it! fucking moron. 
i half believe you bc its always nurses or ppl who lie about being nurses who think bringing up their years of experience counts for anything in a medical discussion. so glad you claim to have been spraying bedpans for x amount of days but meth and amphetamine are two different things. moron
