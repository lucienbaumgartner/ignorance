Ok, that's not anyway comparable to Frieza and Tagoma like at all; in addition, you're making stuff up. Gohan wasn't just riding off zenaki boost nowhere is that hinted at, let alone, even invented until early Namek. Piccolo was his actual training partner, hence, the reason why he left Gohan in the wilderness for those 6 months to condition him for the real training. And can be evidently seen through his use of flight, ki sense, martial arts, and ki blast; whereas, before he was completely incapable and unaware of those things. Not to mention, the relationship at the time was more of a mentor and student so the training was more so for Gohan than it was Piccolo, further pushed by the fact that Piccolo wanted to bring out Gohan's latent abilities. So, saying Piccolo was just kicking his ass the whole time would be the farthest thing from the truth, and Gohan was literally at a power level of "1", of course, he would get thousands of times stronger he had the most to gain, on top of that, he was already prodigy, to begin with. Including the fact that he trained for almost 3 years with Piccolo, while Frieza couldn't even get half a year in and springboarded all the way to God level [by essentially just torturing somebody.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/82ab30f49522bb8390ea67e086f5b798/tumblr_phtb1rTFPt1xhldrao8_500.gifv)
