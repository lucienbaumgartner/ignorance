&gt; i have no idea what you’re even saying anymore. oh by the way did you hear in san francisco if you go to the theater to see a play you need picture id and proof of vaccination? 

No but I heard something similar to this in NYC. Did you know in 1905 SCOTUS ruled that States can mandate compulsory vaccinations of citizens?

&gt;yet the liberals think id for voting is racist!

More accurately I think they know that previous successful voter suppression efforts were tailored around racial lines.

&gt;to see a show id is mandatory! but to to vote?!

Maybe it's different in your Canadian home but in the US you have no legal right to see a show. Because of this when courts look at laws that affect seeing an entertainment show they use the Rational Basis standard for review. As opposed to Medium Scrutiny or Strict Scrutiny which is used for things a person has the legal right to do.

&gt;lunatics who don’t care for democracy. and all for one thing, to stuff the ballots in their favour with illegal votes.

You are incredibly naive and ignorant of the American election and legal systems. To be fair you have a lot of company. BTW I assumed you knew this but looking at what you've written further you're probably not. The premise of you idea that everyone will be given an ID to vote has an additional problem, there won't be a single ID given to everyone issued by a single entity. There can be more than 50 different IDs issued by 50 different entities each entity resourcing the issuing of these IDs differently and potentially failing different groups.

Hopefully you're happier in Canada and understand Canada's systems of government better than you do ours.
