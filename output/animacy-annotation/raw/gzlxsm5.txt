Lolol. What’s my history? If you think I’m Armenian because I stand for them you must be the picture of racism. My empathy expands beyond my ethnic peers. Way to show you’re close minded and ignorant of history to boot. 

What’s factually incorrect in what I wrote? Is honest history now ‘hate’? Were armenians not oppressed (terribly so) and murdered in the name of Islam? You think reporting history is bigotry? Oh, my.
