It’s one thing to have incorrectly mistook Al-qaeda for the Iraqis, given all the highly suspect shit that went on to invade Iraq. It’s really stupid, in 2021, to still have thought it was Iraq, but it’s just barely forgivable and the slightest bit understandable. 

But to think it was the Afghans? The Taliban? Like fuck man I don’t even think that registers on the scale of being “understandable”. That’s so stupid and ignorant that it makes ME cringe for you.
