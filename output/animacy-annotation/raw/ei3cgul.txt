&gt; But the real evidence of how fucking unaware and selfish you are is that you talk about someone being stopped in the middle of the road and didn't think to see if they might need help. You only considered how it affected you and then have the gall to accuse the world of being self centered. Fucking hypocrite.

Right on, the reddit judgement.  Suddenly all the people stopping the middle of the road in midtown Atlanta at 1am in the morning are all having heart attacks and need random strangers to run up their car, tap on their glass, and verify they aren't choking on their tongue or something.  yaay
