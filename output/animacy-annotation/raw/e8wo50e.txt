The Democratic Party stand tall with illegal immigrants from South America/Mexico who come from a society where men rule with an iron hand and Women have little to no rights.

As a matter of fact 47% of women in Mexico has been abused and most are either afraid of forming a group to defend their rights or they are uneducated and unaware that this abuse is wild spread.

Add this to the criminals that kidnapp Women on the border states and the drug Cartels it's absolutely shocking, to me, that any Woman would support the Democratic party.

It will only be a matter of time before they transpose their beliefs here and make it even more a part of modern American culture unless a legal and orderly process is mandated.

I believe that if the US demands a legal and orderly process based on the law in regards to illegal immigrants and migrants this will go a long way in regards to showing what America is all about which is a nation of laws that gives a fair shot to both Men and Women.

It will show the new migrants from the countries that oppress Women that the laws in this country will be enforced.

Doing this could perhaps curve some of immigrants bad tendancies who come from a society that oppresses Women to change their behavior once that enter the US.
