People tailgating are generally one of the following..

1. Ignorant and unaware that it's very unsafe to follow closely

1. Speeding (trying to pass or just upset you aren't going the speed they want to go)

In either case, they most likely aren't leading very stable or logical lives, hence your experience :)
