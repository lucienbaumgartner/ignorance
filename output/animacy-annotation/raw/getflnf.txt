So I get some of the logic of your statement. The founding fathers became criminals in the eyes of imperial Britain when they declared independence sure, were any of them criminals before that? I truly just am unaware and curious.

Now a days we would consider them criminals many fought and killed people in duels and owned slaves. We can't judge them by the standards of our time though that isn't fair. If we did pretty much every historical figure ever would be a criminal.
