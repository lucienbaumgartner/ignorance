I’m not sure which of the comments you’re replying to but yeah I’d pretty much guessed that. Are all angsty teens this predictable? It’s always the same bullshit with these guys. 

The only thing that I find somewhat interesting is that they tend to be left-leaning (at least they tend to mock all white Americans as voting for Trump) yet they’re over here defending a fascist dictatorship. That sort of disconnect is pretty wild, I think. 

It’s also kind of amusing that, generational differences aside, I’ve got a lot more in common with these idiots (culturally speaking) than my wife does, for example. But they’re so fucking small-minded and ignorant that they can’t see past “hurr durr we’re ethnically the same so let’s stick together!”
