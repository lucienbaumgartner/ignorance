&gt; Trump has not colluded with an enemy.   

Maybe not in the legal sense, but morally he definitely has, unless he's so stupid and unaware that he doesn't know who our enemies are, and it's important that he resign or be impeached and convicted with the American public thinking that he's perfectly comfortable with committing treason and that the Republican party values party over country even if it means supporting treason.
