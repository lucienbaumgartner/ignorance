That indeed makes black musicians that deliberately sell the word through pop culture also complicit to the cultural ignorance. But couldnâ€™t it be that a portion of society has simply become numb and ignorant of the word rather than racist? A 14 year old girl fe could sing to a Drake song without having a racist thought about black people tho. Is it right or even the desired cultural evolution? No. But certainly, in my view, a big grey area with lots of factors.
