Well, first of all, your parents WILL find out. Its just a matter of time. Second, I don't think your main concern is gossip or your parents... You said he did this without you knowing about it. I believe that is illegal, and you are under age. There really isn't going to be anything you can do about gossip, even if you manage to get it taken down due to you being underage and unaware of the video, it will still be out there. As for your parents, all you can do there is to tell them you didn't know about the video. Don't try to get out of this, they will know you are lying. Just admit to them you messed up (you did) and accept the punishment they decide on. Ask them for help, yeah, they'll be pissed, but you are still their daughter.
I don't know about your school. You said its a private school, I am guessing that means religious. There may be repercussions from them. (The school my DD athletes nearly kicked out some girls who decided, during a sleepover, it would be a good idea to sext male classmates. Uh, not so much)
Lastly, talk to the police, preferably with your parents, and see what can be done legally to your exBF. He shouldn't just be able to walk away from his shitty behavior.
