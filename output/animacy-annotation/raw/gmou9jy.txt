two reasons.  lying for tips and being on drugs or stoned. the riders are incredibly pretentious and unaware of the realities so you have to come off as super 'positive' and stroke their ego in hopes of getting tips.  if you haven't done it don't act like you know what it's like.  it is cool for a stoner to set own hours and get baked but the numbers don't ad up.  You get 20 per minute driving.  if you're stopped you're burning gas.  plus the other costs plus chances of getting in an accident or getting a ticket for stopping in a bike lane etc.. then you have to drive the rest of the week just to break even.  it's fucking trash compared to a real job
