This is a sign that almost nobody is going to face any negative consequences for the items revealed in the wiretaps.

* Phone recordings of discussions of payments will not meet the standard of evidence.

* Sworn testimony that X school offered Y bribe for athletes will not meet the standard of evidence.

* Lists of prices X school is willing to pay for Y-rated players will not meet the standard of evidence.

Granted, I'm a UW fan and we were not punished when a (completely unaware and dim) HS coach testified to passing cash from football assistant Tosh Lupoi to the parents of a player. (Lupoi and parents denied, denied, denied and nobody got punished.) So it's not like I have any kind of moral high-ground, but people have got to admit that shit is dirty. Our laundry is dirty at UW. Creighton is a pay-for-play school, and lucky to dodge serious penalties. That's the game as it is played and Creighton was just unlucky to have their dirty laundry aired when most other schools dodged this particular bullet. But that laundry has been aired and it ain't clean, people.

TL:DR Creighton isn't the victim. They got away with stuff. Sure, it's stuff that is ubiquitous in the sport, but it's no secret Creighton will pay cash money for prospects.

Edit: for the hair splitters -- boosters connected to the Bluejay's program are willing to pay. Nothing beyond the assistant taking bribes to refer players to agents/financial advisors has been shown to come from University employees. I say it's a distinction w/o a difference, but it matters to some.
