You kinda just repeating yourself honestly. I already know w that hat you believe but saying it over and over doesn't make it more convincing. Your not required to defend your beliefs though. 

&gt;What you want to see in an era of persecution and martyrs?

What I want it some  evidence that what the Orthodox church teaches today as that same as what was taught in early Christianity. I don't think that's unreasonable.

&gt;The canon you have im your hands and that reformers used and later removed books is from 382.

I feel like that position is too simplistic and ignorant of canon history. Jerome made a solid case for the Protestant canon around that same time as the Council of Rome. And doesn't the fact that a council decided to clarify a canon prove that there were Christians prior to the council that didn't agree with that canon? Wouldn't that suggest that the council of Romes canon isn't the same one used by early  Christianity?

&gt;No they arent.

Sure they are. Just read though some of Irenaeus' works. Polycarp, Justing Martyr and Clement of Rome are also insightful.

&gt;Yet you and many others put down early christian traditions, from the people that passed down the theological understanding from the apostles themselves

Again, I haven't seen anything to suggest that Orthodox traditions were held by the early Church.
