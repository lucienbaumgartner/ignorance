When did it matter whether the ingredients or the taste were the same. Its not your business to conduct what kind of diet he eats, only his. You breached a boundary of deceiving him into eating something other than what he thought it was. For all he knew, you could have put anything in that marinara. You're fitting the vegan stereotype of being arrogant and unaware of others, don't be like that please. Don't give us reasons to hate you guys, okay?
