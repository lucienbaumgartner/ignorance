&gt;messing in the internal politics and business of it's neighbours

You are an idiot if you think America doesn't mess with internal politics of other countries which they deem to be under their sphere of influence, try Yugoslavia, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Guatemala.

This is the saddest part, which shows exactly how ignorant and dumb you are.  


&gt;threatening with war

How many countries has Russia invaded the last 30 years and how much US?  


&gt;Russia and it's imperialist, fascist, authoritarian, dictatorial

Check how many airbases America has in other countries and then say who is imperialist.  
Fascist? Your country literally brought fascist scientists after the war and gave them a pass for genociding people because they could help you.  


&gt;Funny how your go-to whataboutism is always "America this and America that". It is like you trolls have some check list where you tick off general propaganda answers.

Comparing what big countries do to other countries and saying that one is being called out and the other not is not whataboutism, it's comparison you moron.
