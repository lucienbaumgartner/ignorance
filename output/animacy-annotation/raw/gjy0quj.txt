I wish I had authority, but I don't. There's not many doctors in the hospital who are more junior than myself. I've tried to drive some changes as best I can (e.g. allowing people in to see dying relatives) but my power to effect change is very limited.

This might not help, but I find it beneficial to interpret people's actions as generously as possible. The government is beholden to SAGE, but more than that it's beholden to the general public. When the general public is utterly misinformed and ignorant of the broader situation, and most have no concept of trade-offs, then you can expect terrible policy. We see this again and again in all countries where too much power has been given to government and the electorate is grossly ignorant throughout centuries, but perhaps haven't seen so much damage as in this last year for quite a while. So I don't suspect ulterior motives in government - just incompetence, ignorance, and a dramatic democratic failure. When the public no longer tolerates restrictions, the government will stop them. I think that day is close.
