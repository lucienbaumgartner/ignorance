I'm not a patriot to my country. I never once claimed to be. I only support indy because it is that or more tory shenanigans. Labour are basically red tories, same with lib dems but in orange.

That's just a stupid concept. I don't want anything because of my "sovereignty". I care about the state of the lower and working class. What is wrong with detesting ignorant people who have no idea what they are talking about? voting a party that has done nothing but harm us these last 12 years?

There are only two reasons you would vote tory:
- you aren't middle class+ and have no idea what you are talking about regarding politics. But still vote anyways cause it makes you feel like a proper adult.
- You are middle class + and want to keep your current position in life

am i missing something here? 

Am I supposed to not hate the first category for being so stupid and ignorant that they eat up propaganda like a fry up after a sesh? They wont listen to anyone. They won't do their own research. It makes me hate them more that they are doing it because they are stupid. It is so avoidable.

The second category, well I expect that of scum with no empathy for those not as privileged as they are.

Any more I can add there? any other reason to vote tory? If not then we done here big boy?
