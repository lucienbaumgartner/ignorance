Why send them to prison?  Rehabilitation is not likely and the cost is astronomical.  5 years of housing, security and basic necessities is quite expensive in a prison especially if the possibility exists that he may re-offend.  The result of an action such as this can range from concussion, brain damage and even death, not to mention the emotional effect of not being comfortable in public places ever again.  Any ~~person~~ insect who would so impulsively subject an unaware and innocent person to such a horrible unprovoked action can never be trusted or allowed again near civilized people.

An appropriate punishment to thwart or completely prevent such a cold and heartless action is death.  

Live by the sword, die by the sword.
