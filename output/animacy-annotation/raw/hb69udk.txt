&gt;Why do you feel qualified to discount the expert opinion of a medical doctor? Someone who did the work, received an MD, and is a professional.

Because I am qualified to discount their opinion. See below.

On the subject of their opinions: they have proven them to be unworthy of the label "expert". Their opinion is grossly negligent and ignorant of basic facts of medical science. They are either intentionally deceiving vulnerable people with a treatment they know to be ineffective and potentially dangerous, or they're so ignorant of physiology, microbiology and critical analysis of research that they need to be removed from practice. It's one or the other. 


&gt;You are not a professional. You are not a doctor. You are no different than any other Facebook nut who thinks they know better because someone on YouTube said so.

Wait really? Then the last like 8 years of med school, residency &amp; practice as an attending physician must have been some crazy fever dream or something. I guess I should return the MD hanging on my office wall? Man I'm sure glad I don't have to wake up tonight and go staff the hospital....
