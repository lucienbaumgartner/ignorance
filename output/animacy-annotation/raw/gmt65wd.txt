The biggest problem is the sheeple refusing to admit that big government is the problem and people need to think for themselves more. Primarily our public education system is partially at fault. Naive parents telling their children lies is also to blame. 

The system itself is basically designed to keep the average person uniformed and unaware of the truth.
