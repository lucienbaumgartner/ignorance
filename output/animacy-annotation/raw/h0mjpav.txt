Girlfriend never saw it and I am sick of her not getting the references.  Sawyer's appearance in Yellowstone was the impetus.  We are late season 2 and she is entirely unspoiled and unaware of the complete narrative failures to come.  
   
Knowing how it turns out, it is definitely a hate-watch on my end.  It's funny to hear her float theories and get emotionally engaged with the story knowing disappointment is the only end.
