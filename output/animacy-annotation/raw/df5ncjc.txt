Its incredible to me how wrong you idiots can be proven time and time again but you still consider us the ones who are brainwashed and manipulated.  Did you read the wikileaks?  They literally discussed how stupid you guys were.

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general **conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong** but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

You see that? That's what people call the redpill, and that's why we say "woke".  You need to wake up, please, for the good of the country.
