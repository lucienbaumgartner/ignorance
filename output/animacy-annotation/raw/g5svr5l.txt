On the contrary, you're making the assumption that those who favor the "slower option" believe they are guaranteed some form of closure. I could be wrong, but I didn't see anyone here claiming that a slower death guarantees closure. However, you *are* offered the chance of it and much more, thanks to time and opportunity. That's just fact. It may not be the kind of time and opportunity to do all you want, whatever you want, whenever you want....but the important fact here is whether it's two weeks or two years, you have some level of time and opportunity. And yes, it undoubtedly will be subject to pain, discomfort, deterioration, and heartbreak. It's rather unreasonable to assume that those who choose the slower exit from life are naive and unaware of the strong likelihoods/ inevitabilities...such as, physical pain, emotional anguish, overwhelming heartache, or that dreadful decline when you lose all of your physical and cognitive faculties...as if this story's version doesn't have its own gut wrenching conclusion. But it's that time you're given between the second you're initially delivered that fateful medical news, to just before all faculties are lost, which provides an undeniable aspect that sudden death does not. *It's precisely this aspect that's worth all the pain and suffering to a lot of folks.* It's also understandably not worth it to many other folks. No one is right or wrong, there is a "lesser of two evils" here for everyone. It's what suits *YOUR* life in this moment. As we all grow and evolve individually, our preferences on this is matter will likely fluctuate thruout time. What we believe suits us now can very likely not suit us in the future.
