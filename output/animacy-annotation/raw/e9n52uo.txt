The vast majority of people living in the San Fernando, Simi, and Conejo valleys have no idea that the SSFL is in the area.

There is also a long history of liquid-metal testing on the site and last time I was there(in about 2005,) about six “storage ponds” were still being maintained. 

When it was first built in the late 1940s the San Fernando Valley was mostly rural and the location was perfect for the closeness to big universities, a high tech manufacturing region and, JPL. 
Sadly (and dangerously) the communities around the SSFL have been allowed to grow and build, almost unhindered, and unaware that there is a puddle of toxic goo just up the hill.
