&gt; You would piss off 99% of the population.

Except all the people who hold the big sticks.

&gt; Not much money could stop the revolution.

You assume there'd even be a revolution in the first place. We're walking right into this as we speak, unaware and unsuspecting. There won't be a revolution and by the time we realize we fucked up, it'll be too late. Nobody wants to talk about how machine automation can be used by the wealthy and powerful to turn us obsolete. Nobody has even pointed it out yet. 

All we're concerned about is how it won't let us have jobs anymore. As if *that's* the main issue.

You'll happily give up your rights bit by bit as you receive UBI and stay at home to pursue your creative endeavors. Once everybody has no way to support themselves and machine automation can sustain itself -- you have no leverage and a century will have passed.

We'll be complacent and unaware. But the wealthy and powerful won't want to keep around billions of people. Too much resource hogging and they might try to attack. Just wipe them out and create factories on the bedrock of their bones.

&gt; It's far more dangerous to kill the working class than make them obselete.

If they're obsolete -- what reason is there to keep them alive? When they have no weapons, no armies, no leverage? Just use nerve agents, they'll all drop dead and you can clean up the cities. Nobody would even realize it.

&gt; Risk assessment is what made them rich not sociopathy.

You know what risk assessment entails, don't you? A lot of it involves making cold, calculated and ruthless decisions. Most of that tends to involve people.
