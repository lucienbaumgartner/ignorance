I think strong cases can be made for and against widespread HSV testing. I personally don't have a strong opinion one way or the other and see benefits and drawbacks of both approaches. But I *do* think it's important for people to be aware that they are likely not being tested for HSV1/2 when asking to be testing for "everything," that it is common and most people who have it are unaware and unable to disclose so it's important to weigh that information when considering how you approach safe sex, that (like HPV) condoms only partially protect against transmission of HSV, and that if you *want* to know your status, you can request HSV testing.  

I do really like the CDC's detailed fact sheet on genital herpes: https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm
