&gt;if you were born white and at some point started calling yourself black (and actually meant it) I don't think most people would take you seriously.

Ethnic identity is not founded in a simple binary of black and white. Our individual identity is both a social and a subjective construct. As an example (away from the socially-charged subject of ethnicity) if a child was raised by dogs the child would perceive itself as part of a canine pack. 
In my country, (getting back to the socially painful subject of ethnicity) indigenous people who are perceived by their community as indigenous and who self-perceive as indigenous are challenged (challenged being a euphemism for what can be a painful, humiliating and outrageous experience given our history) to prove who they are because, on specular and binary terms, 'they look too pale'. Too often socially unaware and jealous opinions accuse them of trying to somehow benefit by claiming to be who they do not seem to be. The ironies resound.
