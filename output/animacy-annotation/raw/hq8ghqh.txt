You really think that the reason a Patagonia or Arcteryx piece of clothing is more expensive is because of the brand name associated? 

I cannot understate how ignorant and incorrect this is. 

Living in the wilderness with a rifle and living in the wilderness with a rope and a harness are completely different activities. I can only imagine you spend way more of your time being inactive and so having something breathable is much less of a concern for hunters, which makes things much cheaper.
