I would consider freedom as a good thing. I'm not sure what not caring about freedom intrinsically means.

&gt;In the case of truancy, he's willing to forsake the freedom of the parent for the education of the child.

I would say that the putting parents in jail is unnecessary and the education of the child could be enforced by the state without putting the parent in jail.

The slurs is a case where he is restricting his own actions rather than the state. Do you think he would advocate for the government to ban the use of slurs, punishable be jail time, if the result of getting rid of slurs was a net good for society?

I agree on the financial side that the loss of financial freedom from taxes is worthwhile to achieve certain societal benefits because the taxes are necessary to achieve those things.

I'm not sure how the AI scenario would play out. If you are locked in jail but drugged so that you are perpetually happy and unaware that you are locked up is that a good thing? If the AI scenario takes property and redistributes it so that everyone has a decent standard of living and has a fulfilling life, now you have made an argument for communism. I don't get the impression from destiny that he is pro utopian communism.
