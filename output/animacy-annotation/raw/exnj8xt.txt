The dichotomy in how Anelise represents herself is what feeds her pathological excitement and illusion of worthiness.  Look at me!  I’m so young, so small, fragile, so lovely... and can you believe I’m carrying this heavy burden, I’M ILL and look at how playfully and carelessly I cope with and overcome my illness.  I’m so adorably, blissfully unaware and unconcerned with my near-fatal state.  Did I mention I’m ILL?  I’m such an incorrigible contradiction.
“I got yelled it shortly after this” = people care about me
“It freaked out my nurses” = see, people care about me
...PLEASE CARE ABOUT ME
