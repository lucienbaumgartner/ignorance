talking about my parents they are very supportive and understanding... i feel very grateful for that everyday because i see most parents who r so pressuring and ignorant and i can understand that it is terrible when u have no one supporting u... not even ur parents... i think the only reason i am alive is that my parents aren't like that or else i could have gone long ago
