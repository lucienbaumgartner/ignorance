The only problem I ever had with you was when you were going on and on in multiple threads about non-English speakers being unaware and uninterested in Gummy's server and when I proved definitely it false with a single simple example you vanished.  Alas, that page is gone now.  Basically it was a VK fanpage with over 1,000 eastern Europeans fawning in Cyrillic characters over the server.
