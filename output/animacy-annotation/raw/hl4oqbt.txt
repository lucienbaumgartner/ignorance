You're kinda ironically feeding the point a lot of other countries make about the US; we're less than 5% of the world's population but our worldview largely ignored the rest of the world.   


"350 million people and 50 states is more than enough to keep up with..."  


As if the rest of the nearly 8 billion documented people in this world arent all that relevant to what happens in the US. As if other countries with a similarly sized population or larger dont do a better job of exercising awareness of what goes on in the world outside their native country. Yes it is a stereotype that Americans are arrogant and ignorant of much of the world... But its a stereotype so many americans unwittingly embrace. Shoot, thats like the entirety of one of the major political parties, and without knowing which one im talking about, i wouldnt be surprised if you agreed
