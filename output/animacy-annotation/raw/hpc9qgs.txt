I look at situations with nuance, the world isn't black and white.  That being said there isn't much nuance when cry babies and paranoid conspiracy theorists are prolonging a deadly virus and giving it more opportunities to mutate.  Y'all are just wrong, ignorant and wrong.  No nuance to that situation.
