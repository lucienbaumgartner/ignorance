Someone who doesn’t wear a seatbelt and gets into a crash makes their body a projectile and something that could kill others in the vehicle or outside of it. Additionally, that’s more of a drain on society for something as simple as wearing a belt. We still treat them because their still our citizens and friends, but we should also tell them to wear a belt and fine them for risking their lives and others for “freedom”. Vaccines are the same. Stop being so narrow with who it affects. Someone getting COVID and spreading it to people unvaccinated(children cannot get the vaccine under a certain age) put those children at risk for “freedom” and harm others. You aren’t living as an island, but a community and the community should work together, not play their own games and ignore your neighbors. It’s selfish and ignorant of the effects on others. Wear the belt, get people away from harsh drugs and the care they need, take the vaccine. You live with us, not against us.
