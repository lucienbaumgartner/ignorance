NTA, first of all you are NOT fat and ugly. I can guarantee that, As someone who carries extra insulation herself, you are still beautiful and perfect the way you are. Both sides of my family tree like to carry extra weight and some have diabetes. That does not mean that you will automatically follow the same path. I was pre diabetic during my first few years of university , but with some diet changes i was able to reverse it. 
Your brother was completely inappropriate and rude when he asked those questions and your parents should know better. 
Tell your brother to STFU, and tell your parents to stop being so obtuse and ignorant of your brothers actions
