How does that conflict with anything I said? I'm well aware the US and Western friendly countries pour money into the Taiwan chip industry. Know why? Because they can't produce their own yet and the factories were already struggling to keep up with the global demand (as we've all been made painfully aware of).

If you have a necessary resource that you're a good 10 years from being able to make domestically, in a geopolitical hotspot, of fucking course you're going to pour money in and cozy up to the people in power. I post about the US selling them the latest long range missiles and you act like I'd be unaware and surprised we pour money into their chip industry.
