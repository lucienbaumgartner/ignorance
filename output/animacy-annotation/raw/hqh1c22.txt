"Foreigners could never make significant enough ties in my country that they would be missed, whereas us locals would be missed by people in our communities because they love us."   
  
From my time in China, I have people that I miss, people that impacted me; I impacted them as well and I know from our conversations since then that those ties were significant. I know many other expats who, through their time in China, meant a lot to their small communities.   
  
Your comments basically suggest that foreigners are so low value to China (you're taking a broad view here) that China dgaf once they leave, but that's ignorant and xenophobic. It's basically a repudiation of shared humanity. The geopolitical forces might be shit, the comments you read here might be shit, but on a human level, people you meet when you live somewhere, people you interact with daily and befriend, can develop strong ties in spite of all of that.
