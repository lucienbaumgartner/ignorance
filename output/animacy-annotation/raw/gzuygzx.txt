I don't get why people don't understand that Matador is hard because a lot of people would've started with this game, blind and unaware of how useful buffs are. It's the same with Minotaur. If you don't know what you're doing you're going to get steamrolled. OP even says "he's easy with some research" no shit if you look up how to beat Matador you're going to beat Matador. I'd pay to see them go through the rest of the game blind and see if they feel the same way.
