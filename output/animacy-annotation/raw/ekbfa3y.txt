See, I wouldn’t say Ren is too bad. His problem is just that he’s so bloody naive and ignorant, that he still treats everything like a game. It’s not that he necessarily treats his party bad, like Itsuki, but it’s that he sees them as NPCs, and only thought that him being strong mattered; they would just catch up. He’s so used to being a solo player in his VRMMORPG game, that he just applied it here too. Yeah, him just rushing forward and thinking his party would just take care of the rest is stupid, but it’s more being a naive 16 year old rather than being a jackass.    

I think there’s a bonus chapter where all the heroes do a party swap that explains the others faults.    
Motoyasu’s party are made to act like a bunch of cheerleaders down to Myne, and they kinda hate it.     
Itsuki has to be the centre of attention, and has everyone else just cover him.     
Ren doesn’t even think of his party, and just assumes they’ll be fine.    
Naofumi considers all his party members (because he bloody well has to).
