I didn’t “have” to lmao, that was just a random example. An example btw *that’s still practiced today* lol, so what you just said was irrelevant. But that should be a sample to you of what I’m talking about. Your instinctual refusal to believe something because it’s not written out on paper. Like just from a non-racial standpoint, you don’t see how wild and ignorant that mentality is?

If someone fired you and told you it was because of your hair color, but then officially wrote down or told whoever you informed about this that it was because of something else, did it just...*not* happen lmao? Is it just *not* the case? That’s not the way things work, especially with humans, and especially with humans that have half a brain. 

You think 70% of the people who voted for Trump *actually* told people they voted for Trump? Hell no, the social repercussions would be devastating for almost anyone. But at the end of the day, *they did*, which is why moderate america was completely and totally blindsided.

But I mean, back to race. So, in terms of being modern, we can both agree there’s an opioid epidemic right? It’s overwhelming white, sparing African-American and Latino communities. Why? Because doctors unconsciously prescribe narcotics more cautiously to their non-white patients. 

That’s one that even *helps* minorities in a round-about way, but it’s a clear example of a very real racial bias that has nothing to do with laws or anything official. Doctors just **feel** like a minority patient is more likely to abuse it, so they subconsciously (or consciously) act on that.

You really gotta not be so close minded man. I don’t know what the demographic is where you grew up, but things simply aren’t the same for everyone, despite what you hear on Fox, despite what your friends or family might say, despite what people you know might say who have never been close with an economically challenged minority in their lives.
