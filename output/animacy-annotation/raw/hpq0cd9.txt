Wow, pretty ignorant and inflammatory statement there r/HumansDeserveHell. Surveillance drones over war zones do not conflate with rural communication infrastructure.

I live near Bayfield and have a lot of friends who are first responders and the article did a pretty good job of capturing the issue down here. We need the cell tower density of a large Metro area, not because of population but because of terrain obstructions. The only inaccurate statement in the article is that Starlink is too expensive for local government. It just doesn't have the capacity yet. Give it a few more years and it and other satellite providers will be a game changer for sure.
