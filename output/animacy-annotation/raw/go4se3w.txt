I’m genuinely in shock that someone can be so deluded and unaware of what is visibly in-front of them plain as day on a screen/Reddit thread.

Let me spell this out for you, as you seem to be on a different planet than most people. 

The user who replied to you and said the English were of Norman descent is called smalls714. 

I responded to that user saying the Normans were of Scandinavian descent and asked what their point was.

Because I responded to a person who commented on your post, you then got a message saying I had commented on your thread.. However I did not comment to you directly, I responded to smalls714.

Take a look again, my user name is not smalls714. 

I can’t believe I’m actually having to explain this to you, I don’t even want to but you seem to think you are right about everything but can’t even realise who is replying to your comments and who is not.

Seriously... wtf.
