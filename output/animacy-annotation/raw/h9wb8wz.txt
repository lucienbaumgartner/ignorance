i think its more critisim towards some ccs attitude towards covid? 

seen some ccs talk about how "covids over" and "how things are back to normal/close to getting back to normal", which, if you're not from a first world country, can come off as extremely privileged and ignorant of the fact that. like, no, we are still in a pandemic.
