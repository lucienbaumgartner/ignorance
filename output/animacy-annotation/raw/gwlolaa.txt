No you're not a towel (I think), you're just new and unaware that this game has a very slow curve of progress when f2p. Actually I think even when paying money to get cards the (results of) progress are hardly rewarding (in other words don't be tempted to give in to their offers).

In answer to your question, it's a grind. Play as much PvE (storyline) as you can to stock up a bit on cards and coins and mats, and prioritize investing those into cards and themes you know you're going to use in PvP.

At lower levels Adventure and Superheroes are the most pushed and easiest obtained themes, but as the road is long, you're going to want to diversify leveling key cards in other themes as well.
