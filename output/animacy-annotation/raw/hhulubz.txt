Reinvent yourself? Not really. 
Self improvement? Absolutely. 

Currently, my salary does not allow me many things.

But!! i do believe in clean clothes, clean shoes. 
I also enjoy two luxury things every single day - expensive perfume and expensive coffee (with cream, hold the sugar and milk). 
I work out every day. 
I shower every day. 
I read every day (religion, climate change, gender studies, manners, etiquette, nutrition, etc). 

I am so different from the people around me, they are loud, rude, vulgar and ignorant of so much but brave about their opinions. If i wanted to be attractive to them, id have to change so much of myself. 

There are things that are important to you - identify them. 
There are ideas you have - develop them. 
There are things you like - refine them. 
There are things you don't like - accept them. 

We can't separate our desire to be attractive to the opposite gender. But we must be attractive to ourselves is a good step forward.
