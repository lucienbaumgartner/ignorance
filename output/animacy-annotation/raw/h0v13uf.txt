Your idea of consent is what is repulsive. Not consent itself. The whole point of a PARADE is to demonstrate the broad diversity of the broader queer diaspora which very much does and always has included versions of kink. Your defense of your version of consent does come across as puritanical and ignorant of the history of queer rights and how the Pride parade is situated within that.. Honestly it makes me wonder how old you are as that is a very immature way of intellectualizing cultural difference.
