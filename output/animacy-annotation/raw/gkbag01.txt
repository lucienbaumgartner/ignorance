Thank you for your reply. As far as the sexual stuff, he did say creepier stuff to my sister, but I'm inclined to think it was more along the lines of trying to be reassuring and just not knowing how that would work for us. We were both preteens I think, and I bet he read something about how preteen girls are often insecure about their chest size or something, but didn't realize that a) it was not his place and b) neither of us were too fussed about that. And the jokes were absolutely in poor taste, I think he just didn't get how they would be upsetting to kids. I was in kind of a frantic state when I wrote this post, and thinking about it more clearly he was probably just really unaware and unempethetic. Thanks again for your response, it really did help me sort things out in my mind a bit more.
