&gt;We don't know the situation with Robin Williams 

Robin Williams' situation was well documented at the time of his death - he was unfortunately well aware of his health and that he was facing a spiral of misery.

&gt;not everyone has the same experiences either.

There's the crux of the matter - you implied that no dementia patient has the cognitive ability to understand what they are going through, but we know that is not the case.

&gt;Your last statement is the weird statement, since unfortunately many people have committed suicide because of depression without dementia, as we all are aware.

&gt;A person can go from a nice, kind individual to being angry, combative and unaware of self, yet not commit suicide.

Most people with terminal illnesses die via natural causes, but that doesn't mean that the people who do commit suicide only do it due to depression, although it is a factor in a lot of cases.  Even if they do have depression and have been suicidal in the past it doesn't detract from the fact that it may have been the least worst option for them, or that the illness was the catalyst for the worsening of their mental health.
