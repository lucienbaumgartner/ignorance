With all due respect, I can't believe this is a foreign concept to you.

Of course we should consider the intelligence, awareness, ability to suffer, etc of something when we decide whether to kill it.

Consider: is it wrong to torture a pig to death over the course of several days? To keep it alive while mutilating it, beating it, burning its eyes? I'd say that'd be outrageously immoral, because it *feels like something to be a pig*. They can suffer, feel pain, likely some form of emotion, etc.

Is it wrong to torture a plant to death? That's not even a coherent question. 

What about an ant? I'd certainly rather not do so, but if I had to choose between torturing a pig and torturing an ant, I'd pick the ant. Ants are so unintelligent and unaware that it seems pretty clear that you're causing much less suffering than you are with the pig.

So that's the logic. And, after all, if you don't consider intelligence and the capacity to suffer in these questions, what do you consider? We're humans, they're not, end of discussion?
