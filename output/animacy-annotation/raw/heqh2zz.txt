True, but as I said in another comment here. I dont know if kids should wear masks or not in general. But the people OP is screaming at internally have a point. And if it was as simple as "masks save lives" and there is zero concern for kids wearings them Im sure even Norway would mandate them. Unless we are just lazy and ignorant of the science.
