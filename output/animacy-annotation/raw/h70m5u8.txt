&gt;I'm pretty sure if Israel was under complete haredi control they would bring back stoning people. You going to tell me the Torah says otherwise?
  


that is so wrong, prejudiced and ignorant of you to say. stoning in the jewish communities is something that stopped a thousand years ago- when everyone was the equivilant of today's Haredi, and the communities were ruled by the Torah laws and their interpetations.
