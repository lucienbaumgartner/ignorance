What "little guys and start ups" don't know that when you do business related to this area of the financial sector, it would behoove them to hire professionals to help them navigate through the relevant laws?    

Just because they're "little guys," that doesn't mean they're stupid and ignorant of what it entails to do legitimate business in this area.   And if they do hire legal experts, they know they'd better follow their advice or get into trouble. 

Also, it's not like you don't have a choice to go into a different type of business if this one is too expensive for you to delve into. 

And by now, 'many people' know that dt has a pattern of not paying attorneys' fees, not listening to what they tell him to do, not sticking with those who aren't just going to "Yes" him no matter how wrong he is, and in the end, just doing whatever the fuck he wants to do regardless of the legality of his actions. 

It's not like dt's patterns in his decisions, actions, and history is unknown, especially by now.
