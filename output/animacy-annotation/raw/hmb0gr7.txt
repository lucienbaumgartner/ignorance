“Being offended” in church vernacular doesn’t mean only being resentful at a perceived insult. The reason members use “being offended” as such a big reason, is because of what accompanies it:  
* When someone is “offended” in the church, they are also immature because they couldn’t separate a members opinion from church doctrine. Members think the “offended” person is incapable of seeing that some people are just asses.  
* When someone is “offended” in the church, it also means they are unintelligent and ignorant of the supposed “facts”. Members think the “offended” person hasn’t done any research into the history or data of the situation.  
* When someone is “offended” in the church, they are only whining and murmuring about something. Members think the “offended” person is irrational in their criticisms.


When a member says someone left because they were “offended”, they really mean they think the person is complaining, wrong, is acting childishly, and has no good reason for their comment.
