I was so disappointed in Biden when he did that. 🥺👎🏼.. Those who say Trump never did any good that didn’t profit himself are just so wrong and unaware of many good things he did or tried to do for the American people. 

   He tried to initiate a 2000.00 dollar a month relief fund for those locked out of jobs during the early months of Covid much like Trudeau did for Canadians. They ALWAYS voted against him in congress , no matter how hard he tried ( lowered it to 1600.00 ) . As soon as Biden was in Congress made him look the big hero by voting for his 1600.00 incentive payment ( not sure if that was monthly ). A little to little and waaay to late as many were already homeless and lining up at food banks for a simple loaf of bread. They did not implement any safety for renters or mortgage holders with landlords or banks until things got back to normal like they did in Canada. 
  
   Call Trump what you may.. but as a Canadian and actually reading about all the executive orders he signed, all the jobs and industries he brought back to US ( saw grown men cry who were steel workers out of gratitude for having jobs again on Twitter .. of course they never showed this on MSM ).. not to mention the auto industry.  It’s sad that they stole the election from him and nobody can convince me otherwise.😥👎🏼
