Yes, but that's just so incredibly stupid for many reasons. Firstly we have a vaccine for the flu, we do not for the coronavirus. Secondly, we already prep for the flu and have the capacity to handle it. We do not for the coronavirus. Thirdly we actually know a lot about the flu. We aren't even positive about the transmission vectors for coronavirus. We don't even know if you can get it again. We don't know it's true mortality rate. We don't know why kids seemingly don't get it. We aren't really sure of the incubation period. We don't know when you become contagious and when you're not. Fourthly, we do not have any immunity to it because it is new. Fifly, "just the flu" has sprung up with new strains in the past and killed tens of millions of people in a year. It's absolutely ridiculous and ignorant that people seriously believe "it's just the flu" is both a rational thought and a helpful sentiment.
