If you have 10 ventilators and 20 people who need one, half of whom are vaccinated, who do you ventilate first? Why should those who've taken the simple and easy steps to get vaccinated and followed other common sense precautions to minimize risks (like consistent masking, distancing and strict quarantining) be penalized instead of those who've made the willfully ignorant and selfish decision (assuming no clinical reason to not be vaccinated) to not follow suit? 

At a certain point mistrust of healthcare because of historic events becomes an excuse and an abandoning of critical thinking or evidence-based decision making. It's simply not comparable to denying obese people or smokers healthcare, where their conditions are not *contagious*. We don't and shouldn't withhold care for people with self-inflicted problems, whether that means lung cancer or a suicide attempt, because we understand the reasons people reach such points are complex and are not simple choices. We do, have and should place limits on those who recklessly and willfully endanger others, such as those opposing vaccination.

What's the rational argument here? There doesn't appear to be one in support of this position.

That also doesn't include consideration of the fact that unvaccinated people increase the risks of mutation that increases the broader risk for everyone of a more contagious and/or lethal next variant.
