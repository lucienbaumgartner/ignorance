Its all about point of view, to america, pakistan, hell all of the middle east are terrorists in americas POV while they are good. Its exacly the vice versa to those countries and denying and not accepting the fact that everyone is a terrorist is ignorant and hypocritical. Im not saying its a case of you btw, im speaking in a general way. The way the rest of the world sees it its that both america and pakistan are terrorists and there is no good in a war, and trying to do a "who did more war crimes than who, who is better than what" is immoral and shitty and is the reason wars go on. Besides america still did unspeakable acts and sometimes still does, you can just type "Americas War Crimes" in wikipedia and you will get a gigantic list of truly horrendous stuff that america did, and i mean nazi level fucked up
