I think the same thing as well. Seeing too many videos of cars swerving to avoid a reckless/oblivious driver, getting in an accident all by themselves, and the other vehicle drives off unaware and uninvolved leaving the victim alone with injuries, a wrecked vehicle, and an at-fault insurance claim.
