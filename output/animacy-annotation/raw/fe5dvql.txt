There's nothing inherently wrong with wearing blackface, as long as you're doing it with care. Almost every discussion around blackface usually comes back to Tropic Thunder and Robert Downey Jr.'s character. There's also Mac from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia who donned blackface to play a black character in the Lethal Weapon movie. The butt of the joke is on the people themselves, the movie producers for not casting a black actor and just the lack of representation of black people in Hollywood, and the fact that the gang doesn't know any black person and they're so insensitive and ignorant that Mac puts on blackface. The joke is never the characters intentionally making fun of black people. 

When handling racially charged symbolism, I think people should reserve judgement until they see the whole context of it. One example where people took one thing out of context and damaged someone's reputation was [this](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/18/1334739878398/Swedish-culture-minister--008.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e0b94fa529ca8db1c31dfef9e0e657fa). That was a Swedish culture minister who was photographed eating a cake baked in the form of racist African imagery. Some people saw this image and immediately condemned it as racist including some minority rights groups in Sweden. What they didn't know was that this cake was an art piece by an Afro-Swedish artist. The culture minister didn't order a cake, she contracted out the artist to create an art piece. Said artist made art centered around racist imagery to make statements about racism, often exaggerating the images as much as possible to emphasize how far away it is from being black. People took it completely out of context and insulted both the minister and the artist by calling the whole thing racist.
