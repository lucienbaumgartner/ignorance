Oh so you mean in the same bubble before the playoffs where the lakers looked so bad that ppl were beginning to have doubts about them?

The same bubble where TJ Warren was shooting so well ppl were in disbelief?

Yeah, by your logic those things still held true, right? God you’re an idiot.

Yes, the Suns did well in the bubble but they were still a poor team back then. A string of hard fought, well played games doesn’t change the perception of that Suns team back then. Y’all so vindictive, petty and ignorant that y’all willing to take a quote and take it out of context just to shit on someone.

You dudes lead some real sad lives.
