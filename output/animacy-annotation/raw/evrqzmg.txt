when car drivers say the pedestrian just wandered blindly in front of them or jumped out of nowhere, it means they were too busy paying attention to anything except the people at the intersection trying to cross the road. 
I agree that everyone should pay attention and look both ways, but too many drivers are impatient and unaware that in Portland they are legally obligated to stop for a pedestrian at any crosswalk (marked or unmarked) or of their surroundings.
