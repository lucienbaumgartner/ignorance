Yeah I wouldn't pinpoint it as incel terrorism either, because the guy seemed to have deep seated mental health issues in general. It's not just a single factor that can cause someone to lash out violently like that against society.

He has posted videos on his ig talking about wielding a weapon at church and was trying to justify his behaviour even though he got arrested/went to court for it. He seems narcissistic and unaware of the consequences of his actions overall.
