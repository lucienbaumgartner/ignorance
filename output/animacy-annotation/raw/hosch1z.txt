They are NOT "jogging trails".  They're shared paths.  

There are paths where bicycles are prohibited...  go to Buffalo Bayou Park and you'll see several.

If bikes are not prohibited, then the path is shared.

Obviously there are people on bikes who are inconsiderate and unaware that pedestrians indeed have right-of-way.  No one on a bike should be going more than about 10 mph when passing pedestrians, and should always be ready to stop to avoid colliding with pedestrians.
