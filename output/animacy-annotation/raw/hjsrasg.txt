The break between Taliban and AQ was long before Doha. Probably just there for giving the Americans a narrative and make it easier for them to end the occupation. All ties were ended long time ago. Taliban regards them as American agents, a plague, and "Taliban were naive and ignorant of politics and welcomed al-Qaeda into their homes. But al-Qaeda abused our hospitality". This has been the speak from Taliban top officials for most of the time since 2001. TPP on the other hand is still said to have close ties with AQ. 

I think Afghan Taliban will force TPP out, if the talks fail. I doubt this will be a major problem.
