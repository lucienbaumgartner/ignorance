&gt;	urging fans not to take it seriously

This is revisionist. He never did this. He made an ill-advised joke when he was uninformed and unaware of the seriousness of the situation. It was stupid, yeah, but he never “urged fans to not take it seriously”.

And in the aftermath he was apologetic and willing to acknowledge himself making a dumb mistake. That’s fine. Just don’t be spreading the idea that he was actively urging people to take COVID less seriously. That’s dumb and false.
