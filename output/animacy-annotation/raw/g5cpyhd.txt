I think Celestials (and other Ancestral beings, like Cain) possess more power than they are aware of. Thus they unwittingly alter reality around them, but they don't even know exactly how or why they do it. Because of this lack of awareness, this power is triggered suconsciously, and once the change has been made, it stands unless they somehow come to a deeper understanding of their own mind and nature, resulting in the eventual ability to annul or modify said change. Among all Celestial, Lucifer is probably the most passionate, emotion-driven, stubborn and unaware of them (at least up to now). He usually just go with the flow without much thought, and only Linda's skills are sometimes able to appeal to his deep sensitivity, helping him through that channel, but I digress. 

The whole thing is a metaphor (and imo a beautiful one) of how people need to work on themselves in order to actually grow, and of how important it is to address one's issues, through friends, therapy etc. 

Everyone can be self aware enough to realize how sometimes you have knowledge about yourself and others hidden deep within your own mind, and you are not aware of this info until you put in the work to uncover it, because emotions and instincs and subliminal clues are super complex mechanisms. 
Add to that the power coming from being the spawn of the unbridled energies which created the cosmo, and you can understand how the "vulnerability thing" makes perfect sense.
