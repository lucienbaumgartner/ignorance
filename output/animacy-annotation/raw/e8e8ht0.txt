It's a nice point of view but it's not really appropriate to be pointed at Rollo. Rollo is presenting the knowledge and the rules, it's up to any one person whether they want to play the game by [current year] standards at all and to accurately assess where they stand in the SMP. Even if we did revert to an earlier time (which isn't going to happen any time soon), these behaviours are still true and more men would be cucked to not be privy to them.

By hypergamy being so overt and open in society now, men have been pushed to look for the real answers behind what is happening, what works and why. Future generations are going to very different based on this knowledge being made so mainstream and accessible via the internet. Information has never been so freely and quickly accessible before (and this could change very soon) leading to the enlightening of more men than ever before.

The only way to keep both parties happy, men unaware and unconcerned and society intact is to return to a more stable hypergamous society. I'm not sure how we would arrive there from here without some sort of totalitarian rule to reset the rules.
