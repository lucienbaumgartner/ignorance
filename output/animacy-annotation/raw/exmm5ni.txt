He showed moments of stupidity, but mostly just spontaneously in the given moment - the way he was nervous at the Vale trial didn't make sense, why wouod he want to speak to Sansa alone when he'd just been alone with her after the murder?

So not sure - there were plenty of things he could've said at his Wf trial that ge didn't, but maybe he wasn't that great at thinking quickly; not having prepared for it was stupid too.

Bran? First of all Bran already gave him a waening but Lf quickly forgot about it.

Secondly, the writers clearly were confused what to do with Bran, they wanted to do a normal plot without the game-changing allseer but also have him give info - so they sorta did both: have him say this or that but not a bazillion of other things he also could've said.

Here he gives 2 tips but the rest comes from Sansa and Arya - and no one, not the main characters nor esp. the supporting ones, was shown to really react to having an omniscient game-changing God among them.

So it's like "oh - thanks for the info!", or "yeah, he did have an inspiring origin story and it's cool how he knows everything that's happened now that you've mentioned it - aye!" but generally they're quite unaware and unimpressed lol

So with Bran and Lf, mistakes were made - the former especially though, the latter sort of as a consequence.
