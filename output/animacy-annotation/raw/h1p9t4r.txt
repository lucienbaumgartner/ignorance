I mean, what makes you less toxic? You've come to the sub of Lulu mains to tell them they're all either really nice or "the most toxic support players I've ever met" with no in between. This isn't a "little bit of a rant post" it's just a full on rant with you accusing Lulu's of being the most toxic support players you've ever met while patting yourself on the back for how amazingly you played compared to the really bad Lulu that was toxic to you. If you don't see how toxic everything you just said sounds, maybe re-read things and get some perspective. 

The game is full of toxic people, but there's no reason to take the toxicity out of game and go to a sub to tell all the mains that they're toxic. That's pretty weird.  TLDR: Why are you so angry and unaware of how toxic you come off?
