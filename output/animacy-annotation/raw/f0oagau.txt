The bit about Peter Hacker is highly uncharitable. The border of language has no need to be policed. The danger of it being crossed is so nonexistant that you have to explain that all you're doing is to eliminate the sequence "crossing the border of language" from language. Nobody is out to part scientists from their useful metaphors, but that they are metaphors is not a scientific discovery and scientists are not in a better position to rule than anyone else.

Scientists can be perfectly neutral to the whole philosophical fight. When they talk to lay people and they say "the brain thinks" or "the left brain hemisphere knows that such and so, but the right hemisphere doesn't know that," they could just as well accept this explanation of what they really mean:  "you guys, you'll never guess what we discovered, you're so dumb and ignorant that we can't tell you, it takes months and years to begin to understand what our work is and what follows from it; but to give a hint, let me tell you that, although it doesn't mean anything to say that 'the left hemisphere knows that so and so' to you, that's just how we talk to our fellow scientists day in day out! The facts have led us to adopting this symbolism! Freaky, huh?! Do you want to know more?"

It's a big deal in philosophy whether "the left hemisphere thinks" is a proper proposition or a sort of schematic for acquiring a yet to be taught language game. 

The same scientists then go home and teach their children "folk psychology" words the usual way, without involving neural tissue, microscopes, electrodes and what not.
