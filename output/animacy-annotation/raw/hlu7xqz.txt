Oh man, dude, I feel like such an idiot, I am truly sorry for blindly lashing out, that was extremely rude and ignorant of me. Also, that is hilarious!!!! That means, they spent hours in the uniforms taking photos, laughing, and probably doing some random inaccurate impression. Like a Sylvester Stallone voice in Nazi uniforms. Haha. Man, so happy you responded. Makes me want to read more information about them. I just started reading The Story of Civilization Book series. I am on Chapter III of Our Oriental Heritage book. I am not really familiar with Columbia's history, but I would like to know. Sorry for sounding ignorant, but I never considered researching the difference between an individualist culture and a collectivist culture. I see things a little more clear now.
