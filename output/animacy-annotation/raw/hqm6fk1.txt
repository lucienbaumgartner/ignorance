You didn’t frame it like that, you said they’re going to “recycle into the same crime ridden recycling door” you just can’t know for sure and it’s unfair to make assumptions and stigmatize the kids. If you have a problem with the community be the change you want to see by leaving them out of it. They’ll have more problems if the community blames them for what their father did. 

I rarely agree with this sub, don’t pat yourself on the back. You have problems because you’re consistently ignorant and angry. Also you’ve been accused of stalking peoples posts if you get angry enough with them. That’s insane.
