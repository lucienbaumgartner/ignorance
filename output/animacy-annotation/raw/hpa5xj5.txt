As upsetting as it is, it never helps to idolize famous people without really knowing who they are as a person. I'm not one to say I seperate the art from the person. I just mean that our community is moving in a positive direction and people like her; famous or not, will fade into obscurity due to their rigid thinking, and their refusal to adapt to something that completely contradicts what they thought was normal or conventional. 

Sure, her work will be around for a while, but as she gets older; on a personal level she will be like that old couple who just don't understand how newer music can be any good. Or that old person who is kinda racist, but doesn't even realize they are! 

It's time for us younger folks to cultivate these traits, such as:  love, cooperation, equity, equality, &amp; creating a world where future generations will be in a much better space then where we are at now. 

Last thing I'll say before this becomes incredibly long-winded! It's our turn to build the world we want, maybe not for us but by the younger generations. A world in which my 8 year old son would feel free to tell me what his desires are. To feel comfortable enough to tell me if ( he/she/they) were gay, straight, bi, Trans, queer etc and to know that I have my child's back no matter what. I 
like the thought of that world, and this is something I believe will happen. The old guard will fade into obscurity clinging onto the only that they have left....

A romanticized nostalgia, that keeps them happy and ignorant of the ever changing world around them. 

Cheers,
