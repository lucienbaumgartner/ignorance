I went in actually quite excited, and unaware of the critical reception, but honestly came out fairly disappointed.  

The movie simply doesn't have a cohesive narrative.  The characters are all largely thinly developed due to the nature of the ensemble cast, with a disproportionate amount of attention being given to the cast member who is the weakest actor, anf the story is ironically hamstrung by its connection to the broader MCU, being forced to devote time to explain a non-interventionist rationale that simply doesn't hold up in the face of events of Infinity War.   It's visually beautiful, far more so than the standard MCU fare, but the story just doesn't work as a story.
