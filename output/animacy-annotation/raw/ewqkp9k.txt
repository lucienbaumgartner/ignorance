I can agree to a certain extent. Yes, we are, for the most part, soft. The best bet our own government has to make us tolerate oppression and tyranny is to keep us that way. Comfortable, docile, and ignorant. That being said, the mask is slipping, and slipping badly, more often lately, especially with the Epstein suicide.

I believe that there are people out there who will take up arms in the beginning, and drone strikes are not some insurmountable force. People will figure out what's going on, where the strikes are coming from, and retaliate, or find some defense against them. Even if ground troops aren't used, military personnel also aren't mentally inept (though I'm sure some folks would disagree), and I doubt that the government attacking its own citizens would go over well.

I hope it never comes to that. I hope that if it comes down to the wire that the American people will prevail in a peaceful, democratic manner. The world isn't rainbows and lollipops, but it isn't entirely shit all the fucking time either, so I also hope, that if last resorts do need to be taken, that both you and I would do the right thing according to our respective moral compasses. 

And that's what I think is "Real."
