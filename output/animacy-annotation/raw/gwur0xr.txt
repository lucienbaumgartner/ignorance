&gt; well the reason I ask is because it's entirely possible the next coach will be worse than scott, it's always a gamble to fire your coach

it's possible, but scott brooks is so genuinely inept and ignorant of how basketball works that if the play-in tournament wasnt a thing and the wizards were tanking this season, trying out rookie coach prospects like the Thunder did with Coach Diagneault this season would be preferable.

&gt;sometimes a coach will take a team to their ceiling and you need to bring in someone new to push them over the edge, but I dont think scott is at that point yet with the wizards

scott brooks is nowhere near reaching the wizard's ceiling. i watch 80% of our games and brooks runs zero offensive sets and barely has a defensive strategy. his lineups are terrible, and he does not react to changes on the floor. there are some limitations in our roster construction, but we have a LOT more potential than our record would have you suggest, and our current streak of winning is directly correlated with the team getting comfortable with eachother, Westbrook's return from injury, and the pickup of players like Gafford who plug blatant holes in our roster construction.
