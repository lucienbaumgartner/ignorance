Right, I'm being rude, if you say so. I seem to be able to comprehend emotions better than you, I'm not acting like some authority on shit, you're just being rude and seemingly unaware and when called on it you double down. Taking criticism seems very hard for you, you've certainly been hyper critical of me and I've conceded where I agree with you. You seem to be getting increasingly petty, and this discussion isn't going anywhere, so I'm just gonna leave it here. Cheers
