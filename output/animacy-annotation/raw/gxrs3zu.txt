Education and self awareness is the only way out of this people. Stop chasing baba's, yogi's, guru's and god (there is none if it wasn't clear by now). Focus on getting to the truth and ask "why".  

India's state is a bit like advanced cancer. Sometimes chemo doesn't even work and it has to be cut from the body. Not sure what can be done with the illiterate and ignorant that roam the land the rule the country. A common Indian seems to put up with so much.
