Are you claiming that pre British rule of Palestine there was some interfaith/ethnic utopia that existed?
 
While the the Jewish experience in Muslim lands from the medieval to early modern period was more often than not less oppressive and more prosperous than in western Christian lands, they were still considered dhimmis, second class citizens and subordinate to Muslims. Jews still suffered persecutions and pogroms under Muslim rule, even if it was not as bad as the persecution Jews experienced under Western/Christian rule, that doesn't mean it should be forgotten about. Nor should the fact that some Jews were able to gain more wealth and power under Muslim rule be twisted into some false notion that the Jew and Muslim lived in harmony until the Bonger nation "attacked"

Both the Zionist movement and the Arab nationalism that rises in response to it begin long before Britain gains control of Palestine, beginning during the Ottoman period. Increasing amounts Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine during the 19th century radically changed Arab opinion on Jews for the worse as they now believed that the creation of a Jewish state was the goal. Fast forward a bit to 1908 and you get the Young Turk Revolution which causes nationalist sentiment to grow rapidly amongst Arabs in Palestine and most importantly states explicitly that Zionism a threat to Arabs in Palestine.

This trend I've seen lately of just hand waving away any nuance and complexity to an issue that exists in a former colonial territory and just saying "Britain bad" is getting pretty tired and worn out. Britain occupied Palestine from 1920 and 1948, that's 28 years. The idea that what's going on during those 28 years can account for "90% of the required historical context" as you say is just plain wrong and ignorant of the history of the region or of Jewish-Muslim relations since the birth of Islam.

The world was not a utopia prior to the British Empire.
