YTA. You came home from work carrying the weight of a frustrated client. A rule of thumb, leave that at the office. 

When you use the phrases “quit playing stupid” and that you “raised your voice and used cuss words” because more food was needed and eaten than realized, you sound ignorant and just angry. I get that you had to work, but your wife at home was probably on her feet all day, cooking for more than the normal amount of people, probably catering to kids, and presents and guests, and ya know what? It was likely hard on them as well. Their hard work was different than your hard work, but it was hard work nonetheless. 

Yeah, a text saying more food was eaten than originally thought, but that’s no excuse to go off on them.
