but that's comparing a singer with no political aspirations to a guy who's currently running for the us presidency. that's.....pretty freaking different. she is basically being taken out of jobs she would otherwise have, based on nothing but just her own personal political beliefs. that's like getting fired from a job because you happen to be a democrat or republican. (and a hop skip and a jump away from other kinds of discrimination). so now what? if they can, a person who wants the job would then have to pretend to be such and such in order to keep it, regardless of how they feel.

so i would fault lancome for not standing up for themselves (but understandable given no one's going to fuck with china), for being unaware and naive to just how the china government still works today, for showing their hand in abandoning hk to embrace the mainland (but again understandable), but for offering the job to the singer who's entirely competent at her job in the first place is not one of their faults.

lol, more downvotes? sure, whatever.
