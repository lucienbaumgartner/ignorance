Is the $5/bag fee on some sort of an individual contractor basis, or is it actually with the cleaning business?

A business charging any sort of fee doesn't usually end up with kickbacks to the peon that does the work, if I get a late fee for not paying my mortgage, the bank teller that takes the payment doesn't earn that fee. You'd be lucky to get even a thank you from your boss.

You sound very young and unaware of how capitalism works. Also the fact that the boss is your mother is going to go even worse for you, she'll just pull the "I raised you" card.
