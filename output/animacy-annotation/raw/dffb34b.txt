Also i think something went majorly wrong in the writing room with all of this. You can see it with a lot of aspects. What happened with the whelmwige, the supposed dainsleif feature of kimaris vidar's wepaons, vidar, is just one example. 

this rushed mess of an ending feels contrived. mcgillis plan being so shallow also just seems contrived after all the guile he displayed. something went majorly wrong here.

and it seems like we won't even be given either iok or Rustal dying at some point..... his whole bullshit bout 'history will remember' and crap jsut does not work with im. he is too shallow, unaware, and corrupt for him to understand it. also that whole dainsleif shoulda caused enormous harm.
