Good evening. So, quick question. Let’s say - ‘Fred’ did an otc trade of $150k to his bank, but ended up in the hospital due to getting hit by a drunk driver , followed by getting covid while healing ( still in the hospital). This was during the beginning of bear season this year end of April beginning of May. Naturally, unaware, and unable to monitor said assets ( $450k poof gone ). How would that be reported ..? Capital gains $150k, losses $450k? Hypothetical, of course.
