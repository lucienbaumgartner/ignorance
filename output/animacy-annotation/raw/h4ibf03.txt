I must be blind to the egregiousness of these bugs. Like I see a feature that has a few missing Pokémon and that’s it. When I change views, it works. When I look at event dex, I see the costumes. Like… are we really that mad that they haven’t swept the past luckies and past hundos? Jeez. 

Also: I repeatedly release stuff aware and unaware of bugs. My post didn’t say I do it once and only once. It’s like you thought I was excusing one occurrence. Nope, I’m informing you it is common.
