That’s incredibly stupid and ignorant of male nature as well as an incredibly bad take on my comment.    People are attracted to individuals, nor “loyalty” or “niceness.”   I said if you specifically don’t like someone you shouldn’t ignore your dislike because you think they’re safe or can’t do any better.   Not that you shouldn’t date someone you like who’s also loyal.   

You’re perpetuating this stupid cliche that shy nerdy men are more virtuous because of their awkwardness.
