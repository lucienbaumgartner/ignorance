Jesus Christ man.  Do you really think hedge funds that shorted retail brick and mortar stores into the dirt ONLY SHORTED GAMESTOP?  Are you retarded and unaware of how sociopathic finance bros behave?   

If hedge funds get a small squeeze from any of their short positions, it hurts them and helps all of the holders of the stocks they shorted.  

GME might be the most unique because I think retail owns the float, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t costing the hf’s $$hundreds of millions+ to put a dent in. That means they have less to cover other shorts with.  

It’s impressive how unbelievably closed minded and retarded some of you truly are in an unironic way
