It's especially frustrating because John Fetterman is a good candidate. He is committed to voting with the interests of real, working Americans. Which unfortunately has become a rarity, even in the democratic party. Republicans can get away with not writing legislation to better the lives of their constituents because Republicans are so unbelievably ignorant and gullible that you just have to yell about Mr Potato Head or White Replacement and you will get their vote. Fetterman is a good dude and the fact that Mehmet Oz has a fair chance based on his name, and grifty attitude is super lame and sad.
