your generation gives me so much hope. I was working one time and someone around your age complimented my bisexual flag necklace and earrings. They were with their mother, who seemed kinda strict and unaware of what the flags represented. I hope they're safe, but I'm glad they felt safe enough to compliment me on it. I will always cherish that moment.
