You: "I really didnâ€™t ask for your dumb ass opinion."

Also you: "MOMMY, HE CALLED ME A NAME!"

I already gave my rebuttal, and you called it whataboutism, because you don't know what that term means. 

You said that Americans are dumber than other people, and then said "lalala I'm not listening," when I pointed out that you're wrong and ignorant of the world.

You also said that I don't know what's happening in the US, while saying that people are being evicted.
