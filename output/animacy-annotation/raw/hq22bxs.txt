So let's trace back how this conversation progressed:

\- OP posts some bizarre only-in-Russia ganglike police activity

\- Several "original" and "clever" redditors thrust their opinion into the conversation that the US police behave the same way

\- They get called out for being ignorant and reactionary

\- You totally own them by saying "Why would you even need to compare them to America?1?1?!!!"

Brilliant
