That doesn’t make stealing them and still holding onto them ok. And  it’s also pretty racist of you to imply the people in the countries they were stolen from are so incompetent and ignorant that they need white people to preserve it for them. It doesn’t belong to them. It’s not the place of white people to decide for them. That’s called having a white saviour complex. If they wanted your help, they’d ask for it. End of discussion.
