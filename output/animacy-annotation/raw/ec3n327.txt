&gt; You wouldn't think so looking at this sub and it's narrow Americo-centric view point.
&gt; 
&gt; FFS sake most of the posters here are so undereducated and ignorant that they actually believe Bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat dollars to increase one's fiat holdings - just like their bankster media overlords told them.
&gt; 
&gt; Dumb as the day is long !!!
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the rest of the planet is waaaaay ahead and accumulating bitcoin by selling their fiat - NEVER to return - EXITING the fraudulent legacy financial system, because we understand the bloodless silent revolution that IS bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Wake up Umerca, catch up. It is YOUR imperialist regime that is falling apart.
