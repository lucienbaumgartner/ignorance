It would be awesome if OP and Cindy started dating/move in/maybe even eventually get married.  

If Cindy’s demon is trapped as well, they could help each other figure out an escape plan.  

In the meantime, the two dumbasses are blissfully unaware and happy together, making it most convenient for the demons to work together because they are constantly in contact.  It’s win-win for everybody.
