First, I asked if they look like people who would use blanks, not where they are from. Second, they look so careless and ignorant, that even if they are using blanks, at that range, or if they point any of the guns towards a person, they can kill that person.  Third, who said anything about the Middle East? - this shit happens where I live, and I'm in Europe, I can literally hear shots fired each and every Friday and Saturday night, when most of the weddings happen.


You are ignorant if you think race or ethnicity plays a role in cases where people handle weapons carelessly - it can be anyone from anywhere, the way these people in the video used the guns, to led me to assume that they are careless gun operators.
