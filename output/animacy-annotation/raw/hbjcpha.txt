Not so worried about OD’ing just worried that I’ll be so dehydrated and unaware of it and then something happen ya know plus the panic attacks are terrible once I tried to hold my breath just to see how long I could ( on lsd ofc ) and I damn near made myself pass out I couldn’t tell how long I was doing it and when I finished or finally convinced myself to breathe i had this crazy pain in my chest same as the dry mouth night but I was on lsd and some edibles 
Also I will definitely look into these suggestions I really appreciate y’all’s feed back
