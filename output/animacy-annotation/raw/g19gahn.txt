Go right ahead and show me that polling data then. Seems pretty suspect considering Biden very easily won the Dem primary. Why would people vote for Biden over Bernie if they think Bernie has a better chance at beating Trump? That makes no sense at all.  Also polling data is often very wrong. Source: 2016. 

Biden isn't an empty suit, Biden just isn't hardcore left wing which Democrats believe is the best bet at beating Trump as Trump is likely to lose almost all of the moderate votes to Biden while Bernie would potentially lose all of them and hand the election to Trump. 

Trump also isn't assaulting polling so I'm not sure what you would want Biden to do about that. Trump made a dumbass tweet, as he often does, because he's impulsive and unaware that he doesn't actually have the legal authority to postpone the election or change how states hold their own Presidential elections.
