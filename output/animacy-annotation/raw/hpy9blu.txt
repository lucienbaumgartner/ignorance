Do they realize Leo did that documentary Before the Flood? I think that's what it's called. If people knew that, they would know immediately where he stands on all of this.

I thought the ilm was excellent in getting the point across. Of course it made me angry watching the people act so ignorant and stupid, but that was the intended effect. Brilliant movie imo.
