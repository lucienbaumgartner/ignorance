Bulging discs/herniated discs are asymptomatic in a huge portion of the population and have been shown to spontaneously heal over time. Even in the event that they don’t heal on imaging, people return to full pain free function even with the injury more often than not. The vast, vast majority of people return to full pain free function following a disc herniation through a combination of time and conservative management. You are severely misguided and ignorant of the research. That is not your fault, but that’s why I chimed in to let you know you’ve been given poor advice. Take from that what you will. Have a good day.
