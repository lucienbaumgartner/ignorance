I can tell you as the person who wrote this.. it had nothing to do with their race. Before they started talkjin crap about us i had alot of good feelings toward them and felt like we can relare to them in some ways as im also an asian / minority. But these people had proven to be ignorant and just awful. And the truth was they were doing stuff wrong which is why the cops arrested them. We can day what we want but rhese dudes were criminals and evem tho i hears alot of what theyd talk about i still didnt judge them till they started on about my family
