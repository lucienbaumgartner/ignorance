WWII heroes defeated the fascists (much like hillbilly Drumph supporters). My grandfather and his brothers signed up to help defeat Nazi Germany (fat Donny's family came from Germany, hence the attraction to fascism). They were not fighting socialists. On the political continuum, socialism is at the opposite end of fascism, ffs!

 How can anyone be this fucking stupid and ignorant of fairly recent history? 

It's no wonder y'all are so fucked up. You are being fed garbage and you're too stupid to know it's garbage.

Eat up!
