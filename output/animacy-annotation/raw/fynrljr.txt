Correction. Not complaining. Expressing my views on this. Iâ€™ve replied to many comments that this can just as well be applied to women. I am not discounting that in any way. I have even encouraged a few people to go ahead and make a list for the ladies. Another comment even stated to someone who was quite hostile and ignorant that everything I said can be turned around to fit a female scenario and variables. Change the hunting and fishing pics to pictures of us with eye makeup looks and pictures of a palette. Girls who have multiple pictures with guys, same thing applies. For the girls who are taller than average, we love them too. I am by no means saying this is purely a gender-sided thing. It just so happens that I am a female and I am not going to say what I think a man wants the ladies to know that we might not know.
