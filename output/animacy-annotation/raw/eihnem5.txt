I heard you guys were bandying about Heidi’s name? Please don’t — she’s a great character who deserves 100 or at least Top 150. Her, Matt, Rob, and Deena are the Top 4 for that season imho (with Christy as a close fifth who can be substituted for any of the four).

Heidi’s brand of energetic earnestness (as opposed to Morgan McLeod aka Diet Heidi who had more of a deadpan earnestness) remained unmatched and unemulated until basically Angelina “Endgame 🧥 🥚” Keeley... and Heidi is a rare female example of the Drew Christy/Siska “hilariously unaware and relatively harmless arrogant person who proclaims they’re a badass” trope. That trope is almost always male, and Heidi is great female take on it. She’s so unique as a villain, who is normally made out to be intentionally catty rather than Heidi’s oblivious bitchiness, and she’s one of the few “fun” parts of Amazon.
