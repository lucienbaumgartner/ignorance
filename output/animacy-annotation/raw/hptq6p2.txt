i live in this town (moved here from Roseville after rent skyrocketed and could no longer hope to afford it). ten years ago i went to this high school and helped found the GSA club. In those past ten years, this town has regressed horribly.

im on the town's Facebook page and this just isn't being discussed at all. not a peep besides that the superintendent herself posted her own response letter on the page. here's what an actual person commented on it: "Not trying to start anything, but why should they be expelled? It didnâ€™t take place on school properly, nor was it a school event."

There's a lot to unpack right there.

The rest of the community page is just people worrying about who they can buy tamales from for Christmas and about getting rid of the mask mandate at our schools. people here are ignorant and scary. I don't go to community events and I sure as fuck don't interact with people outside my immediate group that I don't know. It was strange to realize the FAST regression in Wheatland. I guess in high school I was ignorant and wanted to believe that people were better than that.

But I've seen these kids walking around town. Their parents know what they've done and so does the school district. I can almost promise that nothing will happen to them unless the next school board meeting is overrun with parents demanding punishment, but it won't be because parents here only come to meetings to yell and scream and claw at the school board over lifting the mask requirement. yay, small town living.
