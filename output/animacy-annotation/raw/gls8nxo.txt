&gt;I think this is more of a conversation about the situation, not the weapon. The police were completely unprepared and unaware of the attacker until it was too late. This situation cannot be compared to the many examples of police using excessive force as the first means of response before any attempts at deescalation. Of course, if it wasn't completely obvious, I'm strictly speaking of scenarios where police go into the situation with the full knowledge that someone is armed with a knife, not when they pop-out from behind the door during an unrelated call, as in, this was initially a missing persons call; not a weapons call.


You absolutely just argued that knowing a knife is involved lowers the lethal risk, as you’re arguing knowing ahead of time changes the validity of responding with force.  It does not, because in both situations the risk and response is determined by proximity and intent of the person with the knife.



If you don’t understand what you’re arguing, maybe its a good time to stop?
