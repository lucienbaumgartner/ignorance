All these stories in the comments are so depressing. Please stay strong everyone, try not to let other people ruin your life. I know it's hard trying to maintain a positive perspective when you have family and close friends who end up turning a relationship toxic because of ignorant and selfish views.

Merry Christmas 🎄☃️. Stay up!
