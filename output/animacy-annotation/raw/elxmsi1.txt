Tell him. There's a lot going on here, but the thing that rings out to me the loudest is that whether they've said anything or not his friends have definitely noticed his behavior. It sounds like he is blatantly treating you differently around them, and thats going to paint an untrue picture of your relationship to them.

Its very possible that he is just unaware and uncomfortable, I know that even I'm really social I just have certain situations that I just blank in and act weird because...well, I don't know how to act, until I'm comfortable at least.

But at the end of the day, this sounds like it just sucks, and there's no reason you shouldn't feel like you can talk to him about it. Your feelings about it are very valid.
