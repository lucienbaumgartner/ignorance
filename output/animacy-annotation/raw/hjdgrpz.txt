&gt;Unvaccinated will be symptomatic and self-isolate. 

I have my doubts that those unwilling to take a vaccine to protect themselves and others will now do the right thing if they get a cough.  And they can still be asymptomatic.

&gt;Vaccinated will travel all over, unaware and untested, spreading covid around without ever knowing it until grandma is on the ventilator. 

And they're just as likely to clear the virus and not infect anyone.   
I agree with the testing issue, but there's a whole bunch of wild assumptions here to try and make your point.
