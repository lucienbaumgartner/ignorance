Booyah Bomb is the least punishable panic button in the game, especially with a main of SpPU. It is the closest you're going to get to "save for last" kind of special. 

Clash can't start a confrontation, it has no mobility to approach anything, no damage output to overpower anything and no backup plan to leave an engagement, it has all of the downsides of blasters with none of their power. Again, it only splats unaware and wounded opponents, both of which Aero, or indeed most weapons, don't have problems with.

Meanwhile Aero is second only to Sploosh and Tetras at its ability to gain ground on people (and backpedal too), it's genuinely dangerous up close (with PG stretching the definition of "up close" with the burst bomb, on a fresh accuracy check it can feasibly fight from the tip of its range), and it has a good panic button for when all else fails. All of that also translates into good ability to pick up overexending and wounded opponents, as well as making for a servicable shark and a good tower rider for Clash's favourite mode.
