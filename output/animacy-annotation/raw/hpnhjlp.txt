Seems like a red flag to me, guilt tripping you for not putting out everyday despite the fact you work 80 hours a week?
As others have said, explain to her that tired and you don't have the energy, if she doesn't understand I doubt shes worth your time.its a sign that shes very selfish and unaware of the feelings of others.

Also I find it helps to flip the situation to get a better perspective. How would people view it if you didn't work, she worked an 80 hour week and you demanded sex everyday. The woman would defo be advised to leave the dude in the scenario...
