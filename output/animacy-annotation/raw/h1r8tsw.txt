This is something people have discussed for a long time, the article itself is from 2016 but contains a quote from George Orwell first published in 1941:

&gt;England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “God Save the King” than of stealing from a poor box.

Just because you're uneducated and unaware of the past doesn't mean I'm making things up.
