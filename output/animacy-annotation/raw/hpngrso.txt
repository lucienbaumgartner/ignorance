&gt;it wont matter how much information I give you or how many research papers I link, you will only believe what the government says and be happy about it

I don't give a shit what the government says. I care about what the data says. The government has fucked this whole situation up completely. 

So how about you focus on my points instead of trying to guess where my bias lies?

&gt;The goal has always been herd immunity with literally any virus ever in existence even with this one until now it seems and they estimated it would require roughly 80% for this virus but its nto the same for every virus...

70 - 80% is a pretty standard range for a herd immunity target. And given the infection rate of covid I'd say the 80% sounds pretty reasonable.

&gt;Based on the CDC's own tracker 87.7% of people at or older than 65 Years of Age have been "fully" vaccinated. With 72.6% of people at or older than 18 years of age are "fully" vaccinated. That 61.6% of the "total population" includes all of the people that even you agree should probably not be getting the vaccine anyway, it also includes the demographic of people who have not been impacted by the virus in the slightest.

That's not how herd immunity works. Main figure that matters is total population vaccinated. It doesn't matter that certain age groups are over the 80%, those age groups don't exist in isolation, they're part of the population as well. Herd immunity only works if the total population is above the immunity threshold, not just the vulnerable portion of the population. 

&gt;Again, looking at the CDC's own trackers those at and under the age of 17 years old are highly unlikely to catch, fall ill, or die from this virus so forcing them to take this drug in order to "protect themselves" from the virus in order participate in society or go to school is extremely ignorant and unscientific. 

That age group doesn't need to take the vaccine to "protect themselves" they should be taking it primarily to protect others.

They are much less likely to get sick or die (catch is highly debatable), but they are high contact risks making them the prime age group to spread the disease (which is also made harder because they are often asymptomatic)

&gt;Then we factor in the percentage of population who have caught and survived who would now have the natural antibodies which is another 12% give or take...

Where are you getting that figure from?

The recovered unvaccinated likely have highly [variable immunity which likely wanes over time unless vaccinated in addition (or reinfected) ](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/covid-immunity-following-natural-infection-likely)

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-08-06/cdc-covid-19-reinfections-among-unvaccinated-twice-as-likely-than-among-vaccinated%3fcontext=amp

The only way to guarantee these people have immunity is to get vaccinated.

&gt;So if we blow away the FUD, those who would be most impacted by the virus (65+) are above the 80% herd immunity. 

Again. Not how herd immunity works. You have to factor the whole population (the "herd") togethor.

&gt;But there are no studies that present any evidence to suggest they are safe either...?

No... That's my entire point. It's impossible to know with 100% certainty what the long term side effects of covid or the vaccine is. So I don't understand why you were initially only worried about one but not the other?

&gt;You actually believe that taking away an individuals means of providing for themselves or their families if they don't take this drug is totally okay

[Vaccine mandates are nothing new](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211029-why-mandatory-vaccination-is-nothing-new). Many jobs have always required vaccinations of various types.

If you refuse the conditions of the workplace you relinquish your right to work there. This has always been the case.
