I’m not at all excusing anti vaxxers here, but the American healthcare industry is pretty quick to point fingers at anti-vaxxers for the ICU and COVID crisis in this country rather than hospitals that refuse to properly prepare for catastrophic events in order to cut costs. Even if they’re misguided and misinformed, is it really that surprising that so many Americans distrust healthcare? After years of being relentlessly screwed over and lied to by insurance companies, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, is the antivax movement really that surprising? Maybe it’s time we focus on our failed system as the root of the issue and stop giving any more airtime to the ignorant and uneducated.
