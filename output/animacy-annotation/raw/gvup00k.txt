How to help a loved one that is going through psychosis.
Both when they are aware and unaware of the condition.
Also, I don't know if there is any proven techniques here but how to speak to someone in denial about their psychosis.
 My personal experience here is being non judgemental and offering support can lead to the person interpreting this as validation, while confronting the behaviour leads to alienation.

I'd live to hear any insight you had on those topics as it something I'm finding difficult right now.
