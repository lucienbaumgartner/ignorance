 Those are probably currently the top 2 teams in the nation and I would not be shocked at all to see a rematch of this game in the final four/championship game this year.  Wish I could go back to last April and take Duke to win it this year at those odds, probably the best odds you'd get out of a Duke team in 20+ years... it was disrespectful and ignorant of dukes body of work over the last 30 years.  K got str8 disrespected in the polls this off-season.  Who in the fuck made the decision to have unproven coaches(Memphis) and schools(multiple examples) building teams in unproven ways (Texas) ahead of a Duke who had several returning pieces, top 3 recruiting year, and a top 1 coach going into the final year of one of the most successful and historic runs ever in the NCAAB?  Disrespectful and eneducated.  Covid wiped people's memories or something.  Very confusing top 25 going into this year.  Didn't take long for cream to rise.  BTW I meant no disrespect to Texas or Memphis, they just came to mind as examples of schools who sat above Duke in the pre-season polls that had Duke outside the top ten looking in... looking in at some curious names and faces.  Texas did unprecedented things with that transfer portal and a first year coach that wasnt in the greatest position (after that fall apart at the end of last season in terms of the first round exit), and Penny has Memphis feeling more relevant then they have in 15 years.  I understand the excitement, and I'm excited too.  But to have these teams rising at the expense of Duke just seemed ignorant and confusing, I've been confused by this since the very first preseason poll (released 5 minutes after the year prior tournament concludes).  It took like 3 weeks for Duke to remind everyone, how did entire staffs full of experts not see this coming.  Let's goooo, I love college basketball!  ‚ù§ üèÄ
