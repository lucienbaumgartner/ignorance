Listen to what I'm about to say and listen carefully. You post something like this to make everyone feel like there is a fake outrage about something there is not. Then, you go on T_D and be outraged with your friends... do you not see how stupid and ignorant that makes you. You draw the left as some kind of hyperbolic cartoon, then you, the artist, goes out with all the other cartoonist, and rages over how fucking stupid your own art is. 

No one in this thread or any other in regards to this man are saying nerfed guns and super soakers should be banned or that they represent toxic masculinity, aside from people that post in T_D. Its fucking pathetic.

I think the problem is you, and people like you, are so susceptible to being manipulated, and you are aware of it, you're afraid of shit that scares you. You're afraid you'll do it too if it becomes normalized. 

Gays have rights? Now all of a sudden you want to fuck your friend Frank in the ass and it's the libtards fault! I mean amirite? Guns have restrictions of some sort? Oh no! Now you cant protect yourself from your boy Brad just taking that ass when he wants. You would fight him off, but you played 1 year of JV football and got really heavy into memeing after a kid from California called Chad took your spot.
