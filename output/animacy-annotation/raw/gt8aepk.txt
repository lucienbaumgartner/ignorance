Back when humans lived in caves, didn't know how and didn't have ground to grow grains,  it was natural because they did it to survive. Both to not freeze to death and not starve to death.


Today in 2021, it is not natural. (Unless you live in some tribe in amazon completely sheltered and unaware of the rest of the world...) 


Nothing about eating animals today is natural. 
We don't need it, we don't do it for survival, we do it simply because "bacon is nice". It's for personal pleasure and selfishness. Humans do the most damage to this planet and the ecosystem
