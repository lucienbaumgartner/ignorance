I've already answered this.  Racists on the right have no political power.  Just laugh at them or fight them.  They literally can't do anything to me.  Racists on the left, like you, have *actual* power because you can impact my work and my children's education.  

I'm done taking with you, you literally don't understand the world.  You don't understand it because you live in an echo-chamber bubble.  Almost all parents I speak to agree with me that liberal Democrats have turned into a raging pack of racists, but they are too scared to say anything out of fear of losing their jobs.  People like you are the fucking problem, you're uneducated and unaware of what's actually happening in the world. 

Don't reply, I'm done.
