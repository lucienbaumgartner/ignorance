Bruh, he needs time to get his rotations down on both sides, especially now that everyone is back. Lakers will always go with AD at C (like how they ended the game) but Drummond will get mins over Marc right now so they can play better together later. Vogel isn't stupid and ignorant of Marc's positive mins on the court.
