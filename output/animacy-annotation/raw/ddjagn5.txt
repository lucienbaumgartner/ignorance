Yeaup. Staples is actuallly retarded. 

Every single customer that shops at staples is willing to pay twice as much for things as on amazon. Usually because they are either affluent and trying to avoid walmart customers but don't use online shopping OR old and unaware that staples is a terrible deal. 

Staples should cherish these customers with incredible return policies and anything else they can do to make them happy , b/c they pay twice as much. Staples should grow profit by internal efficiency, because raising the price to three times as much isn't going to work. Trying to attach unwanted horse shit in mass, and selling your customers inferior products against their will is the most retarded thing you can do a set of desirable customers like this.

Staples is destroying the trust its customers have for it. And Walmart et al can do that - there customres don't give a ffuck and shop for price. Staples cannot.
