No it doesn't. The animation team has no fucking creative control over models at all, they can't just decide to give Sylvanas a scarred model and even if they could it has to be approved by other teams and funded. 

Fuck even the people who draw up the storyboards or concept art don't really have control. They have to have their shit approved before it ever passes down the chain.

Trying to say the guy who rendered the model for Sylvanas shares blame with the Art Director is just stupid and ignorant of the process.
