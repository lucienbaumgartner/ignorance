I despise Alexis Ren. I watched a 50 questions Q&amp;A video a couple months ago on her YouTube channel and she really really rubbed me the wrong way. She is so out of touch with reality. In the YouTube video she made so many harmful statements and she overall sounded very privileged and unaware that she has a large platform. So when I listened to this weeks episode, I was not surprised when once again I was so mad hearing Alexis speak. Her views on food, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and the world in general are so HARMFUL! I am so thankful Alex spoke up at the end to denounce Alexis’ victim blaming mentality. Obviously I feel bad for Alexis for the loss of her mother and the horrible things she’s been through, but I am so disappointed in her dangerous use of her platform.
