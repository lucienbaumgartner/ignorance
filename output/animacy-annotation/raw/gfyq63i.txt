&gt;What evidence exactly? You just decided Cypriots and Armenians are killing their babies 

I don't know about those places specifically. However, combine the words "rural" and "impoverished" and shade in the map. Where it's shaded in, that's where such practices occur, and have been occurring for thousands of years. China is not unique in that way.

&gt;ke, I live in a country that's basically the same as Cyprus in almost every regard, there are many, many Cypriots living here (as well as Armenians) and the suggestion is just so offensive and ignorant that it's simply laughable.

Again:

&gt;I mean, it's clear you don't read what people post when you ask them to, but it's probably unwise to simply show off that you are too lazy to read.
