A good wikileaks email to show people to wake them up about the people in the government and how they really think is #3599- the "unaware and compliant citizenry email.

&gt;  "And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."
