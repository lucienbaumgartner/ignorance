It’s kind of a tough one, because the way Reaper’s Bones are structured they do not have to PvP to advance themselves. This technically tracks with the notion of piracy and freedom of choice, but it does create a rift in the player base between those that want to prioritize combat/conflict and those that are seeking completionism/unlockables. 

I often ponder the idea of then adding the Sea Dogs as an emissary in Adventure Mode to balance this out. Where advancement in the emissary could be centered around combat points rather than loot acquisition. Bring over some of the arena rules (you get emissary points for shots hit/ships sunk), add a victor’s trophy (like an emissary flag but specific to the dogs), and build in some mechanics to tamp out damage farming and spawn camping (ex. If you fly the sea dogs emissary you can’t repair other crews ships, or there is a damage point cap, etc). Additionally the Sea Dogs idolize, above all else, the glory and honor of combat. They have pride and shame, where as the Reaper’s have no rules. 

That way there is a true, pure PvP faction. The reaper’s are just anarchists and logically you start to run into dead ends if you chastise them for really any choice they make. If someone was running a sea dog flag and running though, you could clearly point at them and say: a) you are either new and ignorant of the rules or b) wtf come back here why have you been running for 20 minutes I sureashellknowyouarentgettinfsuppliesgoddammitFIGHTME
