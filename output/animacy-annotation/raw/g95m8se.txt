It must hurt to be so close-minded and unaware of history that you can't comprehend something that doesn't confirm your world view.

Most of the comments here are about how religion and most people who are religious are stupid and/or bad people. Spend 5 minutes reading the threads for proof.

Most scientific progress has absolutely been made by religious people and organizations. Shit, the Big Bang Theory was originally conceived by a *catholic priest* in the 1920s, and most medical care and research is, and has been throughout history, provided by religious groups as far back as ancient Egypt. 

And yes, most of the followers of Abrahamic religion do actually acknowledge that the other 2 worship the same God. You only hear argument from the uneducated among them, an unfortunately vocal minority.
