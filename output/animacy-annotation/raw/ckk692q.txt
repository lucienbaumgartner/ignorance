If a server gives a table their best effort, and legitimately tries to make the experience good, they deserve 15%. If they make a ton of mistakes, 10% may be warranted. Servers in the states make their money on tips. I haven't seen a paycheck in 2 years, but I make 40,000/yr. But the shitty (inexperienced) servers don't make that much, so have some sympathy. They have bills and kids and stuff. If someone is in the service industry and they aren't also in school, something probably went wrong in their life at some point.

If the server is completely unattentive and unaware, that is a different story. If you want to sit there and text instead of getting a refill, you deserve a shitty tip. If the server is unnecessarily and repeatedly rude, they deserve a shitty tip.
