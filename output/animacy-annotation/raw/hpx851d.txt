I'm not wrong, and I can back it up. I could go on for hours listing evidence for my claim and you would still be wrong and a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. I have the entire scientific consensus backing up my claims, what do you have?

Guess I'm the idiot for trying to educate people that are clearly very comfortable being ignorant and proud of it, or maybe just trolls. Don't know, don't care. Happy holidays.
