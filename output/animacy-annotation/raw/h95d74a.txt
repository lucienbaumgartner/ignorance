Did you see this part in black space? Basically, you cannot interact with anything but the cat, and the only option is to kill it. You get a lot of dialogue implying the cat is innocent and unaware of the situation and you should feel hesitate to kill it. You don't need to kill it, just stab yourself like how you normally wake up, but most people only find out when it's done.
