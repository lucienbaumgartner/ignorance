Yeah, I honestly don't get why would anyone ever think it's about food. Dogs with plenty of others giving them food will still go crazy when their owner/"loved one" arrives, even the more extreme examples aside. It's supremely egoistic and ignorant of humans to think only they can feel love and other emotions.
