So? Then when they get a place they'll give notice and pay the lease break fee. Getting prequalified for another place has nothing to do with you and your bullshit ego. It's not your place to try and penalize them for looking elsewhere. In fact, judging by how ignorant and vindictive you've been in this thread, I'd move out as soon as I met you. None of the assumptions you've made should be held against them because they are just assumptions until proper notice has been given.
