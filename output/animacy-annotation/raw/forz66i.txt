Hindsight is 2020 but this seemed like a botched "bomb" disposal.

It is kinda like having everyone standing around a potential bomb that wasn't going anywhere while they figured out what kind of bomb it was and how to disarm it. shouldn't they have evacuated the immediate area around the car and delivered commands via megaphone or something? 

They had the car blocked in, I feel it was an unfortunate choice to be right next to the car while the "threat" was unaware and unable to present intent. This pretty much ensured a life or death scenario reliant on the wits of a person who had just passed out at a drive-though.
