Moreover, I believe that it is not only a corporatist plot, they are merely profiting from these circumstances, as they otherwise would even were the situation the opposite as it is now (for as long as they continue to be a force that is), the culprits surrounding all of this are social conservatives from all over the sphere, be it political and/or social, pushing the pseudo-scientific brain development narrative which directly is tied to the notion that children are innocent beings and therefore require to be sheltered from "inappropriate" contents (such content vaguely defined by necessity, as it does not really exists after all).  

Children are routinely dismissed, berated if they even dare saying something as individuals, let alone as a group, especially if it defies "common knowledge" and assumptions about them.  We even label them with rubbish, dehumanising, medical terms like "Oppositional Defiant Disorder" if they do not conform to the selfish expectations imposed upon them. 

We do this, we actively remove them from having knowledge we consider "bad" or "forbidden" and then we also wonder why they are left vulnerable and unaware of certain activities, etc.  Even more unfortunate, but unsurprising for the dire times we live in, I have seen youth liberationists themselves who are stupid enough to side with the ageists in efforts of sheltering children by endorsing ideas and concepts that would logically ever conclude to violations of their autonomy and the denial of self-directed pursuits.  

It is, no need to say, sad that Western society is so removed from the reality of children while also using them as scapegoats and blaming them for their own incompetence in addressing issues relating to them.
