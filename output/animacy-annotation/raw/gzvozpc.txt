&gt; I'm sorry I triggered you broðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

&gt; 

You really didn't.

&gt;Well it's not really irrelevant because I'm comparing the thought process of a human in contrast to a dog.

Thought process is way more than just psychology.

&gt;What's so misleading about saying humans dont eat their loved one?

Because you're acting like it's a universal fact rather than a trend we happen to be in.

&gt;Cannibalism is taboo in nearly every culture to deny that is extremely misleading and ignorant of yourself.

It's taboo in nearly every culture *right now* and I never denied that. It did used to be common place.

&gt;cannibalism leads to other problems within society which can lead to the collapse of the civilisation

LOL you got a source on that?

I mean, to be honest, you come across as someone who hasn't spent much time, if any, actually studying other cultures. In addition, you've moved the goalposts so far I think you've forgotten your actual argument which is that "eating loved ones is universally and objectively a sign of disrespect across all species so why do we think dogs respect us if they do this?"
