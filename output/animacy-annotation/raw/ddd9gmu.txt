LOL. Trump is doing almost everything he said he would. Every President before him lied about almost everything. Obama did nothing but lie and twist facts to make it look like he wasn't lying. Obama's people even got caught bragging about lying to the public about the Iran deal. Podesta said in his emails that they strive for an "unaware and compliant citizenry." Hillary had her "public stance and her private stance." Obama told Russia he would be able to change his stance after the election. Because he was lying to get elected. 


If anything, Trump tells the truth too much. Because the media goes and twists it into things it's not. 


I can't believe people in r/politics think politicians have always been honest.
