I think it’s natural and expected to withdraw and have less connections in other aspects of the relationship. The LL partner has shown themselves to not care and not be willing to put in effort to improve something that bothers you or that you say is important for the relationship. It’s hard to care about them when they don’t care about you. Quite frankly, it’s quite selfish and ignorant of them to expect anything but the withdrawal. It’s even worse when they act like nothing is wrong and then ask you what’s wrong.
