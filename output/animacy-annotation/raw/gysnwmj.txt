Dude, sex without proper consent is rape. This girl is brave enough to publicly announce that she was foolish enough to rape a man and only ever realise it was rape many months/years later.

The man was clearly uncomfortable and very clearly didn't want this to happen, he did not say yes or no most likely because he was conflicted and pressured, he was probably scared of the social outcome that would occur if he didnt go through with it.
Rape is unwanted sex. sex without permision from both parties involved. 
Rape is not always violent, it is when sex is forced upon someone else with utter disregard for what they want.

In fact even if he did say yes it would be classified as sexual coercion which is rape. It happens when someone is pressured or threatened into saying yes to sex. 
Calling rape a learning experience is not only incredibly insensitive and ignorant of you it is also just plain stupid.
This women is brave enough to publicly admit her terrible mistake and has even tried to reach out to the man to apologise after she realised wgat she did.

I understand that rape can be an overused term sometimes and the consequenses of misusing that term can be great. however, the reason the term garners so much attention is because of the reaction it gives to people. It spread awareness that there are indeed some bad people out there.

The context of the situation beforehand doesn't matter. a man was peer pressured into unwanted sex. He was sexually coerced. And he was raped.
An experience like that can traumatise a person and make them sick. I cannot imagine the horrors and struggle the man would've gone through after the experience.

Rape is rape. Not a learning experience.
