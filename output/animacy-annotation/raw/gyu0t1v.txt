Adding bike lanes only alleviates traffic if people stop driving and start biking... and that just isn't viable for many people. 

My kids go to different schools, I work across town from there, am I supposed to bike 20+ miles every day with kids strapped to my back? 

Public transit is likewise slow and inefficient, i don't have several spare hours to waste meandering through town and waiting to transfer busses. 

Assuming everyone is able enough to bike or has the time to bus is pretty privileged and ignorant of the real world and peoples lives.
