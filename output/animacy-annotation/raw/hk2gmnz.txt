I've met two broad types of Christians:

One type (those Christians whom I am willing to be friends with) are respectful of others' beliefs and adopt a live-and-let-live attitude. I have Christian friends who know that I am Heathen and to whom it is a non-issue. I have my beliefs, they have theirs, and we don't interfere with each other. 

The other type I am not willing to be friends with. These people do *not* respect others' beliefs, and try to push theirs on others as much as possible. They are arrogant and socially unaware, and occasionally even try to tell *me* what *I* believe. 

In real life, I meet more of the first kind than the second. Online, it's the other way around.
