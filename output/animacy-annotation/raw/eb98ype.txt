Coming from the left, I don't think the right is evil.  They're just 1) scared of losing what they have, and 2) so sick of being told that they are selfish and ignorant that they decide to openly embrace selfishness and ignorance as if it's a good thing.  It's just as much the left's fault for constantly pointing fingers and talking down to ordinary people.
