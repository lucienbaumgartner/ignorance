So you’re blaming Gary Player as being responsible/a main player of the Apartheid system?

Yes he was an influential and his book was wrong about supporting Apartheid. He was ignorant and racist because he drank the cool aid. He changed his views. He’s no longer ignorant, and I hope he no longer holds racist views.
