Very interesting and informative study, I hope to read sometime soon. Thank you for posting, though it seems the study has been removed from Sci-Hub unfortunately. 

I find it ignorant and gross a lot of people dismiss FGM or at least certain types of FGM for whatever reason. Or that one form of GM is worse than the other. It ain't a competition y'all. Anywho, a little off topic there, Thank you for this space for FGM and for the study!
