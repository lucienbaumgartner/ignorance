I’m aware that it does come across as ignorant and sexist. I take full responsibility of that and I hope it hasn’t hurt or attacked you. Otherwise, I apologise.

Thank you for giving your perspective which I really appreciate.

I understand that I cannot keep these thoughts to myself and that expressing them by giving permission to use a hall pass is the wrong way of tackling this issue. Of course, I have to keep working, and even more, with a therapist an on myself; but I’ll also try to discuss about it with my boyfriend. I hope I won’t have a mental breakdown or burst into crying when doing it, though. I’ll try to write down some sentences so I can repeat them to him without risking him getting hurt or him misunderstanding me.

I really, really treasure him and I want the best for him, no matter what.

Thank you for your very thorough and kind words, they truly are appreciated. And thank you for your wishes! I wish you a good year :)
