My father had ulcerative colitis and as a result, needed a bowel resection and stoma. 

He died right before COVID started due to complications from surgery.

I wouldn't wish that on anyone and totally understand your reaction. You're NTA!

However, to give that AH some grace, I find a lot of people are terrible with allergies/food intolerances etc. and can't distinguish between cutting out gluten as a fad diet and Celiac. I have a soy allergy and suspected MCAS which is constantly adding to a never-ending list of new allergic reactions (getting real sick of histamine ðŸ˜…), at this point, I just don't trust people to remember or get it right, even if it's in writing or a medical setting. 

**Chances are that he wasn't intending to spike anything with gluten, but was being selfish, ignorant, and reckless; however, the reason/intent wouldn't have changed the outcome.**

I tend to default to Hanlon's Razor in cases such as these:

&gt; 'Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.'
