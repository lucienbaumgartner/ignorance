/banana republic stuff/

I love when you all show up here:

**Atmosphere in the Democratic Party**

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

You can see Eric Weinstein (a former Lefty) pick up on that "sleight of hand" and try to educate his younger listeners by explaining to them that "Super Delegates have nothing to do with Diversity and Inclusiveness", listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast (or start at 2:58).

**Andrew Marantz - Surfing the Wake of The Woke - Eric Weinstein**

So the next time you hear them complain about the *Electoral College* being "undemocratic", suggest that it needs to be replaced by a *Super Delegate System* for reasons of *Diversity &amp; Inclusion*.

***AND MORE BANANA REPUBLIC STUFF:*** 

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* **conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry**. *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "*

And John Podesta is no lowly stooge, but would have very likely been *Chief of Staff to the President*, had Clinton won in 2016.

So, it would seem, the Democrat's strategy is: ***"to treat voters like mushrooms: keep them well manured in in the dark"***.

And if they ask for examples, show them where the "unawareness" pays off:

*And his insurance company buddies walk off with all the money...and none are the wiser.*

So, as with Eric Weinstein, I would rather opt for the "bullshitting" over the "gas lighting":

**"Choose Your Own Apocalypse": Bullshitting Republicans Aren't Great, But Gaslighting Democrats Are Evil"**
