He has never been a very considerate person to anyone in my family (for clarification, he is not mean or in any way abusive). Just very aloof and unaware of others feelings. Over the years, none of us have ever found a way to get through to him when he upsets us or does something inconsiderate. We used to butt heads a lot when I was younger but now that I donâ€™t live at home we have a good relationship.
