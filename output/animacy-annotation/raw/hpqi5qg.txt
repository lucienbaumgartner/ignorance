Of course he was responsible.

Trump has the egosyntonic Cluster B personality disorders (Narcissistic, Anti-Social, possibly Histrionic). He wasn't ever capable of adhering to the constitution, thus he should have been removed under the 25th amendment as soon as he was sworn in. He has no ability to not act in his own self-interests regardless of whether his actions are criminal or not. I had someone in my life with the same Cluster B disorders; he's the same person Trump is, just without the money.

He's also an unimaginably stupid, ignorant, and incurious man, likely due to a lifetime of sloth, laziness, and being born into great wealth. Recently it was revealed that he was surprised that the information in the Presidential Daily Brief wasn't on Fox News. Or how about the time when he thought western values referred to California. I could literally give thousands and thousands of more examples. 

The fact that in 2016 when he was on the ballot, millions of left-leaning (and independent) voters either stayed home or voted Stein is preposterous. How could they have needed to have seen what a disaster his presidency was before saying "gee maybe we should vote like our lives depend on it?" 

Despite Russian interference and James Comey's decision-making (both of which IMO flipped the election to Trump), I'll always blame democratic voters who didn't take the 2016 election seriously.
