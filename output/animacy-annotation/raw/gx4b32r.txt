i do think this was rape and assault. i’m so sorry that you experienced it. you’re right, it doesn’t sound like it was a health relationship, but it seems like from the start it wouldn’t be (if this happened at the very beginning of your relationship). i know the feeling. i understand you felt wanted and there was a rush that even though it was scary and you were in pain, you still stayed. it’s the same reason why people chase adrenaline highs doing scary things, and it’s nothing to be ashamed about. if anything, just now know how important your voice is and if he respected and loved you he would’ve stopped when you asked him to. even if he is immature and unaware of the abuse he was inflicting on you, he shouldn’t have continued if he knew you were in pain. just because you said yes at the start doesn’t change that. it was not consensual the whole time, and if you need to call it rape to process it, i think you should. you deserve to validate yourself.
