I agree there are low-information, willfully ignorant and hot headed morons on all sides but you can’t say that at this point in history, they’re the same. More than half of the right want to overturn a free and fair election, think the impending climate catastrophe is either fake or doesn’t care, and wants migrant refugee children taken from their parents. Please tell me you understand the difference between the left and right in this particular point in history.
