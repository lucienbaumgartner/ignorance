Well if they are lying to you then they are either embarrassed by their inability to reach orgasm (which they shouldn't be because its very common), or they feel pressure to say they orgasmed because of their current or past partners, or because they may be very inexperienced and unaware of their own bodies and functions. 

I guess to answer the OP question, you can't tell. Everyone and every orgasm differs and there is no way to for sure tell if someone is faking. 

Side note, if you can't talk to your partner about sex and orgasm, then an orgasm is the least of your problems... you should focus on building trust and communication instead.
