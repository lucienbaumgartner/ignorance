It isn't my job to PROVE you wrong when you are making baseless claims. The articles themselves clearly explain what I am talking about. It isn't my fault your 17 year old brain can't comprehend legal obligations in reference to records/privacy. I also don't expect you to understand how governments and legal challenges work, which is what lead to this situation in the first place due to Harper. But again, enjoy the block and I hope you take my advice. Your too damn young to be acting this ignorant about stuff waaaaay above your understanding.

&gt;the Canadian government doesn’t give two shits about the indigenous people, residential schools existed in the 90s they aren’t something from 100 years ago.

It isn't my fault your so young and ignorant that you are just learning about our past. You know what is kind of funny? You are either old enough to have legitimate positions on politics, or your young enough that you weren't even alive when a residential school was active. Which way do you wanna go with this now? ahaha
