oh please. I love Taiwan and my people, don't argue with me on that. I find your view too simplistic and ignorant of all the other factors in play that contribute to the construction of a societal mindset. It's so easy to say "don't be racist" when you've had lived your life with educated views. Also BLM was created to combat systemic discrimination, which in turn, educated American people on the issues that the Black community faced. Additionally, this worked for the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. All three movements created large shifts in American views on the Black community, so if you fail to acknowledge that, I can't have a proper conversation with you mate. Here in Taiwan there's less exposure, less education, less urgency to educate or need for law reforms (which America had to do with the 13th, 14th and 15th amendment). Hence, Taiwan has slower changing views. Racism is never okay though, which I've mentioned so many times, there's bigger things at play. 
Plus, I'm also speaking from experience, both my grandparents and my dad are uneducated in Black people and their culture, they've also never interacted with a Black person. Occasionally they do say racist things, but that's from being uneducated and ignorant. They don't know they're wrong for saying those things. On the other hand, my sister and I have lived and grew up in Australia. It's a multicultural place, where we're taught about systemic racism and their negative consequences, so we understand making discriminatory statements are harmful. Our views stem from the information we gain from young, where our brains are more plastic and adaptable. Which is why older generations are less able to change mindsets. Would love to go into the neuroscience and psychology behind it (my uni double major), but I'm wasting my time in talking to people who have too simplistic view on everything. 
Hope you have a nice day. At least you're not racist.
