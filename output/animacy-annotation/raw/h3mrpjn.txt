It's not just resources. It's that there might not be enough evidence of the ultimate/worse crime. 

It's incredibly odd and ignorant that you think plea bargains on average benefit criminals, instead of being used as a cudgel against innocent minorities and poor people who are threatened with lifetime in prison but 'if you admit to this it's just a few years' when they're innocent.
