While interesting, keep in mind that common law does not generally consider booby traps to be a legitimate form of defense, and holds the trap setter responsible for damages caused even in cases where they worked against a known attacker. In theory someone who downloads your zip bomb after running a script or other offending code could press for damages that were done. In practicality they may have to face up to possible felonies for their activities, but keep in mind the reason why common law views these sorts of traps negatively is the potential to catch someone who isn't malicious but unaware and cause damage to them.
