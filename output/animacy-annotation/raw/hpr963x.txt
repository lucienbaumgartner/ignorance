"Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist"

Basically, a transphobe that likes to pretend that they're fighting the patriarchy, even though all they do is reinforce it.

I almost feel sorry for some of them, as it's clear some of them had bad experiences with men, which cause them to lash out at anyone they perceive as male, but they're hurting me and mine with their ignorant and misguided anger, so they can frankly go fuck themselves.
