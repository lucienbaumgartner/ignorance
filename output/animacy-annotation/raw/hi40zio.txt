“Only an entomologist can correctly identify a brown recluse”… nope. I agree that they’re frequently misidentified, but if you live in BR territory, you’ll learn REAL quick to identify them. That said, I’ve known a lot of people who lived around them (middle Tennessee literally crawling with them) who thought ANYTHING that was brown and had more than 6 legs was a recluse because they were scared and ignorant.   That said, if a person actually takes a few minutes to read up on the distinguishing characteristics of a BR, they’re pretty distinctive.
