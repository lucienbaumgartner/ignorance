Lol so are you. The rest if us are allowed to think you're decision was one-dimensional, based on a single opinion, and POSSIBLY fueled by a surgeon banking on fear to avoid doing a surgery they don't like (yes they exist). 

Sorry if you don't have a lot if options when it comes to surgeons, but going in on one quote like it's the only way and doubling down is ignorant and dangerous.

Good day, friend.
