This is true of all immigrant communities though, what confuses me is that the Irish are particularly offended by those who claim to be Irish, and in most other countries they don't care if you claim to be "from" there they just care if you're rude about their culture. I don't blame you at all for being offended when people expect you to be living in a 1950s time loop, it just confuses me how much that thinking is blamed on them identifying as Irish-American when I think it has more to do with a horrible public school system that makes Americans ignorant and arrogant toward other cultures regardless of whether we think of ourselves as "from" there.
