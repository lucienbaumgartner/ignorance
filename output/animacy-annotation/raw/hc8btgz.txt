I think there are far more good episodes than bad episodes, and even in the episodes that weren’t the best I can still find something I like enough to rewatch. The ones I won’t rewatch are the ones that are self-unaware and offensive (even for the 90s) like genderbender, teliko, Roland. Also, fight club is terrible, I fucking hate that episode.
