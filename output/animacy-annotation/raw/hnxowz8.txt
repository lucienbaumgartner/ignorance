It's very hard to get diagnosed and the medications options are limited and tend to be less effective than the brand name drugs. It all again depends on what part of south India you are from. I live in trivandrum and it took me 3 years to a good doctor who was willing to diagnose me and prescribe me medication.
Amphetamines are banned in india. The only stimulant medications available are methylphenidate. Me personally would stay away from older psychiatrists as they tend to be very misinformed and unaware of the condition. If you could find specialists I would recommend that but the chances of finding one are very low.
