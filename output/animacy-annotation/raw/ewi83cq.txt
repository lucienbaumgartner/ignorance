Been practicing for about 3 years now. I switch between mantra and mindfulness and sometimes mix em. Getting intune with and more aware of the subconscious is essential for finding equilibrium in the mind. Not only that but it's scientifically proven to shrink the amygdala within about 3 or 6 months of consistent practice. This can reduce the stress associated with starting up.  

Before I started It was like living on autopilot, unaware and reactivate. I didn't know then but it's obvious now. And it also makes you more aware of other people's idiosyncrasies and motivations which is good for negotiation and networking. It's truly a life changer. Ray Dalio swears by it, Jobs sweared by it etc. Everyone should do it imo, entrepreneur or not.
