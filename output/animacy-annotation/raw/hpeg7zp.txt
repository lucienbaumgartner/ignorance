It makes sense, all the examples he quoted were persecuted.  He can't think of any white folks to compare to. This might be because there are very few examples of white folks needing to stand up against institutional persecution. It fits with their whole victim narrative; they were being targeted. The Jan 6 events were just them defending their freedom!!!!

They are narcissistic, ignorant, and delusional.
