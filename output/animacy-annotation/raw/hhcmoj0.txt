As an Australian I've always admired how NZ promotes Maori culture. I'm sure there are probably some "dark side" things I'm totally unaware and ignorant of, but shit, from what we can see across the pond it really looks like you've really done things well and put us to absolute shame. It's quite frankly disgraceful how we treat our first nations people and their cultures.
