I watched his apology video and he said that he was ignorant and wrong and that he's sorry for hurting people and that his opinions have changed. 

Perhaps we have not seen the same apology video but I was under the impression that he no longer holds these views and that like myself he came from a toxic religious environment which indoctrinated him to be hateful but he is now not in that environment anymore and slowly the brainwashing is being removed from his mind
