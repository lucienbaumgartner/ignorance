This is a terrible response.

You have, in multiple points, said that an argument has been provided.

I have never said that no claims have been made. In fact, my very specific problem is that the claims raised are not argued for.

&gt; stified their claim that objective morality is definitionally impossible with logical argumentation 

I asked for their argument. Why haven't you provided it here?

It seems like the easiest way to defeat my position here would be to directly quote their comment that has argumentation. And I made that point and asked you to do it.

If you can't, it looks like I'm right.

&gt;previous comment

Keep reading.

I say two important things about this afterwards:

1. There are people who disagree with you whose arguments I'm sympathetic to. This matters because it now means we cannot accept this premise as universally held or universally intuitive. You must provide reasons!
2. I talk about how I am a Motivational Internalist. This means I think that moral propositions are necessarily linked to a desire/motivate to actualise them. **This does not mean that I think moral claims are value judgements.** 

We've been through both of these before, and recently. In our second conversation, you had trouble remembering any details from the first. Part of why interacting with you is not something that is rewarding or stimulating is because you seem unable to understand the points you bring up *even after* you've been told what they mean.

In the last comment I wrote:

&gt; The answer is, right now, a loud "no". Why think that Goodness and Badness *require* value judgements? What is morality? What are value judgements? What kind of qualities to value judgements have? What kind of taxonomy are we fitting these into? You also have to justify your answer to these questions. 

You've tried to answer one of these by misinterpreting what I've said after clarification then making the outstanding - **and unjustified claim** \- that "It's also plainly obvious to anyone with a shred of honesty." This is a claim that comes about for two reasons:

1. You're not careful with your words
2. You haven't done any fucking work and so have no clue what anyone in the field is saying

Let's examine it a little more closely:

1. X is better than Y
2. X is a moral good, and moral goods are better than Y since Y is a moral bad.
3. X is a personal good, and while Y is a moral good "X is better than Y." 
4. X is a moral obligation, but following it leads to suffering. Y is not a moral obligation but it increases happiness. "X is better than Y if and only if we value X over Y." 

These all contain radically different meanings. I think the second is what we're talking about, but it also doesn't really look like it contains a value judgement analogous to aesthetical value: It looks closer to saying "5 is higher than 4." It has more "moral value" which doesn't look like "personal value." 

**But you shouldn't reply to this because you didn't give a good reason to think your belief is true. Making a psychological claim about the honesty of people's views is always going to be rough but you one-upped that: you made that claim about** ***everyone's views when you haven't read anyone!***

And notice how little of the quote we got through. I just want to repeat what you've done is bad argumentation, but it also just isn't sufficient.

I think we can construct another argument here:

1. Someone who makes claims (X,Y) is necessarily arrogant.
2. You have made claims (X,Y).
3. You are necessarily arrogant.
4. Someone who makes claims (P,Q) is necessarily ignorant of the topic.
5. You have made claims (P,Q).
6. You are necessarily ignorant of the topic. 
7. Engaging with someone who is arrogant and ignorant of the topic is not something I should do.
8. I should not engage with you.

&amp;#x200B;

We've gone through one and two already. The claims that I think you've made that are arrogant is that you've proposed that you can add good insight into the topic when you have done no work on the topic. I also think the claims you've made about the honesty of those in the field are arrogant: it is arrogant to claim that these positions are widely held when you haven't done a survey or even had a cursory look.

Three follows from one and two.

You've kinda confessed to 4 and 5. You've said you haven't done any research. You routinely show a misunderstanding of terms, and how these terms are used. You don't seem to know any arguments, and more than once you've had your view named and described back to you. I think I've even given you some anti-realist arguments before. Of course, these don't come forward now. Instead, we get bizarre claims about the psychology of all ethicists.

Six follows from 4 and 5.

There are a few routes to justifying 7. I take it to be related to the argument in my previous comment, though: I think that if I value my time and sanity I should better pick who I argue with.

8 follows from the rest of the argument.

&amp;#x200B;

You can write a reply if you want. There is a chance I will read it, but I won't reply... **unless you write out a syllogism and defend each premise like I just did.**
