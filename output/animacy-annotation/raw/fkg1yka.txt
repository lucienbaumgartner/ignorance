This clip should used by the Democrat who wins the nomination as a advertising piece for the catastrophe we are witnessing. Put it on every channel, every website to remind people that the unfortunate souls that we will lose to this pandemic is because he has absolutely no fucking clue on how to handle it, and neither does anyone in his administration. His choices will kill even the stupid and ignorant that vote for him. He doesn't care, and he's first to pass the blame like the spineless, selfish coward that he is.
