Warriors actually have the biggest dps loss without batching. What rogues did with batching in pve is minor. Not angry just pointing out that batching is largely negative except for in niche situations where very few classes can utilize batching effectively. And any avocation for it is selfish and ignorant of its underlying effects. Mainly being that heals get batched too often which affects every player negatively in pvp and pve.
