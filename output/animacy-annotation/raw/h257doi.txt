Literally have a girlfriend that I have sex with but okay. Says the guy who is active on a incel subreddit. It’s nit the 3-4 year gaps that are the issue for me. My dad married a woman who was 8 years younger than him, however he was 34 at the time. The problem is the maturity level. That 8 year age difference is messed up when you apply it to an 18 year old and a 10 year old. Why? Because a 10 year old is innocent and unaware of what consent even is. They are not even thinking about sex. Relationships like that are completely based on manipulation. 

Even when you’re 16 there is still a lack of maturity and it is immoral to take advantage of that and forge a sexual partner out of it.
