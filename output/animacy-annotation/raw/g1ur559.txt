Lol that’s what I told my husband.. I said if her dental degree is so much better and higher quality than the USA programs why is she not accepted here or recognized and others from other countries are? 

I def greyrock.. what I need help with is how to put control into the situation with husband.. like do I just act controlling and tell him I’m fed up and not to tell his mom anything health related bc it makes my life stressful and is also horribly inaccurate?

She uses the fact that she is a dentist to talk down to people and even if you calmly disagree and gently explain things are ok, these are the facts and we are ok.. she doesn’t take it in stride but becomes agitated and condescending and more stubborn about her view so I just don’t want to talk with her at all about this and I’ve applied this in all areas of my life but where I lack control is my husband telling her stuff.. he HAS filtered down but I know innocently as her son he will share what he thinks are just light things with his mom (as most kids with health parental relationships would) but then this happens and his anxiety skyrockets and I get super stressed bc I’m already dealing with too much.

Things are smooth when she doesn’t interfere .. I’m good at keeping her from being able to do that but my husband isn’t

I told her that the shit she spews is so painfully inaccurate and ignorant that it isn’t up for debate and that I’m not engaging with someone who doesn’t even know basic science and makes statements so inaccurate that most people who don’t even have a background in science know they’re wrong.
