I've experienced this in form of mind games but less in physical aggression. But it is a thing. First they push your buttons to get you do something which isn't in your best interests and once you do that, they react with more destructive behavior and blame you for starting it. 

Worst thing is that there's no way to prove the narc first pushed your buttons to create the whole mess. It's not like they are ignorant and unaware, it's that instead of refraining from doing things that make you uncomfortable, they use that info to control you.
