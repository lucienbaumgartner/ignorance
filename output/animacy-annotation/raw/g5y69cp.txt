Hi Sandi.

Yesterday I came across at one of your posts with regards to your step brother who was a serial killer.. 

This sounded so surreal.. as you said in one of your comments, the majority of people are oblivious and unaware of the depth and darkness/evil our human experience can get here on Earth..

So I followed up on reading about your life story and have discovered some other of your earlier posts about your life.. the “family” photo post with yourself answering questions about it.. just reading and trying to comprehend it. It has shaken me to the core and it’s been on my mind and attention since.

I can’t even describe what I feel.. Your story and some of your words seem to resonate so deep within that they just leave me speechless. The paradox, the contrast of experiences you have had.. the strength of your soul. 

I am so truly sorry about your early experiences here on Earth..  but I’m also at awe at the strength of your soul. It made me so happy to read that you have finally escaped that hell and that you preserved the light and love despite the unimaginable darkness you have faced. I know you have raised a daughter who also gave you strength to carry on and not to give up.

You also seem to have the way with expressing yourself so eloquently, so clearly which can be so powerful for someone who have been to the depths of Hell and heights of Heaven.

I apologise as I’m very aware that I’m just rambling now and that many who are reading this they are probably very confused what am I talking about.

I haven’t read all of your posts yet but I understood that you are writing/wrote a book about your life.. please do let me know if or when it is going to be released.

In meantime I am sending all my love and appreciation for you continuing your journey and sharing your story with us.

Love and Hug from UK
