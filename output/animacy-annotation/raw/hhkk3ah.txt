So I've read what's out for "I don't love you anymore" and.... I just don't find Valer that hateable? Pathetic and useless maybe, definitely neglectful and ignorant of his neglect, but he's not "evil"? Is there a novel out there or something for the series where he does something worse than what I read so far? I've just read so many many many many worse exes and heck even current male leads in OI and other series than this dude.
