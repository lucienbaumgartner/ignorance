I'd say you're pretty new to Earth with a comment so boldly ignorant and unaware of history as the one you made. That said, you must be old enough, since you seem so acclimated to cherry picking the story that suits you best, huh? I'd say 17-25, probably from the midwest. Somewhere that not a lot of good information gets passed around, like Indiana or Ohio. Probably spends too much time indoors, talking to cats and playing video games or reading comic books, and has a knack for being angry online. Not a lot of real socializing. Hitting any bells yet?
