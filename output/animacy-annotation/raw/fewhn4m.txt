For Persona 2 you don’t have a choice. It’s 2 games if you’re unaware, and Innocent Sin only came out in the US on PSP, Eternal Punishment on PS1. As for P1 it’s a P3 situation where there isn’t really a definitive edition. Play PS1 for a more atmospheric experience, PSP for one with less issues in gameplay and much more content. It doesn’t sound like a different soundtrack on the PS1 version would change much, but the atmosphere it created just gives the game a lot of its own identity.
