The same exact thing happened to me like 2 months ago. I actually posted a comment then deleted it describing my similar situation then saw your comment haha. I can't believe people like this exist man. Just so oblivious and unaware of their surroundings while in a motor vehicle.

Same thing when people are about to miss their exit and dart across traffic real fast instead of just sucking up their mistake and figuring out a detour or how to get off a different way. Reckless and stupid.
