If you watch the video the truly scary part is how completely clueless the two cops are. Wondering out loud to each other what agency the bounty hunters are with. They have now clue who these two men with shotguns are, they have no clue what legal authority they are operating under. Those two cops just aided in an armed home invasion and were so completely untrained and ignorant that they didnâ€™t see anything wrong with it. I hope this family sues the bounty hunters into bankruptcy and tacks on a hefty sum from the tax payers for the complete incompetence of the police.
