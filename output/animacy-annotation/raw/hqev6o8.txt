They don’t even have to be a career woman or have money.   Those men are just ignorant and delusional about how human fertility is in general and especially in current year. 

Anyone concern trolling about parental age when the age is still considered by doctors to be often fine for reproduction, is just projecting some “omg ewww old people over 30” and tying to make it sound science-y.  

They usually googled like one thing and have no idea how complex and nuanced the topic is or how different the modern medical views are from their dumbness.  This goes for men and woman harassing women or men about fertility. 

You’re right, issues like divorce and single moms happen often from young parents who didn’t vet for a partner well beyond omg I need babies now.    So women who take their time to vet are condemned too.
