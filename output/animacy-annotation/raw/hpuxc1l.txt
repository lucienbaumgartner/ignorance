thanks for your comment!! i work constantly on staying positive and accepting my skin, which is a process for everyone i feel :P thanks so much for your concerns as well, i do agree it affects me too much, but i do feel i only feel the anxiety comes from times i go outside without makeup or am around new people and all i can think about is how my skin might look to them. 

i mean, its possible that it could continue even if my skin is clear, but when i’m not thinking about my skin i am quite happy and i feel fine, which is most of the time (: i will look into seeking help mentally when i can! 

again its all a process of accepting my flaws, just cause sometimes people can be pretty ignorant and rude about peoples insecurities and i’m a sensitive person haha
