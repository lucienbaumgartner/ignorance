Lmao so you're not going to acknowledge the key gameplay mechanic in the game because you have no argument other than "you're playing wrong" ? 

The Nostalgia goggles must be imbedded deep in your brain with posts like this . lol. Claiming I haven't played them is equally hilarious and ignorant of you. You can't argue facts so you just make up excuses like "playing it wrong. Keep it up though, i'm glad you're playing the old AC games "correctly" lmao. Ubisoft might send you a cookie.
