You are wrong in so many levels here. The cheaper milk is the one that the US allows growth hormones to be put into. A hormone banned in Canada. How is that fair to our businesses in Canada. And a hormone health Canada bans should be allowed into our country? Is that what you are saying. By the way the non hormone milk is the same price as ours. 

If supply management was gone, a small town area with 40 local dairy farmers would be replaced with 1 or 2 corporations making their own milk. And that would be it. Do you realize how many businesses would be out of business? That corporation would have their own veterinarians, they would outsource their supplies to other countries, etc.   What you would end up with in the long run is just way more poor people and a few more richer giant companies. But hey, those types of things tend to pad the pockets of those invested in stocks, etc. 

Myself, I’d rather see lots of hardworking people have jobs than people sitting on their computers in their basements making money on the backs of fellow people. 

I’m not here to say the status quo is the answer. But I know the abolishment of the system is super ignorant and short sighted. Signing off.
