Again, you cannot speak for me or other polytheists and I find your comments to be as offensive as they are bigoted, I could make some equally egregious attacks against your religion but in doing so I would be labeled an anti-Semite, why do you feel the need to be so casually dismissive and ignorant of a religion you know nothing about? 

Hypocrite.
