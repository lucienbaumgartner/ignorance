Spirits start their lives inside small meteorites that fall in showers onto the world in events called "skyfalls" that happen every 5 years. While inside, the juvenile spirit is unconscious and unaware of their surroundings until it is broken open, which will allow the spirit to awaken.  
These meteorites are special as they're one of the very few materials spirits can physically touch, making them valuable both to spirits and mortals.  
No one knows where these meteorites originate from, but some spirits believe that they come from a massive reoccurring comet who they see as a god.   
    
Compared to human babies, juvenile spirits are much more active and are born with an intelligence about equal to a 10 year old child. They then reach full maturity at the next skyfall and are mentally equivalent to an adult human.  
While they're in this 5 year period of childhood, spirits can freely switch colors, but their powers are very weak at that point. The longer they stay with a color, the more adept they become with that color's powers.    
When the next skyfall happens, all of the previous generation will have their color locked, but most will have already devoted themselves to one already.    
   
Usually the members of the different colors go out and search for meteorites during and after a skyfall so that way they can bring more members into their color.
