But since there is so little awareness or implementation of this law, it becomes more complicated and dangerous than one car stopping. One car might stop, but everyone else probably wonâ€™t. And then other people who are unaware and impatient may try to pass the one stopped car. Not saying cars who do this are in the wrong, but as a driver I prefer when pedestrians cross in marked crosswalks when possible for their own safety. As a pedestrian I prefer that as well.
