My brother, whose knowledge of history was exhaustive, spent some 5 years trying to convince our crazy cousin that the Holocaust was real, that Nazis are bad, that slavery was not fun for the enslaved, etc. Five years. All he got for his efforts was said cousin's dumb friends attacking him on FB in the most ignorant and illiterate fashion. One day he just gave up and blocked the lot of them. He had given it his best shot, but they just dug in deeper and deeper. 

It is important to answer these people back, and it is important to know when to walk away. You can't save people who don't want to be saved.
