I am currently dealing with a true asshole in my life (family acquaintance) who is just like this, attitude and all. Wife has an autoimmune disease, he's just an asshole. They refuse to be vaccinated and are passive aggressive towards anyone they don't "like" for whatever reason. I doubt I'd ever get an F you from them, but the shit they pull is soooo damn ignorant and childish. Can't wait to get these 2 out of my existence.
