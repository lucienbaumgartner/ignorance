very bold of you to imply the person could’ve decided otherwise. You’re clearly ignorant and unaware. And since when is assisting the funeral glorifying suicide? Your opinions and statements are so shallow and you don’t have any strong arguments to base them on, and you also don’t have even the most basic knowledge about mental health, nor seem to be intellectually curious enough to do some research. I’d start working on my ignorance if i were you, and questioning myself instead of others.
