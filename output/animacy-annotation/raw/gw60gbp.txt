I feel what you’re saying but don’t you kinda see this as a “boy/girl who cried wolf”? I really don’t think Laura can get in trouble from releasing the tape by who the police? What would her crime be? 

After the talk Liv and Laura had I felt it was going to happen. Laura once again was blinded and unaware of her child asking for help. In the past ok maybe she couldn’t of helped and she regretted it every time for not noticing but this time is different. Laura can “take the blame” of giving Olivia the tape and helping her with the justice. Laura can use her title as DA and having a black daughter as an example. (This sounds bad but I’m not meaning it like that) I think maybe Laura was told to keep it hidden, but I feel that’s what people do because it’s hiding something. Laura needs to stand against police brutality and help her family and others when she has proof. 

If Laura gets fired/laid off/terminated as DA then at least it’s for something good and it can help with the storyline. 🤷‍♂️
