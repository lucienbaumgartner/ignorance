No, actually, I am intimately familiar. What you are describing isn't how life is for lots of people. You're describing a textbook example of some spots in middle America. And, I've lived it. I'm so sheltered and ignorant that I've got personal experience. You've got a badly remembered rest question from 1st year sociology.
