*takes deep breath*.... (Gonna possibly get a lot of flak for this but here goes...)

1. Products for protecting kids from shooters in schools but no real restrictions on access to guns themselves 
2. Pharma ads on tv all day long
3. The absolute nightmare work ethic and guilt ridden view on the value of personal time
4. Shoes in/all over the house
5. The obsession with 'freedom', thinking no other country's citizens are free, while living under absolute tyranny when it comes to credit systems, debt structures, bought politicians and medical insurance scams
6. Sugar in everything, and in general just the obsession with empty calories (taste) over nutritive values
7. The ability for most people to be completely ignorant and incurious about other (better?) ways of living, being, doing things...

There's a lot that is really good with this country too! Don't get me wrong... But that wasn't the question.
