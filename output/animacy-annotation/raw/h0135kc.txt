An hour? 

Lol. Try 4-5 hours,  if you own a car. The whole day if you don't own a car. 

Me? 

If you think it's as easy as just running over to the DMV in your car, you're incredibly privileged and unaware of what life is like for the actual poor people that can't afford a bunch of gun toys let alone a car that costs a much as your rifle.
