Why would Trump supporters support a boy dressing as a Nazi?  I think that's part of the problem most people.  Most people see the other side as so intolerant and ignorant that they're borderline Nazis.  I can assure you, most conservatives would expect this from the left just as you're expecting it from the right.  In reality, the majority of people in both parties are decent human beings with different opinions on the way things should run but at the end of the day both agree on many different issues including the distaste and inappropriateness of dressing children up as a nazi soldiers.
