This is so backwards fucking idiotic and ignorant that you should be embarrassed. Polls have been extremely accurate for the past three years in literally every single race that had high quality polling.

Multiple models were able to predict the *exact* number of house and senate seats that were won based on polling.

Youâ€™re just idiotically parroting nonsense because people forget that the majority of state level polling in 2016 was done before the FBI announced an investigation on national fucking television.
