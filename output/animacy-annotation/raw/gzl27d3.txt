&gt;Seems to me like you're saying it's not okay

I'm saying that doesn't in and of itself justify it, yeah. People buying something doesn't mean that something is good. That's inherently circular logic. 50 Shades of Grey made millions of dollars - its depiction of a kinky BDSM relationship is still bad and ignorant of that lifestyle. How much it sold doesn't change that. 

&gt;I was going to list some anime that doesn't sexualize their females but it would be such a long list

But percentage wise, how much would it actually be? Like, there could be 10,000 items on that list. If that's out of 1,000,000 individual works - then that's still pathetically small and shows of a serious representation issue. Anime has a problem with representing women, and this is just another part of that problem. 

&gt;Lastly, whether the creators "vision" is flawed or not doesn't matter because its the creators work.

&gt;If you don't like it leave and make you're own that has all of your own preferences.

If that's the level of engagement you want, then exercise it.

You're just trying to dismiss with quibbling. I don't care how smart the creator is - this still looks bad. Grow up - the world doesn't bow to you, and neither do I. If you don't like my words, leave, and drop this childish act. 

You and I both know this line of argument is pure BS on your part and nothing more than deflecting because you don't have much of a point otherwise. Call it a criticism instead of a critique. I don't care. It still is lazy, distracting sexualization that does the character design a disservice. Trying to dismiss what I say on some nonsense technicality won't change that.
