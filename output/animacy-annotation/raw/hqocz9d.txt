The ignorant and uninformed moon chasers dump their money in these projects…cough cough any inu token cough cough. 

Stop wasting your time with these “projects”.

I have learned that the BEST way to get into something is by researching the team. If they have produced quality work in other jobs even if not blockchain related, go for it. Gala games, Jam City’s Champion Ascension, CRO…to name a few of my absolute favorite.
