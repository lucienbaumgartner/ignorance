being queer is a love-hate relationship tbh. Sad I had to deal with all that shit but Iâ€™m thankful as hell I ended up being a part of this community because it made me aware of issues cis straight folks are probably oblivious of. 

Without it, Iâ€™d probably be an ignorant and toxic straight dude who lacks character development. And I probably wouldnâ€™t be obsessing over drag race and its gazillion spin-offs. Sending love tho ðŸ˜˜
