No doubt these are the same people who would say "why refuse to be searched by police if you have nothing to hide?" If you've got a right and you're not allowed to exercise it without being harassed then it's not a right, it's a facade to make people feel like they have the right.

If someone was actually frightened and unaware that it is legal to carry a gun, they might have shouted something like "hey that guy is nuts, he has a gun, someone call the cops!" Of course, it's all quite trumped up, given that he has a legal right to carry the gun and isn't doing anything criminal.
