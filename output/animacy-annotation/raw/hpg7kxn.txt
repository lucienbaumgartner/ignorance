Only a few years off, and I'd argue ignorance is not transient as someone like yourself is gatekeeping both age and interpretation of information quite ignorantly. Along with passion as myself and many others I know have been effected by and upset with an oppressive system since the youthful ages you arrogantly assumed I was currently. 

In all those years I've not felt change happening at a tangible scale. We're still stuck with a vast majority of the same problems my parents faced laying down. Once more I have not been enjoying my time suffering for the wealth of others and see no reason why I would enjoy any time I have left if nothing changes 

You're assumptuous, ignorant, and arrogant with such confidence that you can convince yourself of anything you'd like with extreme indifference toward reality. Then you go about telling folks to riot and straight up lie about garnished wage percentages. You're disingenuous toward this entire movement at best and seem to have no business being a part of this cause
