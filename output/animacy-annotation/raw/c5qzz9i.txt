When I was two years old my dad got a nintendo as a gift.  One game he owned was The Legend of Zelda and after learning how to turn it on, I'd play it as much as I could.  I learned to read the few bits of dialogue and managed to complete the game.  

I think Poke'mon Red &amp; Blue hit the US around '95, so being all the rage, I played and enjoyed it.  I think that was my first turn-based experience.  It's of minor importance to this story, but kinda relevant.  

It wasn't until '98 when I revisited Zelda.  My cousin was over for Christmas and received Ocarina of Time.  It being the '90s, I was astonished and unaware that a 3D Zelda game existed.  The whole prospect of it amazed me, as I'm sure it did a lot of people.  For me, even at 9, I still had nostalgia to relive that first Zelda experience.  I remember spending more time exploring every crevasse of the game world, than I did attempting to complete the game.  I made sure I completed everything, and back then it seemed like a lot.

I don't think it was until I picked up Morrowind that I ever found a game that I spent so much time playing.
