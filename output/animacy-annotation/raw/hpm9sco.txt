Statistics are incredibly arbitrary. Using them to make a point about a whole fan base, heck, a whole city is incredibly naive and ignorant, and lacks context. If you actually believe in what you're saying, then I can't say anymore as it's basically like smashing my head against a brick wall no matter how many media posts you can tag.
