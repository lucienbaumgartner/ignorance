Protests work by energizing people to make a change.  It's not just asking the Powers that Be for some gift or whatever.  If people are energized about some issue, they will elect people who say the right things about that issue and embarrass politicians who don't.  And if the protests are big enough, it forces people to confront the issue head-on.  If a handful of people are writing letters to the editor about blah, you might hear about it and dismiss it immediately, but most likely you won't hear about it at all.  But if there's a really big protest, especially if there's controversy about it, you *will* hear about it and it will be one of the most pressing issues of the day, and you'll pretty much have to come up with an opinion because it's what everyone else is talking about.  The issue becomes part of the discourse, and you can't believe how people were so *stupid* to have the wrong opinion on it (not remembering how *you* used to have that wrong opinion when you were younger and unaware of the issue being protested).  So yes, protests still work.  But they don't usually change the minds of politicians unless those politicians already agreed with the protesters in general, so they don't usually solve the actual problem.  But, by highlighting the problem, it lays the groundwork for future politicians to fix things.  They work, just not quickly.
