Cordy’s relationship with Angel is just all kinds of depressing for Cordelia in general to be honest. It’s her constantly sacrificing everything for him until she is literally just his ‘link’ to the powers. In S2 in Epiphany he’s so ignorant and dismissive of her talking like she’s still just a shallow mean girl and it’s Wes who has to pull him on Angel’s lack of respect and understanding of her. Then after everything, after the way Jasdelia acts wildly OOC and has ‘Cordy’ sleeping with Connor Angel just seems to think ‘seems legit’ and doesn’t even question Cordelia’s choices. Like I understand him not jumping to ‘she’s possessed’ conclusions but not even worrying that maybes she’s going through some trauma? No just boot her out instead. After she’s spent 3 years bending over backwards for him for nothing in return. Like crikey what more does the girl need to do for Angel to not just automatically believe the worst of her?
