BLM is super important to be protested right now regardless of covid, along with the fact that many of those protesters (at least in my area) are being conscious of covid and are taking precautionary measures to prevent the spread

However why the fuck do people think it's necessary to protest having to stay home like how TF could you be so utterly selfish and ignorant that you can't take it upon yourself to sit on the couch and watch TV

People protesting stay at home orders are the kind of people that are completely disregarding any consideration to covid and how it spreads, they're not social distancing and they're not wearing masks

But that's just my opinion
