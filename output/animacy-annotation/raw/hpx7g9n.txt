Absolutely disgusting behaviour, so sorry you had to deal with that especially on your own. I wouldn't know what to do with myself if I were in your shoes, quite frankly I'd leave. People wanna eat animal products, whatever, but as someone who has a plethora of reasons to not eat them, they should learn to respect that. Not doing so is ignorant and immature, but ahhhhh I can't believe someone would do that.

Someone (a pricky git I didn't like in the first place) was joking once with me being like 'well what if I gave you animal products, you wouldn't be able to tell, it's a joke' etc followed by 'what would you do if I did'. I calmly explained that I'm primarily vegan because I despise animal abuse, so if someone jokingly feeds me an animal product I'd punch them so hard in the teeth they might just meet the animal that died in purgatory on their way to hell.

For context im quite a large, tall individual. That fucker shut up after that.

Hope you're okay OP, fuck em. Karma's a bitch
