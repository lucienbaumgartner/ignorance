You know once people got through the game soon after it came out and I saw all the derivative takes of the story I thought that maybe in due time they would be eventually filtered out and their would be more nuanced criticism of the game, but nearly everywhere I look its the exact same stuff on "revenge is bad" and ludonarrative dissonance that I personally don't think that the air of controversy surrounding this game will ever go away if it's this susceptible to such criticism. 

The bigotry to me is less of a problem when it comes to discourse because it's so obviously moronic and ignorant that it's not worth the time for those inclined to discourse, but I've still seen well intentioned criticism from people claiming political/nefarious agendas and using misconstrued information to prove terrible points. The state of discourse surrounding the studio and Neil is equally baffling to me. 

With each following month The Last of Us Part 2's story seems like this aberration for video game discourse and I've tried to understand why this is but it's just so confusing to me. You still have seasoned critics and reviewers of cinema and literature that somehow derive the most basic interpretation of the story, reject that their is a little more thoughtfulness in the writing than they may suggest, but then wonder where all the nuance is. 

Like I truly do not understand how someone can say give "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" a glowing review for its portrayal of trauma but are not able to perceive that TLOU2 is equally a story about trauma and more than just the cycle of revenge with an expression of almost all the exact same themes. 

Both stories very overtly latch onto ideas of radical empathy, human action through imperfect information, the contagious nature of trauma, parental love, justice VS revenge, pride, loyalty forgiveness/revenge fantasies, so on and so forth to tell their stories but the treatment of latter will often be more derivative and I'm not sure why that is.
