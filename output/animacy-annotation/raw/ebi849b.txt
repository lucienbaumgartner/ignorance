But that makes literally no sense. Have you read any of the enlistment stuff, or any of the DoD regulations? Those things are specific to a t. So that means they either banned trans people cause they didn’t want them in the army, or they were lazy when it came to researching about conditions and medication/treatment when it comes to trans people. One of those options is malicious, the other is so lazy and ignorant that it might as well be malicious. Either way I would say it’s not friendly to trans people.
