Why are champ and below players so bad and unaware of their own mistakes? Every placements season the lobbies are filled with cirlejerking diamond 3s that ballchase each other and whiff at will. I wish they removed placements since its an enforced nightmare upon every decent player until you're out of ELO hell again. It's a pure waste of my time and it decreases my quality of life.
