Sad that any of you who put this down as “just baton twirling” or “not real fighting” or whatever obv don’t understand the training behind this.

It’s not learned alone but part of martial arts in order to get to a competitive level. But feel free to stay ignorant and envious of someone’s achievements. Have another donut.
