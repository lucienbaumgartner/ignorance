I'm pretty sure most ppl are aware how difficult it is in all big industries but especially the entertainment industry. This is not unique to kpop lol. Unless the fan is very young and unaware of world issues most of us are aware. I wonder why westerners ask such things since the American entertainment industry isn't very different either. And I hate how articles bring up painful cases of death without even going too deep into the reasons of why they did such things just to "expose" the industry as if ppl in other industries don't have depression and take drastic measures.
