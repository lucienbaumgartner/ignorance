Tone deaf really? Anyone can beat someone who is two levels higher or two levels lower. It’s all about skill and learning what counters what. Sometimes a ice golem doesn’t kill skeletons because it’s underleveld, then you use it for something else and juts adapt. Blaming the reason you’re losing on levels is just ignorant and stupid. The best of players can make do with what they have and win. If the games about levels then just spend money and max out your deck.
