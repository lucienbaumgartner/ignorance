“Stay mad”.  The last resort and retort of the mindless dimwit who’s lost any credibility and who cannot produce a cohesive argument. 

You argue like a child so I’ll address you like one. You’re straight up wrong and ignorant of it. It’s not my problem you can’t point out Nepal on a map because you’re a poster child of a failed education system. You still can’t figure out what Mt Everest was called prior to it being renamed can you?  You still have no idea why it’s so important to Hindus and Nepalis, can you? No because you’re just a sheltered child who’s never actually had to think outside of your own myopic perspective. It’s a shame.
