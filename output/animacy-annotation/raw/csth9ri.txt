Yes, they're depleting, that doesn't mean it's inevitable that we're going to have a war over resources or something. Why wouldn't we go back to wood? How do we power cars with wood? 

You're no expert, you are just a doomsday theorist, we're already trying to switch to solar and nuclear. There's a reason we don't use wood right now over fuel, it's less efficient and less useful, you can't make wood explode.

You wreak of the dunning Kruger effect, we're not dumb and unaware that fossil fuels aren't infinite, we just don't believe that is proof of a war over resources in the future.
