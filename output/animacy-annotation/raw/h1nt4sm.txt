&gt;	Americans are going through a bit of an awakening of sorts, especially young Americans. Other countries don't raise kids to believe that they are the are number 1, the greatest at everything, the best place to live on the planet, and that everyone else in the world just wishes they could live in their country. But I think many Americans were raised to believe that, and their education system tends to keep them very US focused and unaware of life outside of American (other than that it's bad and people have "no freedom").

This is exactly what’s going on these days and it’s a cause of a lot of conflict in America and people like the guy whining that “everything says America bad” have an emotional problem with it because it’s such a big part of their identity to believe that America is the best. They have a hard time handling it

It’s sad and hopefully they can cope
