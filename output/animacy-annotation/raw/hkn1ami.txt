&gt;What? Doesn't everyone believe that their own moral code is the right one? 

Sue they do, but trying to apply your own moral code to others is not allowed here in the USA.... think Marriage Equality, Right to choose, Property rights, Right to remain silent. Just because you have a moral standard you like that does not give you right to suggest those that do not hold the same moral code are inferior.   


&gt; shitty exurban mcmansion subdivision devoid of any life or culture?

So you suggest that everyone who isnt living life the same way as you are is living a bad life???LOL   


Now, there is some evidence for urban HWY removal, but that is not removing the HWY that would bring people to the city. Your suggestion is that all highways need to go.... that is short sighted and ignorant of the freedoms that Americans enjoy today.
