"Noooo! *You're* the red neck racists!".

Funny, you just tried normalizing the large swaths of openly racist xenophobic Albertans, like it's not a thing.

I think it's SUN News infotainment tabloids and Rebel Media being the bullhorn for the Reform faction of the CPC that makes so many Albertans racist paranoid and ignorant of anything science related. I see a similar thing in Qu√©bec media but focused on the Pure Lain instead of the Old Stock.
