Yes. And first of of you are a real survivor of abuse. Never downgrade what you went through. You were never suppose to experience that. No child should. You were young and unaware of potential damage and you clearly have remorse and seem to never do something like that again. Your abuse shaped you in a behavioral manor that a kid was never suppose to be put in and caused these harmful sexual behavior but you are not who you were when you were a child. You canâ€™t change the past but make up for it and take responsibility to do better now. I wish you well and please find a therapist and talk to especially one that deals with csa/cocsa!
