There's [strong bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Women_are_wonderful%22_effect) to fight.

You might liken the comparison to pedophiles somewhat of a joke, but that's really how it is.

MGTOW in that analogy is the story of how if some stranger offers you a ride home from the playground you don't get into the car. A kid is so innocent and unaware that there exists such evil in the world that they just step in without thinking twice. Many men are just like that, completely oblivious to danger, thinking that a woman could never ever do them any harm.

And to make matters worse with our state of affairs we have the pedophiles in power. Women with intent or willingness to do harm come to shut down warnings and to calls heed the dangers of relationships with women.

Could you ever imagine how things would be if you told a kid "hey don't get in cars with strangers, that can be dangerous, and here's why.." with a whole bunch of pedophiles interrupting and harassing with "hey why don't you shut up about that and go not ride with strangers yourself if you don't like it?"
