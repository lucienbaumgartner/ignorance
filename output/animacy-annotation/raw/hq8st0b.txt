Yeah, I would.

The entire point of natal astrology is to render judgement on various aspects of a person’s life by using different techniques and methods on their chart. In this context, “judging” a chart means that you’ll make definitive statements about the character and lived experiences (emphasis on the latter) of an individual, usually while checking the accuracy of your statements as you go (either with the individual present to provide feedback or with resources on their life, like a biography).

I wouldn’t show prejudice towards someone because of their birth chart though. I think pop astrology and the people who contribute to it have really created a culture where it’s ok to be a spacist™️ towards people with certain placements. Regardless of how much you think you understand astrology, it’s ignorant and reductive to avoid someone or end a connection based off of their birth chart, especially with how malleable modern personality interpretations can be.
