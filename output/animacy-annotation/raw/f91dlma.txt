I’m genuinely baffled at all the love she gets on here. She’s shown to be lazy, totally unaware, and horrible at challenges. If you were getting votes every week, of course you’re playing an idol. It took 0 strategy to figure that one out. She’s not an underdog. An underdog has to have some sort of fight or skill. She lucked into an idol by being forced to leave the hammock, and she got lucky using it when everyone finally decided to go with the easy vote. But yeah totally you lay on that hammock kqueen
