Is Asif Ali, linked to in the article you linked to, a 'western Anglo'? The article whose main source appears hilariously to be a restaurant manager in Hong Kong? You know nothing about me: I've eaten a lot of Hyderabadi, Gujerati, Keralan &amp; Goan food (which I hope you call 'Portuguese') as well as Nepali cuisine, and authentic Punjabi/Pakistani cooking - I really don't like BIR cooking very much at all and have had awful experiences eating it. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist as a separate entity, that chicken tilka masala doesn't come from the UK or that I know 'fuckall' (not a word). But you wouldn't know any of these things. 

Perhaps you need to try harder at being less ignorant and judgemental. 'Mate'.
