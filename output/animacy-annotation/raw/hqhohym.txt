Maybe people are soo used to an ignorant person, that they ignore or assume things about them, can't tell you how many times somone will claim somone else's words are useless because they are a troll, when the one who is being ignorant and unwilling to hear somone before they judge is often actually the troll, I have no problem with you not liking me for what I said, however I have a big problem with anyone who does what I just mentioned, makes me think they are in the same camp as the people on discord who block somone or ghost suddenly without caring to say a word, they only care for themselves, this is why I said I don't mean anything rude by this. I'm not afraid to speak my mind because I hide nothing. I beleive in equality.
