Thanks for actually engaging.

&gt; Haha to make the assumption that only unsuccessful people are critical of capitalism is a risky bet, one that I’ve often found to be incorrect.

I don't usually make that assumption. It was just a low-effort comeback to your assumption about the only critique of socialism stemming from an inability to understand the conversation at hand. It wasn't a terribly insightful or enlightening conversation to begin with.

&gt; Don’t act like you weren’t being petty and instigating as hell with your original comment.

I wasn't trying to. I was just making an observation (rather concisely) that the criticism my parent comment was making about libertarianism - that people with that mindset are naïvely idealistic and ignorant of the pitfalls when the rubber meets the road, and a lot of innocent people suffer and die as a result - almost verbatim applies to any form of socialism ever applied. The seeming horseshoe nature of the critique looked amusing to me and I pointed it out. I don't mind the downvotes or your insincere response to my post. I do appreciate your subsequent attempt to engage, however.
