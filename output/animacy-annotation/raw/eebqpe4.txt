Warg Magic is disgusting. It’s soul rape. Varamyr Sixskins kills most of his victims. Hodor’s broken brain protected him to some extent, except Bran’s control of him is responsible for Wylis’ destruction anyway. 

If my theory is right that Sansa wargs the Hound, honestly, it would be well within his rights of self-defense to kill her for it. But I think George inserted a sexual aspect to the warg bond in their case, which leads to rape/sex thoughts. It’s completely fucked up and indeed a “reversal of trope.”

But I don’t blame Sansa for anything as the narrative makes it clear that she is utterly and completely innocent and unaware that she may have any magical or sexual powers until well into The Winds of Winter.
