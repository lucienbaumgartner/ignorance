&gt;know-it-all tone in some of your recent posts sound like Tumblr garbage.

i'm not asking you to like my tone.  I'm asking you to share my incredulity at the statement "we've done our best to make things right."

frankly i'm not sure how else i can do it.  I cited and sources statistics and explained why i think they contradict that statement.

I'm not sure how or why I should be more accommodating, in tone or otherwise.  i'm not trying to win anyone over and i don't expect anything to change.  i want to express my how ridiculous and unaware that statement is, based on facts.
