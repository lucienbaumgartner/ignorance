From looking at their social media posts, they seem very PR. Lots of canned phrases (so classy, what a blessing, how sweet), posed photographs and stiff/robotic captions. They don't post like other people my age (early 20's). They rarely "like" or comment anything on anybody else's photos except their own family's/other "famous" fundies posts and like I mentioned above, only with cliche comments. Sometimes the married ones will go rogue and post something that doesn't sound so controlled, but not often. I wouldn't be surprised if someone runs their pages for them most of the time for the show's publicity. Just because they still seem extremely sheltered and unaware of the outside world's narrative.
