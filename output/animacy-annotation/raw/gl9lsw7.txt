Thank you for keeping him company in his last moments. Even if he was totally unconscious and unaware of his surroundings, I guess there’s always a chance that he was aware of his circumstances and I’d bet he probably really appreciated you staying with him. Additionally, I’m sure his friends and family find great comfort knowing that their loved one wasn’t alone as he died. I know it would make me feel better.
