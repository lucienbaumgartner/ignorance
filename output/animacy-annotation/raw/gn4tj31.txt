&gt;I'm saying that the security of other nations and picking winners and losers in regional conflicts is not America's concern.

Extraordinarily short sighted and ignorant of history.

You say the interests of those other states is not America's problem. Until it becomes America's problem. The US absolutely has an interest in checking the aggression of adversaries.

Look up a poem by Niemoller, "First they came". It describes the problem with your way of thinking.
