This kind of thinking would be a no brainer for me to cut ties with a medical professional, if I were to encounter one with these beliefs. And it is even more so an excellent reason to cut ties with a partner. Her fundamentalist ideas are so toxic, and she’s continuing to put herself, her patients, her family, and yours at risk. It’s absolutely ignorant and irresponsible.
