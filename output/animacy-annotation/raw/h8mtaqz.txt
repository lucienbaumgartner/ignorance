I don't think that "nothing exploded into everything". 
I'm not sure of any atheist that does believe that. 

Maybe you should find out what atheists actually believe instead of setting up this ridiculous strawman.... 


Something from nothing is a theistic belief, not an atheistic one. 
Its the theists that believe that god come from nothing, then used all the nothing available to him to proof everything into existence, from nothing...... You double down on the something from nothing idea and I don't even believe that a state of "nothing" is possible. 

Your post makes you, and theists look dishonest, and ignorant of atheism.
Maybe you should stop getting your information about atheists of religious charlatans and get it from the atheists themselves instead.
