After the Daytona ARCA race, Ty was frustrated about the finals laps and said something about going to a "real track" the next week, much like Kyle did a few years ago. He came off as kinda bratty.

Dale Jarrett called him out on Twitter for being disrespectful and ignorant of the team's history. Jarrett earned JGR's first ever Cup win in the 1993 Daytona 500.

Ty then won the Daytona road course race the following weekend, and he apologized for his earlier comments during the interview.
