By cognitive dissonance, I'm referring to the feeling of uncomfortable tension which comes from holding two conflicting thoughts at the same time, which usually causes a person to amend one view or the other. Leftists typically do not have cognitive dissonance, not because they don't hold conflicting ideas, but because they are so irrational and unaware that they can hold so many conflicting views without the slightest discomfort. It's what Orwell called doublethink. 

Edit: Maybe instead of downvoting, actually look up the definition.
