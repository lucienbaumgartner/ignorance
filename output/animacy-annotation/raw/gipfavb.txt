Why doesn't a company have the right to determine what speech they want on their platform? Companies don't have rights and have to allow any speech? Does Facebook have to allow speech advocating for child rape on their platform? How about coups? No one has a constitutional right to use Facebook, reddit, Twitter, etc. and to suggest they do is absolutely ridiculous and ignorant of the First Amendment. We really need to start teaching civics better because way too many people have no clue whatsoever what their constitutional rights actually are and the First Amendment is probably the biggest source of ignorance.
