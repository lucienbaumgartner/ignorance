Spent my whole life hypersexual and unaware that it was linked to cocsa experiences, so at least you've got it figured out a bit better.   
I'm still figuring things out myself, so I'm no expert, but if you're not interested in the relationship aspect of the sex, more just the sex itself, I wonder if a FWB situation wouldn't be too bad?  
I wouldn't suggest tinder or any of the anonymous hook-up things, but more thinking of anyone you know who you're kind of into and you think may be into you.  
Again, don't know if this would be recommended for someone who experienced cocsa, but it's the only thing that came to mind.
