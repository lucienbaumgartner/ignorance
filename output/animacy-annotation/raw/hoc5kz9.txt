Let me start by saying that I don’t necessarily think that the Raid will fail. But the Raid is definitely more similar to the Day of Black Sun. DBS is a day where their enemy would be weakest due to Firebending being nullified so the good guys stage a surprise attack to attack while the bad guys’ pants are down. The Raid is the exact same. All the enemies are gathered for a party, they’re drunk and unaware that the good guys are coming. Once again catching them with their pants down. If anything Yasiue’s death, while tragic, was actually a good thing because it kept the cover for the raid under wraps as far as we knew. Now Kanjuro being a traitor makes that somewhat moot but that’s not really the point. 

A situation that would be similar to Sozin’s Comet would be if the Raid failed and Kaido and Big Mom were able to fully link up with their forces and truly brought the threat of the Rocks Pirates back into the world. Then, when the villains are at their absolute strongest, our heroes engage in a last ditch do or die attack to win.
