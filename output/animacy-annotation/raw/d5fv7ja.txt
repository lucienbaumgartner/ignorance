Reptiliandude: I will respond to the question of human speciation a little later as I have some things to do tonight. In order for you to understand how we "reptilians" view humanity as several different species rather than as the one exclusively embodied in homo sapiens sapiens is going to require the use of some new human words which are reflective of the meanings of those used in my language. I will do my best to provide a comfortable association with the Greek and/or Latin origins of such as you might find in your own.


 I mentioned sociopaths because they are a separate human species from your one-size-fits-all homo sapiens sapiens. You humans mistakenly categorize yourselves into one species. You are not, nor have you EVER been just one type of human species occupying this planet. 

I will call the sociopath Homo Toxicus so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

The overwhelming majority of the human species would, by comparison, be akin to something like Homo Somnius: in that you are sleeping, underdeveloped, unaware, and inferior.
