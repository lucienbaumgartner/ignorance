On so many levels. You could barely get though a single sentence in this post without saying something pathetic and ignorant that increases your AH level.


You don't sound 31, you sound 13.


Clothes with any waste (poop, pee, vomit) need to be thrown out? And you actually believe your whole family feels that way? What do you think your parents did with you when you were a baby? Do you truly honestly think they threw away all of your baby clothes after one use? Babies will literally soil thier clothes 4-8 times a DAY, that's a lot of outfits to throw away because your too pathetic to understand that it's fine to put them in the washer. Also many people use cloth diapers and launder not just the babies clothes that gets a little bit of poop/pee, but the actual diaper that gets it all.


I hope you can improve yourself and try to act more mature after reading the replies in this post.
