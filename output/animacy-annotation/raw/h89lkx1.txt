*It was in that moment I fully agreed the councilor’s views, sure he’s been right about a lot. With the senate being bogged down by politics and bureaucracy. They could of stopped this war tearing the galaxy apart. All the men sacrificed fighting a war they where sold into. Ripping apart the Galaxy. 
Add to that the Jedi council being so blind and ignorant of what is going on. So self righteous and yet so hypocritical. I could have gone back and freed my mom. I could have saved Padme. They told me I was chosen one. So much good it did for me.*
