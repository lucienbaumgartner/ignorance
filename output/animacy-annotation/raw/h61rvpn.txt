 I know there are people upset with the portrayal of Bonnie Prince Charles on Outlander. He's shown to be vain and ignorant of the realities of war, and his attitude seems to contribute directly to the massacre at Culloden field. I'm neither educated enough nor Scottish enough to have an opinion on his portrayal but I know the debate exists.
