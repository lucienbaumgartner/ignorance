Sadly necessary preface: I'm not a "cancel culture is ruining Amurrica. PC gone mad" type. In fact I cringe any time I hear the term "cancel culture" and I'm pretty liberal and generally my ideals align with that side of things. But I find both sides of most of those arguments frustratingly obnoxious and ignorant.

That's exactly the problem with (ugh) "cancel culture..." The whole twitter mob thing has rarely been on-point or useful. Some good things have come out of it. But it's mostly just been hypocritical justice porn addicts seething for any outlet to feel like they're really fucking someone up. It's not about doing the right thing or making positive changes, that's just the excuse for chasing the rush of blindly attacking people on the internet and seeing real world consequences. It's a power fantasy.

Cancelling a minor celebrity is easy. Making steps towards meaningful change in systemic issues that negatively affect millions is difficult and takes more than a short barrage of twitter comments and youtube downvotes.

Nothing in this comment is meant to express an opinion on the issue with Sabrina and Gus. Just a commentary on trends in the focus and intention of internet outrage and the potential/likely reasons behind the seemingly frequent misdirection of said force.
