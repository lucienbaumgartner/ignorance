Loved the irony between Ethan and Hannah’s progression:

Ethan becoming less rational to the point he’s not the same caring man he was at the beginning while Hannah grows to be more understanding of human nature developing her own emotions 

More about Hannah, her journey with the Arisen is how I imagined in-game bonding to be aside from the quotes, no self-personality, very perceptive, and unaware of human emotion until well, they learn from their Arisen. 

Also, I don’t see a single resemblance between her and Mercedes in the slightest, the only thing that’s similar is a white cape... that’s literally it.


While not really characters, Episode 2 is my most favorite; Ethan thinking he ended the mayor’s gluttony and satisfying the village only for there to be more chaos. 

Simon and Balthazar were definitely the best side characters cus **BALLS OF STEEL!**

Theo has potential but became immediately wasted as soon as the episode ended 


Yang and Lennie were also redeeming qualities for me, Yang overcoming his sin of sloth and growing a pair up against a goddamn hydra. Yang deserved his bittersweet conclusion, suffering the consequences of his sloth tendencies that left Lennie blind, but at least she got the man she wanted in him. 

The Dragon’s a straight up cheater killing Ethan’s loved ones and not doing a bargain lol
