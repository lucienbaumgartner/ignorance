I love seals, i get a little unsettled when they get close to the lineup but surfing in California you just kind of have to accept that there is most likely a white shark within a few hundred yards of you if you're out a few sets.

Random story that i think that ive told in other threads but we took my buddy out for one of his first times surfing and he had on a silver bracelet that a seal took a particular liking to. The seal came up to his board, snagged part of the bracelet within seconds was pulling him 20 feet down and back by it until he managed to get the bracelet off.

The fact that he was a water polo player (strong swimmer) and the leash of his surf board keeping him from being taken deeper was what probably saved him. The seal was just being curious and playful but watching him get yanked under was one of the most terrifying things that i have ever witnessed in person because none of us had any idea it was a seal at first.

It was like a scene of a shark attack in a movie. Long story short, seals are awesome but also very curious and unaware that we cannot hold our breath as long as they can. :]
