Sinema doesn’t share my ideology but I’m getting tired of seeing people be so over the top about her  (and Manchin). 

Dems have 50 senators who are each emboldened with their own mandates. Sinema doesn’t have to face judgement on her record until 2024 - that’s our system. As of now, Arizonans have given her a mandate - this wasn’t a surprise, she was consistently among the most conservative Democrats in the House.

If we want other types of initiatives to gain traction in the Senate, we need to elect Senators who will support them. However, it’s hard to say that if Gideon, Cunningham, Greenfield, or others had won, that they would be considerably more liberal than Sinema.

As progressives, we have to reckon with the fact that our parties are big tents, there are moderates and conservatives in the Democratic Party and there is even state-by-state, rural/urban ideological diversity under the “progressive” banner too.

And thank God Sinema and Manchin were elected, cause NC, ME, and IA Democrats (or in NC’s case, their candidate) didn’t deliver as hoped. 

We have 50, including Sinema and Manchin - we’re not going to get what we wanted and stomping our feet and claiming we are intellectually and morally superior or somehow entitled to everything we hoped for is counterproductive and ignorant of the fact that we just don’t have the numbers. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.
