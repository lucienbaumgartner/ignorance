good luck finding a happy relationship if you think looks are the most important and not the person's character traits. not saying looks arent important but they don't last.

&gt;I said models, or any other attractive men, are not dating ugly women.

you say this as if it's some universal fact like the sun rising but I know such couples so you're just being ignorant and stubbourn. It may be a rare thing but it still happens, no mwatter whether you believe it or not
