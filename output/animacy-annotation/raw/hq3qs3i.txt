Schaub CAN be one of these guys cause he actually walked the walk and stepped in the cage, and put his body on the line. The point you missed here is people who make these comments from the safety of their keyboard didn’t don’t know shit, and just sound dumb, ignorant and disrespectful. Also they sure as shit wouldn’t make this comment to any fighters face no matter how successful they might be in the ring. If ur a fight fan, respect the trade.
