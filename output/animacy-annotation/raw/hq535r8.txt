&gt;you really are wilfully ignorant and unable to understand basic things.

You were talking about movies and how they have "objective criteria" of movies. I know what you meant. But I don't agree with that view of yours. That's all.  

Movies aren't such important topics to insult others about. Just because one person agreed with your takes regarding "objective criteria" of movies doesn't mean that everybody needs to agree with you.

&amp;#x200B;

"state of Facts"? Because of how I view movies? Funny you still don't acknowledge your toxic attitudes that you started because of your views of movies. All people aren't obligated to agree with your takes/criteria eye to eye. It's not some rocket science.
