*Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive*   
*stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause*   
*inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple*   
*tech stocks?*

Why is this shit even allowed on here? People in the stock market for longer than a year or two know that the President doesn't really affect things that much. Trump just took all the credit for a hot market because that's what he does. Even more importantly, this is how hypocritical and unaware of reality you are:

*Just last week, Trump tweeted, “The Federal Reserve is derelict in its*   
*duties if it doesn’t lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate.”*

That was **before the pandemic. Stimulus and rate cuts.** If that happened, the pandemic would have set us into negative interest rates and we'd be fucked hard, although you would still sit there and blame Biden.

Why is this bullshit allowed?
