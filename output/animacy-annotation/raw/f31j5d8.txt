I'm in my late 30s, and my wife is in her mid 40s.  We were playing adventure league earlier this year, and sometimes found ourselves grouped up with younger players.  Generally speaking, how we viewed them dealt a lot more with how they acted than their age.  Had a few 20-somethings that were clearly 'kids', and at least one guy that was \~15 and clearly the backbone of our party.  

I can't speak to your specific situation, but from what you describe I'm imagining that you're the self-conscious type that's a bit nervous.  I'ts pretty much always the ones who are socially oblivious and unaware that are the annoying kids.  If anything, the younger self-conscious kids are the ones I love playing with, precisely because it's extra fun to see how the game can help people come out of their shell and really open up.
