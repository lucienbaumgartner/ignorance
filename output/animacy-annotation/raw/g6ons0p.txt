I think the issue at my local store is more so that the shoppers seem to be inconsiderate and unaware of how much space they take up/how long they're in front of items as other people wait/ and most importantly, not wearing their masks properly. 

I'm so tired of seeing adults with their entire noses out when shopping or wearing those face shields that don't do anything.  This is also more subjective, but at my store, entire families will often come in (like two parents, grandparents, AND kids) all at once and not be mindful of how close they get to people and block entire aisles.

 I get bringing young kids if you're a single parent or the other parent is busy, but if you're all free, wouldn't it be easier for one person to shop and the rest to stay in the car/at home?
