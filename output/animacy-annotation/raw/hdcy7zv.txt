I think this sub has made me realize I'm a bit of a sociopath. These people are so dumb and ignorant that I'm actually glad they arent alive anymore so they wont keep infecting others with their stupid opinions.

I guess it's the whole "f\*cked around, found out" karma that makes me so gleeful about all this.
