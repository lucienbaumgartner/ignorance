TOES TOES TOES OHHHHHHH SCARY TOES UGLY TOES! MUAHAHAHA. You cant stand when men wear sandals... thats enough reddit for today
.. someone angrily said 1st gen italian americans arent italian, and now someone says men shouldent wear sandals because the things we all have on our feet are nasty. Its depressing that some of yall are so pedantic and ignorant that you denigrate a group becauce toes are nasty, or to be so dismally ignorant of culture that you think an italian is no longer an italian if they dont live in italy... makes me feel towards yall the same way you do about toes. Ugly and disconcerted, left wishing I never see your distorted and unreasonsble opinions ever again.
