&gt; Liverpool that just won a league after 30 years and a Champions League after 15?

How is that a con? The current administration took over a club on brink of administration and led it to CL/PL glory. If anything, those time periods are representative of how well they've done. 

&gt; We win CLs for fun here son. We are renovating our stadium while Liverpool still play in a third tier ground.

Yes, because you had much more revenue/fans/reserves than Liverpool. The current administration took over recently and they only had a fraction of that to work with. You're doing a comparison of the best/efficient management without taking context into account? Honestly, do I even have to point out how idiotic and ignorant that is?
