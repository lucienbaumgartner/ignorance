Maybe this example will help... I have a player who's playing a Blink Dog with the Aspect "I don't know why I teleport or what a Blink Dog is". This gives him permission to have stunts relating to teleportation etc but through discussion he described it that sometimes he just teleports for no reason. This corresponds with the idea of Aspects having pros and cons. So, during a combat scene he was at the front of the action, I had a countdown working against them, and just before it was about to run out I offered him a fate point and said, "It would be really bad luck if you teleported right now". So now he had to choose to sacrifice a fate point to prevent this or take the complication and gain a fate point for later. He chose the latter as we were learning and I thought it would be good to see what happens. So I moved him to another zone in the scene and he was inconvenienced for a couple of rounds, and the tension rises because the countdown had nearly run out (which would lead to many people getting hurt or killed).  


Another character chose the aspect "Socially unaware and somewhat literal". When the combat started, someone convinced everyone to join a charge which he decided to do, but thought it would be funny if he went in the wrong direction because that's the way he was looking. This fits the aspect I mentioned and was a self-compel. So, now he was a zone away from the fighting and a fate point richer.  


Prior to both these examples, I described compels to my players thus: "As the GM I will be throwing complications at you anyway, so why not self compel or take a compel from me and earn a valuable Fate Point as a bonus". And compels make complications come from the characters as well which is another bonus.
