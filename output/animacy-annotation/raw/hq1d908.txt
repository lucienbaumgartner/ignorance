Wow. What’s your blood pressure? It sounds like you haven’t watched the video in question, if you had you might understand why I called Piskor ignorant and arrogant. These two words I used have meaning and context, unlike the ones you throw around - You should know I do not need my own YouTube channel to have an opinion on his views. I certainly do not want you to kiss my feet but you can twiddle your tongue between my toes and get all the fluff out before you go back to tossing Ed’s salad
