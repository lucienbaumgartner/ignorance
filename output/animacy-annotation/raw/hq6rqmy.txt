okay? I don’t have a problem with people who have children young. I wanted to myself for a while. But to say “you’ll be too old to enjoy your kids going to college at 50!” Is just ignorant and uninformed. But I genuinely hope you do have children young and they have happy and healthy lives, as do you with them.

Anyways happy holidays man, probably get a blood pressure test.
