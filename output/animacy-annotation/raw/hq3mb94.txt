YTA. If you didn’t want your child to celebrate Christmas, you shouldn’t have married a Christian. See how ignorant and unhelpful that sounds? 

You are about to have a child, you need to get your shit together and stop making this a pissing contest between religions. It isn’t just your child, and it isn’t just his. You can have both every year and not act as if your beliefs are better than his purely because they are yours.
