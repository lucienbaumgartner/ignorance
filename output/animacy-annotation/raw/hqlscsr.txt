It’s a shame this full episode has taken such a toll on people’s mental health.

I’m really lucky that all my jobs have been considered essential so I’ve worked through the entirety of the pandemic, I live with my family so always have company, I’ve focused more on running when I couldn’t play the team sports that I usually do to socialise.

Other than a few recreational pastimes that I’ve not been able to partake in I’ve not noticed that much of a difference to my life over the last 2 years.

Like I said, I’m lucky but we are on the home stretch and its only going to get easier and more ‘normal’ as we go forward.

Yes I’m naive, ignorant and optimistic.
