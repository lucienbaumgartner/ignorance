Poser used unironically refers to people who try too hard to appear cool, people who try to show off how underground obscure bands they know and like despite lacking a taste/music hearing ability developed enough to appreciate such bands, people who denounce very popular bands like Dio and Judas Priest and call them not metal in their effort to appear as deep into the scene/culture as possible. The word was used in this sense for the last time in 1994.

The poser as I've used it is obviously not in this unironic sense. It refers to poor bastards who are so not in the know that let alone trying to appear to like cool bands, they openly proclaim listening to bands that are not accepted to be part of the genre. These pathetic clowns such as yourself then proceed to argue how the extremely popular, undeniably uncool bands should be included in the genre with no rational basis and try to be accepted into a group that rejects them.

Your comment is actually so wrong and unaware of its wrongness that it's the poser of comments, in the second miserable wretch sense. Posers like you would need to learn a lot more to even start posing as the unironic poser and would lick one such unironic poser's soles if you ever met one because it's your kind's insecurity and ignorance that makes you vulnerable to being impressed by unironic posing.
