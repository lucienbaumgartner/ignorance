I understand that becoming a single dad by choice is harder than becoming a single mom. I think biology not forcing fathers to fuck up their bodies and potentially cause them irreparable harm or even loss of life is "playing favorites", though.

It's just easier if you don't have to be the one getting pregnant, delivering the baby, and potentially breastfeeding it. So much can go wrong, and you are changing your body for a child, which men don't have to do. I'd be a dad in a heartbeat because it doesn't require nearly as much physical sacrifice. I think pretending that men don't have it easier when it comes to actual childbearing is being deliberately obtuse and ignorant of women's struggles.
