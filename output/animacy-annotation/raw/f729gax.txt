Would love to see that! I also am unfortunately familiar with Steven Anderson. I saw his preaching on "The Sinful Nation of France" the other night. People had been shot by terrorists at an Eagles death metal concert, and he basically said it was their own fault because they had gone to a concert that "worshipped death." He also told gay people to kill themselves and said LGBT stands for "Let God burn them." He's horrible. When I watched him, the things he said were so mind-numbling hateful and ignorant that I could almost feel my brain cell count going down.

As long as you post to your same channel, I have my notifications turned on, so I should get it! Looking forward to it!!!
