Ha! I remember all of this! His Spanish was so cringe! He couldn't get even the very basics. It was like 1 semester of high school Spanish level. No way he came out of majoring in Spanish talking like that. Then he and his nasty hags started making fun of the guy's English and accent without ever acknowledging that English is his 2nd language and a million times better than John's Spanish. As always, totally lacking in self awareness. 

The Russian thing was so very bad. Racist, ignorant, and just sad. Then he sat there dreaming of places he'll never go. Easily attainable trips for most people but his addiction to alcohol, laziness, and social media will keep him from ever coming close. What a sad way to live. There's so much more to life than this.
