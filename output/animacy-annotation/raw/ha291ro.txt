Take a look at the comments on that second article. I don't like that the entire thing is not viewable. Clearly, other studies do conflict with what it concluded. I also don't know why the first guy concluded that? There are many other scientists saying the exact opposite and I have seen no one else make a statement like that. I just want to know where that conclusion is coming from.

Your argument is valid but only if vaccinations don't actually decrease infectivity. It honestly doesn't make much sense for it not to decreased infectivity since vaccines function by fighting off viruses faster, therefore, destroying virus particles faster and reducing production. I would like to see a full study if you have one that shows vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads.

 Mandatory vaccination is nothing new. Dal already has mandatory vaccination for other programs. It is best to assume vaccination reduces spread (since they typically do). I don't want a new strain developing that is unaffected by vaccination and giving us an entire new lockdown. Best to reduce the amount chance this virus has to mutate by getting vaccinated. 

&gt;How naive and ignorant of history do you have to be to not realize what this has the potential to become?

We already have mandatory vaccines for all schools so I don't get your point. This is not an authoritarian country, one new regulation is not anywhere near close to allowing the government to start implementing crazy requirements. I think you are paranoid. You still have freedom, you have the freedom to come to dal vaccinated or go somewhere else. The government is not forcing injections, you will always be able to avoid it but will lose privileges like going to establishments that require vaccination. It is a privilege to travel, to go to university, not a right. There are many requirements for both and if you don't like them you have the freedom to do neither.
