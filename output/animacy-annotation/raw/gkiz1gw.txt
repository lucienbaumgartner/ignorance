Excuse me? I am from DC. My neighbors are being pulled in for insurrection on the regular. Half of them participated in a white supremacist attack on democracy.

The USA flaunts democracy in a way that glorifies it compared to war and other imperialist policies. 

We use GDP and the amount of money, despite the drastic inequity and poor distribution of wealth, and Olympic medals as if that should translate to any kind of reputable meaning to justify our prowess. 

We ignore every health indicator and refuse to set a precedent of prioritizing reality under a Disney-esque premise of promoting childhood innocence and peace in such a method that we ostracize the victims who don’t get to grow up in that mentality within our own societies and refuse to address it. 

We have over 100 members in congress who refused to condemn an insurrection because “party over everything” and constrain our political structure to not represent the people on any positive aspect and keep them immune and unaware of scientific logic by making politics for personal use and imploring vast lack of accountability for the rich, many of which were deeply involved in entertainment culture.

So forgive me for being critical.

“Just because someone has it better than you, doesn’t mean you’re feelings aren’t valid.”

Similarly, just because people have it worse, doesn’t mean we can ignore reality in our own country to prioritize a false righteousness as we exploit the resources within their countries for military strongholds and capitalistic gain. 

I’ll be impressed when we are both self sufficient, higher on quality of life and global health indexes, and DONT have to worry about a new age of Hitler over the next ten years with pretty high degrees of legitimate concern.
