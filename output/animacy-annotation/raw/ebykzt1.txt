Interesting, I usually go to Point Blank but never saw any shockwaves, but I wasn't really looking tbh. I guess this is just a great example of some Gun laws being so convoluted and ignorant that no one can consistently agree on how to comply with them. No wonder some politicians believe in fully semiautomatic ghost guns.
