It's just like people looking at a car wreck. Even though you know you're slowing down traffic and probably shouldn't be looking, you just *have* to. Except in this wreck, one car was carrying a midget dressed up like a cowboy, a donkey that has been completely shaved, and a circus clown that is completely naked, except for the rainbow hair and red nose. The second car carried three sets of conjoined twins who were having an orgy at the moment of the impact and are now permanently linked together like one of those Chinese wire puzzles, and the ghost of Sam Kinison just so happens to be standing on the side of the road screaming at everyone that is slowing down to look at the wreck. 

She's simply so dumb and ignorant that it's hard not to talk about it. For most of us, we are simply dumbfounded that anyone actually voted for her. It's incomprehensible, to be honest.
