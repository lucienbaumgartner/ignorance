I really think their behavior is anti-Christian, it defeats the whole purpose of love and stuff. I made the mistake of telling my mom she didn’t understand the bible and SUGGESTED she read the bible with context and try to understand. She started to cry and threatened to break my nose for that. Then when my dad came home, she told him I disrespected her in front of my siblings and that I called her ignorant and stupid. I tried to say I didn’t say those words she said I didn’t say it, I meant it. She think she somehow knows so much about reverse psychology or something and is always telling me to “stop playing the player” because she’s lived longer therefore she knows more about life than I do.
I just wish they can just acknowledge me and my feelings as a human being even, aside from religion.
