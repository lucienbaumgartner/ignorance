If you were one of a slim minority that was not insulting right off the bat, I thank you.

However, in the upheaval of dogshit that resulted from that dogpile resulted in your comment being lost to the masses.  

I do sincerely apologize for not seeing or reacting to your comment.  

If you were not one of the ones who decided to insult and continue to infinite I accomplished something nefarious or malicious, then you're not one of the ones I am respectfully asking to meet me halfway and apologize.

You didn't do the behaviour. So you are not who I am speaking to.

I also sincerely apologize to you for not clearly defining and differentiating those who were insulting, and those who were not when I was making my request to handle this like adults.

Lastly, I sincerely apologize to anyone visiting here who did not witness to the shameful event that took place.  To visit here based on twisted words taken out of context is not what I had intended.  

Or if you are new and unaware of all that has transpired, I envy you.

However, please disregard the ramblings of people to prideful to bend to a compromise.  

Do feel welcome to post and interact as you would normally do.  This is a safe space, where uncalled for insults or purposely hateful comments and posts are not allowed and will be removed to protect the safety of this place.

Thank you for your patience at this time.
