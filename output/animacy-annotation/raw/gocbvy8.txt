I mean...evolution is considered pretty foundational to modern biology, and has relevance in a number of related fields, such as the development and use of antibiotics.    Do you like the option of treating infections with antibiotics rather than dying?  You willing to commit to denying them to yourself and children should you suffer infections?

The thing is, you and your children could probably get along being scientifically illiterate and ignorant of how the physical/biological world works, so long as you're willing to unthinkingly obey the instructions of those more knowledgeable than yourself, and to uncritically fund their research with your tax dollars and not interfere with what they are doing or how they are treating people.  Of course, this still leaves the question as to where all the people who you are going to rely on to actually know things are going to get their education if the school your children go to doesn't teach things like evolution.  And this also leaves the problem that you, your children, and others like you are going to likely vote and otherwise participate in politics in a way unmoored from reality, one likely to interfere with best practices in research, medical treatment, etc.
