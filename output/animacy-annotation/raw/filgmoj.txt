I "put in the effort" to correct the conclusion that you were trying to make from your facts.  Your conclusion is flat out wrong and we have suffered significant international decline because of Captain T.  

As for you being sensitive... I know you are.  I checked out your profile and post history and was... well pretty sure you are young, overly sensitive, and unaware that most of your comments make no sense.  As many seem to point out.

Then you bail.  Feel free to bail from this conversation and continue the trend but don't pretend you made any sense or your point was in any way valid their skippy
