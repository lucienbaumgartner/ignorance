Self awareness, having the ability to observe details about their actions and that of others. While being intelligent and kind about it. 

It stems as the opposite of one of my turn-offs which is being oblivious and unaware of anything that's happening around them. 

I love anyone that can be aware of themselves, laugh at themselves, and know when things need to be serious or when we can use comedy to cope. I want to feel relaxed and comfortable around them. Knowing we're on the same page or have the maturity to get back onto the same page if we fall off. 

I like people who can see through bullshit, and like understanding how the world works, how reality works. Not in some pseudo-depth kind of way, just on a simple day to day life level. To me it shows you're paying attention to your life, and your surroundings. You're in the moment, and are observing everything with interest. It's something my brain has done from birth, it's how I operate, so seeing it in someone else just becomes really attractive for some reason.

 I guess it makes me feel like they would be more capable of understanding my mind, and I theirs.
