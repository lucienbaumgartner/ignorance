&gt; The subreddit is the same as it has always been

Trolling and bashing aside, I think this a major part of everyone's problem with you. Not everybody knows that you've "always been" banning people for just trying to share info about games etc. As a casual lurker from r/oculus (and person who generally loves VR and wants an awesome community across all hardware and software) I had no fucking clue you were banning devs from this sub and I would have been upset much earlier if I had known. Your crappy rules obviously hinder the community rather than support it. People WANT to hear from devs. Some of the best games I enjoy the most I first heard about on reddit FROM DEVS. You probably haven't realized how much you've been negatively affecting the community because they've been largely unaware and thus unable to express dissatisfaction until now. And now that everyone KNOWS that you're refusing to let them have what they want, they're fucking pissed. You may be correctly enforcing the rules but not only are you WAY too harsh in doing so but you need to take the bigger fucking hint that maybe your rules suck and need to change.

Ah, who am I kiddin, no doubt I'm totally wasting my time typing this but eh had to say somethin.
