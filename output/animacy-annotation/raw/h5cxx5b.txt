my worst setback was going to the OBGYN for my first pap smear and telling the (clearly new) doctor to please go slow, as i was scared and anticipating a lot of pain (i wasn't diagnosed at this point). she was also 'rough, swift and traumatic' and by the end i was begging her to stop the exam and crying out. her only goal was to get a sample and ignored my requests. afterwards i fainted, then woke up vomiting all over myself and the exam area. i was embarrassed, ashamed, and angry. it was clear she was surprised by my reaction afterwards, either oblivious to my crying out during the exam or just straight up ignoring it. 

she said i 'might' have vaginismus. i went to physical therapy, and there my PT said she hated gynecologists because they are not taught to think of the entire patient, but instead get used to just spearheading right in and getting out. i don't know if a more veteran gyno would have done any better, but there is very clearly a lack of knowledge on this subject in the OBGYN world ( SOMEHOW!!) i tell this story because the dr was clearly VERY NEW and unaware of how to approach someone with pelvic pain. had you not made this post, i would have assumed she was just a bad dr. but from what i've noticed is a pattern of drs not caring to do their research or listen to patients. IDK. maybe i'm just still mad at this one doctor and generalizing.
