&gt;You may be able to negotiate an exit with the landlord, but that's not required on his part.

This is actually illegal. You can get taken to small claims as a landlord if you do it. I know, because I did it, and I got my money back and then some.

@ScientistShan , please do not listen to redditors. they are dumb and ignorant, and they don't know the law, especially california law, and *especially* especially san francisco law. 

this is one of the most tenant friendly cities in the country. you can basically walk away from your lease and put a minimal amount of effort into helping your landlord replace you, because there is always a new renter waiting to replace you. the only time this was not true in recent memory was during the pandemic. and even then, there was so much obligation on the landlord to rent out at market rate (NOT your pre-pandemic rate). and you had leverage by just being able to refuse to pay rent.

if they try to fuck around, you sue them. any landlord dumb enough to fuck around with a tenant in SF who actually knows the law and has access to lawyers gets the joy of paying out
