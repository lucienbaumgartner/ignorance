I'm saying that all the American media is bullsh*t. It constantly shoves idealism infront of real issues and that the left and right are complicit in running this show designed to distract from the fact that America is a nation who overworks and undervalues large groups of people in the name of profit for a few. Americans live under an oligarchy of billionaires, just look at how much a lobbyists priority is held above the voters.

I can't even blame anyone who has been tricked into this culture war, it's not their fault that there is a massive economic interests in keeping people uneducated and unaware of the larger issues plaguing the country. Do people not feel it's a little unfair that so many people are surviving pay cheque to paycheque, only a minor medical incident away from being f*cked over? Or are they just told that these aren't real issues and that these people are privileged or just don't want to work, cus the data doesn't support that and if you just take the excuse so you don't have to face the problem, you are part of the problem.
