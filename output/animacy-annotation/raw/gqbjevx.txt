Hamilton Morris ... surrounded by reel inneresting questions he never answers. 

Maybe because nobody asks?  

Like musical taste. How does Morris like Tommy James &amp; The Shondells? *Krystle Cole Persuasion*? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Blue_Persuasion

Speaking of sweet music, any updates on his heart throb "in this podcast" on that?

&gt; Krystal Cole is a sadist torturer and has ratted multiple times just to save her own a**.  ... an accomplice to a guy (her ex-bf) being kidnapped, held for a week in 2 different locations... sickeningly tortured... his genitals mutilated. Good starting point... Pickard's legal defense team:

&gt;  Hamilton Morris ... has a 20-minute episode about this... *Getting High on Krystle*
https://youtu.be/r7qliVpGEk0 &lt; jcoffland - **a 20 min video about how he's in love with Krystle.** &gt;

Just kidding of course. With a smile on my face and love in my heart. We've all had our little romantic tragedies. At some point in a life time Everybody Plays The Fool (how does Morris like The Main Ingredient?) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Plays_the_Fool

What about Morris' 2013 book deal that seems to have vanished from radar? 

You know - 'book length' version of his *Paul Stamets Is Innocent &amp; Had Nothing To Do With The Unsolved 1980 Murder Of His Former “Magic Mushroom Kingpin” Rival Poor Dr Stephen Pollock - So Stop Saying That (And “Perish The Thought”)* article.

Almost 8 years passed since Morris chirped about that without a word out of him since? 

&gt; (Dec 3, 2013): For those of you that liked [my] @Harpers article *Blood Spore*, I'm now expanding it into a book for @mcsweeneys
https://archive.is/jNxhw#selection-3021.0-3039.10 

Not like I'm the only one wondering. **What happened to Hamilton's book "Blood Spore"...**  (OP) u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019) www.reddit.com/r/HamiltonMorris/comments/b8ywng/what_happened_to_hamiltons_book_blood_spore_from/  

&gt; Morris wrote an... article called "Blood Spore", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of "mushroom doctor" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/ [In] Podcast appearances ( ~4-5 years old) he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning [it] into a book, as documented by his tweet:
https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856
[ https://archive.is/jNxhw ] What happened to the book? Was Hamilton silenced... found out things he shouldn't?

Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City Univ of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI… crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers… 162 victims &gt;  http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

As Schlessinger said (in an episode of UP AND VANISHED):

&gt; most victims who get killed know the offender… the vast majority of murders [involve] people closely connected…. There’s a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim… Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they’re smarter than law enforcement…  when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said “I know not, I’m not my brother’s keeper.” That’s the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)… don’t follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who’s more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous [example], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. [Until] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader’s narcissism… &gt; 

As in real life so in 'true crime' fiction - it's a well worn storyline: 

&gt;  *The perp hires a detective* [or "journalist"?] *to SoLvE tHe CrImE in order* **to throw suspicion off himself**... *strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it (same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police)... [it's] an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was* &gt; https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy

Amid a weird (let's not say 'suspicious') combination of sounds and silence, I could almost ponder, “If I were a Hamilton Morris” (a harrowing premise):

Would I wanna be implicated in a homicide as accessory after the fact? By complicity with any unindicted suspect(s) availing of my story telling style (as a “journalist”) to frame themselves innocent in a preemptive maneuver by diversionary scapegoating some Bad Cop - with me as mouthpiece?

Considering the Beug/Stamets partnership's record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Like the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;  *the student* [never mind his name btw] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended “The Hollywood Bandit,” a notorious Western Bank Robber – and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf  [Psst - &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound. The gunshot Sgt. Monta had heard was actually Scurlock shooting himself. &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Scurlock ]

Especially with nothing for an alibi but some hokey ‘smokey gun’ audio cassette whose very authenticity Morris (according to his own unsworn testimony "I, The Complicit") can’t even account for, in his ‘version of events'?  On behalf of The Innocence Of Paul "his fleece as white as snow" (and just a crummy book deal in it for me)? 

As a frustrated Morris innocently explains:

&gt; I wanted to begin with a visit to Gary Davis’s house in Nixon (TX) to speak with him about the origin of the tape, BUT [nothin’ doin'] he was *by his own admission* [decoded: alibi] preoccupied with having himself checked in to a mental institution ...

(Shades of Roswell mysteries. Like that &lt; mysterious envelope landed on ... Jaime Shandera’s doorstep, sent anonymously with no return address, postmarked Albuquerque, NM... [like] a huge hint to some that Richard Doty was behind this caper &gt; *Adam Gorightly Discusses 'Saucers, Spooks and Kooks'* by Jack Brewer, Feb 23, 2021)

Especially after the Big Dramatic intro Morris gives this whole 'smoking gun' audio cassette ('red herring' as known in cheap detective 'pulp fiction') in his Harper's fairy tale (absolving St Paul The Innocent):

&lt; July 2011, I received a fragile-looking Maxell compact cassette from a retired psychology professor and gerbil-aggression researcher named Gary Davis. 

&gt; I had been told... &gt; 

(By Stamets Who Apparently Found Out About (And Therefore Knew Of) This Tape - How Now Brown Cow - And In What Context Of His Telling Morris All About It, Praytell? Morris never does 'come clean' on these dirty details either...)

&lt; (that the tape) contained a recording of two police officers discussing their involvement in the robbery and murder of one Steven Pollock &gt; 

AND in acquiring the mystery tape from this "Gary Davis" it seems:

&gt; the transaction was further charged by a stern warning… from Paul Stamets, who had told me about the tape but never actually heard it: “This information should be treated with due caution. Some of these cops, if still living, could be very dangerous.” &gt;

Skipping past 'first things first' (how Morris first came to hear all about this tape from Stamets in the first place aka Where / When / Why) - Morris 'starts' from a different beginning of his story:

&gt; I first had the opportunity to question Stamets in person about the story of the tape. In a sold-out room with theatrically dimmed lights… hesitant to bring up the subject of Pollock in public...

How discreet. And lo, when: 

&gt; I tell Stamets I have obtained the Pollock tape and think I can solve the murder, in response … his face changes. “You know, Steve was assassinated by the police” &gt;

(Portions adapted/edited from www.reddit.com/r/Psychedelics_Society/comments/in45oc/suspected_cult_leader_and_enabler_of_child/ )

If I got myself caught up in a potentially incriminating felony web, by my fingerprints on some lame Harper's article (transparently contrived like whitewash) how might I disentangle myself, to get myself the hell out of criminal jeopardy as an accomplice? 

Hypothetically of course.

So lemme get this straight.  

With such inneresting questions overhanging his pencil-thick neck like a sword of Damocles, all Morris chirps about - "describes" - is "ayahuasca vs pharmahuasca"?? 

And "why he prefers pharmahuasca" - ?(!)

**???**

Mkoay. Nice knowing. 

Thanks to OP for ... this.
