Lol, pasta time!


The inexperienced and insecure only understand strawmen that they can easily dismantle within their highly limited frameworks.

*”Elitists hate any metal that is different!”*

(Translation: Someone didn’t approve of a a band whose style is so forced that it even makes crunk core look organic. I’ve never heard of The Body, Gnaw Their Tongues, Negative Plane, Palimpsest, Jordablod, Pan.Thy.Monium, Imperial Triumphant, Moëvöt, Sigh, Pensées Nocturnes, Nuit Noire,  The Schizoid, Maieustiste, Raspberry Bulbs, Nazgûl, Nishaiair, Pavillon Rouge, This is Past, Reveal, Leech, Lugubrum, Daggers, Oksennus, Portal, Curse of the Golden Vampire etc. nor would I like any of it, because when I refer to music that is “different” I actually mean normie music and VEVO pop that has been forcefully amalgamated with lowest-common-denominator “metal” into a new gimmick by big producers aiming to target tourists, outsiders, and the inexperienced. I don’t really like when legitimate new boundaries are pushed so I gravitate towards established/redundant sounds that are paper mache’d together strictly for the sole purpose of novelty and/or marketability. So when someone doesn’t like the McDonalds “metal” I mindlessly consume, I cope by accusing them of not liking a band/artist for being “different,” as I lack the ability to distinguish between something “unique” and something “contrived.”)

*”Let people listen to what they want!”*

(Translation: Someone just shared a personal opinion that I don’t share. I feel that only people that want to suck given band’s dick should be allowed to express an opinion as it’s more often than not closer to my own. I’m insecure in what I like, and am constantly seeking the approval of others. When I hear that a band is vehemently disliked by a total stranger I become disillusioned and begin to doubt why I like the band. This may make myself and others like me stop listening to said band. Unlike other people who can hear a dissenting opinion and not give a fraction of a fuck, I somehow believe that negative opinions stop myself and others from enjoying things...somehow... Because of such, I try to shut down and shame any thought contrary to my own and make sure to frame anyone who doesn’t like what I like or share their dislike with only the most delicate and dainty words as an “elitist” who is somehow preventing others from listening to something simply by the act of stating that they don’t like it. If I paint the contrarian as one who is somehow physically preventing others from doing whatever they want to do, I believe this makes me look morally righteous. My fragility is palpable, but that’s pretty metal... right, bros?)

*”You only listen to [insert 20-part-ridiculous-genre-salad].”*

(Translation: l don’t understand/can’t accurately distinguish between any hybrid genres such as black/death, crust/black, death/doom, etc. as I’m not familiar enough with metal (or music in general) to make any meaningful distinctions so I must deride those who do understand... and someone just razzed my ignorant ass for saying that Slipknot is Death Metal.)

*”You don’t like bands with more than 10 monthly listeners.”*

(Translation: I can’t pinpoint any difference in quality between Gojira and Infernal Coil as I’m painfully unaware and unversed when it comes to Death Metal as a whole, so I assume that the reason “elitists” dislike the bands I mindlessly worship must only be strictly based on how many fans/the exposure each band has. Never mind that I would use the  exact same reasoning I’m strawmanning against to talk shit on the popularity of Billie Eilish, Nickelback, or Taylor Swift as being lowest-common-denominator music-by-numbers for people who’ve never once tried to explore anything beyond what they’re spoon-fed (not that I’ve ever even tried to rationalize my thoughts that succinctly). Also, I legitimately believe the reason that Metallica lost cred amongst “elitists” with the “Black Album” has nothing to do with compositional style, and everyting to do with how many people -who wouldn’t be caught dead listening to thrash before- suddenly got into them for apparently no reason at all. Thus my conclusions are not that I have basic-as-fuck-entry/pleb-level tastes, but that others who don’t worship the same polished turds that I do only refuse to do so because the band is “popular” and no other reason whatsoever.)

*”You only listen to albums recorded on a potato.”*

(Translation: My ears are untrained (or perhaps “conditioned”) by *AT LEAST* a decade and half of listening to over-produced radio-pop and my sensory ability to distinguish between different sonic variations is completely stunted. I’m not used to using my brain when listening to anything (or most of the time) thus I recoil anytime something isn’t spelled-the-fuck-out for me in THE most accessible way imaginable. Unless it sounds like it was recorded in a Virgin studio by the same team who mixes Taylor Swift’s albums, I’m incapable of comprehending it, so it’s easier to just mock things that make me feel insecure and like I’m on the outside. Also I think that saying potato makes me look funny and quirky, like it did in the fifth grade.)

Etc etc.
