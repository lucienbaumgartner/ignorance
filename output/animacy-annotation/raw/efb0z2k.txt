Look this is going to be hard to respond to but i’m going to. I will start by saying that I appreciate you saying you worry for me and that I deserve more, however I need not worry or pity or weak energy sent my way. I know in your mind your just being sincere but what you fail to realize is how biased your comment was. You’ve clearly been indoctrinated like a mindless slave to believe bad things about the entities I have mentioned. You make assumptions that someone has to be in pain or weak or something negative in order to call upon these ancient gods, how ignorant that assumption is. Do YOU understand the gravity of not working with them? Do YOU understand the gravity of labeling something “lower” or negative without proof or actually getting to know them? Do you understand how fucking rude and ignorant that is? I am worried for YOU because it is evident you’ve been deeply indoctrinated with christian bullshit or something similar. I am worried that you will always be blinded by these false “higher beings” that you speak of. I know what it’s like, i’ve been there, I was Christian for 9 years and finally realized how much bullshit it was. No prayers answered, no actual help or guidance etc. The angels didn’t do shit either. 

As much as I kinda understand why you’ve approached this comment with such a bias, I still cannot help but be annoyed at your condescending approach towards how I must be feeling and towards who/how the entities I listed actually are.
