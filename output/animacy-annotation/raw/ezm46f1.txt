I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted.  The clerk did say something stupid and ignorant.  That didn't warrant that strong of a reaction, though.  


This would be a terrible world, if everyone reacted the way the mom did, due to someone's stupid comment or action.   We've all said or done something stupid.  That doesn't mean we deserve being berated every time, though.
