A little background, I'm Irish and German, so I'm white as snow with freckles and red hair. Hence the username.

I greeted some guests at my restaurant and they just said, "No. Spanish!" I said okay, and then switched to the greeting in Spanish. They just looked at me horrified and said, "No! We. Want. A. Spanish. Waiter."

I stopped for a second, and just said in my cheeriest voice, "Oh sure, if you want to choose the race of your server, you can sit outside."

They started yelling about getting a manager, so I got my whitest manager that didn't speak a word of Spanish. She was also new, and unaware that the only other server there at that time who spoke Spanish was serving the patio. She moved them to the section of a server who looked Latin, but didn't speak Spanish, and moved them 2 more times before she had to apologize and say they had to either sit in my section or on the patio if they wanted someone who spoke Spanish.

They were pissed and took corporate's number when they left. I was so sad to see them go. Did I mention they arrived 5 minutes before close and those shenanigans went on for so long that the kitchen closed?
