Being someone that lives in Kentucky and knows how bad the storm was.....I'd definitely view this person differently. 

The storm took SO MANY lives. It's the worst one on record for us. 
But with that being said, with people in such a high position, I suppose it's easy to not be sympathetic and unaware of others. That is somewhat expected of men in high places.
