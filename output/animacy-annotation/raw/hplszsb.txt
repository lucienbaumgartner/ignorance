I kinda like that Top 10 guy and his grandson. Sure, they did look down Jiwoo. But they also doesn't look so ignorant and arrogant. I'm pretty sure Jiwoo will just lose without getting lasting injuries because Even the old man knows Kayden and his disciple shouldn't be messed with.

Also, it seems Kayden let Curtein know his condition, as the latter mentions about his condition. It is good to see some deep trust between them.
