You can send back the form with any excuse whatsoever and you won't get fined. It's an idle threat, they really don't try very hard to enforce it.  

If in doubt - "I woke up with a sore throat and felt it best to self isolate given the ongoing pandemic".

Alternatively "My car wouldn't start", "My dog ate my how to vote card", "I was worried about magpies", "I got shitfaced last night and had a hangover".

Or even just the truth "Was homeless and unaware of the election". 

If you so much as smear ink on the form and send it back, you won't get fined.
