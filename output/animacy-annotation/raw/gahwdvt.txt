I definitely see it as a self soothing thing for sure! It’s like a coping mechanism that I’m both conscious and unaware of. It definitely happens more when I’m feeling stressed or if I’m just thinking or focusing too deeply. I tend to hyperfocus on my thoughts and usually don’t realize I’m doing it! I’m on 36 mg of vyvanse but it doesn’t seem to help with this 🤷‍♀️
