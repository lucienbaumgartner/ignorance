Honestly I think it was our incompatibilities. Physical and mental. She was a virgin when we met. And even though we took it slow what was comfortable and what felt good to her wasn‚Äôt compatible with the same for me. So she had an initial mental place she could not seem to get past in our intercourse together and unable to relax. I was ignorant and probably not much help in that. It was such a negative thing for me. She used to call me an abusive man for trying to initiate sex. Even though she married me and wanted to remain with me. Sex hurt so I was abusive for wanting it. I was so confused and ignorant with no education to stand on. Like you said, she‚Äôs my ex and it‚Äôs in the past. But it‚Äôs important to recollect sometimes. So thank you for listening as well as the best wishes! ü§ù
