Ok.... it doesn't reflect typical "50s design." A blanket comment like yours is so ignorant and presumptuous. All you have to do is Google 50s design to see what it actually is but instead you'd rather sit at a keyboard with a grin on your face murmering to yourself "I sure showed him!" I grew up in,  and am literally sitting in the center of 50s design but I'm willing to bet without a search engine, you have zero fucking idea where that is yet you sit here and tell me "the town was build [sic] in the 1950s..." I think I'm just done with how unbelievabley stupid redditors are and how they need to keyboard warrior like their thoughts like they're fact. 

10 seconds or more can save you from looking like a fucking moron. 

A slatted house is nothing new and if we're judging it, then it's from the 1840s.
