I used to FUCK with Sony - since PS1. After seeing how they purposefully do messy launches to increase hype I’m done with them. Buy PC’s consoles are a sham in modern era. If you think any element of this wasn’t calculated, you’re assuming a large corporation is completely incompetent and unaware of how to do business
