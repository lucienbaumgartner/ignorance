I'm what I guess you're trying to call a "moderate religious people." I'm somewhat religious, but I don't talk about my faith, I don't push it on anyone else, I don't interact with people of the same faith more than anyone else, I have an extremely diverse group of friends of all faiths (including a Zoroastrian) and I'm accepting and very interested in their faiths. I don't judge anyone, and I don't like being judged - another reason I don't go to church. 
I fail to see how I'm "providing cover" to religious extremists who might share my faith. They're a disgrace.

I'm knowledgeable about my beliefs. It's incredibly ignorant and insulting that you would claim that I'm not.

You seem like a real sad, ignorant, angry, negative piece of shit. Maybe you'll grow out of it. I'm not going to waste another second of my time on you.
