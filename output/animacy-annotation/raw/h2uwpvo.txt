Wow. YTA. You are allowing your parents to abuse your daughter. What is wrong with you? Either you are so sheltered and unaware of other people's feelings that you don't realize how terrible your parents are and the damage you are helping them do to your wife and daughter, or you agree with them, which is even worse. If you're just that clueless, you really need to take some classes in empathy and try to understand how your wife and daughter feel being subjected to abuse just because you can't stand not forcing your parents on them. If you actually agree with your parents point of view, then I really hope she leaves you and takes your daughter for her own safety. 

The mental harm you have inflicted upon your own child is appalling. Please think about your actions and ask yourself if this is what a loving and responsible father and husband would do? 

I'm not saying cut off your parents. You do have a right to see them. But your wife and daughter also have a right not to be abused in their own home. Do not bring them around your kid again. And take a long hard look at your priorities. Who is more important to you? Your parents, or your daughter?
