Not everyone hates themselves. You don’t know everyone. Some are spiritual and all blissed out. We can’t speak for everyone. It sounds like something or someone or events caused you to come to this point. I would seek therapy. **I’m in therapy too!** so no judgement

I totally struggle with self hatred. But I know it comes from my mom treating me like shit. So I internalized her feelings about me. I’m undoing those patterns of abuse and language of hatred. Some in my family are asleep and unaware of their own issues. So I stay away from them. Make sure to only talk to people who make you feel good. Or at least people who don’t make you feel bad, even if they’re just “friends” on facebook or whatever. Be kind to yourself! Your inner child seems bruised emotionally.  But it also seems you brush that pain aside and say “I’m ok.” If you were actually ok, you wouldn’t hate yourself. 🤷‍♀️ 
Hate is a strong word. explore why you do.
