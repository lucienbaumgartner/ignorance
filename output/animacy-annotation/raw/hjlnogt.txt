I believe pain is such an important part of the human experience. I wish to challenge this video, respectfully. 

In the words of Jorja Smith “if you can feel the pain, then you know you’re alive” so many people walk around carrying suffering in their hearts and traumas never spoken. Completely unaware and completely unconscious.
Unable to break free because of the paralysation that pain causes. These people create more pain from the seat of their own un realised pain. And so the cycle begins. Where hurt people, hurt people, and in turn, hurt people. 
My own spiritual awakening did not start until I experienced a succession of painful events which thrust me into a position where I was forced to heal and accept pain, and in turn accept light and divinity. 

A tree cannot grow up to heaven, unless it’s roots reach down to hell. This is not just earth duality, and an unfortunate circumstance which inconveniences our experience. But a necessary condition to accepting and understanding the nature of the universe. 
Pain and suffering exists on the frequency that is equal and opposite to our divinity as beings of light. Earth teaches us that. Without the realisation of frequencies on both ends of the spectrum (light AND dark) simultaneously, one cannot ascend to higher universal vibrations. This is the nature of the universe
