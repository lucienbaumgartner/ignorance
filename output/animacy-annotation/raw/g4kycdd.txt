sorry, hard to tell around here :-)

I did this experiment to demonstrate that [even zip lock bags allow moisture in](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2008/04/humidity-and-cameras.html) back some decades ago (I did the initial experiment in the late 90's) At that time I was concerned about fungus growing on camera lenses. However it also has a role in corrosion, as this article makes clear https://galvanizeit.org/corrosion/corrosion-process/corrosion-rate

And had a direct role in the corrosion which forced me to do surgery on [my battery pack here](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/02/mercane-pack-repair.html). 

I find it sort of funny in this concentrated echo chamber of the uninformed and ignorant that the focus is on LG batteries being better (than what? Panasonic??), people go on and on about only charging your pack to 80% ([which has problems in itself](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/04/should-i-fully-charge.html)), but nobody considers how the pack is constructed and do not demand from the manufacturer greater warranty against construction failures like the above (where literally a $2 saving in chosing an inferior metal to make the bus strips from rendered the pack unworking). Happily it cost next to nothing to fix only my time and knowledge.

Happy Scooting
