You claim to have knowledge about what is going on "behind the scenes" with some of the more wealthy and powerful people in the world. You say their aim is a "direct takeover" of the tech economy globally and they already control much of the global activity today. Rather than citing facts or evidence, one must "read between the lines" and interpret their "code talk" to understand what is really going on, and those who don't know about this are blissfully unaware and ignorant.

This is textbook conspiracy. I don't like it because it requires me to already have a bias in order for the conclusions to logically follow from the premise.
