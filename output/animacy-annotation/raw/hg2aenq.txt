Does anyone outside Apple care about Apples reputational and legal risks?  Not really. It’s pretty clear he’s saying that companies like Apple care about their reputation more than reflecting on their business model and the reason why is because Apple has a supply chain metaphor problem. 

It’s all but spelled out in the section you re-quoted as well as in the others that you didn’t. Here it is in the conclusion of his piece. 

“Our efforts to build stronger and more resilient supply chains will get us only so far.”

Who is building these supply chains?  Society isn’t. Companies are.  And not the whole company but its logisticians specifically, the ones who take supply chain management classes. 

“Our efforts to subject learners to steep learning curves will get us only so far.”  

You really can’t see how confused and ignorant that sounds?
