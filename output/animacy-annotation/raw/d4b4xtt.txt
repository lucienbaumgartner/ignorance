Yeah, when I mix weed into my lsd trips, I start to see the world in such a twisted sort of mockery. To see other people go on with their shit jobs and their petty lives completely uninterested or unaffected by their coming deaths. To see the arbitrary social constructs such as honor, pride, faith, etc. and to how such non-physical social constructs such as these can so easily influence the actions of man. Can make you feel like a fucking idiot just for the act of living. You Pretty much  reach past nihilism at that point, that is seeing the world through absurdism. 

In philosophy, "the Absurd" refers to the conflict between (1) the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and (2) the human inability to find any. 

Realizing that most of our issues and hardships in life are fabricated by social constructs such as religion and society, that the importance we place on our daily lives, on our nations, our unreal gods isn't justified in anyway as nothing really matters, its just like a big joke in the end. Searching for a deeper meaning to life and then finding that their is no meaning, the universe's ultimate cruel joke and the hardships of being a rational and self aware being in an  largely unaware and irrational universe.
