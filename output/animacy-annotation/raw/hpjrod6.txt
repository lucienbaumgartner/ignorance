Omg just use you head ffs. Its not hard at all.......

At least give some indicators so people can see what have you fcked up and give you some advices.

For example if you lvl up unnecessary stats like int when you dont even use magic and stuff or you forgot to upgrade your weapon, stuff liie that.

By the time you get there you should have a +10 normal weapon by default which is more than strong enough to turn the duo into a joke if you didnt fck up you leveling, nah even IF you fcked it up its enough.

If you quit because you were ignorant and lazy to learn the game properly, guess you didnt even deserved to play it from the beginning. 

Best you could do is make a fresh start and LEARN the game properly. Not begging for other to kill bosses for you, no no. Actually learning the game. Do that and you will easily shit on that duo or dont and stay lame.

Dont stay lame, restore you humanity and be a fckin champion already.

If you want some simple, basic tips that can make you life easier we can give you that, just show some willpower and intelligence.
