I know I'm guilty of that, but I was also young and unaware of how hurtful those words are.   I think it's very different to use those words now than it was 10 or 20 years ago.   As a huge tool fan that has a son that is gay, that does bother me.   I hope he apologizes.  I'm not going to stop listening to their music, but I would like for him to put out an apology for using that word.
