whoops, i quoted someone else in a response to you, my mistake!

in any case where the universe is a name for all the observable processes that came after the big bang i think we can say that is has a beginning.

see this [quote](http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html)
&gt; All the evidence seems to indicate, that the universe has not existed forever, but that it had a beginning, about 15 billion years ago.
 
but where the universe is defined so as to include whatever "stuff" may have existed before the big bang yes that stuff may have hypothetically always existed. in which case, we merely disagree on what the uncaused stuff/thing/wahtever responsible for the existence of the universe (per the first definition) really is. 

if you think that stuff is, beyond a reasonable doubt: inert, unaware and unintelligent, what makes you so sure?
