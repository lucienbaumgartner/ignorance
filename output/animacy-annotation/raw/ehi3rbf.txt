"Regardless of their relgion"  yet you're disrespecting Islam by not doing proper research, going by stereotypes, and assuming that we want everyone to be like us. 

Dude, just look in the mirror. You're more like the thing you claim to hate than we actually are lol. 

That's like saying "I want the whole world to respect each others genders and sexual orientation, but you women have to stop complaining and gossiping and using so much makeup and you gays have to stop spreading the AIDS - please I just want progress"  See how dumb and ignorant that sounds?
