&gt;I’m saying that it’s ridiculous to have words which can never be spoken, that’s childish.

No it's not, what's childish is stamping your feet and saying "DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DOOOOO" because you can't accept that your actions and words have consequences regardless of what your intent is. What's childish is being so fucking sheltered and ignorant that you think people can just disregard what that word means, what it means to hear it. Thinking that you can circumvent the history of the term and just throw it around under the guise of 'explaining' shit. 

You do not need to say the word, plain and simple.
