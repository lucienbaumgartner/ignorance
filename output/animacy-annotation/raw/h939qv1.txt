&gt; So far, all I have seen people talk about is how on-hit is getting nerfed and crit/lethality is basically buffed.

Some people say that but they never explained why.

It's obviously bs.

1. You lose the 20 base damage on maxed E no matter what your build is.
2. Q max is not gonna be stronger because Q has not been changed (no brainer) and E is actually still very strong (obviously it gets nerfed because the base damage is a bit too cheesy), even after the nerf only 2 maxed E shots will still have more base damage (2x105) than hitting both parts of maxed Q (2x85), also most of the time you hit more than just 2 shots, also E can reset.
3. Total E damage including base damage interacts with crit, attack speed and increased crit damage (IE passive) and gets multiplied, which means builds with more crit are hit slightly harder by this nerf than builds that have only attack speed and less crit
4. The AD ratio increase is so low that you only compensate the lost base damage at full build.
5. I am getting tired of this discussion, because I feel like some users here are so biased and ignorant that they will just downvote without commenting and without being able to refute anything I just explained.
