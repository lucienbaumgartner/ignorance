Yeah she's still being played a lot in pro play and the Korean build helped her win rate in solo q. Though I'm surprised and unaware that she's doing well as a support!

A few weeks ago I think they were planning to nerf her E but that's it. I hope Riot doesn't nerf her too much if they decide to do it. :(
