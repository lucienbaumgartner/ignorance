How did the vet come to that conclusion, that she was blind? Did they check her eyes, say what caused the blindness or was it just a guess based on how she was behaving? If the cat was just behaving confused and unaware and unable to focus on their surroundings, that doesn't necessarily mean they're blind. I dunno 

Definitely take her to the specialist, it's better to be safe and sure
