Doesn't work. You need to posit a takeover by a culture with technology a couple of thousand years ahead of the indigenous culture. So what if aliens landed. They bring technology which can produce 100 times as much as we can, we can access space travel to others worlds and discover their cultures. We are no longer isolated and ignorant of the rest of the universe. We can be part of an interplanetary Federation, but have very little say in it. We lose our language, our culture, most of our land, which is developed by the aliens in ways we never imagined. Alien invasive species abound. Alien food is plentiful and grows easily on our land. Alien diseases run through our population. Many die before we develop immunity. But 150 years later we live two to three times longer, we have equal rights to the aliens, we've been intermarrying with them for generations. Our passport opens most doors to other planets in the space Federation. We are free to practice our original culture, but many don't bother. Our language is used and supported, it is reviving. Did we lose a lot? Hell yes! Did we win a lot? That too.
