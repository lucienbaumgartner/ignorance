I'm sure [David Dunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunning) &amp; [Justin Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kruger) would be shocked to learn they were 15 years old and on Reddit when they first discussed the now-fairly-well-known Effect in their paper, "Unskilled and Unaware of It: "How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"" back in 1999.

I'm also certain the folks who created Reddit in back in 2005 or thereabouts would likewise be pretty shocked Dunning and Kruger managed to be 15 years old and posting on Reddit as far back as 1999.  Hell, that'd be a pretty major scientific breakthrough!

Or, of course, it's also possible you're simply an uninformed/uneducated dingus who thinks they know more than they do about stuff.  Humorously, the very effect you deride appears to apply here.
