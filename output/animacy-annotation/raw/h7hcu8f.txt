Take your privileged self guilt and project it somewheres else. I worked at Walmart it was a shit hole. Everyone who wasn't on salary there (which is the vast majority) thought it was a shit hole too. Some of them worked towards bettering themselves. Gained skills and got better jobs. Others are still there complaining about their job but doing nothing to improve their situation. It sucks to get off work then study and practice new skills but it pays off. What does equality look like to you? For the record I support free education most most areas of study. Knowledge is a right not a privilege. I support helping those with special needs. I worked as a human Service worker for a couple years I have seen first  hand people who habitually make bad decisions and lose their kids because of it. I have seen the system abused. There are some who just got dealt a bad hand and with help were able to get a handle on life. I know how hard life can be. I wish people like you would stop pretending that people don't abuse the system regularly and pretend most people who are stuck in low wage jobs or habitual unemployment because others are just more privileged. You admit yourself you had it easy and you are trying to tell someone who has been on the other side that you know how it works. Whatever. Have fun living in your bubble where everyone that doesn't agree with you must be privileged and ignorant of other's plights.
