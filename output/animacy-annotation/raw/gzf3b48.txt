I'm not saying it's normal to mix adult and nonadult stuff but straight up removing it entirely like vaush constantly seemed to backpedal around with language like "pedophiles" is absolutely insane and ignorant of what pride is about. You can have the kids be a part of pride just do what everyone does and make it so the more uncomfortable stuff is idk, after the main event or whatever. Is that really so unfeasible to you folks?
