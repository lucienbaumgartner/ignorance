I don’t follow religious nuts rallies.. irrelevant to me. You are getting off topic. My initial comment to the OP was that “apartheid” is a recent, new cool “buzz word” used on social media platform to play with people’s emotions, that are uneducated, and unaware of the conflict. There is no apartheid.. its a lie. You are all misled. 

#THERE IS NO APARTHEID!!
#YOU ARE BEING LIED BY HAMAS AND IRAN FINANCIERS
