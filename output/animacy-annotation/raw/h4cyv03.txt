&gt; Equal and opposite? Only within the context of traditional gender roles.

No. Equality is a figment of imagination. Especially gender equality. It simply doesn't exist. 

&gt; By nature, men and women each evolved to have a separate and exclusive source of value.

True. But the value that we each contribute is not equal in any way.

&gt; For women, the ability to bear children. (Arguably the most important value to a species).

It's the bottleneck of the reproductive process, but it is not the most important element. Please, stop the pussy worship!

Granted. Humanity needs men and women. Humanity cannot survive without men and women. However, the process of gestation and birth is something that a woman can do in a coma. 

#In a coma!!!

A pregnant woman without the protection and provision of a man, is dead meat. She would be dead within a day or three. She cannot carry the baby to term without his support. She cannot raise her baby without his support. Even today, she has the support of the male collective, even if she doesn't have an individual man.

His support requires actual achievement. He must work and bust his ass, to protect and provide. He must succeed in life to accomplish his role in reproduction. She OTOH, can achieve her role while completely unconscious and unaware of what the hell happened. 

But because she's the bottleneck of reproduction, she's the most valuable??? Give me a break!

&gt; Each source of value actually created the closest thing you can get to a "balance of reproductive value" between the genders.

Traditional gender roles were balanced, but they were never equal. 

There is no equality between the genders. Not value equality and not legal equality and not any other form of equality. The whole concept of equality is a religious belief that has no basis in the real world. Thus, it's bullshit.
