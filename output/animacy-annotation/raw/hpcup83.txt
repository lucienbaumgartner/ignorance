There is knowledge outside of "core educational material" that is incredibly important and useful. An LGBT teen being able to read about other LGBT teens could really help them.  Realizing that you're not alone, there's nothing wrong with you, etc etc can be life saving. 

They absolutely are dumbing down their kids, trying to keep them ignorant and afraid.  It's terrible.
