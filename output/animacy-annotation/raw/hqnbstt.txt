&gt; Hell if it was in support of China why would it be being framed as a bad thing?  

Why would it imply America doesn’t support the health and security of its citizens? 

&gt; If this post was implicitly in favor of China why would it portray China buy US land and companies as a bad thing?

It portrays Americans as being ignorant and complacent in allowing a takeover of “all their land and companies” because CCP members are wealthy, which is supposedly the only thing the US system cares about lol only on reddit
