By advocating against a representative of the working class, you are hurting American workers.

You call yourself a communist, not because you have any idea what that means, but because you like to be a part of something.

You don’t care about pursuit of the truth, of finding out what is actually our best course of action, because you are so arrogant and ignorant that you do not bother to challenge ideas, or have your ideas challenged.

You ignored most of my responses and just said irrelevant or untrue things. 

Read communist theory, have discussions, face opposition and try to better your understanding. Otherwise, you’re going to keep hurting our cause.
