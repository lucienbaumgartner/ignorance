Consultancies don’t generally care about actually building good software, because that’s not what generates their revenue.

They generate revenue based on meeting the terms of contracts which are very cleverly written to basically have nothing to do with actually delivering a successful product. Copy this with slick talking consulting managers whose entire job is keeping senior clients stakeholders happy and unaware that their project is a giant money sink destined to go nowhere.

The failure rate in consultancy software projects is mind boggling.

Lastly, you’re rarely going to be anywhere near any kind of interesting or fun project. If a company is hiring a consultancy, they’re probably not someone that is technically strong in the first place, meaning they’re a nightmare to work with as a developer. Secondly, they tend to rarely be solving interesting problems. Most are usually ERP implementations or a company who think their needs are unique reinventing a shittier wheel.

Also the pay is below industry level, the hours longer, and bullshit travel commitments that you will 100% be lied to about in the hiring process.

I don’t like consultancies if you can’t tell. Fucking leeches.
