I don't feel equipped to talk about where it falls short in terms of the diversity and inclusion, but I will say the action just looks like they watched much more superior martial arts films like Hero, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Raid, etc. and decided to generify those fights by making them shorter and infused in trash CGI. 

For me, the biggest issue I had with the film and really with a lot of blockbusters nowadays is this PC agenda coming out to portray women in this tone of "hey all you men are stupid and ignorant of how we are just as strong and intelligent as you!". It just feels so cheap, disingenuous, and makes every female character feel so unsympathetic because they all feel the same. It's just boring to see women who never truly encounter real struggle or have any flaws because all their troubles in these films are because men made it hard for them and they would be perfection otherwise in a world without that. Not that I think Simu Liu's character is developed any better, but Tony Leung's character is handled in a more realistic way where even though he is technically the bad guy, his flaws and strengths are both highlighted and he feels like a real person. Perhaps that is due to how magnificent Leung's performance was though, by far the best performance ever given in a MCU film.
