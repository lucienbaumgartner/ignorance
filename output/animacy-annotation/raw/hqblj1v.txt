My wife and I bought a house on cabbage hill this year and we absolutely love it. Our neighbors are really nice and it’s actually quieter than anywhere else we’ve lived in the city. I think the mindset that cabbage hill is “dangerous” has mainly just precipitated down from older generations in Lancaster who don’t know the city that well, or feel uneasy being around people who don’t look like them. I think a lot of the thinking is just ignorant and racist. You should move here :)
