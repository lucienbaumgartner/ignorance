Part 2/2

&gt; I have evaluated many philosophies on the subject.

And yet you're unable to communicate any of them without making up terms for them where the terms already exist. 

&gt; It is a subject I came from both sides as I knew the standard view and the subjectivist view of morality, and so I could see different perspectives.

This is a false dichotomy. 

You REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY need to read that book I recommended. Here's the link again: https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Moral-Philosophy-James-Rachels/dp/0078038243/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GIJCQ4TYO4CH&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=elements+of+moral+philosophy&amp;qid=1615357947&amp;sprefix=elements+of+moral+p%2Caps%2C208&amp;sr=8-3

Your view of ethics is SO narrow and ignorant that it's hard for me to even have this conversation with you. 

&gt; One could claim there are many I haven't seen, as I always admit fallibility and ignorance.

You're a couple pages into your responses in this thread and I've not seen you do it yet. 

&gt; Victorian society was largely predicated on duties; so was roman society; so was mongol society; so is taoism; so is hinduism; so is judaism; so is christianity, and so are the societies that have been heavily influenced by them. 

Argumentum ad populum fallacy

Many of these had similar notions to duty. Again, "duty" is a great way of framing ethics you can't justify in order to control populations. Military's are VERY duty driven. It's because that's how you convince people to follow orders without question. So no surprise that a lot of religions find their way to that notion too. 

&gt; Remember, also, that I am not talking of academic philosophers, I am talking of people. I don't care if Wittgenstein would disagree, most people have a notion per their intuitions and their intuitions indicate an objective morality, regardless of whether you would argue that their intuitions are false, those are the intuitions at large. Grab 20 people at random on the street and ask them: "Is raping your mother objectively wrong?" and see what people answer. Ask the same thing in another country and see what they answer. I am making the claim that most people would say yes, and they would say the same regardless of whether you ask the question in the US, in the UK, in China, in Germany, in Mexico, in Russia, and whether you ask it in this century or in the 1900s or in the 1500s. 

1. Argumtum ad populum

2. Of course most people would say "raping your mother is objectively wrong." This doesn't demonstrate or even remotely relate to ANYTHING you were addressing. Remember, you were arguing duty here. I don't need a sense of duty to recognize that raping anyone is wrong. Nor does the fact that most people believe that make it true. 

In the 80s, if you asked people what the best color was, you would overwhelmingly receive the answer "red." Does that mean red is the best color? NO. It's preference. But preference is influenced by a lot of factors. The same way you might prefer red car because every fast car you see on TV is red, your ethical preferences are formed from your experiences. 

If you disagree with this, then there's little common ground in other for us to have a fruitful conversation.
