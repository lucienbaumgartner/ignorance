When did I say that at all? I literally said that gay people pass as straight. That is because gay people do not look or act differently (in most situations) than non-gay people.

The reason saying "It's not like they can't pretend to be straight" is a problem is because it is placing the responsibility of homophobia on gay people. It is, in a subtle way, victim-blaming. It is like saying that Holocaust was really not all that bad because Jews could have just pretended to be gentile. It is also incredibly tone-deaf and ignorant of how societies that persecute gay people operate, where whether or not someone is gay and even what being gay means is a decision made by other people, not an immutable trait that relates to the personal expression of love and attraction.

So I am pretty confident in saying that "Pretending to be straight is not a solution to homophobia" is in fact not homophobic. Stop acting brand new.
