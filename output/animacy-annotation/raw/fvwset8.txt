I am retarded enough (or maybe just too young and ignorant) that I just had to read an explanation of what an MBS is on Investopedia. I did know most of what it was just didn’t know the terminology lol. 

Anyway I don’t know shit so maybe I will wait longer before buying any calls. 
I might toss a few bucks into some shares of things like DRN or DRV depending on the day/week from time to time
