This is really sad actually. Imagine being so upset and ignorant (of the kinetic energy of a vehicle) that you throw yourself in front of a moving car. This girl is lucky she wasn’t paralyzed or killed (pavement is hard a hell, harder than the car). 

Also very upsetting that people like this count as 1 vote just like a person with a doctorate from Harvard (don’t worry I’m not talking about limiting peoples right to voting, just a funny observation).
