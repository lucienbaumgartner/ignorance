Nope not at all. There's a hundred things and more I am woefully unqualified, unsuited and ignorant of to pass judgement on. I couldn't tell you how balance Irelia Azir the best way. I could have an idea of emperor's dais only spawning once per turn or being higher mana and I will have completely missed a myriad of things this could negatively affect in the process. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong about this. 

It's also not my job to convince you I'm right either. But it is Riots job (or at least it's their intent) to convince us that they are right. And with the reasoning they gave they have failed in my opinion. Riot can be wrong. The game is bigger than them. They often look to the community for input.
