I hope Mormons are trying to infiltrate the government. I give two shi$s about a person's beliefs. I do care that a person has character, morals, and a lifetime of service all while being told to be humble, fair, kind and generous to all. Although, they aren't necessarily INVITING to all - I'll throw in the NOT ALL here just because we still chat with children. 

Mormons running America would be 1 Billion times better than the few hundred corrupt 'woke' regressives and corrupt whoever. I just know D.C. is corrupt, we all do. Some blindly don't get it like much of life, most are tricked because the Media is 'credible' in their heads, some don't care, some truly are dumb and ignorant of history and the horrors committed in the name of progress, equality, and fairness, then the rest get it but the other groups are just way too loud AND they have corrupt politicians and Media personalities lying to them. 

You all have said it, they have an empire of wealth and others have mentioned their skills obtained from a focused life. 

I vote Mormons over any current politician. And Romney, his ass is a corrupt D.C. stooge. We would want to put the atypical Mormons stereotype in charge. That with our constitution and three branches of Government (that work and are rid of treasonous üêñs) would make America prosper profoundly.
