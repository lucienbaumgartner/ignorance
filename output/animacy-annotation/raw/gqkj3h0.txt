Something we should think about for success.

Phase 1 of their attack came early this time around. Halting the markets and manipulating it to go down is just the beginning. In January this caught many people off guard and many people sold, because we were unprepared and unaware of their capabilities. Yesterday phase 1 started earlier and we held and we survived! I am proud to be apart of this and proud of each and every one of you. 

We need to think about the other capabilities our opponents have, what phase 2 of their attack will be like and how we need to respond. I know, donâ€™t sell ðŸ’ŽðŸ‘‹ sounds simple but it is even easier when we understand what is going on.

BTW limited purchasing hasnâ€™t even begun yet. Be ready for that. Know if you sell, you may not be able to get back it.
