That's like saying, "I have an incredibly ignorant and uninformed opinion about something, and it should be given equal credibility because that's how I choose to understand it."  

I could interpret the song as a man who believes that the weather is so bad outside that he's actually worried she might die if she leaves, and ultimately he's trying to protect her.  That doesn't mean it's the correct interpretation just because I'm able to aplle some context from the lyrics where this could be applied.

Your whole comment is just nonsense.
