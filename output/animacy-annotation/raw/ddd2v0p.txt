Not salty or crying, my candidate is the President and things are going well.  He has already followed through on most of his campaign promises and the left is cannibalizing itself through violence and picking the wrong battles.  He doesn't do anything horrible, you're just gullible and are willing to believe that because you lack discernment. Here is a good excerpt from Bill Ivey to Podesta regarding tricking feeble minds like yourself into voting democrat through subterfuge 

&gt;we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging.

Not taken out of context either, in fact the whole e-mail makes it twice as damning.  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599
