My man, we got an album with features from the likes of chance, 6lack, Ant Clemmons, Ari Lennox, Mereba and so many more amazing artists by accident? 

And again I'll point out that they were the most featured artist on the biggest and most talent diverse hip hop compilation album ever made. Dreamers 3 is historic shit and they were all over it, that's some superstar shit.

If you're a JID fan listen to the intro track for DiCaprio 2 frequency change. Guess what roof the homies that were ready to die jump off, the mirrorland hotel and casino. This was not a throw away album, vision and concepts like that show growth and maturity in an artist.

Look, music is art, and art is subjective. You're entitled to your opinion. But for a earthgang Stan you're being incredibly dismissive and ignorant of what they accomplished over the last 3 years or so. And for real, mirrorland is by far earthgangs most cohesive album. Infact ima go bang it rn
