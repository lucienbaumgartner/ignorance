If you’d read my whole comment you’d have found the part where I said, “if any of what I just said does not reflect who you truly are then say so.” I showed you those assumptions because that how you have made yourself look to everyone around you, from the ones you’ve slept with to total strangers in the net.  Then I addressed you as if you WERE NOT all those things I assumed. 

I notice you haven’t actually addressed what parts are true to you and what parts aren’t. 



As for the FWB, You could have helped her find her own place. You could have tried to hook her up with some other friend for the moment. You should have done literally ANYTHING ELSE.  If you are really so unaware and impulsive that you didn’t realize what a shitshow this was gonna be, I hope this taught you an important lesson bout the choices you make nd how they affect the people round you. 

I have two more questions: 
1) do you in any way still love your ex girlfriend?

2) the most important one—did you sleep with your FWB and/or your Ex-GF in the time that you were all living together?
