Absolutely. I’ve traveled and lived all over the US and it’s amazing how much more trash talking I hear from conservatives, simply dismissing everyone as ‘liberal’ or dismissing traditionally Democrat run states. 

The infrastructure across the whole US is crumbling, the majority of people under 50 are barely making it, half or more of the population is living in poverty and these people just want to dismiss everyone as being ‘liberals from the coasts’ as they enjoy the benefits gained for them by the generations before them and destroy all opportunities for generations after them. 

The (predominately boomer) ‘conservatives’ who do this are the most selfish and closed minded Americans to ever have lived and they don’t even realize that they are the ones bringing down the country. 

It isn’t about fiscal conservatism for these people, it’s about willfully remaining ignorant and hateful of anyone who doesn’t look and speak like themselves.
