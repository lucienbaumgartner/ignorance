I want my politics to appeal to all workers, regardless of if they have backwards social views. The process of engaging in class struggle is what helps to break down these deep seated, backwards views. This is why I keep saying it’s a dialectical process. Lenin and Mao didn’t wait for the peasants to be less reactionary or conservative before the struggle. It’s not that I don’t think these views don’t exist or aren’t a problem, they are a huge problem in organising. And to my goals specifically. But I realise that to address any kind of National Question, the struggle must be on a National level. The nation being America or Australia or what have you. So my position, is how to make Communism appealing to the ignorant and backwards workers without encouraging ignorance or backwardness. Because my position is, the best way to break these barriers is class consciousness.
