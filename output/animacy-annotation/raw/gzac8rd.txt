Just noting one thing. Your friend said 5e is light on rules. On this you can tell him that he is just wrong and ignorant of rpgs. 5e is squarely rules medium. The GM can ignore things, yes, just like how they can invent their own system from scratch.

But that takes work. It is not a valid defense of the system as it is written.
