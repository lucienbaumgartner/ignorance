Space is great, if the moose seems unaware and complacent I will talk to it as I pass so it knows I’m not stalking it and it doesn’t get surprised. Remember, spring is calving season and all cows should be treated like a territorial bear. Fall is the rut and all bulls should be treated like a violent drunken idiot with a sledgehammer.


Dogs are seen as predators and should be kept on a tight leash with moose in the area, I’ve seen a few nearly stomped on.

No hike/bike is worth a trampling. If the moose isn’t going to let you pass, you aren’t passing. Have an escape route/plant if things start going south.  Moose can’t climb trees, but can you climb one fast enough?
