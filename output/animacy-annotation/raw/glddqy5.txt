Being unaware and stupid is not the same. I have seen what was explained in the ingame description, but I didn’t know what to make of it or how they applied to the meta in certain aspects of the game. Calling someone stupid is very degrading and then especially when they have no idea how the situation is or what the other person’s intentions are. Have a nice day and don’t comment on this post again, as I have gotten my answer and your comments are simply not worth my time even reading them.
