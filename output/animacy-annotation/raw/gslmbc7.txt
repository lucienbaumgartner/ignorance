What are you even talking about now? Are you high? Are you trying to say that the police somehow made or convinced these protesters intentionally murder and beat other protesters?

Can you string one coherent sentence together to attempt to explain how the police are responsible for these protesters shooting and killing other protesters and police? 

And in all this time you’ve spent, you should’ve been able to give the names of two protesters killed by police. You can’t, because you’re completely clueless and ignorant of facts that challenge your views.
