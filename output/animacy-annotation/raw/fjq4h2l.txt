Jesus did not advocate any socialist ideas.  Its disgusting and ignorant that you think so.  This idea comes up every so often (neckbeards must all listen to the same podcast or something) on /r/AskHistorians and the concept is pretty much laughed out of the sub.  

Can you name one thing where Jesus advocated for the government to get more involved in society?
