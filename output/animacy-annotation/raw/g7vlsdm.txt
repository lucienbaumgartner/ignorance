As a kid I just saw the crash and nothing else (the first time I ever saw F1 stuff was around 94, and I was very young and unaware of who was who at the time), and later on, thanks to the power of the internet (and a bunch of others), I learned about the man who had lost his life that day and the legacy he left F1 with.

The Jules one just caught me by surprise. I had a free day at that time that I could watch F1 on TV again and while I was still laughing at the 2014 penis nose car designs, it was nice to see some of the races from time to time. And then that part with Sutil and then I heard what happened to Jules soon after. Stuff like that really sticks in your memory pretty hard. And just last year we had Hubert's accident too too (as well as Correa, who thankfully is on the road to recovery at the very least).
