If this happened in America and Chinese nationals would be recording and laughing, there'd be massive backlash over this. 

I understand not realising the extent of the situation in the moment, but maybe don't post the video showing yourself laughing when you know almost 200 people died. 


It's ignorant and disrespectful, like what Logan Paul did in Japan times 100.
