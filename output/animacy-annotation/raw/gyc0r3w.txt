I gave very specific examples of hatred and discrimination, calling that a fantasy is delusional. My husband gets harrassed at work about whether or not he's pro BLM and LGBTQIA+. People in this town are obsessed with forceful assimilation into radical leftist ideologies. If you don't agree to assimilate, you are literally labeled as a Nazi. But I'm guessing you're one of those people so you don't understand how disgusting and ignorant that is.

No, disagree philosophically with the ideologies that tend to follow those discussions - transgenderism/the existence of neo pronouns and nonbinarism. People like you fail to understand that you can want those people to have safe and happy lives without agreeing with them. I personally believe that having gender dysphoria should be treated as a symptom of trauma, which is usually* is, and hormone and surgical therapy shouldn't be handed out left and right but psychotherapy should be the first approach. But apparently that's hateful. Next we're going to start accepting other delusional symptoms into reality such as schizophrenic and narcissistic delusions... it's the same thing. Oh and don't tell anorexic people they aren't actually 200lbs but 90lbs, because they feel it, so it must be true. 

* I don't believe that every single trans person experiences dysphoria due to trauma, I am 100% certain a fair amount are genuine. But most cases of dysphoria in general are psychological pain displacement for the brain to cope with trauma and once that trauma is dealt with the dysphoria would heal. Surgery and hormone therapy for these people not only makes their issues worse but prevents them from facing their reality. Projecting the pain onto an unrelated issue is often easier.
