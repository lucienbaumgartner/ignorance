Look I'm also a red-piller on this movie - it was objectively worse than the originals (not "different", worse). But disliking something for pushing a feminist narrative is just ignorant and misogynistic. Disliking something for \*poorly\* pushing a feminist narrative is valid. But I don't even think giving Trinity powers was feminism-related - she was plenty badass without them ("Dodge This" and the motorcycle scenes in M2) - I think it was about the power of their love, but it was shown so badly that it came off incredibly cringey and like it was a "woke" move and not plot narrative. After all why wouldn't Neo's powers be trasferrable to other people in the Matrix?

Man it's like hating Avatar by James Cameron for the environmentalism message that I didn't even *notice* until my conservative friends started throwing hissy fits.
