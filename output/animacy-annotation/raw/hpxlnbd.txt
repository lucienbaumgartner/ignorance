Your teammates will suck just as bad if not worse than you. I'm in gold and my teammates are only marginally better, we all still suck pretty hard. Don't worry about dragging anybody down

If you can't win lane just try not to feed. If you feed just try to focus your win condition and push for objectives. And if your teammates flame just remember that they're ignorant and likely don't know how to play the game very well, so 99% of what they're saying is meaningless
