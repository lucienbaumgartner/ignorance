I am the equivalent of a minister, or teacher, in my religion, so I am **super** religious.  That said, I do not personally care whether someone I'm dating is religious or not, nor do I care what religion they are.  I get along equally well with atheists and religious people, and I have close friends in just about every major religion.  In fact, I often get along better with atheists or agnostics, because I find the fanaticism and lack of critical thinking on the part of many (not all) religious people to be lazy and ignorant.  

That said, even though I date people who belong to other religions, or even who have no religion at all, that does not mean that I compromise on my religious principles.  Primarily, that means there are certain things I am not willing to do in the bedroom because they would violate the tenets of my religion.  That often means that other people opt not to date (or continue to date) me, because they desire certain sexual activities in the relationship that I am not willing to engage in.  

So functionally, my religion *does* filter a lot of people out of my dating pool, but I never apply that filter myself.  I am always open to a relationship with the other person, regardless of what they believe, and I leave it up to them to decide whether or not what I offer is compatible with what they are looking for in a relationship.
