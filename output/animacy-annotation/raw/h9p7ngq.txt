The exception to the rule does not destroy the rule. What world do you live in where outliers determine probability? Did you finish high school? This. Is. Basic. Math.

Just because a 1 in a 100 or 1 in a 1000 event occurs does not make it any more or less probable. Do teams look at Johnny Manziel and Eric Crouch and Tim Couch and all the other 1st round bust qbs and say we'll we can't draft a 1st round qb because they bust so often! 

You are ridiculous and ignorant of basic principles obviously. 

You are the person that see red on the craps table board 15 times in a row and bets the house on black thinking there is no way it can happen 16 times in a row, what are the odds!? Failing to realize the actual probability is still 50/50....


Good day. I have things to do way more important than to teach you basic math and statistics
