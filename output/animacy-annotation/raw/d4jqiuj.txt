I tried to be agressive with my fuso on ranked which i normally don't and since my return, i've averaged 57% on random with that tactic whereas my ranked is an absymal 33.33 with 6 battles. (I know, it may be too early for me to decide with only 6 battles. I just don't want to be a liability for the team any further) On random battles, i try to stay between 14-16k out and citadel unaware and easy prey but i stay between 10- sub 10 on ranked to help my team with soaking up the damage. I believe i just don't have the armor to play agressively with the beautiful fuso. Maybe as you say, i should check up on more videos about ranked. Thanks for the heads-up!
