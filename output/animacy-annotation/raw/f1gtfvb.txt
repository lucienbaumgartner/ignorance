Wow, way to be so shallow and ignorant that you generalize an entire film industry and everyone involved with it based on the actions of a few terrible people. Especially when Jordan Levin has barely any connections to the Hollywood film industry as the vast majority of his career has been involved with the TV industry. He’s about as involved with Hollywood cover ups as a small sized credit union from Idaho is involved with the Big Banks of Wall Street during the 2007-2008 financial crash. You’d know his, had you bothered to do even a modicum of research before spouting off from your ignorant mouth. Alas, such basic things are beyond you capabilities. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
