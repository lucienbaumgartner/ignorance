But while we’re sober most of us humans have such low awareness that we don’t think any plant or mushroom has consciousness. We’re very unaware and disconnected, it hasn’t always been this way tho. People who live in the Amazon in their sober minds can observe that the plants are alive and even communicate with them. Seems to me that eating the mushroom can heighten your awareness to where you can start communicating with the mushroom. Just because mushroom doesn’t move around and talk in the tubs and act like a human doesn’t mean that it’s not conscious.
