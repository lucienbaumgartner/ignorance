Accepting a “objective meaning and truth” that goes beyond your humans ideas and ideology isn’t egotistical. A “objective meaning and truth” doesn’t require human thought or ideals to be perceived. It i simply a truth that you can choose to accept or you can be ignorant and egotistical and choose to decline. I don’t get stinger point, I’m sorry. I know I also shouldn’t be arguing with you, but with stinger, but stinger I guess doesn’t have Reddit.
