I'm sorry to say this, but these definitely are traits of a Narc. Your Dad sounds very controlling and unaware of how his actions are hurting you. Narcs always have to be on top with every one else on the bottom. I dunno if your Dad will ever realize it but at least you know now that your Dad's behavior wasn't normal. Stay Strong OP!
