It's hidden in mystery to make the T'au seem more Grimdark. When they originated the T'au were purely good guys. Super smart, relatively small, and unaware of the true horrors in the Universe.   Now they've implied there's mind control and the such going on.  I prefer the Original lore and keep it as my personal brain canon.    The T'au, to me, are by far the coolest looking faction with good lore too.  They offer more lore friendly paint customization than any human faction and they're access to all kinds of alien allies offers the potential to make lore friendly custom alien allies. 
We're really not the worst, in 7th we were OP as fuck. It's just now with 9th GW has just buffed all the other factions with a new Codex and have raised the leathality bar in general with the update.  We *should* get similar treatment when we get our codex.  This game is like 40 years old so patience is key. 🙏🏼     feel free to DM me if there's any questions you got.  FTGG!
