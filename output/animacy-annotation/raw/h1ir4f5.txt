More servers by far. Also a lot, ALOT Of bad players. Not in a negative way, but the playerbase was overall super slow and ignorant of the game world. “Smelling the flowers” was the M.O. for many players and the clearing the one dungeon you spent hours preparing for was a common achievement for people. 

Compare that player culture to today’s playerbase where everything is spammed to maximum efficiency, every secret known, and the end goal is both recognized and planned out methodically by the majority of the playerbase with access to immensely powerful tools like wowhead etc. and you can see how layering would be a much needed solution to help establish some semblance of enjoyable gameplay. It’s still not entirely solving the problem but I’d rather have layering over spending hours trying to complete basic quests because there’s hundreds of mages insta-tagging every mob in a region and AoE farming them all down in maximum efficiency.
