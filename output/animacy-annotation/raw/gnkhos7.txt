To sum everything up - the system of America was made to keep the general public uneducated and ignorant of the way the country works as a whole - the wealthy control the narrative (inequality in the most important aspects were hidden and silenced)

Social media comes around and now everyone can be connected - from setting up meetings to actually learning and furthering business (things that weren’t meant to be made so common became common knowledge) then people learn about more aspects of life and their country vs only knowing where you are at specifically

Now on the internet, everyone is a professional at their beliefs and those beliefs constantly clash with others - driving more division

The division distracts us and we probably won’t advance as far as we could/should until America fully wakes up to see the real enemies (spoiler alert it’s not each other contrary to what many republicans believe)
