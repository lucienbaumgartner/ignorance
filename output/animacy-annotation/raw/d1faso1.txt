&gt; To claim all muslims believe in the values you described would mean all christians believe the values of the old testament

No, it wouldn't. Christians don't follow the old testament, they follow the new testament. Christianity went through a reformation, Islam did not. We do not really see christian terrorism, christians that call for the death of apostates, or christians forming insular communities within western nations. You've shown once again you have no clue what you're talking about.

&gt;We have laws in place to stop people like you for a damn good reason.

And what law have I broken by posting on reddit that you now think I require stopping? You really either quite a poor troll or someone who is really politically unaware and inept.
