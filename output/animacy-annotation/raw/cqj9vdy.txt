 [**Hei Bai**](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Hei%20Bai) (from Avatar wikia): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;Hei Bai had been the protector of a forest just outside [Senlin Village](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Senlin_Village) for thousands of years; however, after the destruction of the forest, he became enraged and unaware that it was due to the actions of the [Fire Nation](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Nation), he targeted the nearby Senlin Village and blamed the occupants. As the [winter solstice](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Winter_solstice) drew near, Hei Bai transformed into his monstrous form and terrorized the village by abducting one villager each day.  When [Aang](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Aang) came to the village, he attempted to reason with the enraged spirit, but was unsuccessful. Hei Bai became violent toward Aang, prompting [Sokka](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Sokka) to help Aang by attacking Hei Bai with his boomerang. However, Hei Bai quickly overpowered and kidnapped Sokka and took him to the Spirit World. Later, in an attempt to calm the angered spirit, Aang showed Hei Bai the acorns that covered the floor of the burnt forest, reassuring the spirit that the forest would grow back. Hei Bai's anger faded and he returned to his normal form. He took the acorn in his mouth and left through the village's gate. From that gate sprouted bamboo stalks from which the missing villagers stumbled out.
