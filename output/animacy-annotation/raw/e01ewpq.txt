Whenever I see a sniper death I think how it must feel. I mean, they always seem completely unaware and quiet, probably thinking about regular things, like what they will dinner. And then, instantly there is no more thoughts, no more life, absolute darkness and silence forever. It's kinda creepy and sad at the same time.
