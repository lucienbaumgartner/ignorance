You went out of your way to make a post judging everyone, you come off very smug and conceited. Declaring yourself a better person is both ignorant and arrogant. 

You seem to give 0 fucks for anybody facing the consequences of what this guy did, instead choosing  to grandstand  your "moral superiority ". This will not make you happy and you brand of apathy certainly won't make the world a better place.
