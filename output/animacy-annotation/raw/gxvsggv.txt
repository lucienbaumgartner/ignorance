What Sardesai and gang have been doing for decades (they are after all typical marxists, just go lookup how they view media) Arnab does it 1000x better. That’s why they hate him. He’s beating them at their own game. 

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Hindu intellectual class is rising and that’s why they actually hate Arnab. He’s not only doing a better job than them at their own game, but undermining their entire life’s work and value system that was unjustly and coercively applied to a preoccupied and naive people. They are now paying the price for this betrayal, and their dying pangs gives me immense pleasure. That’s why I love Arnab, not for his journalism but for his acumen and acting as a conduit of exposure for probably the first generation of a Hindu intellectual class.
