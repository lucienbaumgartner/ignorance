I posted one of those just a little while ago. No one thought the boss had actually done what he said he'd done (cancelled the workman's comp) since it was illegal and there was no way he was going to be able to get away with that for very long in the business we were in. Thats why no one reported it. The state caught him when the inevitable accident happened. I'f I was to hazard a guess I'd say most people were young and unaware that they could at the time, or in a very precarious position financially and afraid to.
