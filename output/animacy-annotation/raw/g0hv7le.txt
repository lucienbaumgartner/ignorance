well, children are notoriously unaware and ungrateful; most do not know (if they have them) what gifts are physical safety, clean drinking water, food security, health care, education, freedom from civil unrest ... I grew up a military brat and was grateful for living in many places. Oregon and Washington and California are special for the reasons you cited (topographical/climatic diversity) but other places are beautiful too! (and you forgot the rivers and lakes and most of all THE CONIFERS!!!)
