&gt; your comment is so pathetic and ignorant that i'm not even going to counter with your wrong ass opinion.

So. Then why did you even respond in the first place. 

&gt; Israel + Usa both colonizers open up a book and not the whitewashed version your education system taught you.

Lol. Ok. The world has been colonized by one party or another throughout history.

South America - Spain and Portugal

North America - Europe

Europe - Other Europeans

Asia - Turks, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, Persians, Europe, etc

Africa - Europe

Australia - Europe

The world has been as a whole a history of empires and colonizers.
