My general rule regarding my kid is that we don’t trust her with any dogs. Period. She is too hyper and unaware of her own body to possibly read the body language of an animal. She also plays rough and wants to “hug” way too hard. We just monitor all interactions with dogs closely and that’s that. Dogs can’t talk, they can’t say when they’re not feeling themselves, when they’re touched out, when they just don’t want to be bothered, not in a way a small child can understand.
