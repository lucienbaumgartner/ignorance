This is what religion was constructed for in the middle ages. The poor and those unable to afford any form of education were 'scared' into believing if they didnt tithe their life savings into the pockets of the clergyman theyd burn in hell   
Its easier to convince the uneducated and ignorant of that than it is those who are better off   


Religion is and has always been a sham, a fear mongering construct.
