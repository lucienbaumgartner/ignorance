This claim was spread on a Swedish fake news website, and yet the article didn't provide a single link to an alleged example of this. 

Please provide even one link to an alleged paid Russian account. It is only the 'unaware and compliant citizenry' who believe false claims without verifying stories for themselves.

Anyone who is reading this, don't trust me. Don't trust the disinformation agents pushing fake Russia news. Research this claim for yourself. Try to find a single news story which provides a link to an example of a Russian account.

Edit: I specifically asked for a link to a paid Russian account, and they were unable to do so. I rest my case.

The only people who believe the Russia narrative are gullible sheep who believe fake news articles which provide no evidence to back up their claims.
