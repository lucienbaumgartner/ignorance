As he said, he was new and unaware that this goes on in pet stores, as I’m sure a lot of newcomers are. The rest of you “experts” are so condescending and rude to newcomers that it scares most of them off. Thus being extremely unhelpful when real problems arise. I think there’s absolutely nothing wrong with him talking to employees and trying to make a difference if by some small off chance one of them listens. Shame on you for trying to deter him from making a difference. 

If I recall the last picture that should have been tagged NSFW was somebody’s pet who had died after not taking sound advice from others. I agree that that was not helpful. But to me, this is.
