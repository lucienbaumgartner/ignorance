This is the exact type…opinionated, totally ignorant and uninformed and loves to show off the nasties that are posting YTA here. And actually thinks their ignorance makes their opinion worth something.

Gross. Personally if you don’t like kids I could care less on their opinion of anything remotely touching upon child raising. It’s like asking a vegan on the best barbecue methods.
