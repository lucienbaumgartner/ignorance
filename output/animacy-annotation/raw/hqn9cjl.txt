&gt; Pushing your own fear on people

Lol-- nowhere in my message did I state my opinion on COVID or put across any facts or figures about it.  You might be projecting here.

&gt; The fact that you are exhausted is admitting you are an insane person...

H'okay.  Now you're just coming across as stupid.

&gt; My sample size is literally most of the population and you cannot argue or disprove that so you will continue to down vote the truth like a coward.

I lied.  This is the stupid part here.  I'm under no obligation to back up your baselessness-- you led with "everyone I know is...".  Asking me to refute your point is...  you know what?  This doesn't matter.  I'm talking to someone who's just looking to rile people up.  You're not going to change your mind; you're here to whine at an anonymous person on the internet.

Your original post is as I said it was-- ignorant and non-empathetic.  That's kind of the gist of it.  Lashing out to call me selfish, insane, or a coward is just childish name-calling considering the context, and if it's coming down to that, then you're not worth more than this.
