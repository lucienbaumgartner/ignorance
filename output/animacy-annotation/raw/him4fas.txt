This is either a troll post or YTA. And not only the asshole, but also completely delusional and unaware of how the world works. You should move back to mom and dad, you are NOT ready for the adult world yet.

Apart from a very, very few exceptions, mostly people that got their career handed to them by rich parents or are so incredibly talented they receive scholarships and are already famous when they finish their schooling, any musician that made it big can tell you that it was a shit-ton of work to get there BESIDES already working their asses off with a regular job to *pay the bills*. I'm not saying your dream of becoming a star musician is impossible, but it's ***actually much harder than you think***.

Real life, like rent, utilities and food come first. Once you've got that covered, you can follow your dream. Yes, that will mean you can only cram in an hour or so of practice per day. Yes, that will mean you will have to wait and save up money to buy new equipment. Yes, that will mean that you will have less time for recreation. That's how adult life is. And you are already failing miserably at it.

Your parents and roommate have enabled your childish delusions for far too long already. I hope you come home one day with all your stuff in front of the door and changed locks. I hope you can't find a place to stay and have to move back to mom and dad. I hope your parents finally decide you need to get your shit together and get a job. I hope you make it big one day, but first you need to grow dafuq up.

And if this was a troll post, thank you, that allowed me to get out some bad energy.
