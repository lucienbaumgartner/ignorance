At 20 things were good and bad, but at the time I only recognized the good. I had just moved out of my parents house and into an apartment in the city with a good friend. The independence was intoxicating. I was in university and working minimum wage, part time. I was very ignorant and very happy, for the most part. I wish I could have lived my early 20s with that happiness but without binge drinking and getting into debt, the latter of which is still affecting me today at 34, and sleeping with/dating questionable people.
