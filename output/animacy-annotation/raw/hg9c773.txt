OP, himself, has not impacted me - however, OP and everyone of the same mindset DOES impact women's rights.

It is NOT POSSIBLE to be in the wrong body - that's a cult/religious/woo-woo/metaphysical pile of bullshit.  

Look, if the activists had just stopped at asking not to be hassled based on presentation, none of us would have a problem with that.  

Performing feminine stereotypes does not confer womanhood.  

Trans ideology is a MENS rights movement.  They have all the rights men have and are appropriating all women's rights too.

You may be blissfully ignorant and unaware of how this is going to affect you, but I am no longer.  

Trans ideology is putting violent men, most of whom are sex offenders, into women's prisons because of their allegedly sacrosanct 'identity', as if a man would never lie in order to access victims.  then the activists try to play No True Scotsman when these men are proved to be scum. California prisons are handing out condoms with a shrug, and several inmates are already pregnant.

If you say 'transwomen are women', you are a rape apologist.
