I can provide you with some of those things. Unfortunately, part of the problem is that the majority of climate scientists are not really interested in being climate activists, and so the information in their papers is largely translated to the public via activists and the media. Neither does a great job.

Returning to the issue of scientists not writing for the public, there are not a lot of meta-analyses of scientific papers on how to address climate change that a layperson could comfortably read. It's also not the sort of thing I'm that expert in. I don't really have a particular interest in climate change, and most of what I know is simply from being exposed to high-level conversations about it daily for the better part of my life.

I can, however, easily direct you to the EPA, which has sources for GHG emissions on their website.

[https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

Table ES-3 of the national GHG Inventory from 1990-2018 on page 40 has the information regarding aviation emissions for the United States which I referenced.

Some of the best--at least in terms of readability--climate change coverage I've read comes from the blog Noahpinion. Again, since I don't actively search out climate change information, I rather doubt this is the best source, but I can say I've welcomed his articles which push back against the specious reasoning of many activists while acknowledging the necessity of action.

Sorry I don't have much more to offer, but I can give some general principles that can help you judge any blogs or sources you come across:

* Coal is bad. Anything you can do to kill coal is pretty much a positive. That includes fracking and other techniques that lower the price of natural gas, a much cleaner and (ideally) cheaper fossil fuel. Since many coal-fired power plants can be easily converted to natural gas powered plants, this has a low cost but can reduce emissions from plants by 2/3.
* Climate change is a distinct crisis from other environmentalism. Be wary of people who make climate change their "priority" and claim that it will "destroy the planet/civilization," but maintain anti-nuclear positions or other environmental positions which are not focused on reducing GHG emissions above all else. (For the record, climate change will be bad, but much of the first world may not notice anything besides sluggish economic growth and additional natural disasters. It's perfectly acceptable to have other environmental priorities if you embrace this view, but not if you think climate change is an apocalyptic threat).
* Pragmatism. The best climate analyses I've read are all extremely pragmatic. While sweeping changes to society are exciting, they're also difficult. The best solutions are going to be those that accomplish the most at the lowest cost. People who focus on how to make everyday activities such as driving carbon-free, rather than trying to force people to change their lifestyle, are going to accomplish more.
* Technology and economics. Solar panels have exponentially decreased in price over the past few decades. The economic cause of climate change is fundamentally about how the negative externalities of power production are not properly factored into the cost of power. While economists have (unfortunately) been largely unhelpful and ignorant of climate science, this has begun to change in recent years, and many climate scientists stepped up and did the economics on their own. Determining the cost of climate change is critical to determining how much money needs to be spent on it (my rough estimate, probably direct government funding of between 4-40 trillion globally over the next 50 years). Knowing a lot about all the different developing technologies is similarly critical, since ultimately a decision must be made about which to use and when. RealEngineering on YouTube has a series of decent videos discussing the technological side of climate change which, as an engineer, I can vouch for.
* Politics is necessary, but be wary of becoming political. Generally, look for people who are policies-focused. While party-preference is fine, and acknowledgement of some parties' or politicians' intractability is good, the best commenters on climate change look for the political solutions which have the broadest support and the most effect. This is in some sense an amalgamation of all my previous principles, but also the most important one. The main reason climate change remains an issue is because the world lacks the political will to solve it. We have the power to do so, but many feel the costs are too high. Convincing these people that they are wrong--or even that the risks of them being wrong are too high to countenance--is perhaps the greatest challenge in addressing climate change. Largely, I recommend doing so by showing how little truly needs to change to solve climate change, though many reasonable people disagree on this.
