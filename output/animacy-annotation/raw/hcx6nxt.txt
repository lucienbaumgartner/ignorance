Absolutely even the general entilement over video game updates and reactions to harass the devs, they're so insensitive to the work the devs put in.   


A lot of gamers are just so insecure and unaware of what actual effort looks like, it's fuckin crazy. I wouldn't say this was a primary reason for me quitting but it definitely helped me make the decision a lot sooner.
