This comment is one of those comments that I know is going to stick with me forever so thank you for making it. It seems so stupid but I've never been able to make that connection before by myself. 

Whenever I've heard people say *treat yourself like you'd treat your inner child* or something I've always been like well... that won't work. When I was a kid I was in a pretty bad situation where I was either starved or force fed. 

I had one relative who was really kind, totally uninvolved and unaware of the abuse. When I was with him I could eat whatever I wanted. But he was an old man who had never learned how to cook so it was always takeout or junk food or snack food. There was no malice behind it, he just didn't know any better. 

Anyway, I've always thought if I were to treat myself the way I'd treat myself as a child, I'd treat myself like he treated me. Because he was so sweet and kind but totally misguided in that one area. But it's genuinely never occurred to me that like - caring about a child is also about ensuring they get a balanced diet and treat food stays treat food rather than daily food. 

And when you put it like that it seems so obvious - I'd never dream of giving a child junk food for every meal. I don't know why I've never made that connection before. Sorry this was a weird ramble but it really hit home.
