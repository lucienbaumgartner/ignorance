Bro, every weekend for the past 2 years I have walked past there after the bars have closed. Every year for the last 2 years I have seen the same scene. Anecdotal evidence is not the same as factual evidence this is true, but if you told me that you saw a family of ducks in a park every weekend for 2 years, I'd probably believe that a family of ducks lived in that park.

Drunk 18-24 year olds are the most reckless and unaware of their surroundings whilst consuming alcohol. This is factual evidence cited while sitting the test for a liquor control qualification. Combine that recklessness with an abundance of packaging and public seating, et voila.
