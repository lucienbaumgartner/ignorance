That’s okay. It’s just a matter of people being unaware and underexposed to popular previous work. It’s an easy thing to tease.

Genres are like a road map. The art and sound comes first, then people categorize it. And sometimes people will argue about it (see: hipsters debating the band Deafheaven)

For example, most Rezz stans will call her music “Dark Techno” which, is just wrong. Make an actual dark techno playlist and Rezz won’t fit at all. At most I’d describe her as heavy Downtempo Bass music.
