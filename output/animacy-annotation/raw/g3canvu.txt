ok look 1) I don't know if your mentally disabled or your brain is just unable to make strong neural connections that could thread together even the smallest form of a coherent intellectual thought but what you've just said is so immaculately wrong and ignorant that it honestly made me feel dumber just reading the words

2) It doesn't just symbolize communize you dumb fucking cunt

&gt;The raised fist, or the clenched fist, is a universal symbol of revolution. It also symbolizes solidarity and support. It is also used as a salute to express unity, strength, defiance, or resistance.

3)It is the fuking "Black lives matter logo"

4) In the trailer, it is intentionally recoloured black. Just like the "Black Lives Matter logo"

5) Even if we removed all of this BLM bullshit you have still proved the earlier comment wrong with the original bitch ass comment "THere iS nO PoLITicS i SwEaR" "B-b-B-uT oH yEAh No tHaT sYMbool dOEs acTUallY rePReSEnt cOmmunISm"

6) And oh yeah it does make me wonder about the deeper meaning behind the BLM logo I just found out. Which is actually a poignant message about strength, defiance and resistance, not fucking communism you neanderathal

7) Don't even try and come up with a reply. I have proved that your just a dumb mutherfucker.
