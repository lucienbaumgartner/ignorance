YES! It's progressive if you're a cis-white, white feminist. But I think we can agree that white feminism is not actually feminism it is simply white supremacy that pretends it's not. I think the "view it in a time capsule" argument is so whacky because it simply doesn't make sense. People say that as if there weren't POCs talking about how problematic this was even in 2004 and well before that. 

I find that people who use the "it was the time" excuse are really just trying to justify the fact that they were completely ignorant of misogynoir, biphobia, transphobia and classism. There have been POCs talking about issues with race in the LGBTQIA+ community for a very long time. If someone didn't know that in 2004, that's because they were ignorant and unaware and that is not an excuse and it isn't an excuse for the glaring problems with this show.
