It can be taken two ways. The way I mentioned, or that the ex is so unaware and incompetent that he couldn't even get her favorite flavor of Laffy Taffy right, despite assuming he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt, thereby hinting at the reason why he's an ex in the first place.

That potentially another way to take the fucking joke.
