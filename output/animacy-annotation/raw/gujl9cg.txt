He stopped touring around 2005 I think. His performance in Edinburgh from 2005 is on his channel.
Eventually he decided to start a music project in Glasgow designed to help kids with their musical creativity. 
His mini documentary fills in the gaps and is pretty interesting.
I've always hoped that Numan will bring him on tour again as I was too young and unaware of Gary at that time. If only.

Once you listen to a few of Rico's tracks, you have to listen to all of them. It totally sucks you in. I've been digging up old newspapers from 1999 just to get more info on him and his work. Really interesting guy.
