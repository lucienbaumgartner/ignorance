see but that is different. Because of the society we live in, capitalism and systemic racism doesn’t allow for equal opportunity between classes and races therefore to withhold necessities that hold value as basic human rights like food when it is not equally attainable for all *is* in fact greedy and selfish. Knowledge however is equally attainable for all races background and class. Anyone can walk into a library and pick up a book. Anyone can ask questions and learn what’s right and what’s wrong. If someone were to ask “Hey, I’m trying to educate and learn more about the injustices of the prison systems” for example because they are taking the step and approach to enlighten myself any sane just person would take the time to talk and share what they know along with resources for them to further deepen that knowledge, that is what I’m talking about. But to say that it is a duty to see any stupid person in the street &amp; go up to them and try to educate them is absurd for 2 reason. 1. You cannot teach someone who is unwilling to have an open ear &amp; 2. It’s simply not my job. If they wanted to remain blind and ignorant that is on them. What I can do is listen, hear what they have to say and understand from their point of view why they believe what they believe but if I go up to every random ignorant person and try to educate them why they’re wrong I’d be exhausted and drained of energy, it’s not worth it. Granted sometimes you get those cases where you do &amp; have a really great conversation where something sparks in the other individual but that’s not the case for every person you see. Do you understand?
