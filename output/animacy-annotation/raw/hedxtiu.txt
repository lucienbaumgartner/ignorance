Lol this is one of the most politically ignorant, historically unaware and blind to the existing reality comments I've read, in what way is the government trying to protect you unlike all history of governments and how are they not being authoritarian by violating individual rights in the name of overextended to state authority, I really don't before anyone is this ignorant or naive?

But seriously in what way have governments actions helped without making things far worse in your opinion?
