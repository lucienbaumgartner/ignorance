Do it then. Prove what no one has proven so far. Prove that making the general public wear masks has a net positive effect on limiting the spread of covid.


You ameritards are so pathetic.. So arrogant while you are so ignorant. My god... You are a joke to everyone. We are laughing at your fascination with making everyone wear masks. We do this while we have everything under control.


Instead of taking advice from people who handled covid amazingly, you are so arrogant and ignorant that you dismiss it, because what you are doing is great.... yeah great numbers you guys have... Go wear your mask child. Go make everyone wear their masks... Please don't listen to anything.. And hopefully you will get a lesson, when your ignorance kills someone close to you.
