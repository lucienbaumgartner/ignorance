Why are people in America and the West so ignorant and jingoistic?

For the same reason people in the east, north, and south are ignorant and jingoistic: because people are dumb. And smart. And nice... and mean... and goofy, and arrogant, and witty, and dull and all the whole range of qualities. If you get a big enough group of people in a room, no matter what part of the globe they’re from, you’ll get the whole range of characteristics. So it’s incumbent upon *you* to recognize that that’s the reality of the human race, and refrain from denigrating an entire region of the earth based on the blathering of a few dumbasses.
