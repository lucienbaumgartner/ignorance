To be clear I am not against transition. I don't think you are making a mistake if you choose to transition or not to transition just because you have autism. When considering transition, I don't think the questions should be "how can I tell if I am trans, what gender am I" I think the question is "what do I think would help me be more comfortable?" The human condition dictates that sometimes we are wrong about what we think we want, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't ever try to chase what brings us happiness.

The only issue is that children are impressionable and unaware of the depth of what influences them. Being neurodivergent can make this worse, and perhaps this is why we see significant overlap of gender dysphoria and autism. Those outcast from the land of the neurotypical may find friends among other neurodivergent communities. The LGBT community is very accepting and welcoming to others who don't meet the norm, and unfortunately many echo chambers can develop within it, furthering the gap of understanding between communities. 

As of now, how much of yourself are you changing simply to meet societal standards, and how much of yourself are you currently expressing without the pressure of theatrics?
