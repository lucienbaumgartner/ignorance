Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough.

I’m not an owner. I work in a business that hires international staff regularly. We pay them all well above award rates, always. $45-50/hr. That’s 2x award. We hire professionals. Sometimes we will hire and train young people out of school or at University but there’s a discrepancy between how the waiting profession is seen in Australia and, particularly, Europe. It’s a profession over there, not just a job you take to ride you over a summer. These people aren’t here. The last estimate I heard was a 100,000 person worker shortage in hospitality &amp; tourism. 

Of course there are cowboys exploiting the vulnerable. They’re a disgrace. It exists in all industries. Internships, traineeships, overworking apprentices etc.

What we are about to see, if the labour shortage isn’t fixed, is a lot of business closing. That’s a tragedy. People put a roof over their heads, feed their kids, you know, survive. The argument that this will fix the labour shortage is an empty one too. Celebrating businesses closing because of some chip on a shoulder is narrow minded and ignorant of how this is going to affect real people. My friends.
