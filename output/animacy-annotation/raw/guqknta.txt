In no way shape or form is Canada a better country than the US. I disproved whatever nonsense you regurgitated by telling you exactly what America is, a representative republic and not a democracy. You are both idiotic and ignorant of so many things. Enjoy your compulsory speech laws. I’m not a fan of Biden at all. But be sure that he’s better than Trudouchebag. Or any Canadian for that matter. Your country is literally a joke. Enjoy your “free healthcare” mate.
