What? I made it very clear from the beginning that what I “have” against Greta is indeed her personality, it’s her personal unsuitability to the role she is playing. I’ve been clear on that, I’ve provided evidence as to how she is unsuitable with regard to her abrasiveness. “What is up” with being a caretaker of ideas is that she holds such a level of importance in the climate movement that she is invited to the UN to represent those ideas when as I have said she is entirely the wrong person to do so. I get that you think climate change is going to kill everyone and the ‘boomers’ deserve it and are entirely responsible for this mess but the truth is that there is a collective responsibility for climate change on all of us, scapegoating older people doesn’t solve problems, it’s just an excuse to do nothing about them. 

You saying I have something against Greta is facile and ignorant of everything else I said, the point I made was in regards to her suitability for a role and that obviously requires an analysis of her personality. Whether I actually like her or not is immaterial. Her autism plays no part in how I view her except in so far as it effects her ability to fulfil the role she has chosen to do, and given her inability to positively influence anyone not a teenager (so anyone who can actually do anything,) I’d say she is entirely unsuitable to the role.
