Thank you OP for such detailed write up. Pardon me if I am posting this question at the wrong place. Just wondering if anyone here had any experience on what can be done if the victim had fallen into some cryptocurrency scam? 

Not very sure which category this kind of scam falls into, love scam or investment scam? Perhaps both? Victim thinks scammer is her boyfriend, scammer through fake cryptocurrency investment platform makes victim thinks they have a joint investment account and had been buying and selling non-existent cryptocurrency for months. All transaction were made through instant transfer, outside the so called investment application installed. The applications were all downloaded through web browser outside of App Store. Victim was not very tech savvy and unaware of the source she is downloading an application from.

This happened like almost 3 or 4 months ago, tried calling bank and also BNM but all of them said there’s nothing much can be done? Just curious if it’s true that nothing can really be done? Or there is but the parties with the ability can’t be bothered because this kind of cases happened too often? Or we are not trying hard enough?
