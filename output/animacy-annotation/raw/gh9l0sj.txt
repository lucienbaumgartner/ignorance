When I was a teenager and young adult (in the late 00’s) I was skeptical of the idea that there were really huge sums of people who were ignorant and unaware of global or even national going-ons. 

Then I went to college. Friends and I would laugh at jokes about Chinese not liking Japanese and in return not liking Koreans. There were always theses people who would blankly stare and say they didn’t get the joke, usually white girls from small rural towns. 

We’d explain there’s numerous reasons for the racial tensions but the most recent was Japan’s occupation of other nations during WW2 and they usually would respond akin to something like “but that was such a long time ago why don’t they just get over it and move on?” They’d also couldn’t comprehend abstract concepts like why the government couldn’t just print more money. 

The most jarring realization was these were the best and brightest from their small homogeneous town that were  filled with many more of those who didn’t make it out.
