Honestly it reminds me of mean girls like “I saw Cady Heron wear army pants and flip flops so I bought army pants and flip flops.”

It sounds like you’re doing everything right if someone’s trying to copy you.

This isn’t anything new there’s a huge market for fake gold jewelry and gemstones, clothing, shoes, purses and accessories. Some people are fully aware they’re buying a fake and in time some may want the real thing and they’ll go looking for it. Others may be unaware and very disappointed that they aren’t getting the real thing and will probably try to warn others before they also go looking for the real thing.

You say that you have years of experience and I’m more than certain that your service reflects that. 

What I’m trying to say is that I don’t believe you need to do anything at this point.

I wish you the best of luck with your business and keep us updated if you hear anything else about the copycat client. 

Light &amp; blessings 🙏🏼
