When I heard her sipping something on the phone, asked her what it was and she told me, 'Toilet Cleaner'. She had already been a self-harmer and I had supported her through stopping that, but as soon as things got dark, as soon as I tried to break up with her, back to this. Girl tortured me for years by hurting herself to make me stay. I was a prick at times, getting emotionally tugged around, I responded - But that shit? Worst thing was, I was young and unaware that if she were to do that, she'd probably be writhing in seconds or gravelly. Knowing her she was probably just sipping water on the other end of the phone and just had so much hate in her that could be redirected at me, she just told me it was cleaner. Man, that was some of the most fucked up shit.   


Worst of all, crazy seems to be the only type I'm attracted to. Tried being with someone 'Normal' and got bored. Tried going for another 'Normal' turns out I found a disguised crazy. Lawd help me. I'ma become one of those dog-men you always see walking their hounds down by the lake, always alone, because they live off takeaways, beer and the sports channel.
