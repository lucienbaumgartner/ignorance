That’s pretty disingenuous.  It is absolutely religions fault.  Just like racism causes people to kill people of other races.  These are ignorant and dangerous ideals and there’s no reason to pretend it’s some respectable thing.  We are talking about people who literally want to change other peoples lives over a supernatural belief.  Sorry but I’m not going to pretend that’s not fucking stupid.
