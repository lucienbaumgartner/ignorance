&gt; Apathy and ignorance are Trumps best friends.

Actually, it's the other way around... apathy and ignorance are Clinton's best friends.

If people actually research the wikileaks emails and look at the hard evidence against her, they'll see she's clearly corrupt. In fact in one of the Podesta emails, one of her advisors almost literally state apathy and ignorance are Clinton's best friends:

&gt; "And as I've mentioned, **we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry**. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."

Trump may be a lot of things but in the absence of hard evidence, we have to give him the benefit of the doubt in relation to the sexual assault allegations... sure, he's got a history of *saying* insulting things to women but that makes him an idiot, not a criminal.

If the worst dirt anyone can find to throw at him is the comments on that bus, then he's squeaky clean in comparison to Clinton and his biggest crime as far as I can see is the fact he speaks his mind.
