Because I said what you said was fucking stupid because it pretended as though there was a unitary opinion of any kind with any giant population, and then you pretended it was smart because you were generalizing and then you later admitted it's just most, thus proving my exact point the whole time?   


That's an awfully fucking specific thing to say is the reason why the rest of the world thinks we're idiots, but then again, now you're back to pretending all the non americans think all the americans are anything, so I guess we're just in FUCKING RETARD MODE again.  


If you said something true, you would find I also have a highly critical perspective on my own country and I think most Americans are highly uneducated and ignorant of history and global geopolitics, but instead of that, you're being a fucking retard and saying the kind of shit our stupid rednecks say, which begs the question, is this just UK humor? Cause it's a brilliant fucking troll if you're intentionally being the caricature of a stupid fucking American generalizing the entire world, but I suspect it's because my country lacks a monopoly on dumbfuck.
