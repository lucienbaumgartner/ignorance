I listen to country music, and where I live in Boston that's not really popular. There's a girl my girlfriend hangs out with who I can't stand for many reasons, the main one is how "progressive" and "woke" she is and she makes everything out to be a racial class gender etc issue and how she's standing up to it, we all know that type of person. 

She has complained how she has to listen to my "racist music". She called the ballad of Ira Hayes racist, which is a song literally celebrating the heroic deeds of a native American, by Johnny cash who spent his career fighting for native rights. He called Merle haggards "fighting side of me" racist, and "okie from muskogee" "fascistic".

My gf wanted me to pick her and her friends up and my music was playing in the car. She kept complaining about country music and I just ignored it, it was getting annoying then came the point where she flat out asked me if I was a racist because I only listed to music by white people. I responded with "you are so fucking dumb and ignorant, that sing playing, "burgers and fries" is by Charlie Pride, he's probably my second favorite singer. He's black, and I don't think about the skin color of the artists I listen to" 

Her jaw dropped and her face turned red. I told her to be quiet and one more word out of her and she's getting out of the car. 

After this ordeal my girlfriend said I was too harsh on her and I embarrassed her. I told her I don't care, I'm so sick of her. I told her I'm never driving her friend again and now my gf is pissed
