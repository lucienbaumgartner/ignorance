Do you really think I don't know? Did I say anywhere gays don't receive discrimination? It, unfortunately, happens at a good portion of the world and I hate it. But it's not illegal to be gay in Turkey and many, many gay people live openly in the country. You're still being ignorant and dismissive of this community when you blindly comment about LGBTQ+ people in Muslim countries, generalizing without knowing anything.
