Here is another individual who cannot have *a* discussion without resorting to informal fallacies such as strawmanning.

Oh, there are plenty of people who aren't stupid, dumb and ignorant that I disagree with. I think Stephen Harper was a smart dude, even if I hate his guts. John Tory is smart even if I think he's a trash mayor and trash politician.

I suggest you stop living in a colour blind world, a world built upon ignoring reality and ignorance of how the world works. I also suggest you stop strawmanning if you don't want me to call you slow.
