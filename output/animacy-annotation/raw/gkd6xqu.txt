I *think* I have some leeway, since none of the actual clients are in my country, just me on my computer, but im not sure. Theoretically, if all goes to plan, I’ll leave my country for gap year in my studies, late this summer, to travel and seek for my further purpose. I think that may have some impact, but I can admit I’m still unaware and uncertain of how well my plan will work. Either way, thanks for your contribution :)
