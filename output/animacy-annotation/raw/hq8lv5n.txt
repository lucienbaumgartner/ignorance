Again it’s like calling a WASP red neck or an elite Englishman a gypsy. It’s really not demeaning and just makes you look ignorant and stupid.

Being a drug addict has nothing to do with this. Blame my parents for knowingly having children when both are riddled with mental health issues and addiction.

Also I’m fully aware of Dalits yet you think I’m uneducated.. please

I don’t think it’s demeaning and it says a lot about you as a person you would use a groups very real often horrible life experiences to try and insult someone who’s a fucking Brahmin. Again calling an Englishman gypsy or traveler isn’t demeaning. It just makes you look stupid.
