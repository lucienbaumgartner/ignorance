Your bf is ignorant and rude as heck. In my culture ( Eastern Europe) it's the same as yours, and eating lots or at least enough and trying everything shows you appreciate the host and their food. 

I've dated 3 Arabic guys so far, this was back in the day before I met my partner, all from different countries. I never left their table hungry. Their mommas and families loved me and loved feeding everyone AND providing amazing desserts. They were always super welcoming and would serve a million things on the table so it was hard to resist lol even being small so I couldn't have second helpings but certainly tried lots of cool new stuff I still enjoy to this day. So I call bs on his culture crap. But whatever.

Unsure in what culture it's appropriate to shame OTHER CULTURES because that's what he's doing to you. You were just raised differently and he's being a silly little nitwit about it. Nip it in the bud now and tell him to grow up and show some respect and prediscuss or warn you about this type of stuff... or find yourself a guy who isn't such a piece of work, he sounds tiring as hell. His fam, too. NTA
