I've yet to come across stores with signs such as that one, BUT I have seen a friend's photo of a restaurant in Hokkaido that said no foreigners allowed during COVID. 

I've had terrible discriminating experiences living in Sawara (Chiba-ken) and realized people are just ignorant and racist, so it's no surprise to see this in Tokyo because many countryside folks bring their close minded mentality to Tokyo and don't try to be international.
