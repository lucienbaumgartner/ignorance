I personally have trained in different holistic modalities and I would not consider her holistic. She is a wolf in sheeps clothing. She is black and white. Many like to add Holistic or natural in their titles or practice now, to ride that bandwagon.

I didn't see the post telling people to help their npd abusers. But wow....I can see why many are saying she is a narcissist. She is either so clearly uneducated and unaware of the topic of NPD, or she truly is one herself. Either way, she needs to stop spreading misinformation.
