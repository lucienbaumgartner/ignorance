If you aren't able to communicate with honesty and you don't want to share your thoughts, desires, and dreams, then you're weak. You don't need to tell everyone everything, but if you're withholding crucial information due to insecurities and fear, then you're hurting everyone.

In order for us to heal our world, it's important for us to stop being afraid. If others react to you "opening up" by shunning you and being mean, then two things could be occurring: They're insecure and unaware that their actions are destructive, and/or you're expressing yourself in a cringey way that is self-centered.

It's our responsibility to find better ways of communicating, and when some people make fun of us and don't acknowledge us with respect, we can continue to share with others and realize that we don't need to be controlled by others. Irrational fear is an illusion, and it's time for us to stop being afraid and start loving each other.
