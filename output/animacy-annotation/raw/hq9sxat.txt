I agree! The other day I thought to myself, "Wow am I the only person on Reddit who keeps scrolling when they see something that they disagree with?" Exactly like you say, some grump finds a way to disagree and be mean! I even commented on a post about social media where I said I like Reddit better than Facebook because you are valued for your contributions of information on the topic, not your popularity. Someone commented basically telling me that I am dumb and I am not valued on Reddit and that I contribute nothing. What is the point of saying that? Just buzz off! 

The comedian Ricky Gervais said it best! He likened their offence to somebody walking into the town square, and seeing on a big notice-board, an advertisement for guitar lessons. They immediately call the number on the Guitar lesson advertisement, and scream on the the phone line: I DON’T WANT F\*%#ING GUITAR LESSONS!”  
“Yes Sir, that’s OK –  you don’t have to have them. They’re just available if you decide you want them.”  
“BUT I DON’T WANT F\*%#ING GUITAR LESSONS!" Haha that is how some of these people are! They just have to disagree! They just have to let you know! They have to insult your intelligence for disagreeing! And they report you and downvote you for not agreeing. These people I imagine are miserable and projecting their anger elsewhere onto us. Maybe downvoting and reporting and being mean on Reddit is the only power and control they have in their lives. I try my best to just keep scrolling on Reddit and Facebook too because I do not want to be like them. Recently on Facebook someone posted something that really pissed me off and it was hard to, but I ignored it. It was ignorant and judgmental but what is there to gain for me by commenting that I disagree? 

It's ok, forget about those miserable meanies! They just want to bring you down because they feel down.
