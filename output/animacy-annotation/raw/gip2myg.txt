My mom was like this, and for her it was definitely about control. When we moved from a ‘specifically people of the same religion’ town of 300 people to one of the biggest cities in the country, she could no longer control my access to information as well. When I was younger and ignorant of the world or even the way that other people interact, I just thought that her behavior was normal. When I started meeting different people with different morals, I began to see the difference between acceptable behavior and not, and she lost control of (me, the dynamic she had created, her tactics for manipulating me). For me, everything I see my Nparents doing is about control and how to maintain it over their (adopted) children.
