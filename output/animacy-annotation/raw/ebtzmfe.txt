What today seemed to suggest to me, was that some of the developers weren't happy with this change. I find that very odd, and that suggests to me that this was an EA mandated decision in response to BFV's poor sales. 

We speculated that the game wasn't selling well because of the controversy surrounding it, and the awful marketing campaign. We were confirmed this when we saw the 50% sale. Ahead of the holidays, it appears that DICE have got a call from upstairs pushing them to make this game more "n00b friendly" in an attempt to try and keep the new players who will be introduced to BFV over the holidays. 

That mandate seems to explain why they seemed totally unaware and unprepared, not only for the change, but for the hate it received as well
