The writng process is different for everybody, and while reading books is a good way to learn how other people have worked with the medium, it is just as possible to work with your own voice and your own experimentation. Stories have only been being written down for a few thousand years, and human language and storytelling absolutely must go back deeper into time than that, possibly a hundred thousand years or more (human ancestors like *H. erectus* may have had the earliest languages as far back as 500,000 years ago). Storytelling comes from human language and human culture— being engrossed in those two is far more important to me as a writer than consuming the most popular or critically acclaimed books right now.

Today, visual and digital media is how most people experience stories everyday, not everybody reads. Audiobooks are rising in popularity. As long as you are capable of using writing to express creativity, you should be able to write however and whatever you want— regardless of what inspired you, whether it be meant for film, graphic novels, traditional print, or anything else involving language. It's natural I think that younger writers like myself will gravitate toward the most prominent forms of media to express themselves within.

It's narrowminded and ignorant of creative possibility to dismiss television and film (or any other non‐literary avenue for writing) as somehow less valuable for inspiration. I see a lot of really gross and elitist attitudes around how writers spend their time, as if any time that's neither reading nor writing is unproductive and harmful to your quality as a writer. Fuck that. Why are you writing? If your only answer is to make money and make a career, I hope you find happiness in it, but those two alone aren't worth your whole life and soul.
