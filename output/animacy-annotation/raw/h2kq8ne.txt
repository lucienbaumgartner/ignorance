I’ll take the other side to this - I have no desire to be friends with someone that supports the Republican Party. If that person is so dense and unaware of the horrible ramifications of the actions of Conservatives (or worse yet, they support them) then I don’t want to associate with them more than I have to. 

I used to have more compassion for opposite opinions until 74 million Americans voted for a guy that let hundreds of thousands of Americans die needlessly. Until that same group had no problems attempting to overthrow the US government and couldn’t be bothered to wear a fucking face mask in public. Fuck the right. They are a bunch of deranged, selfish, asshats.
