They grew up in an environment where being gay was so exceedingly normal that I don't think they realize that this isn't the case in most places and not even until very very recently.... Point blank I think they're straight up privileged and ignorant of queer history. I'm happy that they feel safe enough to explore their identities in a caring environment but it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth that they see gay as equally privileged as straight.

All I can do is continue having conversations and try to educate them, they're still very young and lord knows I didn't know a lot at their age. And I definitely didn't have TikTok and twitter and all that.
