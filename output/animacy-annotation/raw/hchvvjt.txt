I believe you heavily empathize with people and perhaps that’s why you feel so guilty over these situations, you two were young and unaware of future circumstances. Now that you are more grown and understand the complexity of emotions and relationships you may simply feel bad for the person who would be hurt knowing you were previously intimate/involved with someone they cared for even if it has been discontinued. I could imagine the secrecy of this situation is also adding onto these emotions you’re feeling (Not that any of this is true just making assumptions as to why you may feel this way)
