Bolin not listening to Opal (or any of his loved ones) and siding with Kuvira is my biggest argument. Plus, Opal ignoring the fact that Bolin is very oblivious and unaware of the things going around him. It needs work because they are very young and went through this much. Long-Distance Relationships often makes any relationship toxic. By the end of B4, I still think they have a lot more work to go through.
