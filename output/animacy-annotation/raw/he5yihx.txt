It sucks, but unfortunately, you're not going to change your aunt's mind.  Yes, she's a misogynist and ignorant of reproductive health; you're correct there.  But she's also set in her ways and does not want to change.  No amount of anger or well-intentioned conversations with her will change that.  Best to save your sanity from trying to make any kind of difference with your aunt because, sadly, it will never happen.  Best to accept that now and move on.  Save your time and energy for a much more worthy cause.
