The thing about TOCD at least with me is that I don't even want to think I might have it. I feel like I would be invalidating a lot of people who really have TOCD, because I only feel confused at certain times. I don't experience TOCD as frequently as any of my other LCD symptoms. I feel similarly as you do at times, and then other times I am completely comfortable and unaware that I was thinking about being a woman earlier.
