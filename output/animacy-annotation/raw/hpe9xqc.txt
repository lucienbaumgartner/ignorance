Lady, stop trying to stir the pot. We get it, you don't like gulf arab countries, but your questions are willfully ignorant and obtuse.

There is no dress code, alcohol is freely available, all of your meds are fine you won't even need a prescription because no one is going to frisk you, you can curse all you want no one is going to arrest you, your mothers hormones - while increasing her risk of cancer - are perfectly legally here.

If you find someone while on a brief holiday here to gossip about that would be real news so gossip away.
