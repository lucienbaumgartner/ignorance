If people would just fucking stick together you all will win more games lol


About 50% of the time when my team of randos stays together we win, 100% of the time when they are spread all over the map you will lose.

Like, i can pull of a 1v3 occasionally, if they are unaware and terrible or if im very lucky, and a 1v2 easily if i get the jump on them  but constantly forcing 1v3s and 1v2s is fuckin stupid.

I tried to save my squad of idiots earlier tonight and i managed to knock 2 of them but the 3rd got me, and all because these 2 dummys just ran off on their own fuckin YOLO style, away from the closing circle into an unnecessary fight, if they wouldve took their time and stuck together  we wouldve won that fight


Anyway, playing with randoms is a crap shoot. Sometimes you get decent teammates and sometimes you get worthless garbage, and youll find out which within the first 60 seconds usually
