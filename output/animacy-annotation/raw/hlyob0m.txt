I have to add my piece.

I'm.a Sri Lankan Tamil living in Toronto who grew up in Community Housing. 

I was racially aware from 4 years old because I was mugged for my bike and called a Paki while it happened. 

It wasn't my first memory but you can't not he racially aware after that. My dad is bald so he was called n**ger  a lot too but as I become older there was a lot Sri Lankan Tamil specific related racism. 

Elementary Teachers would question me if someone farted. High school teachers would take me aside and tell me in subtle terms not to hang out with other Tamil people because of gangs. 

I used to get stopped by police a lot and searched. People would ask me about scams.

Hell if I was in some random place and there would be white people surprised at my presence, they just dismiss me as some "fucking Sri Lankan".

Having gone to the states a few times and being other reddit, at first I was surprised at how abcds were privileged and unaware of racial dynamics but how could they? 

Most people grow up rich, insulated, unaware of microagressions occurring against them. 

But I know my experience is not really all that typical.

That being said I fear for my East Asian brothers. Hard times are coming for them.
