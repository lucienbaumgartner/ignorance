Are you comfy, once every 6 months, taking your tankless out of service for a few hours and pumping vinegar or another descaling product through it for that period of time OR scheduling and paying for that to be done as a service?  

If this gets skipped, your tankless can get shitty. And/or die.   Fast, depending on the water going through it.

People who blow off servicing tankless units are a bane to everyone who deals with them.

It's tankless because of tech that stops working well if not kept descaled.

Tank heaters are easier to abuse and ignore and get away with that for years or decades.  If I sold water heaters and had to service them (not a box store) I might advise a tank heater too.  Just to flush some of the ignorant and lazy out of the pool of potential buyers, frankly.

All that said...

I installed a Takagi for our home in 2013.  We get our domestic hot water AND heat from it.  It's a damned beast.  I'm successfully heating a hundred year old cabin in northern WI with this thing and radiant floor heating.  

I do the maintenance.  Like it's a doomsday averting ritual.  Cause it is. 

It performs flawlessly.
