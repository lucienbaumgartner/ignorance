Saved for the perfect moment:

"For you, I can make any chair in this place vibrate."


When referring to someone else's strong conviction or emotional outburst. 

"I believed the tears."

Saved for the perfect moment when someone is being scatter-brained and ignorant of context (but I'll probably never use because I hate conflict... so I just imagine myself saying it - in the same serious fashion as Mike - as a precursor as a kind of fantasy)

"Listen to me.  Carefully--"

Said to myself when someone... well when someone sweet talks me right out of the gate of course:

"Oh man, sweet talking right out of the gate?  You want something."


Said to myself when I catch myself remembering, even for a moment, past grievances:

"I've gotta say, it doesn't help dredging up the past like this."

Said to myself when the I realize the self-pity is becoming too much:

"Jimmy/Soho, you are always down."

When depressed:

"None of us are ever leaving this godforsaken wasteland"

Another thing I wish I had the courage to say when talking to someone about harsh objective truths (though never anything really profound):

"I respect where you're coming from on this thing, I do.  But that's just how it goes."

On my mind when I decide a relationship is not worth my effort:

"Now understand this: after I walk out of here, I never want to see you again.  Never.  This ______ shit is too hot for me."
