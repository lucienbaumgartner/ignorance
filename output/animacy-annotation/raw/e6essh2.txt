Try and ruminate instead on all the ways in which you are compassionate and empathetic towards people.  We can also be in denial of being all the positive things we imagine are other people.  Not that the items you list are narcissistic, but narcissistic traits are common to all.  To not see those traits in onesself would just make someone unaware and less in control.  It's strange, anxiety and intense introspection is a double edged sword.  You are limited in being able to be at peace, but you also go to your very own depths... which makes you more able to identify with anyone and not condemn them.
