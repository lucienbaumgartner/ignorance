Ok see, you are saying really evil and offensive things. So when you try and say you are not evil, when you have already proven otherwise, it really means that you are evil and part of being such a vile and disturbed person is also lying about it. I mean, other than you admitted lack of reading skills, you don't seem so stupid that you wouldn't know that you are being evil. Unless you really are so stupid and ignorant that you don't even know the difference between evil and normal human behavior. Even then, ignorance of an evil act doesn't make it not evil.
