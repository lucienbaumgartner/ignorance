I have a similar story from a Christmas past.  For a little backstory: I am 31 and have been dealing with EDs since I was 12.  I “came out” with it at 17 to my family to my doctor &amp; to my friends.  When I was 22, my mother bought me all of these clothes from old navy for Christmas.  They were maternity clothes (I was not pregnant).  I was devastated.  My mother, unaware and insensitive to how this could impact me just said “oh I just liked the clothes and they made me think of you”.  Meanwhile I’m thinking “so you think I’m so fat, I can’t even wear regular clothes”. My whole recovery has been spattered with people who just do not understand that these things are extremely powerful for those that think like we do.  It isn’t even about “how they see us” because they don’t even think of it.  With your MIL it could be as simple as XL is a blanket size that could fit most people so she wouldn’t have to worry it “wouldn’t fit you”.  It could also be something stupid like “oversized is trendy so that’s cute”.  You’re not alone and it’s hard.  Keep going, keep reaching out.  You’ll be ok.
