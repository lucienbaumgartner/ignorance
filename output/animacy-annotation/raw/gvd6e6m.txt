Bitcoin is the first ever user owned currency. Some people like to compare it to gold but the thing with gold is when you buy and sell it on the macro level. You're not given actual gold, but a right to your gold, a stock, a bond, an iou that says you "own" this amount of gold. So who's in charge of making sure your gold is actually yours, it actually exists? The responsibility falls on the banks and in return the government. They work as a single entity as they are dependent on eachother. 

It is a centralized, inefficient system. One that has made those that run the game extremely wealthy at the expense of the majority. Just look at the covid crash. The Fed artificially pumped the market pouring 3 trillion+ into it, bailed the banks and gave them the power to trade more actively, more aggressively. The rich got richer while everyone else not playing the game got left out in the cold, it would take just about a year to get these people the help they needed. If this isn't a clear signal that we should not put so much faith in our current system,  I don't know what is. It's a ticking time bomb if you ask me. 

Thats the reason there is so still so much FUD being pushed by our media outlets. Keep the public doubtful and ignorant of the applications of btc and you extend the fiat systems lifetime. Defi is a space with so much potential but one that threatens the existence of these banks. 

Which brings me to the values of the founding fathers. They were freedom, limited government, and individual responsibility. Ask yourself what kind of "limited" government steps in to bailout failing banks? Trivial politics keeps the people divided and distracted. We are trained to consume and our choices are already predetermined. What kind of freedom is that? 

In what can we invest in to change thd system for the better?
