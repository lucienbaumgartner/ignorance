I just that episode and she appeared to be blackout drunk and unaware of that happening.

It was pretty clear as well she was in an unhappy relationship and had feelings for Jim as well.

She was on the way out, just wasn’t out of the building just yet.

Final season Pam on the other hand I’m sure is an interesting debatez
