&gt;There's quite a big change when a character becomes a suffering marshal, or a magistrate (more so if it's the adept kind), or a mortigue.

Not really.

The characters generally aren't entirely stupid and ignorant of what their jobs involve, and the main IC difference is external expectations on their duties while working. Characters do usually ply a regular job of some capacity in DH1e. It's not all inquisitorial stipends.

Mortiurges are assigned to the role, or they're recognised killers. Either way, the change is that they shift focus from law enforcement to on-site execution.

Suffering Marshals' most common means of entry is through the Inquisition. Promotion is temporary, a target is assigned, and their worth is measured in how well they capture said target.

Magistrates ... 'Requirements: Literacy Skill and either Common Lore: Administratum or Scholastic Lore: Judgement'. You had to start learning for this somehow. Books, tutors, other magistrates. Whatever it was, good enough; you're a magistrate now.

&gt;The latter makes it feel like you lose something.

You don't actually need the game mechanics to observe precisely when the character is informed of their promotion in lockstep chronological order. Just have things happen before the next rank.

Even so, there's nothing wrong with suggesting characters learn a little from the CRB entry for taking elite advances before they enter anything non-standard - justify why it makes sense, explain what you've been doing to support it, and haggle details until a compromise is reached. If you do that in advance, PCs get goals and GMs don't get surprises.
