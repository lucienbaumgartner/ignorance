Well the image is very stupid, but here we go. For starters the system that allows you to "live in comfort" has incapacitated you to think that the majority of people do not have a "comfortable life" the reason for it being people like you worry too much about "comfort" while some others worry about surviving. See... The system you praise has makes you selfish and unaware of the world you live in. Has taken away your empathy and reasoning, instead it has convinced you that you need material things to be happy. A monkey living in a cage may not mind the cage too much if there is enough bananas. This is humanity's downfall my friend. But I really hope you're comfortable while you watch you fellow humans suffer and the world die.
