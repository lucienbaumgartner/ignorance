The quote was taken much out of context, when Snopes reached out to the writer of the quote they received this response:

If these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this:

&gt; “And as I’ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking…”
&gt; 
&gt; No “master-of-the-universe" conspiracy; just a lament that leaders and policy makers have not been sufficiently attentive to some of the basics that make our democracy great.
&gt; 

I am not saying Clinton was the best choice for presidency but its really not that simple.
