I don't know which of your parents told you that people are just fully asexual and unaware of feelings about others until the break of dawn on their twelfth birthday...But that's not really how that works.

And by 12, they're dealing with puberty. You think *introducing* these concepts will go smoothly piled on amidst all that?  'Hey Timmy, bet you're feeling all kinds of confused and gross and weird about that new hair growing on you and your voice going all f#cky and those pus bumps all over your forehead but *anyway* on top of all that, you might start feeling like you wanna blow Johnny from across the street...'
