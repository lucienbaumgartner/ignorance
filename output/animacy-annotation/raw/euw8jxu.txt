NAH as of yet. Going against the grain here, but since you haven't discussed this with your dad (or your mom) technically you've jumped to the conclusion that he is cheating. Without knowing the whole situation, there is a possibility he is operating with the consent of your mother and due to their older/more conservative background, they're just keeping this part of their relationship under wraps. Until you know for certain that your mom is unaware and non-consenting, I would recommend that you discuss it with your Dad first. I'm going with NAH despite the 10 year wait due to the fact that despite what everyone is saying, your parent's relationship is their own and automatically inserting yourself in the name of being righteous or morally conscionable is a difficult decision at best, so I don't blame you for avoiding it.
