&gt;The Great Stink was an event in Central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather exacerbated the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present on the banks of the River Thames.

Obviously not everyone mocking Indian people for poor sanitation - which I hear they're working to improve, and had success - are Londoners. I just think a lot of people genuinely are so fucking painfully naive and ignorant that they thought this was never a problem to western countries.
