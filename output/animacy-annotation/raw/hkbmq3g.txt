I’m so sorry ❤️

My parents are also very toxic like that. I did the same thing, I think in fact for time I even thought they were supportive. 
I know it can make you feel awful, they play off of the compassion we have for them or others, and make us feel like a burden. 

Just know that it’s them that are the problem, not you. You are not a burden. Maybe they would of had an easier life, but it’s so selfish and ignorant of them to not think how you would’ve felt had you not come out. As if we choose to be trans. 

I’m also so sorry about your ‘counsellor’ (inverted commas, cause he can fuck right out of the profession in my book😡). 
One of the reasons I want to get into counselling is because of how fucking shit some currently are. 

He sounds awful, and frankly should never be allowed to see another client again. I’m so so sorry you had to put up with that! And I hope it doesn’t prevent you seeking support in the future should you need it. 

I second another’s recommendation for pink therapy, and if you have the energy (it’s ok if you can’t or don’t) and he’s part of any agencies like UKCP or BCP please report him. I know you complained, but wasn’t sure if you reported them. 

Just know that all of these people, parents and counsellor, all they said is wrong, misguided and horrible. You are none of the things they said. You are not deforming your body, or whatever ignorant arguments they made. 
You are brave, braver than any of them ❤️💜💙

Sending hugs.
Stay safe x
