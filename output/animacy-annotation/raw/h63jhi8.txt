History is full of kids like this. The problem is not a child having been around two shootings by this point, the problem is enough of us became so sheltered and unaware that we thought this wasn't still happening. 

But in a lot of neighborhoods it was and always had been, all that changed is the sheltered suburbanites who had forgotten have been forced to remember the reality they previously chose to ignore.

People are shooting up the ghetto a lot less now than they ever did before, but it never went away and it never stopped, we just pretended we'd gotten past it in our heads. It is privilege that we were ever able to forget that children experience violence all the time.
