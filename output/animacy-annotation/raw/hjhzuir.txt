"While I can" is anytime, you stupid drunken whore. Do you really think I wouldn't overpower you and force you down onto my cock even if you were fully capable of putting up a fight? That's half the point right there - to dominate you, to crush your spirit as I rape your body. Any idiot could accidentally fumble their way into your slit when you're drunk. I know what you desire is to be taken and used and abused, left a drooling mess, gargling the cum I left in your throat because I decided I was done with your cunt sooner than you wanted me to be. You'll be left bruised and battered, your hand drifting to your swollen red cunt to rub it out of some disturbed and depraved sense of need even though I've shoved a glass bottle up into it, your other hand idly massaging my cum from your mouth onto your tits like you're trying to make yourself into a glazed doughnut. Your mind will be so fractured that you'll plead with me to keep choking you while using your throat, but by that point I'll know that you're gone, your soul has collapsed, and there's nothing left to destroy except the rapemeat that remains.

That's why you don't get it while you're drunk, slut. It's because you want it when you're numb and unaware of the depths to which you will sink. No, I will wait until you're sober. I will take you when you feel at your best and most contented and most secure.
