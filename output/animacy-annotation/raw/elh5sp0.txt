It's for the safety of the patient and the staff. Regardless of whether you say sorry or not, it's extremely offensive and ignorant that you think my being gay impacts that at all or would be sexual assault. I never touch them. I'm not ogling them. I don't like it doing it. I hate doing it. It's the worst part of my job. Nobody's enjoys it. You can say it's not against me personally but that is personal. My sexual orientation has zero impact on my job, if anything I just get to be verbally harrassed by patients if they out but despite that I still care for them the best I can with as much compassion and patience as I can. Theres nothing illegal about making sure a patient doesn't have drugs so they can overdose or give to another patient who's allergic or so they can overdose. Or to check if they have a knife so they can't kill themselves or one of us. Is it a perfect system? No. Does it make people uncomfortable? Sure. But it's for the safety of everyone.
