Lol. No. Not wanting to specialize is not a bad thing. In my dental class it was polled that 56%o of us don't have any intentions on specializing at all. So here are my two cents

1. Don't shame others for not wanting the same thing you want no matter what. Its horribly rude and mean. It also is frankly very unprofessional and ignorant of you to think its bad for choosing a different path especially when one works better for that other person. 

2. Specializing does not necessarily mean more connections and more money. Money depends on your practice size, your location, overhead, and soon many more factors than just having a specialty or not. Connections as well don't necessarily increase. Especially if it gets out that you look down on general dentists that didn't specialize. If it got out to your community you looked down on someone for doing GD see how many GD's would refer patients to you for treatment. 


TLDR: don't be ignorant and unprofessional.
