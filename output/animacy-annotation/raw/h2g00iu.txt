&gt; Never said it did. Fuck off with your fake straw man argument.

Your are mistaking an inference(ie: a guess...that apparently struck a nerve) with a straw man argument. If you do not wish to respond to the critique, it says almost as much as if you had tried to respond. You chose deflection, which tells me you do not want to really dive deep into these ideas. You only want to pretend to be most correct always.

&gt; Secondly no I didnâ€™t see a bunch of poc speaking out against crt. &gt; I do see right wing uncle toms like Candice I refuse to learn history Owens.

So black people who do not tow your party line are Uncle Toms again? Wtf dude. Stop being stupid and ignorant. That sounds ignorant imo. And manipulative. And kinda disrespectful.

Also: At this point I think I need to point something out for the purposes of reality - you might be purposefully saying these things in a troll form because you want me to respond like this. You might be faking a position to provoke a response that is potentially more powerful than the way in which you would otherwise speak.

If that is what you are doing: please stop. Your actual voice is probably more powerful and insightful. And if that is not what you are doing? Then I am just going to say you are wrong until you actually use an argument to disagree with me properly.
