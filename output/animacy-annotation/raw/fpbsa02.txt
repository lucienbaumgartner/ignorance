Anti-vaxxers like this stupid woman fall into a category of people so arrogant and ignorant that they ignore the reality set before them and consider themselves 100 percent correct with no logical explanation. It's honestly the most irritating thing about these people. Do you know how they go on to list ingredients in vaccines like minerals? That's because they are far too stubborn to understand that the dose determines the poison (for example, overdose in medication) and that most of these ingredients are found in food. You could Google the nutrients of a banana and find copper on the list. That's the hypocrisy of all of them; they think they are righteous for having beliefs that contradict reality, despite being completely arrogant, ignorant, and stubborn and thereby endangering lives around them.  


However, I assume most of you knew this already. Sorry for the rant.
