Well, I just went through CA again so I have to say Felix 🤷🏽‍♀️ That guy is the youngest so he doesn’t yet know how to curb his enthusiasm. He also can’t accept MCs answer of NO the several times he asks each day at CA which is really ignorant and inappropriate, as I, and I’m sure many others are BIG on that consent, like NO MEANS NO, it doesn’t mean come back in an hour and ask again 😑. He is also trying to be Kassam instead of being himself, like you’re not a DJ bro, you’re a club promoter. Have some respect for yourself and dignity, AND have some respect for MC, you already revealed your profession, I noticed when you changed it because of Kassam.
