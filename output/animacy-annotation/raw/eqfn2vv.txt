thats a problem though. why should we give a fuck if you dont? theres alot more straight people and we simply dont have to give a fuck what you people say do or act but we chose to to be decent human beings, do you not see how bloody entitled that is or how ignorant that in itself is? why should we give a fuck when u people are the minority when you dont give a fuck about your imagine? do you not see how backward, hypocritical and ignorant that is? this this shit right fucking here is pure ignorance at its finest. you people need to take a good hard look at yourselves and ask are people homophobic or am i just a horrible person to be around. you cant blame your shitty personality on homophobia your whole life. so im going to walk out of this conversation w the thought, we should respect gay people but gay people dont give a fuck about us. alright cupcake. you are a cancer to your cause.
