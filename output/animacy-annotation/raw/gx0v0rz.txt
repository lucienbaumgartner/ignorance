Came here to say this. I hate followed her forever bc she just seemed sooo dumb and unaware of her privilege, unfollowed her, but followed again a few months ago bc people here mentioning her tone shift and I can’t believe how much I genuinely like her now! She seems to have really grown into herself and is so much more comfortable and open and it’s so refreshing. She also seems like a truly great mom which is nice to see. All around proud of her growth tbh
