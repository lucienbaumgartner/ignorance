I remember all the doomsayers on whineseer that were CERTAIN GW was dying. Every year, GW was dying, every stock increase, GW was dying. Some people were so bitter and ignorant that they legit believed GW was manipulating their stock prices, somehow, to make them go up while the company was actively dying lol.

Coincidentally these are the same people who believe GW intentionally shorts their own model stock, producing fewer kits because somehow being unable to meet demand for new models somehow earns them money.
