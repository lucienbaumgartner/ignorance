Islam is the dominant religion, there is a Christmas minority, judaism is non-existant here though, as the arab jews mainly lived in Palestine before the conflict. 

our culture suffers from nepotism and occasional tensions between Arabs of different origins who are mainly ignorant and uneducated. but there is never any discrimination against Christians, in fact, it's considered a shameful act to hate on Christians or Muslims. I remember in 2007 when Christmas coincided with Islamic eid al adha, and it was beautiful as shops decorated for both holidays at the same time.

We have the city of Aqaba as our water inlet, which boarders Israeli eilat, but the coastline is narrow for both cities as it is mainly taken by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It's an interestingly mountainous desert location were Asia and Africa meet tectonically. 

Jordan is one of the most diverse countries when it comes to climate, if you are interested, you can Google "biomes of Jordan".
