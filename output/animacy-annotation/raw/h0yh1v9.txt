As someone who also has this condition, to be diagnosed as a teenager was incredibly stressful and scary- I cannot even imagine how scary it must feel for your daughter to be so young and unaware of why her body is suffering. You let her deal with the physical and mental stress ALONE. 100% YTA. This is also a chronic condition, so she will be dealing with this for the rest of her life- grow the fuck up and be there for her
