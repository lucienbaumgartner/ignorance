But you were going out alone in the desert with a stranger... Did it not even cross your mind ahead of time what you would do if things went south? What would you even have done if he were serious? Are people really this dense and unaware of what's going on around them?

I'm not saying dont go stargazing with new people, but *maybe* run through a couple "what ifs."

I'm done ranting, now, sorry. But everyone thinks it wont happen to them until it does. Take a second to assess.
