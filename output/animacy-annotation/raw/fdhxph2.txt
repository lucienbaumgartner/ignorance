I find it rich that people who aren't hispanic feel like they can make hot takes like his Spanish is broken so he must be faking or forcing. I grew up in a household where both my parents still speak solely in Spanish to me and my spanish still sucks. I definitely agree that it feels VERY icky and ignorant that sub members are discrediting his heritage just because they want to nitpick Peter as the bachelor.
