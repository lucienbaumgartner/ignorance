Your statements are so baseless and ignorant that there is no point in attempting to address them. Nobody can argue with the irrational fears of an anxiety disorder, there will always be another reason why the boogieman boogies. 

I don't think that this is a conversation that will go anywhere in this space. You are too focused on your derangements.

I wish you the best of luck with all that you do. I'll do my best to ignore you, but feel free to reach out if you ever get tired of being as miserable as you clearly are.
