This is so out to lunch. Displaying a symbol is a form of personal expression. People, for the most part, do not display a symbol for it's effect on other people. They display it to express something about themselves. 

It is a symbol with heavy racist connotations. I don't think anyone is disputing that. But to make the jump to "everyone that displays it supports the Confederacy" is truly illogical. It's also become a symbol of redneck "pride". There are plenty of people I went to high school with who associated it with country music, rednecks, fishing, drinking beer, etc. Those people are stupid and ignorant. That doesn't necessitate they are racist.
