&gt;Believing that men are so emotionally unaware and stupid that they donâ€™t know what they think and feel before having sex, is really not a nice thing to think about someone.

Yet society paints us all as cold, uncaring monsters that are only interested in women for sex and will rape/murder/assault them at the drop of a hat.
