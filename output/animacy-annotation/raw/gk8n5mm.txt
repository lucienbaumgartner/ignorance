Including the article I posted earlier in the thread - which you also didn't read - I've posted _four_ things that prove you wrong. You've posted _no evidence_ to support your lies..

And yes, I posted the conclusion of the article you didn't comprehend, because it _contradicts you_, simpleton.

Look, I don't know how much time &amp; effort you spend on these little forays into dementia, but I assure it's less than I do. Every single time you post, it takes me _literally_ less than five minutes to prove you're still lying and wrong and ignorant of logic and the english language, _every single time_. 

Whatever you're paying the people who bathe &amp; feed &amp; read reddit out loud to you, it ain't nearly enough. I pity them.
