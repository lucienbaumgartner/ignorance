You said people had little reason to dislike him except for racism. I'm pointing out how untrue and ignorant that statement is. No. I don't think my white friends who support Trump are racist. Just like I don't think my black buddy I know from highschool who *constantly* shares pro-Trump, pro-Christian, and pro-Confederate flag shit on Facebook is racist. 

I think they believe misinformation and are way too deep into political conspiracies but are decent people. If they saw someone broke down on the side of the road, they would help them out, they wouldn't care about the persons race or political ideology. 

I think you've become the extremist you accuse Trump supporters from being, except on the other side. You pat yourself on the back and think you're on the good side, same as they do. 

What sucks is that you fuckers represent a minority of the electorate, but are the most vocal. Thankfully the majority of people in real life aren't as radicalized as you yet.
