Your comment makes no sense. If he was truly blocked for referrals, this is Ledn's fault as they set the referral terms and conditions (and later changed them without any notice whatsoever).

40 referrals is a lot for a typical person, but it's peanuts compared to social media influencers who get that much and more in a day.

Unless something was fraudulent (fake accounts, fake IDs), companies want referrals because it brings in customers.

Ledn has a good reputation so I'm curious how this unfolds, but your response is uninformed and ignorant of how businesses grow.
