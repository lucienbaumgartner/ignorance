BM is heavily nerfed down/handicapped into oblivion. In WCI her tantrum made her skinny, physically vulnerable emotionally unstable and unaware. And now that she stepped a foot in Wano she has lost her combat experience, does not remember who she is or what her goals were, does probably also not remember who Zeus/Promethes are etc 

It all just reeks of plot convenience
