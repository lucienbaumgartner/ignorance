I'm still reading that fanfic and I haven't finished it yet. My comment above is about the first chapter in which Ned seems blind and ignorant of Catelyn's  behavior towards Jon to a point where Benjen have to remind him. That makes no sense with regards to Ned's character. I don't buy that Ned who treated Theon, basically a hostage, as his own ward would let Cat abuse or insult him. That's entirely OOC for him in my opinion. Even in Canon Catelyn was just indifferent towards Jon. 

But this is Fanon right? Yes. I don't disagree with that but if you're make a character distinct from canon, you should provide or give your precedence and reasons for it
