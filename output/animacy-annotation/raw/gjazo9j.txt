&gt;What? What is this? Theres science: there is, and is not. 

Sorry.  Basically just that our understanding of a subject can be wrong initially but over time it should improve.  Like how in January 2020 the knews was that covid wasn't airborne.

I think we actually agree on whether the mask provides protection for the wearer. But I don't think my mask needs to protect me to be effective.  Its whether wearing a mask prevents someone who is contagious and unaware of it to spread it to others.  

Your bottom link brought up the math in part 2 that if 60% of people wore a mask that prevented 60% of the covid carrying saliva from reaching other people then each carrier on average would infect roughly the same or slightly less people over time. At the start this was to "flatten the curve" to prevent hospitals from being overloaded.  But if you increase either % you would increase the effect.

Its similar to vaccines or herd immunity as they also prevent a person from infecting more people through having less people to interact with that could still be infected.  While masks should instead lower how many people a person would infect on average

And if the cloth masks do prevent covid from reaching other people than its better to have everyone wear them as the math would state it would increase the % of people who are contagious, unaware of it, and are also lowering how many people they infect by wearing masks

However do make sure to change and wash your masks.

Also don't wear masks with valves, or ones that are too big or small, or a bandana as they don't do anything, and can cause people to leave the house enter locations thinking they are protecting others while they aren't.
