Just for those interested and unaware of what this is. This is a Doppler ultrasound, it allows for visualisation of bloodstreams if they move away or towards the ultrasound device. My guess, but OP or someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, is that the lightsaber is the bloodstream in the umbilical chord.
