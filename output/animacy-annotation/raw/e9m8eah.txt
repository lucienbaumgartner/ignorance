Wow... you are so dumb and ignorant I don’t even know where to begin.  

Thought crime legislation is as old as time. Countless human beings throughout history have been killed or imprisoned for believing the wrong thing. It’s even happening today in places like the UK and Canada where saying the wrong thing is getting people in trouble with the law. Have you ever heard of Galileo? The inquisition? The world wars? The holocaust? You seriously have never heard of “**thought crimes**”??

Is this guy serious?? I think it’s obvious we are getting trolled. Nobody is **that** dumb. You are either engaging in some serious dishonesty here for the lols or you are so severely misinformed and ignorant that a fruitful discussion on the subject is not really within your reach.
