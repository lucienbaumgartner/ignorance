Stupidity and ignorance is not an excuse to break the law. If someone is “grossly misinformed” about other stupid beliefs that endanger their children, they go to prison. See: the dumbasses who withheld medical treatment in Alberta recently.

Vaccinations are vital medical treatments. Refusal of vaccinations for non-medical reasons is willful child endangerment.

I don’t care if someone is too stupid and ignorant to realize this. If they are that stupid and ignorant, that is just another reason they probably shouldn’t have kids.
