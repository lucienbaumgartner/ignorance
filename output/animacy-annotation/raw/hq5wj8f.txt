Sorry you’re getting downvoted. This is the most anti btc sub on the web after r/buttcoin. Probably the most ignorant and stubborn crowd you’ll find, mostly jealous and angry bc Bogle told them not to buy in early. I’m a boglehead in terms of contributions but btc has continually destroyed VTI over the time I’ve invested, if zoomed out…..downvote parade incoming!
