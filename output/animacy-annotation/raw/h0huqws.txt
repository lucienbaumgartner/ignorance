What you're noticing is that religion is nonsense. When we run into cases where God would be a dick, theists jump to make up excuses or pretend like their god made some non-existent dictate saying those who aren't capable of understanding him get a free pass.

But think about what christianity is asking. There is absolutely zero evidence for the existence of God. And eternal damnation awaits you if you don't believe in something no rational person should believe in. The key that unlocks heaven is being naive and ignorant of reality. 
But those incapable of understanding are ok and those who try to use logic and reason get kicked to the curb? 

It sounds more to me like humans feel bad that their book would damn you to hell too so they make stuff up to pretend like their demonstrably cruel scripture isn't so bad.
