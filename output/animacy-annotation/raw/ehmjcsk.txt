Very ignorant comment. How stupid do you have to be to think any country is going to send a drone strike to every single house in America? How would that even be possible? Your level of thinking is so shallow and ignorant that Im sure you would find a way to drown yourself in it.

If a drone strike SOMEHOW kills you, your battle is over and you have nothing left to worry about. Those that didn't get leveled will have to protect their family and themselves. That means bad guys clearing houses, on foot. You dont think a soldier would be more hesitant to enter a house where he knows damn well he will be met with incoming fire?

I know what your donkey brains are going to say, "well then theyd just shoot it with a tank or throw a grenade, durrrr". Again, if thats the case theres nothing left to worry about. Real life isnt call of duty, ammunition is limited. Imagine if EVERY SINGLE HOUSE had to blown up because the people inside said fuck you. Do you understand the logistics of something like that?
