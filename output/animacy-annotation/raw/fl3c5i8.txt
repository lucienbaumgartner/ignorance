I think just as much as the individualism thing, if not more so, is the growing anti-science trend. Flat earthers, young earthers, anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers...all are in the same general stupidity bucket of just simply refusing to take scientific facts and experts seriously. And while those are the most obvious offenders of this bizarre “experts say this, but *I* know better” mindset, a shocking portion of the population exhibits the same kind of thinking in more subtle ways.

For example, we routinely mock the aforementioned groups of people in my friend group for their silly anti-science perspectives. And yet the very next day, we might be talking about flu vaccines and they’ll say something along the lines of “well those don’t work” and “the one year I got the flu was the one year I got the vaccine,” completely straight-faced and unaware that they’re now committing the exact same error they just criticized in others. And now as we start to shut things down here in the US, those same friends are also acting annoyed and like they think it’s an overreaction. 

That, to me, is the really scary thing in all of this: seeing it reveal the true scope of the anti-science mental infection in our society and knowing that that is going to have disastrous consequences.
