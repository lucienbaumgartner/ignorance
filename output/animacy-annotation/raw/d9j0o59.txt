Agreed. They are unaware and compliant. Bill Weld just endorsed Hillary and mentioned that he's been close, personal friends with Hillary for 40 years while he's on the Libertarian ticket! That's crazy. It wasn't Trump who was the Clinton plant, it was Johnson. Libertarians hate that he was nominated because he's not a Libertarian.
