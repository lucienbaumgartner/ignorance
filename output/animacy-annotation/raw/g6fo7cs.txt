Not necessarily. It can sometimes be bedding, mom, dad, really the main factor is being in a space surrounded by sleeping people who are incoherent/spatially unaware and especially tired. I even saw a case once of a parent holding a baby in a recliner, falling asleep, and the baby becoming wedged. It doesn't even have to be in bed. If you are tired, put your baby in a safe place to sleep, even if it means a crying baby. I'd take a crying baby over one that isn't alive any day. (Again I know this is an "easy for you to say" situation... In the moment when you are that frazzled and brain fried, I get it, it happens.
