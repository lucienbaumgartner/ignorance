I'd say that's some pretty unaware and inattentive racing from both parties. The track narrows considerably though this section, and nobody was paying much mind to keeping space from the other.

That said, when the person behind is trying to insert their nose next to another car, the majority of the responsibility is on then to make sure they do it safely. You had room to the right, there was no need to be that tight
