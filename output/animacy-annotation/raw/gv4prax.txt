NTA. They would react the same if he bought home a girl from Quebec and was learning French. They are small minded and unaware of their own ignorance. I am a French Canadian raised outside of quebec and I often receive this kind of response for using a French word in conversation with people like this who act proud of being unilingual. They are insecure and angry at their lack of understanding and so they attack you to compensate and make themselves feel superior again. 

I hope your husband appreciates your knowledge and culture, it sounds like he does. It does feel to me like a betrayal that he didn't stand up to his family to tell them how disrespectful and intolerant they were being and that neither of you would sit there and accept such undeserved maltreatment. That it's atrocious to choose to react so violently to a word you don't understand.

You deserve an apology and they should commit to broadening their understanding in the goal to be more accepting in your next meeting as part of reconciling with you if they want to have a relationship with you. I mean, if you even think you could forgive them?
