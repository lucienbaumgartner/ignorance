Ok, you got me there. I was definitely too broad in my statement. However, I stand by the fact that you, as (presumably) a white man, commenting on black people’s use of the n-word is incredibly immature and ignorant. That word has the connotations that it does because of the hateful and unforgivable actions of white people. For you to tell black people that they shouldn’t reappropriate it is just fucking disgusting. There are times when your opinion just doesn’t count for shit. This is one of them. Keep it to your yourself.
