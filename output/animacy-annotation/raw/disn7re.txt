Nope.  Nothing to see here.  Just stay unaware and ignorant of life outside your large cities.  Everyone here lives in a sod hut, we don't have cars, no running water and only candle light at night. That's life in Fargo.  Living out west...well no one lives there except oil workers and indians who still live in teepees and hunt buffalo.
