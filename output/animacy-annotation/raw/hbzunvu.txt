Did you just completely ignore the quote from the article and basically everything i said? Because it sure seems like it

&gt;But to say that all unwanted pregnancies are 100% on the man's shoulders feels fucking slimy and ignorant of the human reality to me.

&gt;The article isn't arguing this.

Thats literally what the article is arguing. Did you even read it? The author reiterates this point nearly every other paragraph.
