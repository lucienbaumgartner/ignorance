I don't play with a controller and certainly this is easier with a mouse, but you need to be able to ~180 quickly and accurately.  This is how I do it on PC, shot from behind I stim/180 and return fire, maybe jump.  In any case you are at the mercy of your opponents' skill level, if he has you unaware and dead to rights with headshot there's not much you can do.  Even when you think you are alone though in this game, you should avoid unnecessarily moving in a predictable manner.
