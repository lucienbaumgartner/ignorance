Writing, as in all creative endeavors, is a process of revealing the self. The axiom should not be "Write what you know" but "Write what reveals the most about yourself to yourself." 

Art is a way to explore the dark, dirty, shadow sides of ourselves, so that we can make decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Cancel culture is a way to keep us alone, afraid, and ignorant of the humanity within all of us by making us afraid of taking the risks that bring us self knowledge.

Life is dark, ugly, brutal, unequal, unfair, risky, random chaos. It is also beauty, courage, compassion, love, connection discovery, and so many other things, both fearsome and wondrous. Stories should be able to reflect all of these things, not just a small sliver of what is deemed acceptable in this moment in time.

Shedding light on the shadow doesn't mean we are celebrating and perpetuating it, it means we are taking ownership of it and stealing its power.
