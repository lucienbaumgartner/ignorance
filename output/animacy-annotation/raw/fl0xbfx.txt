**TD/DR**:

The best way to avoid divorce is, before getting married (and preferably before getting into any relationship at all), being *very* familiar with yourself and how/whether you're best suited to give to the other person with whom you're in relationship.

**Full Response:**

I was 21 at the time of my first marriage, and my emotional capacity probably equated somewhere around your description of yourself (fairly naive, feeling 'mostly okay' about getting married, etc.). In hindsight, the better question is, "How do I know whether I'm ready for a romantic relationship?" (forget marriage for a second...let's just focus on any relationship that's growing romantically at all)

Relationships should be two people becoming committed to giving to one another. The problem is that most people have a mindset focused on the benefits the relationship will bring them. That is, they're focused on themselves and, basically, taking from the other person. Note that 'taking' is different than 'receiving' -- 'taking' being based on (unreasonable) expectations of the other person, and 'receiving' based on grace and appreciation for the other person.

A relationship with two people committed to giving to, rather than taking from, each other is somewhat rare. Spotting this distinction is fairly straightforward *if* one knows the things to notice during the acquaintanceship, friendship, and/or long-term relationship stages. Most of us learn the hard way, whereas you're doing the prudent thing and seeking advice before you've wasted a bunch of time on a relationship doomed to fail.

In order to give to another person, you must know yourself, be comfortable with yourself, have lived on your own two feet completely independently by yourself, know your likes and dislikes, know your strengths and weaknesses, etc.

If you're unaware and unsure of your own self, then you will have a difficult time giving to another person to your best capacity. The whole "opposites attract" is complete B.S. For example, if someone knows he/she thrives emotionally in large friends groups, then it would be hard to give yourself to someone who prefers small groups, because you would constantly have a pull to be in different environments.

There are many good books I could recommend, if you'd like.

In this culture, at age 22, a person is unlikely to be familiar with himself/herself. Ironically, this especially holds true if the person is coming straight from college, since university life is *definitely* *not* real life. I tell my kids that, as a general rule they should be (1) on their own for about two to three years before they even consider marriage, much less actually be going through with marriage, and (2) have dated a person for about two years before they start considering marriage, because after the first year has passed you can probably start to see the "real" side of someone since the person has become comfortable with you, you've seen a whole cycle of indoor/outdoor seasons, holidays, etc. pass.

Regarding your question of emotional protection equating to a lack of commitment, I would they are not equivalent. If anything, you're doing the wise and right thing by assessing your own emotions, so that you *can* ensure you'll be committed to your marriage.
