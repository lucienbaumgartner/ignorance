What you're asking is basically "why doesn't everyone speak standard english at all times?" But you don't learn your native language/dialect in school. You learn it from your parents an other people close to you. And people tend to want to speak their native toung if they can. That's not "improper", it's just how they speak. 

The problem with your question is that you clearly make the age old mistake to assume that any non-standard way of speaking is just being lazy, or people are corrupting the language, are just doing it wrong because they didn't pay attention in school etc. The reason that's wrong is because that's just not how that works. It's not the case that there is a correct standard language, and any other speech is just an incorrect version of that. Different versions of the language are called dialects, and they're just as much of a language with it's own vocabulary, grammar etc as the standard language. They're just not the dialect you learn in school.

You probably wouldn't ask why scottish people are so lazy and ignorant that they choose to speak poorly. If it's different enough and people aren't aware of any socio-linguistic context, it's easy enough for most people to accept that "dialects" are a thing that exists and there's nothing wrong with that. When these "why they don't speak proper"-questions come up, it's *always* about the speech of lower class people. And that's why you're getting the strong responses you're getting. You're asking why some group of people is so "ignorant and lazy" that they can't talk good, while being completely ignorant about the simple linguistic reality of the situation.
