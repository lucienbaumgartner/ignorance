&gt; but I'm not one for banning words

no one said anything about banning words, so i have no clue wtf you're talking about 

&gt; He's still a progressive

which is why he should be aware of how homophobic it is to be sluring gay politicians with nonsense about ass. and is also why he should be aware that the main anti gay slur is a homophobic slur, and why he should be aware that straight guys can't "reclaim" homophobic slurs.

i mean he's literally so stupid and ignorant that he thinks **STRAIGHT GUYS** can "reclaim" homophobic slurs. that is unbelievable. i wonder if he also thinks whites can "reclaim" anti black racist slurs(he doesn't and never would think such a thing, but when it comes to gay slurs he thinks straight men have any right or ability to somehow "reclaim" slurs that aren't targeted at them)
