"Drugs ruin your life, so we'll throw you in jail to keep you from ruining your life." I guess you can replace "throw you in jail" with "kick you out of the house," in OP's case. It's astounding how some people are so closed-minded and ignorant, that they'd kick their own underage son out of the house for smoking a little weed to chill out.
