ADHD is a possibility but honestly you may be going through something deeper, even depressed and unaware of it.

I myself have trouble with concentrating and feel the same as you do. Through therapy I unraveled that I’m so afraid of incompetence and being fired that I overburden myself with work which eventually makes it impossible for me to properly manage my tasks. Eventually I also settle mentally that I will get fired no matter what and unconsciously try to self sabotage my performance.

I have another friend that went through the same thing as you did: he’s very intelligent and quite competent, but he was fired in lass than 2 months from 2 jobs because he spent all day at his phone. He also was able to deal with this through therapy and now is working fine, although he slips up from time to time.

I understand that therapy may be hard and costly in the states but I seriously recommend you to invest in it and try to develop new habits that may help with this self-sabotaging.
