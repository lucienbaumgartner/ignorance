Sadly, my experience is that, today, a whole lot of students cheat. This is especially true for online courses. Cheating is also a fact of life at other institutions. I have taught at the university level for more than 35 years and never before seen cheating at the level that it is today. Perhaps in some cultures cheating at school is the only way to get ahead or cheating is an acceptable social behaviour. Certainly, I see cheating all around me in relationships here, and that's how capitalists seem to work, but I hadn't expected to see it grow into such a problem at universities. I love that a lot of the current group of students seem to feel that being called on it is somehow wrong, or that even having it pointed our is somehow wrong. 

Poor babies! Over population by a factor of 30 times, global warming, pollution, populism, authoritarianism, racism, sexism and young people who are so selfish and ignorant that they think that cheating is a viable way of getting ahead and that being called on it is somehow wrong. Duh!
