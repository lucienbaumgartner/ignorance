I'm First Nations from Canada. One of my friends who is Asian, (Can't remember i asked a few times but she never gave me a solid answer as to where her family is from they speak a few different languages) Well one of her relatives in Canada had a kid with a First Nations person, the person passed away so their kid didn't have the chance to get to know their Indigenous side. Anyway, my friend says to me "My cousin said that sometimes he can feel the Indian in him come out when he drinks" all because his dad was Native but he never got the chance to get to know his father. I hate this stereotype. I don't even drink, I haven't touched liquor since my sister's birthday in August and before that I hadn't touched it in a year. Never had a problem with alcohol I always only drank on special occassions, I know many other Natives around here who are sober too. Stop assuming your alcoholism came from your Native Relative it's insane and ignorant that people actually think this way.
