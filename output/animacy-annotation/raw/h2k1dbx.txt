NTA

You’re looking out for your son and she refused to address the issue even though you have raise your concerns to her which she brushed off as nothing. She gets no right to criticize and guilt trip you when she’s being selfish and ignorant of the effect it has on your son. She’s being a shitty aunt. 

She can either start correcting her son to be fair especially at the early age or find other playmates who are willing to be bullied.
