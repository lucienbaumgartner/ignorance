Sometimes parents are just wrong. 

I was just out of high school in the early 80s when the AIDS epidemic was rippling through the US. My first out gay friend made me casually aware of how many people he knew that were dying of AIDS, and he would sign up for these care groups: gay guys providing round-the-clock care for men who had no family because being gay was so stigmatized their families wanted nothing to do with them even though they were dying. (It’s a part of my shame, that I was so young and unaware that I didn’t realize I should have been volunteering to support their loving actions myself.) 

There’s something about this recent willingness of parents to blindly turn against their children for a twisted belief that reminds me of those times. Go forth and give love and receive it from other loving people, and perhaps your parents will rise back up to where you are.
