Beheading people is not a cultural norm and you associating it with Islam is purely intolerant and ignorant of you to do so.

And I would absolutely refute the idea that 'no country has any responsibility to adopt to the cultural norms of any immigrant'. As a colonial state which in this case France most certainly is, it has many irrefutable obligations to reconcile with its colonial past and ever-lasting effects it has had on (their mostly colonized population and the life they are escaping and then forcibly seek the status of an immigrant) and so yes, they do have the responsibility to adopt, accept and cater to the cultural norms of immigrants.
