Actually it is. Because you have decided that his interaction with these women (who btw are as big a percent the population as the one he befriended) is so jarring and impactful that it negates all that he did in his life. You’ve placed a moral value on this event that is greater than or equal to the good he did. You aren’t an arbiter of who is recognized and who isn’t. MLK was a womanizer. Tell me should we remove statues of him? Hmm? Should we not study and understand his philosophies just because he cheated on his wife? Or how about the ancient philosophers, without whom democracy and the ideals that allow you know and love would be a nonexistent. Just stop. Every single great person in history has their demons. But hey look at you furthering the feminist cause of being full of shit and totally not reinforcing the stereotype that women are emotional illogical and ignorant of history. Well done. If you want to invalidate a the life of a man who risked his life to save strangers you can do it alone. The man’s a hero, you’re a troll.
