&gt;That is a baseless argument?

Really? She attacks a retired jedi master from behind, she trusts the story of a dark lord instead of the one told to her by Jake skywalker, she consistently does not take responsibility for her actions, in fact blaming Luke for much of the problems she is facing in the galaxy. I see nothing noble or jedi like in her actions. She operates entirely for her own purposes, Rey has no bigger goal other than to acquire more power (apparently) and to rule instead of Kylo. 

What have you seen from Rey that convinces you otherwise? Every force user has acknowledged that she is both strong and ignorant, that is usually a descriptor for the dark sides users since they don't know any better. 

Luke/Anakin were never *awash* in the force like Rey was at the end of TFA, UNLESS it was the dark side.
