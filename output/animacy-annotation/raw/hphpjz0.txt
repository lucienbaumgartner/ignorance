Ye. I get annoyed when people are loud and say dumb things, and are ignorant of how dumb they sound and are very sure of themselves, especially when others start accept the ideas they’re saying without questioning them. I guess what annoys me is someone who doesn’t put effort and just succeeds and causes chaos just bcs they’re ignorant and confident. Maybe i’m a little jealous on them too.
