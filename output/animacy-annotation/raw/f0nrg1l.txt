I just hated dresses and all that business. I was very loud, joking and active as a kid, coupled with being socially unaware, and other kids treated me like I'm fucking weird. And I internalised that shame. I always knew that boys get praise for the same behavior so you can say I *wished* I was a boy almost my whole life, but it became a conscious desire only at 15 maybe. I tried to distance myself from girls and femininity. A typical trans story
