It’s unfortunate all this is going on. My impression is that most people understand AA and support him, but are concerned that a lot of shareholders who don’t participate in DD on social media will see the word “dilution” that the media will surely spread as FUD. Those uninformed people will freak. I really hope that doesn’t happen. I’m just trying to consider all the possibilities right now. I was so amped after seeing the interview. One thing that concerns me about the theory above is that even the GME zealot apes won’t consider AMC as legitimate AT ALL. They are ultra threatened and ignorant of AMC. I’ve tried to reason with them a couple times and it’s always the same with them. It makes me wonder if fellow apes in GME aren’t going to respect the facts and DD on our side, how will the general public deal with it? The GME only apes should know better, but they hate AMC. I just hope it all works out
