This is why I love medical and crime dramas for crochet!! They literally describe everything that is happening. “He’s making a run for it!!” or “She’s crashing!” and I know everything that’s happening. Do not recommend mysteries, however. A lot of it is ominous music with a lot of visual cues, which tends to leave me anxious and unaware of what’s going on.
