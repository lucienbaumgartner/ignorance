Investigated, and found to be no insider trading, nobody did shit about it because nothing was done improperly. You should definitely reread the entire article.  

I'm glad you don't have any power, since you prefer to draw conclusions from what you think and how you feel instead of facts and actual knowledge. Your comments come off as being uninformed and ignorant of how trading and trading groups work. So I think it's better to leave it here, since we'll just keep going round and round. Have a great day
