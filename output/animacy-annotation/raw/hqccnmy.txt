If I made a "I'm a Mormon" Facebook page at the behest of the church under the leadership of a prophet, during the meet the Mormons campaign that the church spent millions of dollars on, and was raised with the idea taught by president Hinkley that "Mormon means more good", and passed out pass-along cards that said meet the Mormons, while passing billboards that said meet the Mormons paid for and put up by the church, and was taught to introduce myself as a Mormon missionary (Los Mormones) on my mission by supposedly inspired mission leaders, do I then get to call myself Mormon without having someone self righteously act like it's always been a bad thing to say Mormon\mormonism? How many quotes extolling the virtuesof 'mormonism" (and yes they used the term unapologetically and endearingly) from Joseph Smith and other leaders of the church all the way up until president Nelson would I have to pull out to refute the idea that it is rude to call someone a Mormon?

The term Mormon is sticking around. I'd suggest you quit correcting people, unless you like looking pretentious and ignorant of our own history. It's not a good look. And it's a name I embraced for myself proudly for decades, asking with my family and everyone I knew growing up. And then to have people turn around and act like it's a bad thing and always had been feels very 1984 to me, with an huge extra dose of ridiculousness.

Anyway, spend these two cents of mine as you wish.
