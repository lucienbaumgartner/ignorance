I get what you're saying but viruses are just not spread by people with no symptoms.. that's really not how it works and it never has

It's only this last year that people have just thrown common sense out of the window, before they told you to be scared, NOBODY was worried about getting a flu or other type of coronavirus from somebody with no symptoms.. 

If you saw someone sneezing and coughing a lot you might keep your distance but nothing like the brain dead lunacy we've seen in 2020..

And regarding lockdowns, they don't work. They clearly don't work, otherwise the first one would have wiped the thing out. And if they don't work, why keep doing them? 

And EVEN IF a lockdown had any effect on this or any other virus, it's STILL absolutely unacceptable in a free and open society. 

I saw a headline the other day that said 'You might be allowed to hug your loved ones in a few days'. 

Now I rarely check the news these days and have been essentially doing what I normally do this entire year, no masks, distancing, and I certainly haven't been avoiding human contact.. 

But seeing that headline made me think hold on, there are actually people out there so brainwashed and unaware of reality that they've STOPPED hugging their loved ones because the TV said to? 

Is that really all it takes now, for them to just say something and people instantly believe it's true without looking at the science, data, reality or just using common sense?
