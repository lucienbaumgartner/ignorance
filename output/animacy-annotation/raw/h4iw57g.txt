Yeah but not scrimming against potential matchups also has a lot of disadvantages. Is it really that worth it going in on a series completely blind and unaware of your opponents strats just to hide a pepega draft that may or may not even work in a competitive setting? 

And its not like Nigma actually put on a strat that noone else knew. I mean Tide TA vs a team that has beat that strat multiple times? I mean what year is it Kuro, 2019?
