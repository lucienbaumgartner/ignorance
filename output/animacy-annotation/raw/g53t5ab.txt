Those are all valid links and you are welcome to believe them. I have no problem with people making up their own minds.

But just understand that this is the class of people you are putting your faith in (and **never** in my many years as an educator did I ever utter much less think, never mind write something like this):

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* **conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry**. *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "*

So that is what you think of the voters? And John Podesta is no lowly stooge, but would have very likely been *Chief of Staff to the President*, had Clinton won in 2016. And at one time I believed the Democrats were on the "side of truth" and science.

And I find it interesting that Podesta takes an (unsavory) interest in climate (and keep in mind Pielke is a colleague of mine):

**WikiLeaks Exposes Podesta-Steyer Climate McCarthyism**

And you can publish as many counter links as you want, but this makes no sense either:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

You can see Eric Weinstein (a former Lefty) pick up on that "sleight of hand" and try to educate his younger listeners by explaining to them that "Super Delegates have nothing to do with Diversity and Inclusiveness", listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast (or start at 2:58).

**Andrew Marantz - Surfing the Wake of The Woke - Eric Weinstein**

So, all I suggest is that people do their homework, down to the primary sources and the actual data. And when that happens, I won't be surprised when they end up here:

**Michael Moore Presents: Planet of the Humans**

[https://youtu.be/Zk11vI-7czE](https://youtu.be/Zk11vI-7czE)

Nor will I be surprised by another raft of links appearing from the same sources (skeptical science and carbonbrief) denouncing Michael Moore.

So, let the ***chips fall where they may,*** as the saying goes...
