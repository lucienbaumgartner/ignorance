I think the things he's most oblivious about-

Almost every state pays tuition for those in foster care for a minimum of 2 years, maximum of 4 years. A few states even pay for room and board, like CT &amp; MA. 


I have a MS Psych and my husband is a pretty successful mechanical engineer. We didn't make 6 figure incomes until our mid thirties. We paid for each other to go to college, until we both obtained advanced degrees. We bought an overpriced house in 05, with shit credit and high rates. We didn't own our first new car until our 30s. OP is completely unaware and unappreciative of any advantages they have had. Foster care isn't great, but life is a mixed bag of positive and negative experiences. When you only acknowledge some without the other, you are also giving away some of your humanity. Also, if life were ever truly easy for anyone, there would be no struggle. Without struggle, there is no innovation. Without a desperate need for the sun, the plant withers &amp; dies. Struggle is a necessary part of humanity, it's how we grow, evolve and expand as a species. 


But I actually kind of think OP is blowing smoke, at any rate.
