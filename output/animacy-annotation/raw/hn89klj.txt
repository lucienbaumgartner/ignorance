We do that all the time with other animals.  What makes people special?  The reflexive and logic-free argument is that people are important because we're people, and animals aren't important because they're not.  Most people take a logical route, though.  The animals are unaware and incapable of understanding their plight.  So are fetuses.

Are you also a vegan?  I doubt it.
