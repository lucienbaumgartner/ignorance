Have video games as a whole improved? Sure. That does not mean that there’s no place for games from the 80s on a list of the best games of all time. If /r/games had its way this list would be comprised entirely of games made in the last ten years and it would suck. The idea that more recent games are inherently better is ignorant and dismissive. Again, if “old” games were inherently worse, the style of those games wouldn’t be as popular as it is for modern games. This is an insurmountably stupid take.
