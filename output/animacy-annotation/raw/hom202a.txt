This whole process is so new to me. I used to joke with folks in my small town, telling them that the piercer took a hole-punch and just popped my ear hole out. I know it’s not quite the case obviously, but the idea of these larger sized fresh punches being a thing is mind blowing. Is it safe/reasonable to do? Is it just for the impatient? I’m not judging here, I’m just genuinely concerned and ignorant of the practice.
