You've just inspired me to wear a hoody and shorts more often. I much prefer not to encounter people who are so shallow and ignorant that they believe if someone dresses comfortably they must not respect you or anyone else.

You sound like someone who was raised by parents to who threw the word respect around constantly because they didn't want to actually teach you anything.
