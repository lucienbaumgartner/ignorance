A lot of different factors. 

They know the rapist and make excuses for the rapist ("He/she's a good guy/gal, it was a mistake. They'd never purposefully hurt me"), allowing that person to further victimize the victim.

One common reaction to being raped is to have a lot of meaningless consensual sex (it makes victims feel more in charge of their bodies and consent and sex life). Unfortunately, that can put you at greater risk for being raped.

Many victims are young and unaware that what's being done to them is wrong.

Rape lowers victim's self esteem. They may feel they deserve the treatment or they may just have low self esteem and settle for shitty partners. These both make them more at risk for being raped.

I feel like I'm forgetting some reasons, but I think this paints a good enough picture.
