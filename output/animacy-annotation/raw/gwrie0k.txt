I don't know about others but my parents always made me an independent person. Dad always sent me everywhere to handle everything on my own. I mean if a traffic police ever stopped me while he was sitting right next to me, even then he used to just stay on his phone and let me handle everything. I have been going to bank since I was in the 7th grade in school. I by myself got my driving licence, voter id, adhar card, pan card and even passport. Dad was just their to guide me. I used to find it difficult and ignorant of him to do so. But now I realise that what he did then helped me become stronger today. Today I am able to handle almost everything by myself without anyone making me a fool. So I thank my dad for everything I am today.
