&gt; It's I think 50% of transpeople kill themselves. And I believe this is after they "transistion". The fact that it's not seen as something not normal is very strange. 

I think the stat you are thinking of is somewhere around 50% ATTEMPT suicide.

An random citation, the numbers will vary some:

&gt;Why? Well, i'll keep my opinions to myself.

Probably good since what you've said so far is wrong.


The quick stats from that link above:  https://imgur.com/a/iguJPRW
The whole page has quality information worth reading for anyone interested in digging into a rabbit hole of good information..


Hopefully you can acknowledge that the extreme hate and vile things said about them, and people casually tossing about false information may lead to those high numbers. Not to mention condemnation from their own families, mothers and fathers, siblings, close friends. Refusal of mental health care, physical assaults on their lives. The research has been done, I Understand you dont care about the research and want to cherry pick what fits your narrative. 

You can actually see what trans people say, what the research says, and how people can actually help those people. I dont think you really care though. Maybe Im wrong.  I suspect youve simultaneously made up your mind about what the problem is, unwilling to be open minded, while ALSO claiming to be uneducated and ignorant.   That would only be SLIGHTLY problematic if you didnt then go online and look for links that fit your narrative to post.

I suppose you think I'm doing the same thing?  If you do call me out on it and we can discuss if maybe there is a difference?
