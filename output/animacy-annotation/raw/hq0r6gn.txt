You're a complete clown. Let me guess, you're another pompous liberal arts major who thinks having access to google makes you qualified to pretend you know more than someone who is actually in medical school?

And no, I haven't spread any misinformation. I will sometimes correct typos and add additional information, but not change anything I've said. Nobody has "corrected" me, and they haven't needed to. Again, check the timestamps of my edits. They're always within a few minutes. 

Leuprolide is a serious drug with dangerous side effects, many of which are permanent. I never said the delaying of puberty is permanent, because it fucking isn't. Upon cessation of the drug, puberty will progress in most cases. This drug should not be administered to gender dysphoric children. You can screech about it all you want, throw your petty insults and make up stupid lies to try and deflect, it doesn't change the facts. 

Stop replying with your bullshit. It's clear that you're uneducated, wilfully ignorant and incapable of basic reading comprehension. You're wasting my time.
