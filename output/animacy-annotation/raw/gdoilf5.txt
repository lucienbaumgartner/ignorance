This will get lost in all the comments, but I actually went to game stop like a month ago in person for the first time in maybe a decade. And I will say I have the best customer service experience of my life. 

It was a middle aged woman running the store by herself. I was trading in my ps4 to put towards my ps5 preorder through game stop. She let me know what because I bought it online and didn’t preorder at her store, she would have to call the corporate line and have them apply the amount remotely. While she is on the phone with them, she was helping several other customers too. When she finally got through to the department she needed to speak with, she step by step explained to them the whole process but the person on the phone seemed very confused and unaware of how to do the request to apply my trade in. She kept making sure that in no way was my preorder to be canceled, and that all that needed to be done was apply a gift card to the order. 

She quickly realized this person was about to cancel my preorder and told them to stop everything. She apologized to me and said she was scared they would mess it up and didn’t want me to lose out on my ps5. She said that I should come back in person when I have my ps5 and she would do it herself. 

She went above and beyond to help me when she didn’t need to. She was genuinely concerned it would mess up my preorder. And during all this time of being on hold, her and I was just casually talking. She told me how she loves video games because it gives her a chance to connect with her son. And how her and her son spend the evenings together playing. 

I left the store totally happy. Even though I didn’t get what I came in for originally, this woman’s attitude and dedication to the customers was amazing. It was the best customer service experience of my life, and Linda I hope you and your son have a continued great experience playing video games together.
