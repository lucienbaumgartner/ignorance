Haha, no I completely agree that would be the sensible thing to do. Instead we see the private contractors landing on the beach head and going in there with SCAR's and M4's. Not to mention how they react to seeing a bunch of dead bodies in the lake, completely not worried about whether they were hit with mini gun rounds or mortar shells, not trying to get head shots at range, they seem sure they're dead, they seem completely unequipped and unaware and frankly it seems illogical.
And if you noticed I asked about the guns they were carrying, literally, in my post. Why bother going in there with their assault rifles on dune buggies when they could just take them out with an Apache or Blackhawk. I was sincerely asking why in the world the contractors think their armament load out is sufficient, so you didn't answer my question.
