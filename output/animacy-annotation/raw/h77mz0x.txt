True, pure, Communist-Manifesto Communism isn’t intended to be evil, and quite frankly it isn’t evil.  It’s just stupid and ignorant of how humans work, not to mention entirely unachievable.  It’s based on the ideas of superabundance of resources (which is actually achievable using automation and such) and also the idea that everyone wants to work together and is happy having the same value of stuff as everyone else, and no one wants more and people will still work hard because *reasons*.  The only way to achieve a system like it is to have an authoritarian power that forces everyone to have the same wealth, basically.  So, not ethical nor practical, but the essence is well intentioned.  That’s about the best you can say about straight up communism.

Fascism is strictly based on hyper-nationalism and racial hierarchy.  It’s implemented as the idea that you, as a citizen, have the great purpose in life of serving and bettering the state through your work and service.  Individuality is squashed.  It requires authoritative power, that everyone serves, and often needs to be expansionist or combative to survive (you need an enemy to direct anger at, basically).

So, both are stupid.  One is intentionally violent, aggressive, and authoritarian, the other is so poorly thought out that the only way to “make it happen” is with authoritarian policies.  Both end up depriving/punishing people of individuality and free thought, so both are so evil in my opinion that there’s really no point in saying which is worse.
