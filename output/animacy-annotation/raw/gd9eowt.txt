I can not understate how much of an absolute embarrassment Victory (and then grown up Victory, ORU) are on an otherwise nice town. These regressive assholes live in an ironclad bubble; their selfishness and hypocrisy are endless. I think ‘pride’ is a sin, that being said, imagine being *proud* of being so nihilistic and ignorant that you hold church gatherings so you can stroke your own sense of moral superiority during a motherfucking plague. These shameless brainwashed ghouls are happily spreading their virus while this virus is crippling our nation, but they’ll be the one to drape a flag and a cross on everything they own, so they’re convinced they have a monopoly on the goodwill of faith and patriotism.
