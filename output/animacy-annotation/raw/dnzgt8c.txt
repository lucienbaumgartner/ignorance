&gt; I have not eaten more than 500 calories a day in over a month,

If that was true, you would actually be starving yourself. I suspect with a high enough starting weight it'd be possible, but you would have to spend all of those calories on your micros, or take a bunch of supplements.

&gt; some days it's as low as about 90.

I came in here and wanted to defend you, give you the benefit of the doubt. That would have meant to explain how maybe you're not full of shit and lying through your teeth, but just really unaware and uneducated .... but, no, you are claiming that there wasn't a single day where you ate more than 500 calories, and a few where it was "as low as about 90".

So you're claiming you were counting. And you are lying.

If you were counting, and if these numbers were right, you would be losing weight.

If you were counting, and if these numbers were right, you wouldn't need to tell as a rough estimate on how low the numbers were, you would know. (And  why wouldn't you call a day with just 90 calories what it actually was? "On some days, I was fasting and had no more than a small apple and a glass of milk for breakfast.")

But if you're lying, and had no idea how many calories food actually has, you'd be telling us how you were eating as little as 500 calories a day, or maybe just 90 on some days. Because you'd have no idea how ridiculous you sound.
