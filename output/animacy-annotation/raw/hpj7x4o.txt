I love this comment. Just goes to show how ignorant and inexperienced most of y’all are when it comes to sneakers. These are 2013 Chicago Highs, not mids. Quality on these suck and the Jumpman branding looks horrible in my opinion. I can see why you got these confused as mids. I’d put them in the same category.
