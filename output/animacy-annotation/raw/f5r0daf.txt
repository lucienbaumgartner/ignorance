&gt;I suppose another 6-10 million socialists and other political opponents,  Poles, LGBT+ people, disabled people, other ethnic minorities, 25-30  million Soviet people, 8 million Germans, and 1 million Yugoslavs don't  count because reasons?

I used the 6 million figure because OP's post was so uneducated and ignorant that the only way I'd get through to anyone was using the dumbed-down '6 million' figure. I'm fully away that Hitler killed millions more (though you're including soldiers in that tally so yours isn't exactly the true figure for 'exterminations'). I can easily add far more to Stalin's (including a lot of Jews)- and while we're at it, why not add Chairman Mao into the mix? His killcount was the stuff of legend.

&gt;Also, your attempt at trying to paint every communist as a Stalinist shows you're arguing in bad faith or your ignorance of politics.

Not really dude. Not every fascist was exactly like Hitler, but in my eyes every fascist leader has been 100% shitty. The same is true with every communist leader.

&gt;As well as that Hitler **waged a war of extinction whereas no communist has ever done so.**

The starvation of the Ukrainians was purposeful and deliberate. It wasn't technically a 'war' but it might as well have been. This is just completely false in every way. The millions wiped out by communism were murdered with exactly the same level of determination as Hitler used against minorities in Europe.

&gt;If Hitler got his way, *the entirety of Eastern Europe would have been sent to the death camps to make room for German people.*

Yes, you're correct. That doesn't change the awful things done in the name of communism, and the awful things that *will* be done for communism if it ever gains control of a major bloc of states the same way it did in the 20th century.
