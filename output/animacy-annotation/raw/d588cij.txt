Eh, arguably, the universe is quite vast and arguably [we ain't all that intelligent](http://img.picturequotes.com/2/84/83141/can-a-robot-write-a-symphony-can-a-robot-turn-a-canvas-into-a-beautiful-masterpiece-can-you-quote-1.jpg). But, let's not really go there for the sake of preventing hurt feels on our behalf.. Is intelligence the only factor in deciding a being's worth? Is my mentally disabled relative who is more unaware and helpless than a pig ([since pigs are much smarter than dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpzpUeJ9HA8)) worth so little that I should put myself above them? Maybe even consider myself entitled to exploit them even? Use them? How is intelligence justification for exploitation? 

Putting intelligence as a test for the value of a sentient being is dangerous, and could have dire consequences for large portions of humans. I would just rather not use that as a benchmark. Sentient beings simply deserve autonomy.

&gt;Yeah obviously, why wouldn't we value ourselves over lesser species?

Well, when you put it that way, I agree. It's only intuitive to want to care for my species more. I wouldn't let a baby die over an animal if it ever came down to it (thankfully, an actual scenario like that is near impossible.)

But does that justify using other earthlings just to satisfy my own pleasures which seeks taste? I just don't think so. I don't need it.
