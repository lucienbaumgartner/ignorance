Exactly right? Look at this by sheer numbers. There are far more white athletes playing these games in the united states. Which means there are far more white players trying out for these positions. Lack of other options doesn't make someone faster, stronger, more explosive. These organizations take the most elite athletes. Someone who is an elite athlete isn't going to take another job just because they can. These people train for this their whole lives. This is an absurdly reductive perspective that demonstrates you have no familiarity with professional sports whatsoever. 

The initial example itself invalidates the entire point you are trying to make. The point of the example is that if more black people were socialized into hockey and expense wasn't prohibitive and etc., there would be more black people in hockey. And that is absolutely true. But why is it in sports where both groups have equal access to the sport, one group routinely comes out on top? You're totally ignoring the flip side of this example.

Social factors are not everything. Genetic factors are not everything. But you're reducing everything to social factors and your arguments are circular and ignorant of reality.
