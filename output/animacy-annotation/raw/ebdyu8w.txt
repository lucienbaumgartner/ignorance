What made me skeptical was that she said she got drunk and blurted out some brutal honesty and was super confused to why he reacted like that. Normally when we get drunk and show a part of ourselves that we normally hide, we apologize or feel shame, hence why people often stay silent on these things.

Instead, she was super clueless to why he was acting like this. If she is this unaware and dumb, she would have 100% said something along those lines sober and without any idea what she says is messed up.

Or like I said, that guy was simply that clueless and it took her saying something like that to give him a hint that maybe she is a bit of a bitch.
