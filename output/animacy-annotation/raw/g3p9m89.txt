She had not much room to make mistakes. Aang had virtually no time to learn all the elements while Korra had 16 years up to the point where the story begins. Korra knew most of the elements before she started training and would have been a prodigy while Aang didnt even know he was The Avatar until the monks told him and he didnt even want to be the Avatar in the first place.
Korra had extensive training from each master with no major press for time and Aang only had a few months with the fate of the world on his shoulders.
She had no business making mistakes. Her mistakes came from cockiness and hubris, not from being unskilled and ignorant. 
That is why people accepted Aang's mistakes: he was still an unskilled little child who had never even seen the outside world and was thrown into a life he didnt even want. Korra was groomed from day 1 to be the Avatar
