True but I think some personal responsibility comes into it as well. We can have the best, most honest and effective education or government but if people are raised to be (or train themselves to be) wilfully ignorant and contrarian conspiracy theorists then it doesn’t matter what the public health system says, everything will be filtered through the lens of “the government always wants to dominate and kill us, big pharma always wants to profit and kill us, chemicals are always bad, nature is always best”. I will add that these beliefs are not always wrong, but then they aren’t always right either, and usually taken too far.

Part of that problem is that the government does very little to address peoples concerns on their level. Opting instead to go with “we know best, the science says this is the way, trust us.”
