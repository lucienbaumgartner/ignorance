I think this text is being misinterpreted. We read

&gt; "conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry" 

and jump too quickly to conclusions. A line or two on:

&gt; "This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

What the writer means is:

1. we are now in an age of reality TV politics
2. Trump is good at that, Clinton is not.
3. Democrats have been as guilty/ willing as any to dumb the whole thing down, which is proving a mistake as Clinton is not suited to this type of politics
4. The old way of doing polls and sending out messages in response is not enough to help Clinton in this new environment
5. The problem needs serious thinking to be done

The writer sees an "unaware and compliant citizenry" as a bad thing.
