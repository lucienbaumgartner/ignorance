&gt;Communism is an attempt to force-feed a society into post-scarcity before it's ready by redefining

See, this is what I'm talking about.  You ignorant and uneducated buffoons go around spouting half assed information that completely misses the point.  And yet you think you are phd experts.

What you just defined isn't communism.   You defined what real political scientists call "Lenninism".

What Lennin and then the rest of the bolshevics pushed in Russia was not communism,  but their own band of authoritarian political leadership with an economic model that was deeply flawed as you said. 

You are half correct in you assessment because you are able to identify the reason the ussr was doomed to fail from the start.   But you clearly don't really understand what you're talking about because you falsely assert that what Lennin pushed in the Russia is the definition of communism.   It isn't. 

You're the epitome of duning-kruger.  You are embarrassing yourself.  And yet you're so uneducated you continue to shit your pants and blame the other guy for the smell.
