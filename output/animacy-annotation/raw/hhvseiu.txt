It’s possible to be critical of the a-bombs in ww2, and war in general, while also being clear eyed about the motivations and forces working on the people who developed the bomb and Truman, who’s decision ultimately led to their use. 

It’s important to understand that we have the benefit of hindsight, we can see how things like bombing civilian populations has very little strategic gain in exchange for an incredibly tragic cost. However, the people at the time, although reckless and ignorant of the unpredictable-at-the-time consequences of their actions, believed their actions to be harm reductionist, that dropping the bombs would prevent millions of other deaths. In addition, the pressures of the US political system, the bias of the military to solve problems through military action, the unprecedented violent circumstances that they were living through, encouraged Truman and others to take decisive action.

All that is to say, individuals have some wiggle room within systems, but some actions are forced by outside forces. We cannot understand how to stop this kind of mass violence without being honest about how it gets to that point. It is a complex situation and cannot be solely laid at the feet of any single cause. And so there is not going to be one single solution to it. Some of the causes have been addressed, after all we haven’t had war on as large of a scale as ww2 since, but obviously there is still work to do.
