&gt; You ignored Any argument i gave you, and you answer in a way that does not address my point: after that you walk away dillusional saying to yourself you ‘won again’ .

Im getting pretty tired of you TBH. What I said was that in the list you linked to there was no evidence that masks were ineffective. I even said the evidence that they were effective was variable, but, personally, I don't have a problem wearing a mask and it's not a hill I'm particularly interested in dying on. 
 
You started off by saying you didn't believe vaccine studies because they were sponsored by Pharma companies and so biased. I tried to explain that there are safeguards embedded in trial design to prevent this, and you went on to question the credibility of doctors and scientists. 
 
As Ive said many times before the only thing I can do is to form an opinion based on the best available evidence. If you don't accept that evidence because you have an ingrained belief that the studies are corrupt then I know from various other exchangers with antivaxxers it's pretty futile to waste my time trying to convince you otherwise. 
 
Oh, and this thread started with some theory that viruses don't cause disease and they are actually some kind of cellular repair mechanism called "exosomes"  - that's so far fetched and ignorant of pretty much everything we understand about cell biology, genetics and biology I'm perfectly comfortable calling it out as bullshit and anyone proposing such a theory as a scientifically illiterate buffoon. 
 
Anything else you are concerned about that you don't think I'm addressing?
