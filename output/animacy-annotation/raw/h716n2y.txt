Can’t answer for them but for me?  They’re family.  They spent 18+ years raising me.  When we were down on our luck and couldn’t make house payments they covered us for about a year at great expense to themselves by pulling out of their retirement funds without even us asking and said not one word about repayment (we did repay them). 

Yeah my step dad primarily says some batshit crazy things, barely graduated high school and is not well educated, and the solution is to do just like with our mildly racist grandparents back in the 80s. That you tell the kids yes their grandparents are wrong and there are simply subjects you avoid with them, and if those subjects come up you simply say that’s interesting and talk about something else.  They’ll be dead in 20 years anyways and we can move on.  I may abhor some of their views, but I also know they would go and have gone to the ends of the earth for friends and family.  Do they say stupid shit?  Yup, but given their level of education and ability or lack there of to understand the world I get it.  Not all of us are capable of grasping the concepts we are expected to, and are for lack of a better term simple minded and unaware of it.
