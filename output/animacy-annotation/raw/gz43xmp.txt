Classic victim blaming, not every instance of police commiting extra judicial murder involves someone with drugs in their system. What about the plethora of examples we have of police planting evidence, or falsifying reports. I think it's the uninformed and ignorant that still throw their blind support behind the thin blue line. Drugs don't make you " act like a demon" , anymore than going to church makes you an angle. Being high on drugs is a crime sure, but it isn't punishable by the death penalty. Your callous disregard for human life, lack of empathy, and your obvious need to feel somehow superior to others is honestly the same confluence of character flaws that creates the sociopathic police state people are trying to put an end to, so no wonder you're out here backing the blue. Oh, and don't think I didn't notice that "civilized people" dog whistle there at the end of your comment. Your empathetic arc ends at the tip of your nose.
