Then there's the added context of your other post where he explicitly states that he outright "disagrees with someone's sexual orientation" while also trying to weasel his way out of homophobia. 

He 'doesn't agree' with a sexual orientation, meaning he disagrees with it, meaning that he has an antagonistic stance on a sexual orientation, You can't get more bigoted than the literal definition of bigotry. 

I have people like this in my life, they say the most uneducated and ignorant of things with such unshakeable confidence and still claim that they're being logical, while they assassinate your character by calling you 'too emotional'. It's god damn maddening. 

He doesn't get to disrespect an entire population of people just because their is a portion of them that does things he doesn't like, that's absurd. I'm angry for you.
