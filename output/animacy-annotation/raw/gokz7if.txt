I think you're being downvoted because of how bull headed and ignorant your comment is. It really sounds like you are completely unaware of the history here. Here is some background reading: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat

The US and the UK overthrew the first democratically elected leader in the country for, you guessed it, oil. So i think when you say that they need to decide if they want the US to be their savior - you sound incredibly ignorant and unaware of history.
