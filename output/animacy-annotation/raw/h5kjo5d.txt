&gt;Check the post history of the guy I'm talking about and you'll indeed see I'm correct.

Than the guys posting history is evidence of his political stance, not his use of a phrase. 

&gt;Radical leftist is a dismissive and demonizing label from those who lean right (dismiss the opinion and demonize the holder). That sort of flipping the victimization is the exact sort of thing that they pull and you're leaning right into it.

It can be. It can also be a term of pride in my experience. So many of my activist friends actively describe themselves with this term. With that being said, I see where you're coming from, and I hold similar distain for anybody using the the term bootlicker for example, but its good to actually hear out people and their views before dismissing them. Advocating for less nuance is rarely a good thing. 

&gt;You're also blaming right wing radicalism on left wing politics (it isn't), you're also treating the left wing as a monolith (it isn't).

Right wing radicalism isn't solely the fault of reactionary left wing politics, and it's extremely complicated and would be overly simplistic to blame one aspect. However to say it's not part of it is honestly just naive and ignorant of people outside of their information bubbles. If you were to blame one institution, personally I would blame legacy media and social media companies creating reactionary echo chambers, but even that would be simplistic. 

My overall point is that human beings are complicated, and it's counter productive in my opinion to apply labels and dismiss people prior to a reasonable conversation.  I feel that empathy and trying to relate to strangers bridges political divide. 

Anyways just my 2 cents. Have a good day
