"given the US refused to provide any evidence of his guilt" 

Well let's see, the hijackers were identified as members of Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden was the leader of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, and days before the attack Osama called his mother and told her he would be going into hiding. Oh, and in 2004 he did eventually claim responsibility. So yea, there was a ton of evidence and everyone knew he was guilty at the time, including the Taliban. Why do you think they agreed to hide him in a secret tunnel in the days leading up to the attack? You think Osama told them he just wanted to play hide and seek? 

It's really ironic that you are calling me ignorant. 

"So? The US regularly agrees to things to then ignore them" 

Stupidest argument I've ever heard. No, we can't just ignore international law. 

"You are no better and probably helping worse people the Taliban ever did"

No, you are by repeating Taliban propaganda where they try to paint themselves as victims. They knowingly hid a person responsible for killing 3000 people in addition to all the other attacks he committed. They refused to hand him over knowing that we would be obligated to attack. There is no clearer justification of a war. 

"Your point is that you are moronically dogmatic and ignorant of the actual history."

Says the person who thinks the US shouldn't have attacked the Taliban after they knowingly hid a terrorist. Again, you think war in general is bad, but you don't understand that there are cases where it's necessary. Definition of being moronically dogmatic.
