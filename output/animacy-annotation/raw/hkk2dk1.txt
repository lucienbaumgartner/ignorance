Alright, I'm done with you.  

But For the record, I'm not a conservative, I've voted NDP every election.  Someone disagreeing with a comment as categorically stupid as "everything is politics" doesn't make someone a conservative.  It's just as narrow-minded and pants-on head stupid as "all government assistance is communism".  Maybe you can find some forceps and pull your sanctimonious head out of your ass and realize that "All speech is political" is a phrase that's just cooked up to further divide the lower classes so that we keep squabbling over the scraps from the rich people's tables.  It's a dog whistle for people like you who are so stupid and ignorant that they think they're smart.
