That's quite alright. Apology not necessary, but accepted nevertheless. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. I do know that people can be deliberately ignorant and insensitive rather than accepting that a lot of bad things were done in the past. In many cases restitution is just impossible, but where it is possible it should be done, especially something as simple as renaming a hill or a sports team.
