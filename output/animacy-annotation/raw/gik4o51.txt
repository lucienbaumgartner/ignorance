I was about to say you were TA but upon reading the story- NTA. It was totally rude and ignorant of her to uninvite the sister of the groom over such a trivial thing. Time to tell Maggie you'll forgive her rude selfish behavior for the sake of the family. I'll bet she demands an apology but your parents and yourself should then tell her absolutely no. She is the one who disrespected your family and needs to beg for forgiveness for her actions. This probably won't happen so you'll have to wait for the inevitable divorce because eventually your brother will see what a despicable creature he married. And by the way, your family should subtlety plant this in his mind without actually saying it.
