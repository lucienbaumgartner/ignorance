All you've done is further solidify yourself as an irrational and resentful person towards anyone who has a different perception from yourself. It's not a baseless assumption when you're only proving my point: the world doesn't revolve around your priorities, or what you deem as being responsible or not. Because many could say you're extremely childish and withering your life away by initially buying the game or spending hours gaming to begin with. Maybe in my eyes, I find it indefensible and idiotic to trade away time rather than trade away money in dead-end time usage such as virtual gaming of any kind. So no, your argument is flawed and a very large indication that you're very young and unaware that idiocy doesn't stem from peoples lack of allignment from your own mindset, but rather idiocy stems from the narcissistic attitude that what you deem right trumps everyone elses opinions and perceptions. Your entitled attitude and lack of awareness on very simple ideas will only get you so far
