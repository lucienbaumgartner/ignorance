I'm not a hardcore lefty but can people can claim Venezuela to be "socialist"?

Yes, they have (had?) wealth redistribution but workers don't own the means of production there (well at least the majority). Or in simpler terms, I think they have some workers' cooperatives but most means of production are privately-owned. It's rather discouraging and ignorant that any proposal to redistribute wealth or even anything remotely "socialist" like universal healthcare is struck down because "HERP DERP VENEZUELA XDDD".

Many capitalistic countries have endured the same problems, and I'm surprised many people didn't blame capitalism for their misgivings.
