This whole word salad is literally "Earth is flat, now do your own research don't ask me for evidence. I'm not wasting my time *(I totally have all the citations)*!!"

I'm not asking you to "cite 10 web pages", one peer reviewed scientific paper is enough. 

Can't tell if this is satire or if you really are so ignorant and delusional.

&gt;Also if you look up the DEFINITION of sentient and then do some research on plants to realise they DO react to chemical/physical stimuli, well then BY DEFINITION OF THE WORD SENTIENT, they are sentient.

Please point out which definition of sentience you are operating under, because that's completely false under definition by any major dictionary. And I didn't deny that plants react to stimuli.

&gt;just go "yeah i dont believe in all this evidence"

Seriously, how presumptuous can you get?

&gt;basic botany that we learn in grade 9

When did they start teaching that plants can feel in grade 9 botany? Talking about grade 9, I think it's a few grades prior that you're introduced to the nervous system and taught that it's responsible for everything you feel. Guess what, plants don't have any. Plants can't feel for exact same reason as rocks, there is no mechanism for it. 

Funniest thing about all this is that even if plant could feel (never happening), a lot more plants are needed to feed farm animals. So not only non-vegans are contributing to tremendous amount of animal cruelty, but many times more "plant abuse" than vegans, those who are ignorant enough to believe it.

Imagine the absurdity of this situation. A thinking and feeling animal is screaming in front of you for its life but you go â€” "Nah, imma kill you anyway because I think that plant over there can feel, which I'll feed to you anyway." Common sense is not so common, especially when it comes to things you are indoctrinated about.
