If you are really so naive and unaware that you didn't know broker fees existed, you also likely didn't know that you are supposed to have documentation and materials ready to apply when you are shown the unit.  By not being prepared and knowing what you were getting into, you wasted the broker's time. That guy could have been showing units to someone that was actually ready to sign (which you should be when you go looking). He didn't take advantage of you anymore than you took advantage of him. Do some basic research into the process and norms.
