Nope, we literally fought tooth and nail for worker rights, that's what unions are for, and generally still are.

And yes, corporations get away with unbelievable amounts of horse shit in this country that isn't a problem in others. Unless you're counting third world countries, then I guess we're doing pretty good as a third world country, which is pathetic.

Would it work for the gig economy? Probably not, but to pretend that they don't apply in general is so unbelievably stupid and ignorant that I can't believe it would come out of anyone's mouth other than some rich fucker who has a stake in keeping everyone else poor.
