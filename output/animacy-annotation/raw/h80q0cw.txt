&gt;You're kinda just repeating yourself honestly

Yea bcs thats the truth

&gt;but saying it over and over doesn't make it more convincing

Im not here to convince you but to inform the reason of many of us who leave protestantism

&gt;What I want is some evidence that what the Orthodox church teaches today as the same as what was taught in early Christianity. I don't think that's unreasonable.

Simply: early christians were able to hold and preserve the traditions. History is clear. The evidence is their existence itself. Is like asking if pur bible is preserved over the arguments of muslims who claims it has been corrupted. One simply sees history. Christians were able to compile a canon and preserve it.

&gt;Wouldn't that suggest that the council of Rome's canon isn't the same one used by early Christianity?

Yeah, those were heretics. Good luck wanting to defend congregations that used gnostic texts that treated God the Father as a demon demiurge. 


&gt;feel like that position is too simplistic and ignorant of canon history. 

Simply is the historical truth. Regardless of doctrine/denomination. 

&gt;Sure they are. Just read though some of Irenaeus' works. Polycarp, Justin Martyr and Clement of Rome are also insightful.

I did. They dont use 5 solas to make up protestant doctrines.


&gt;Again, I haven't seen anything to suggest that Orthodox traditions were held by the early Church.

Are you a trinitarian? If so.

Will you imply trinitarian doctrine is less real and less orthodox (in the sense of doctrine and not the Church) based on congregations that disent or werent yet aware of it?

I dont think so.

Therefore claiming there isnt orthodox theology in early christianity (since orthodoxy IS early Christianity) is THE simplistic Ignorant statement.
