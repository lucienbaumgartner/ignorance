I work with people in prison,  awaiting prison,  and released from prison as well. 

 Most people are sadly uninformed and unaware of the scope of substance using people and their experiences. This kind of broad implication about people who use substances is one of the many reasons it's so difficult for people to overcome it or give a damn. 

Either way, it's wrong.
