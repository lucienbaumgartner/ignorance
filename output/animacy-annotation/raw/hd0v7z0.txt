1) don’t listen to your mom! I’m a nyc bride, too, and there’s no way I’d have an outdoor wedding in November! No way! Especially to accommodate someone so selfish and ignorant that they won’t get vaccinated (sorry, not sorry)

2) realistically, it will be a struggle to fit all that under $5k. Photography alone can easily run you that. But if you get creative, you can find ways to make it work. Ie buy potted plants and wrap a ribbon around them for centerpieces instead of using a florist. Use an iPod and play list for music. If you know a college age kid (cousin, neighbor, etc) maybe hire them to keep an eye on the play list. Etc.
