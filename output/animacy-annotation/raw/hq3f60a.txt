Because of the negative connotations of the flag. People who are scared of being called racist won’t fly the flag. Others believe in its southern pride meaning more than they think it means something racist. Imagine a black person flying the flag… oh some do. Most don’t because it would “seem” hypocritical by people who believe the flag is 100% racist (I believe its racist and obviously won’t personally fly it, but I do see where people come from when they say southern pride). Please look at it from different points of views. 

Nobody wears swastikas. I repeat that again. I can also say nobody has ever shoved a glass jar up their ass, but lo and behold, there is always a person. You don’t walk down the street and see people wearing swastikas. Ever. (figuratively, because you understood “nobody” as not any person ever to exist). I don’t think you have even seen it yourself. 

I can acknowledge how I see the flag as racist but I can also see why others have different views. Try it for a change, instead of “they don’t believe the white patriarch constantly oppressing minorities so their ignorant and dumb”.
