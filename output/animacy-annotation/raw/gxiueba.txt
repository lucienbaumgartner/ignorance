Your initial comment was dismissive and ignorant. That said, this other guy really went over the line.

Your reasons are your own for following mask policy. If it works for you, great! I'm not in favour of taking anything beneficial away.

If you are of the mindset that you can wear a mask and other people don't have to, then you are in the correct mindset. If you believe this activity should be forced on other people, you miss the fact that "force" in this context necessarily ends with destitution or a gun. You can't fine people or smear them into doing things, and when you can protect yourself without concern for what others do, you should always take this option and leave others alone.

Hope that addresses your comment a little better.
