&gt;The disastrous distribution of wealth to the rich as a result of freeing the forces of free markets is self-evident.

I mean... Inequality existed before free markets before capitalism and still exists in today's society that have a heavily regulated market.

So, I don't know what you mean by "*self-evident*". Honestly it just makes you sound arrogant and ignorant of literally every other possible causes of inequality.

Bad post.

&gt;Why would anybody deny reality when it is slapping you in the face?

Arrogant as usual, acting as if you were the owner of the truth.

&gt;The rich are getting richer and have been ever since the Republican Ronald Reagan took office and declared war on the average person, the employee.

Since 1971 actually, look it up "**WTF Happened in 1971**" on Google.
