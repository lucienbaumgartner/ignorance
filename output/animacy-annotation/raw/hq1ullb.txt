That's fine. In fact that's great! I'm glad you're practicing as works for you.

However yoga's origin is in Hindu scriptures. It exists to achieve spiritual goals. It's fine if you're not pursuing them, but saying it doesn't have a religious origin is ignorant and untrue.

These questions are just out of personal curiosity and you don't have to answer, but do you chant om? Do you do headstands? Om is a manifestation of God. It is from the Vedas. Headstands are done to channel amrita or kundalini energy. Purely based on physical analysis they're a dangerous addition to an exercise routine that offer little reward.

I'm curious because I have yet to meet anyone doing fully secular yoga. Most people just don't know that what they're doing is religious because for a lot of people if it's not Christianity it isn't religion.
