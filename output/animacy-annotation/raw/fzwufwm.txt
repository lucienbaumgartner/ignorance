Unpopular Opinion:  Historians always seem to put Antoinette in a positive light, usually referencing to her 'Let them eat cake,' quote during the French Revolution.

But that always struck me as odd since that quote impresses me as being flippant and disconnected from the rest of starving population.  That while they're probably barely getting by on scraps of bread, she's suggesting feeding them cake, like that's going to solve the social-politic issues plaguing the French Revolution.  And to hear she trivialized the lives of actual peasants and farmers seems to support that she wasn't as benevolent as historians frame her to be.

Misguided, maybe, but she still comes off like a teenager rebelling against her strict, fundamental parents, unaware and oblivious to the fact her lifestyle and mentality were part of the problem plaguing France.
