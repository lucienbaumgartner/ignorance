A ranked system would be infinitely preferable. I voted for some dickhead because he said he was going to change it, THAT was the solution. We had a committee that figured out what would be ideal for a country such as ours but that wasn’t the best for the party so we made excuses and nothing happened. The problem is that Canadians are unaware and apathetic and so there is no pressure or repercussions for this. The solution is awareness, for people to actually understand and get angry so that politicians have motivation to actually do something. THATS why I’m bitching, because making people aware is an important aspect of promoting change.
