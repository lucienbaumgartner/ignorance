Pregnancy and childbirth is a natural process that occurs to something like 45% of the population over their life.  It has happened over 8 billion time in the 100 years or so.  

No one is saying pregnancy is fun or pain free. But we are talking about ending a human life. 

&gt;We can kill someone if we feel threatened in our homes (even if the person threatening is mentally ill and unaware of what they are doing), **but a first trimester abortion where the woman is terrified for her safety by someone in her body** is immoral? Please help me rationalize this.

This just has no bearing in reality.  The amount of pregnancies where the mother is under threat of permanent injury or death is so small it's not worth talking about.  In those extremely rare cases  90% of pro-lifers support abortion.
