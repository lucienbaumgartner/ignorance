Depends on the individuals but it boils down to three main thoughts based on these scenarios.

* If they met someone they had chemistry with and they just happened to be younger I have no thoughts beyond that.

* If they have a subconscious pattern of dating a specific age group it's a window into their mental state. Either the people they believe are their peers mentally highlighting a probable lack of internal growth, escapism, or control issues. I think this can be without issue/victimising, but a glimpse into their flaws and needs. Not everyone who seeks control is abusing others, sometimes they are just fearful and unaware of it. Like I noticed about myself in retrospect that though I wasn't picking a couple younger men on purpose, I had no idea of their ages until later, I strongly felt like I was at the helm in my feelings. Like I wasn't on my back foot, I knew the dance steps in a way they did not. I was fresh out of years of being controlled maliciously and then by someone who was simply an accidental bulldozer and I guess I was subconsciously correcting that internally by reorienting towards those connections.

* They're abusers.
