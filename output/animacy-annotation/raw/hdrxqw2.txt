People that tend to cause the most harm are the most insulated and ignorant of their actions. They build up an ideology that protects their conscience and justifies their actions. There is no counteracting force that balances these things, and if it did, it does not scale. 

Their soul may be hollowed out, and lives ultimately without meaning, but there isn’t some one-to-one connection between action and consequence. There is no natural justice. I think that’s what people tend to mean when they talk about karma. It is not real.
