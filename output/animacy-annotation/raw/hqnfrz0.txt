No. It does not. Keyboard activists love the word "gaslighting" because it makes them sound fancy and intellectual, but those who use it typically are using it to describe any type of lying, coercion, or manipulation and very clearly don't even know what it means or where it comes from. Using "gaslighting" incorrectly makes you sound ignorant and juvenile.
