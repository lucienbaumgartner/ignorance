What is it that you're trying to say here? 

From what I gathered, your argument is to say that white supremacists and "descendants of Confederates" are arguing that Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. I'm assuming you're referring to the absurd notion that some historically illiterate people claim that it was *actually* about State rights? Is this correct so far?

Now when I say, that actually the North did not oppose to slavery because of morality or principles of freedom or whatever idealistic nonsense is typically taught in the US. But instead out of self-interest and white supremacist reasons. You realize how these two are not the same thing?

What I am saying, essentially, is that your version of "why it happened" is just as wrong as what the supposed white supremacist are saying. Both of you are actually illiterate and unaware of what were the material conditions that lead to the Civil War in the US. Both of the camps here, the "white supremacist" camp and your liberal camp are arguing that the reasons were idealistic, whereas they were material in nature.

You are also missing the characteristic features of US society as a settler-colonial and white supremacist society, where the white labour were not in fact proletarian and sharing the same class interests with the oppressed Black nation but in fact *parasitic* and benefitting from the continued oppression of them (as well as several other minorities).
