Are you serious? Is explaining myself now equal to "trying to weasel out"?

The only reason why it seems to you that I'm ignorant is that far-right means something very specific to you and anyone who doesn't have that same idea as you is obviously wrong and ignorant. 

That being the case you're being pretty immature and completely disregarding others' understandings just because you want others to think the same exact way you do. I'm going to stop replying given that you're not being reasonable at all.
