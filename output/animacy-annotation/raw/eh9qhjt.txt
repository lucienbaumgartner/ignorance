Anybody think that Trump is knowingly trying to do everything he can to get impeached because he knows the shit he is up to his neck in? What if we find out that he is a double agent? A very inept one but still. Why would the GOP keep him locked in place? I know that he is an idiot and pig headed but he really seems more dumb then the situation demands. As an example would be how he approached the while Flynn/Comey thing. He was so blatantly stupid and ignorant that you have to wonder if it could have been something else. I hope he really does wind up in jail but you have to ask yourself could somebody really be that ignorant? Worst President ever.
