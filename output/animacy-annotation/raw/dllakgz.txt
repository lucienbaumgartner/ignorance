the right winger's post had some interesting insight. clearly he wants the system to work for him. he falsely believes that everybody has been given handouts while "his people" have been left behind... totally naive and unaware that most people right now are trying to climb out of financial difficulty.

his rhetoric sounds more like national socialism then any kind of classical republican or libertarian ideology.
