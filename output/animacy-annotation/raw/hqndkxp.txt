A lot of people in EU are just ignorant and arrogant when it comes to their capabilities in game. They don't know what a cheater looks like, especially a closet cheater. 

I don't know if it comes from the european mentality not to call these people out or if a lot of the players are just plain naive, but it's alarming.
