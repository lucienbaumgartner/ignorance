First this group is highly political and if you have a problem with that you should be the one getting off, also liberals aren't leftist at all they are die hard capitalist who will sooner ally  themselves with facist before trying to think about giving any meaningful help to the working class. I understand you are most likely a seppo and this has warped your political view a lot but saying liberals are anything beyond right or center right is just ignorant and incorrect. And libertarians are just delusional nut jobs so yeah different to liberals but surely not better
