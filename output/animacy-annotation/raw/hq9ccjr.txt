 I believe ancestral privelege and wealth is key in order to determine the future state of a generation. Poor people very rarely get the same opportunities and have to work much harder than the lucky few whose forefathers amassed the riches. In India there is the addition of the horrific class system based on religious bullshit which further adds to the suffering of the poor. Then there is religious discrimination which is another topic by itself. People argue about reservations in our society for the under priveleged being a cripple for competition yet these very people will be the first to compromise in order to get ahead.

Every facet of Indian society is designed to make the poor people poorer giving the middle class the illusion of superiority even though they are one hospitalisation from bankruptcy. This pandemic has destroyed lives and livelihoods and instead of protesting  inflation we are busy debating whether Christmas should be celebrated because a bunch of saffron wearing terrorists want the country for themselves. We voted for them and now they will do whatever it takes to stay in power- keep the masses ignorant and poor so that they have just the right amount of hunger to kill and plunder but not enough to fight for their own rights.
