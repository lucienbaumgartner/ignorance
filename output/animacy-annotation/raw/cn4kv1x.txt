I see corruption a lot. There's a lot of people who want to take the easy way and cheat. 

Perhaps becoming sentient beings was a problem as everyone is always looking to get ahead. The birds, the bugs, and people. 

Maybe we simply have too many tools at our disposal without restriction to do this without it becoming our evolutionary dead end. 

Then the world will sigh and move on, forgetful and unaware that we ever existed.
