Hello! I am not a historian by any means - I just lurk in this sub to pick up interesting nuggets of information.

This book, to my uneducated mind, sounds a bit like "The Better Angels of Our Nature" by Steven Pinker who argues that, despite constant bombardment of negativity in media, we actually live in the most peaceful, nonviolent time in human history. It kind of goes against a lot of commonly-perceived feelings.

Forgive me if I'm way off base, but this book sounds similar - we all (or most of us) have been sort of conditioned to think about the "Dark Ages" as violent, ignorant, and scary. I look forward to reading something that pushes against that narrative.

So my question is, given all that: If you could magically go back and live during some time in the centuries you cover in this book, would you? Do you think you could live relatively peacefully and comfortably? Barring no access to modern medicine and such...
