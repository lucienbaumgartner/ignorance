&gt; the implications of your positions? 

did I hurt your feelings? Did some words make you make a veiled threat of some childish behaviour. Guess what? You can call me whatever the fuck you want, draw me however you want.

Again, if this was purely a discussion and you religious fucks didn't make women out to be lesser than and push your beliefs on everyone else (you need to be saved!!!) we wouldn't be having this conversation because there would be no problem.

&gt;Here you are making a conditional statement, as in, there are religious systems that do not meet the condition for you to disrespect

What you don't understand is that I don't care what you think meets some criteria to be disrespected. Fuck the church, fuck islam, and fuck your sky daddy.

&gt;your ignorant and bigoted statements had global implications.

Yea, I caused the elders of villages to molest young children in the mountains somewhere. Go fuck yourself.
