It dipped down a bit and came back up. Feel free to re-read my comment and check out the context I linked in an update. 

This isn't even a "take", I just explained why people often see cops striking people while on the ground. It's a common practice that gets results, and has a long record of being proven necessary in many similar situations. I was pretty appalled and ignorant of it too until I looked into it.

My comment event stated that despite understanding the practice, this still appeared to be too much force. I fully acknowledged my ignorance of the context, and context is *always*  important. 

So, for context...you saw me post *that*...and decided to insult me? 

Are you proud of that?
