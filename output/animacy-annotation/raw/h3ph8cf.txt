Thank you for the sentiment.  I appreciate the shout out and thought.

If anyone is unaware most of Canada is not celebrating Canada day this year.  In the last few weeks it has come to light that the residential schools (also a blemish and significant cultural issue yet to be fully addressed) seem to have had mass graves of dead children in their grounds.  It’s thrown up a lot of feelings across the country and many like myself are appalled but also shocked … completely shocked and unaware that this could happen… as recently as the late 90’s.  

Nonetheless, I hope it tasted nice and just wanted to make people of the shock spreading across the country.  Perhaps many of us are naive and uninformed of what was going on under our noses. It’s certainly an awakening.
