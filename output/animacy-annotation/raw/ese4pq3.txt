I have never seen people miss my point so hard like you and the other guy. So Iâ€™ll explain slowly.

You say bad things about women. You are not going your own way when you say bad things about women. You are very fixated around women instead of going your own way. A lot of the things being said on here is frankly scary and ignorant. That is why this sub might get shut down. Not because you guys are some freedom fighters or whatever other fantasy you hold of yourself. 

Basically break rules and you lose your sub.

Anything else about feminism was brought up by you and the other guy.
