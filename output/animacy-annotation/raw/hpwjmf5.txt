what exactly are you saying? you seem to be replying to a point i didn’t make. where did i claim to be a musician? do i need to be one to comment on music? my point is simply that your statement that rap does not require musical talent is painfully ignorant and objectively wrong. Are you saying To Pimp a Butterfly, which is widely regarded as one of the best albums of all time, didn’t require any musical talent because it is rap?
