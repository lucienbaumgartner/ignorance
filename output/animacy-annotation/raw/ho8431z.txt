The ownership is not just the ability to save the JPEG, but the fact that it's linked to your digital wallet address in an irreversible metadata kind of way which can be viewed and verified (including the list of all previous owners back to the maker of the NFT) by anyone who has the internet. The file has it's entire ownership history (list of the wallet addresses) on the blockchain (public ledger). It is a highly secure and publicly verifiable certificate of ownership of any asset. The video here was cut before the guy could explain himself. Quite misleading and ignorant of a great piece of technology with several applications. The tech is quite misunderstood now but in the coming years, it will integrate itself into more mainstream applications... Imagine selling your physical land/property online in the form of an NFT.
