***OH COME ON JOSE!***

It's damn near 2020! These are elementary concepts and principles of computing. You're fixin' to inform me that you have been going afk for years now without even acknowledging proper terminology? You realize that could have been the mere cause of so many lost games?

Jose, I bet you're the type of cat to tell your online homies 'brb' and then proceed to take a 20 minute deuce while they sit there in the lobby, entirely unaware and oblivious to your extended absence.

I hope that we, as a community, have learned something today.... as well as the detrimental effects that the lack of, or misuse of, proper terminology might cause.

Let us do better, moving forward. I'm not mad, Jose.. I am just disappointed.
