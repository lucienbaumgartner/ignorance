There are protests in Israel and Palestine everyday but there hasn’t been a conflict on this scale for many many years. You have to be very stupid to think this is caused by protests or Israeli responses to protests. Might as well blame it on a tree falling in the forest.

Hamas is funded by Iran. Iran has launched renewed attacks because the Biden administration has made it clear that they will give Iran a free hand. Iran has also been attacking US ships for months and generally ramping up aggression in a way they haven’t in exactly 4 years.

Your explanation is so convoluted and ignorant of the way international affairs work.
