pro corporate-healthcare and pro federal education, neither of which has helped our healthcare or education system for normal folks. Obamacare has made the healthcare system worse, no? It's more expensive and covers less. The only people that helps is corporations. The poor were already covered with medicaid, so who did it help if not the corporations?

Same goes for education. The Dems created the Department of Education in the 80's to help the education system and our education has gone to complete shit since then. Common core does not work and it's becoming painfully obvious now that a large subset of our population cannot even entertain critical thought anymore. This only helps the corporations in order to create a "unaware and compliant citizenry" to promote their causes at the expense of all of us.
