Your are:

* undemocratic (votes of citizens from different states have different weights)
* more or less the only country without universal healthcare and denying your citizens the right for a healthy life
* in the top 3 of incarcerated people/people quota
* sparking wars all over the globe
* having a large chunk of citizens beeing proud of beeing stupid and ignorant

That is for me an uncivilized country.
