You’re right. Thanks. I was rolling everything into one category. Relative to the definition,  “the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations...”, my position is that Obama was unaware and unwilling to learn that there was a change in the electorate whereas a Trump was able to see it and execute against that visibility. So maybe Obama was both in terms of not understanding the vision or plan Trump had to bring back jobs or create job growth. After all, if he knew a Trump would ride a wave he created, he could’ve simply said, “you don’t need a magic wand or to do anything because the jobs and economy I created will last through your term and lots of jobs will be created....” no comment about a magic wand would be needed.
