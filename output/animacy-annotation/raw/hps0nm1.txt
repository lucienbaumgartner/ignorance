You have no clue what you'll do. It's easy to imagine all this nonsense when you're 26. It's another thing to actually be faced with such things when you're 60. This is not a situation where you can try to hypothetically spew some nonsense. The very fact that you think it's about ego here shows that you are a tremendously ignorant and immature individual, definitely not ready for a responsibility like marriage.
