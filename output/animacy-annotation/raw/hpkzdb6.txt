  
Why have you bragged about your job/education, again? for the third time? Will telling you I'm to be an IDF fighter pilot keep you from another consecutive education/job non-sequitur? you are unbelievably insecure and unaware that it is just INCREDIBLE, nobody was talking about education except you, when you made a hair-thin connection to his comment. Me and likely anyone who reads your comments could understand the type of person you are.

I'm convinced you are almost braindead evident by the several unrelated tangents you made. The entire paragraph is buzzwords and insults with nothing behind them, calling me "cringe" is a sign you gave up, unexpected from a scholar as scholarly and fine as you.   
I would usually respect and attempt to consider the words of another even if they keep insulting me to my face with no cause, but I'm ignoring this rule I've made for myself as I highly believe you are projecting so intensely that my skin is burning and blistering.  
Else, why would anyone bash dragon-ball fans with such confidence, while browsing a dragon-ball related forum?
