Honestly.

&gt;I think it’s forgivable considering he shows remorse.

What a fucking delusional thing to say. I’m sad for the Duarte family when I read that because I can’t imagine how they’d feel if they heard such a thing. This man took an innocent girl’s life because he was so selfish and ignorant that he got behind the wheel at THREE TIMES the legal limit. Isabel Duarte is gone forever and these commenters think a year in lockup and some rehab classes earn forgiveness. Disgusting
