We will coexist with other humans when they coexist with us. When both Islam and Christianity have attempted time and again to forcefully convert or kill Hindus and still do so till date it makes perfect sense for us to hold steadfast to our identity. 

Muslims in Kashmir didn't ask Kashmiri Hindus whether they 'identified' with Hinduism before they attempted to kill them. They went after every last Hindu in the valley regardless of whether they considered themselves Hindu or not. Every last one of them was given the option to convert, leave or die. So please piss off with your stupid ignorant and blatantly Hinduphobic statements. 

India has been a Hindu nation for thousands of years prior to even the Islamic invasions. And it was during those times that India was the richest, most prosperous nation in the entire world. It was Hinduism and it's way of life that led to such prosperity.
