Not to bust your balls too hard, but the way this reads sounds  straight up like the rationale of someone who's a bit paranoid, maybe watched a little too much SVU, and ultimately just unaware and unfamiliar with other cultures(seriously who the fuck says Near East in 2019?) and it's peoples.

Of course  people coming from a corner of the world that has a bit of a blatant conservative and hyper male dominated culture are going to act in such a way that might seem off to someone completely unaware to it all.  Seriously if you ever known anyone who grew up in strict foreign households, there's obscene amounts of what would seem to be normal things that would be deemed inappropriate for a woman, such as working a graveyard shift, playing sports, etc.  There's also the possibility these people are taking care of families when they're not at work. 

I think it's kind of insane to immediately think it's clearly gotta be sex trafficking if you see women working at a grocery store from a foreign country, likely new to here and not being a chatty cathy to some random ass person. I mean wouldn't you be a bit closed down and nervous looking if you were working somewhere where you didn't speak the language that well and the culture of things was completely foreign?

Look I'm not gonna say that sex trafficking doesn't happen and there aren't fronts for it out there, but what you're describing sounds nothing particularly out of the ordinary. You could make just about anything(especially if you're unaware of the culture of things) that might seem personally off to you, sound more sinister in your head.
