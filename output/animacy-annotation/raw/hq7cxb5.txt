No not a single assumption was made. You acted in an ignorant close minded fashion, and then proceed to expect to not to been seen as ignorant and close minded when it very clearly is how you behave before someone's even spoke to you. 👏 you couldn't make it up😂😂. I then said try some molly instead of building up your own imaginary opinion on something you have never tried, or experienced. And you apparently perceived that as me saying not to listen to your "rational mind". There is nothing rational about your ignorant, deluded mind. You are the reason people don't take this seriously because you are the most ignorant person I've spoken to on here yet. Not doing drugs doesn't make you rational, proven here👍
