Two years ago, I had a close family member survive his  suicide attempt and then he called me over, when he realized he had failed, to deal with the aftermath. I arrived at his place uninformed and unaware of what had transpired and had to call for help, despite his pleas to let him die, because he wanted to die.

One of the very first stages of grief that I went through, incolved feelings of anger towards him for making that choice. Visiting him in the hospital I was angry for what he did, even though I felt so thankful that he survived, so we could get him help. Thankfully that anger has passed and we are in a better place now.

My point: although the elements of my experience are different than OP's, I just wanted say that it is normal and easy to judge the cast of characters involved, after the fact, in the light of rationality, but the underlying hints, clues, signs, and actions are not always so obvious, in real time. Eventually the anger and resentment will diminish, so that emotional healing can take place. I wish you well.
