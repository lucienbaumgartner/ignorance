When it comes to regular people, I have no problem believing that very many of them are simply so stupid and ignorant that they outright believe this. 

But when it comes to "prominent" people â€“ people who at least have the wits to grift a comfortable living, make "movies", etc., I find it equally unbelievable that they'd be this outright stupid and that they'd be this shameless.

Odds are that Dinesh is simply shameless. But I just can't wrap my head around that level of shamelessness.
