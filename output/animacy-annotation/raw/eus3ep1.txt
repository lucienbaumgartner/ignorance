Do you think it's more likely that someone is just absent-mindedly, if inconsiderately, sitting in the most comfortable position for them, or that they are actively spreading their legs to "establish dominance"? Dominance over the anonymous passengers of..a bus? Or a metro? Who is thinking like that? People who are commuting are often tired, unaware, and uncomfortable, not thinking about how they can be king of the jungle on the way back from their shitty jobs.
