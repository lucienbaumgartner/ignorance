Maybe you guys can look into a cgm (continuous  glucose monitor)  that is approved for children her age. This can help the whole family out and help her out. Also there is sometimes a share app that they have on the device where you can help keep track of her blood sugars if they get too high or too low.  Sometimes if kids run around all day you have to watch out for those lows that hit them at night or in the evenings like when they are asleep and unaware that their sugar level is dropping.  Most CGMs have an alarm on them that can alert friends parents or the user if your blood sugar is dropping low.  They can be super helpful for newly diagnosed patients. 

When she gets older you can all help teach her how to manage her blood sugars.  And even look onto devices like a insulin pump.
