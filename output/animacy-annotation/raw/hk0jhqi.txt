Sounds like she’s probably never had real girl friends that showed her and talked about boundaries. She may be just socially unaware and awkward. I don’t think she means any harm, I’d definitely talk to her about the comments about your BF though. 
As for her always being in the room, I can see how thats annoying but if she’s paying to be there then there’s not much you can do especially if she doesn’t have friends
