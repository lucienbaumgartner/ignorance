yeah you already know what time it is when medusa steps in ;)

yeah he probably guilt tripped her into it, she considered giving him a chance for a hot minute then retracted that- realised there was no spark and told him whats up

he's batting out his league and should know better really- at least she had the decency to realise that was a dead end and not lead him on....did all the women in his league suddenly drop off the earth? I think not- just typical male overestimating his options

I guarentee there was a million friendzone signals he chose to ignore cos it didn't flatter his ego or his dick. I can't stress how much I have made it so BLATANTLY clear to some friendzoned males b4 today- I am convinced they just don't give a fuck. They are out for theirs...which again immediately signals they are self serving entitled dimwits who don't understand the art of communication or reciprocal relationships. Its a 2way street not one, if one person does not fancy you there can be no relationship

he gave himself false hope by not looking in the mirror

ah you remind me of the famous line 'men are scared of being laughed at by women, women are scared of being murdered by them'

if he can't get over a soft rejection like that he is going to struggle in the real world- grow some balls.

'his reputation got destroyed' lmfaoooo bc a 5'4 nerd asked a stacey out? Give me a fucking break. You beta males are eveeeeeeeeryyyyyywherreeeee. The lack of reflection on how utterly beta male and ignorant that statement is

I know women that have been raped and had their boyfriend fuck their bestfriend and still managed to get over it and give men a chance

Take that up with nature- women are more valuable- that's why we didn't have them fighting in wars in the same numbers as men. 

Well I am not from America so that's not my problem, that place has been a laughing stock to Britain for some time now
