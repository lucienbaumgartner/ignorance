DID is the current DSM 5 disorder, which is what you call it when you want to take it as a serious mental illness, with its own research and treatment specialists and everything. It has had other names like Multiple Personality Disorder in the past, but that's a little dated; calling it that is kind of a tell in regards to how little one knows about it.

"Split personality" is both dismissive and ignorant of what's actually happening. Basic medical terminology is rarely foolish, and is only pedantic to those who insist that their ignorance is a solid substitute for actual knowledge. 

Seriously, even a cursory skimming of Wikipedia would do you wonders on subjects like these.
