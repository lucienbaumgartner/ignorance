too many people are unaware and complacent. What you said about them laughing at us is absolutely on the money. It's not just politicians either. It's any profession that demands to be trusted: politicians, religious leaders, doctors, judges....they laugh at the very people they are supposed to protect. Meanwhile the general public just keeps letting them get away with it. Very sad!
