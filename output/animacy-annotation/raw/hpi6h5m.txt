No, it's ridiculous that he finds that inappropriate. People with vaginas experience what is called "no concordance" which means their genital arousal is not always caused by sexual arousal and vice versa. People with penises experience this but much less often (getting a boner when they don't feel turned on or feeling turned on but unable to get erect)

People with vaginas can experience wetness with absolutely no sexual feelings presents merely physical stimulation (sitting on a biker even wearing a maxi pad) and can also feel very turned on without getting wet at all.

It's totally norm and he's being ignorant and bizarre for shaming you.
