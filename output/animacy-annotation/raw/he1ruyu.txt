The part that bothered me was after he got mad/embarrassed that Adam said he doesn't like poetry but in all honesty, it just seemed like Eric was trying to suck up to Rahim. Telling Adam that they need space then claiming he's overreacting was such a shit thing to do too. Gaslighting and always cheating....he's got funny moments but I never feel bad for him since everything he does comes across as selfish and unaware of how it affects others.
