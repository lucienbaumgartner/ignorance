I chose to leave Concordia because they employed a Jesuit priest for several decades who raped a dozen children and then protected him and enabled him to get a RAISE and a PROMOTION at another college when complaints were filed against him at Concordia. 

Concordia is a disgusting Catholic organization that protects child rapists. 

edit: scathing opinion, i'm fully aware. but i'm serious. the entire time i attended Concordia my studies were constantly interrupted by riots, protests, regressive bullshit and chaos, and most of the *serious* students complained of the same thing. the Netanyahu protest is case and point. I had no idea who Netanyahu was or that he was even speaking at Concordia the day he was invited to visit. I was just showing up to class as usual, was completely unaware and uninvolved in either side of the conflict, I was going to class to study and learn, the point of the tuition I was paying Concordia for. To learn, not to fight and get pepper sprayed and attacked by people on both sides. the fuck. why did Concordia invite this guy to speak at the school if they knew it was going to result in violent conflict? THEY KNEW it was going to result in violent conflict, there were warnings weeks before the event apparently. yet Concordia allowed it anyway. so hundreds of innocent students were caught in the middle, locked in a school and pepper sprayed, attacked by both sides of the fight AND the cops, for doing nothing but showing up to school one day like a decent student should.

the entire time I was at Concordia it was one crisis after the next. Concordia *encourages* division and conflict under the guise of philosophical and political discourse. constant. crisis. Corcordia was complete Disconcordia when I attended and it doesn't sound like things have changed much.

why don't they focus on PEACE instead of constantly creating conflict? constructive altruism instead of destructive expressions of anger and frustration?
