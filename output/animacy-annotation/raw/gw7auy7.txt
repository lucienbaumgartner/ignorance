While in this case, like others have pointed out, it's just that they're in a time loop, I've always seen it as more of a "the adults are talking, go play somewhere else" kind of reaction to him, as he's often frivolous and unaware of his self-absorption and I say this as someone who loves Deke

From the final scene, it's clear the team misses him and by extension, cares about him. Simmons definitely does and even Fitz in his short time with Deke cared about him risking his life in the temple. Coulson trusted and sent him on the secret mission to recruit help from Deathlok. Daisy might be one of the harshest on Deke (well, he sold her to the Kree..) but from the way she reacted when she found him and Simmons in the Chronicom ship, she does care. Yo-yo had some missions with Deke in season 7 and they got along very nicely. Then there's Mack who would definitely care for him especially after what they went through in the 80's together, and when May arrived, she was spending time listening to Deke's recounting of the events, which she wouldn't have bothered if she hated Deke
