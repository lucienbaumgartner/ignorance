My issue is comparing Pitts to literally any other rookie TE was a fucking ignorant and foolish argument to make. 

Pitts is far better than any tight end I’ve ever seen in my lifetime with the exception of maybe Vernon Davis. Sure maybe he won’t reach his full potential, but comparing him to even Hockenson is pretty stupid if you watched both play in college.

I get a vast majority of this sub doesn’t watch college football at all (or maybe not even the NFL games I’d we are being honest) but it should be abundantly clear to anyone who has not to compare Pitts to other rookie TEs.
