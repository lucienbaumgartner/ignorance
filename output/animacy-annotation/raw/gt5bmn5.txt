You answered my question. "They can choose when to take a stand". So my question is why did they not address the covid protocol issue?

Now a history lesson, the voting rights act of 1965 would prohibit GA passing a law prohibiting blacks to vote.Very naive and ignorant of you to use that in your argument. Any legislation that can be proved to target a groups voting rights would be a slam dunk, even with today's conservative scotus.

So georgia's trying to undermine souls to the polls and how folks recieve and drop off mail in ballots can't be proved to target african americans. Yes, data from the last election in georgia show that Sunday morning voting and mail in ballots were used by significantly more Dems and blacks, the argument could be made that whites could have just as well voted on Sunday morning or used mail in ballots the way stacy abrams group used them. That both blacks and white have the same restrictions under these new laws.

So while it's quite obvious that these laws target blacks and Dems, it's not that easy to prove.

And even before trump packed the court, the voting rights act of 1965 took a hit in the supreme court case holder v Shelby county.

States regulate elections. This is a states rights case, and chief justice roberts sided with the states in Holder v Shelby Co.
