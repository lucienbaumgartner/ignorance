Sure. It also had Reg completely ignore what he was just told by Ozen, a thing that he then proceedes to not want to do despite there not being any consequences for it in the anime original arc. As well as making Riko out as if she's completely retarded and unaware of where she is. Despite her being previously shown to know her situation and her way around the creatures of the Abyss.  
Not to mention that it reuses story beats from later in the story, to the detrement to it when it then reuses them later.
