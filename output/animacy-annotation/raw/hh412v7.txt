She’s three days old, don’t be so hard on yourselves! The first couple nights home are really hard. While you’re still in the hospital, the baby is still quite dazed and unaware of what just happened to them. At some point, they get really pissed off to be alive and out of the womb. 
So in regards to sleep, lots of skin to skin and having the baby on you is super normal. 

Re: feeding. I have no experience with breast feeding, but would suggest finding non-biased health care support that will prioritize getting your baby fed and the jaundiced squared away over anything else. Maybe your kid will figure it out and breastfeed like a champ, maybe they won’t be able to latch, maybe you’ll need to combo feed, no matter what it’ll be okay!
