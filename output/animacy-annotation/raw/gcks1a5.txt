NTA. Your wife on the other hand is both irresponsible and ignorant. That dog and its owner followed the rules, walking in a park they were allowed, and even having a vest requesting not to pet the dog. And she lets the kid run to touch the dog? You are lucky the dog wasn't aggresive, because if it was your son would be hurt, an innocent dog would be put down and a responsible owner would be heartbroken. All because you haven't taught your kid basic manners. As a dog owner, i am appalled at your wife's behaviour. And you need to chose parenting your kids properly rather than avoiding conflict, or you will be the AH. Who knows how many dedicated weeks or months of training that person put in to socialize the dog and your kid undid it a matter of seconds...shameful.
