[Masterful sheet of phenomenality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10eWmSAr6Xl1liRrd003F6hU_vsHRTYIaipV3BbymR9A/edit#gid=0)

* **InnerWish - InnerWish**: Out of the blue apparently comeback album that rocks hard. Really good Power Metal.

* **Almanac - Tsar**: Smolski train keeps on rolling, surprisingly good.

* **Dawnbringer - XX**: Jesus fucking Christ! When my friend says that I'm awfully quiet about the new Dawnbringer EP and I just stand there looking at him dumbfounded and unaware that they had release anything... Glorious EP by a man whose output is becoming in my eyes, legendary.

* **Ravensire - The Cycle Never Ends**: Holy shit! Fucking great Metal from Portugal?? Don't mind if I do! It sounds like it was released in the 80s too. Even broke my rule of never giving 9s to non original albums, it's that good.

* **Sulphur - Omens of Doom**: Awesome varied Black Metal.

* **Skuggsj√° - A Piece For Mind &amp; Mirror**: Really something extraordinary, these guys transcended themselves with this release. The only thing stopiing me from giving it a 10 is because of how difficult it is to listen to the album. It really requires full immersion and attention to detail, but it's also exhausting. It's the reason why I don't listen to classical on a daily basis. Back to the album, it's really flawless and perfectly produced.
