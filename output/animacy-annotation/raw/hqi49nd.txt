A lot of whataboutery and gaslighting, my brother. Why is it that saying Shahada lets in you in Islam and meanwhile you have to show a thesis to prove that it is a false religion? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your ignorance and non-educational stance is indicative of a person who is ignorant enough to compare and contrast modern days norms to those of 1500 years ago. You are are too ignorant and uneducated to differentiate or know the difference between the two.

That's a lot of screeching and whataboutery and deflection meanwhile not addressing a single point. Just say your prophet married a 9 year old while himself was in his 50's and go.

&gt;Where is your proof of this 'violence, violation of women and economic sanctions'? What land

\*Points to the library\* Read your undistorted history for a bit and even Quran and Hadith has plenty of references. Did they not murder poets and critics?  Didn't you wage Islamic war on other people and slept with their women while their husbands were looking? Islamic invaders committed so much atrocities on this land that even today, Hindus are turning extremists just thinking about them. Come on. And even today, you are doing the same in Afghanistan. Do you have any self-awareness?

&gt;Foreign? Islam never challenged culture. That is why Islam never clashed with culture and civilization as is evident by Ibn Batuta's travels and how every corner of the Muslims world has its own incredible diversity from Malaysia to Turkey to Indonesia to Arabia. All living differently yet following the same religion.

Yeah, resorting to Taqqiya to propagate your destructive religion. Yesterday, you broke Afghan originated Musical instruments, you forcefully cover women which mostly didn't before your fascism and wore colorful cloths and roamed the streets with peace. The men of Afghan and Pakistan wore colorful, culturally evolved dresses that showed their diversity, right now they are slowly leaving that and beginning and forced to wear that Arab inspired Shalwar Kamis along with pulled Shalwar to show your feats.

&gt;Please. Your backwardness is painful to experience. Get some knowledge before engaging someone in theology, history or anthropology.

Yeah, I don't need those things, you should say that to some white guy, not those who experience it and go through it. I am enough to dismantle your backward practices and you should not be calling others backward when you cannot understand liberty and individuality and individual rights.
