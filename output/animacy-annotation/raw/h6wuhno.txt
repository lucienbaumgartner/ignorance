Speaking personally, not that great with subtlety. Hinting at interest in me? Self doubt says ‘no way she is.’ Hinting at not interested in me? ‘Does ‘maybe’ mean keep trying, convince me? or no?’ If no, please say no, won’t hurt my feelings. Also, sometimes it’s obliviousness - I’m just overly chatty and share too much - maybe just being friendly and unaware that I’m weirding you out. Jerks who get handsy and pushy? Fuck those guys. Bit of advice? In that situation, find a stranger who’s just arrived, act like you know him: ‘oh sweetie, I’m so glad you’re finally here!’ Most guys will get it and play along to get rid of the creep.
