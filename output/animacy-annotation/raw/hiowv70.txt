to add . . . I once had the unfortunate experience of entering one of these trucks that was driven by these poor guys . Their were three guys driving the truck in shifts . They were all from Bangladesh and had been running this trucks for 14 months non stop . They were having some issues with the truck vibrating so violently it was dangerous to drive . Turns out the problem was the company had cut a hole in the floor of the sleeper unit so they could shit through the hole and didnt have to pull the truck over to take care of themselves . The shit had managed to accumulate around the driveshaft of the truck and was what was causing the violent vibration . This is what they do to people who are desperately poor and unaware of their basic human rights
