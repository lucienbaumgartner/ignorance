&gt; He clearly isn't a bigot or racist.

You realize that pretty much no one is saying that he is one, right? They are saying that it was incredibly tone deaf and if he is still parroting that "disrespecting the military and flag" bullshit in 2020 then he has actively avoided finding out the real reasons behind the kneeling. It never had anything to do with the military or the flag itself, and the only people saying that were using it as a reason to oppose Kaepernick without even attempting to look in to why he was doing this. 

&gt; because he thinks people should respect the flag and simply disagrees with those that do

Kneeling for the anthem is not disrespecting the flag, and many veterans have even said as much to Kaepernick and others. Why does Drew Brees get to believe that his opinion on the flag is more legitimate than actual vets? Just because it's "only his opinion" doesn't mean we don't get to tell him how dumb and ignorant that opinion is.

&gt; who are advocates for your cause

He's not an advocate for the cause if he still thinks the cause had anything at all to do with "disrespecting the flag and troops." 

That's literally a right-wing talking point that has zero basis in reality.

And saying "I will ***never*** agree with someone disrespecting the flag" kind sounds like he doesn't agree with their message either, simply because of the way they choose to convey it.

For Drew to still be saying and thinking this way, now, is pretty much inexcusable, and I can't stand how many morons are in this thread defending him and treating him like a 7 year old that doesn't know any better.
