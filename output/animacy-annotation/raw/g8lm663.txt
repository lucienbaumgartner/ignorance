I'm not even saying they're doing anything that is a sleezebag, I'm not saying that the money donated to them isn't still going to a good cause and isn't charitable.  You're completely misinterpreting what I'm saying.

What I'm saying is that they use the donated money, in their name, to then do those charitable actions, and the donated money they spend, is being written off on their taxes as money they donated.    Essentially, people donate money to celebrities (and companies) so celebrities can donate money and write off the taxes.   Of course the average person doesn't try to write off a $10 donation, but 10,000 donations of $10 is $100,000, and that is worth writing off for the company/celebrity.

That's all legal and within tax law.   People are just naive and unaware that there's an ulterior motive in all of these foundations (that are still also doing good things)
