&gt; I could make a website myself saying debunked for something in about half an hour.

Yeah? You could create dozens of high resolution photographs of the people we see in your image that 100% prove that those are different people and not the same like this one here: https://i0.wp.com/www.rojakpot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Islamic-rage-boy-02.jpg?ssl=1

?? Yes, you could do that? 

Imagine being so weakminded and ignorant that you don't even look at evidence presented to you.
"They used the term "debunked" which I don't like so there's no possible way they actually provide proof beyond doubt that I am wrong, hence I don't even look at it."

I bet you consider yourself as a woke free thinker, yet you act EXACTLY like all the braindead sheeple who cover their ears everytime you try to tell them that there's something wrong in this world. Are you proud about yourself?
