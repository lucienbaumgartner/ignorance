Damn bro, that's a great argument for why you couldn't type "Desmond tutu was x" and instead chose to, yet again, make me feel like shit for not knowing. really I totally cared when you told me I was "ignorant and obtuse"

man it's great knowing that my fellow americans would rather flex on ignorant people and make them feel like shit instead of going out of their way to enlighten them in order to disprove the stereotype of americans being ignorant that upsets them so much. "Nah bro do it yourself" sure is a WISE sentiment that lends itself to helping improve the world one mind at a time.

fucking idiot.
