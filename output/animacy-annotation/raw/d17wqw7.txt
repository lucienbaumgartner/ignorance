There was one a few years ago which I recall but can't find a video of it.

Two riders approaching the finish. neither wants to take the front as they know the second rider is going to go on their wheel and get an advantage. The road up ahead is split by a barrier / raised concrete. The rider that is behind at the moment either shims through a gap or bunny hops over the object and sprints for the finish, catching the rider in front unaware and unable to get on his wheel.
