He really reminds me of myself at his age.  Bombastic to the point of being unaware and dumb despite his obvious potential intelligence.  People like him cuz he was fun and a silly dope, but he was clearly also quite annoying and an overbearing handful.  I felt it was a good and well balanced representation of someone who is a kid cuz he still had a lot of shitty parts he needed to recognize and shed.  I could see why some might find him overly annoying, but seriously, I would preffer that a thousand times to a lot of protagonists that are completely unrelatable.  There are far too many shows I had too give up on because the main character was just a sad brick wall of a human being.  For instance, I know that that dream pizza scene in Steven had something to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion but I was never able to get more than a few episodes in because I found Shinji, the main character, so incomprehesibly unlikable, boring, and unsympathetic.  Sorry.  That rant didn't have much too do with your original points after awhile.  But I started thinking about Shinji and then I couldn't stop myself.  I really wanted to love that show.  Either way, I am glad you were able to muscle through your agitation with child Steven too get with us too where we are now. : 3
