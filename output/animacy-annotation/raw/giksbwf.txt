&gt; They lay out their reasons for the timeline. Which part of those do you disagree with specifically?

But that's the thing. It's arbitrary. There are no hard reasons. They could just as easily have said 24, 29, 31, or 36 months. That's what I disagree with.

&gt; Why don't you try reading the decision which you clearly have never done. :)

Yeah, that's what I've been doing these past few minutes. There's still no justification beyond picking an arbitrary number. Perhaps you could tell me if I'm missing something?

&gt; 3 years isn't 'fair' either. That's the point. What you decry as unreasonable is still almost 3 years waiting for a trial.

Okay...but you're still not addressing my point. It's inherently subjective at what point it becomes "unfair." Is 12 months fair? What about 13? 14? 16?

&gt; Complaining about the courts saying "get your shit together government, it shouldn't take 3 or 4 years to get a case through the courts" while ignoring that it is the job of the government to actually prosecute those cases is...quite seriously flawed reasoning. One might even declare it nonsense.

When you construct a straw man, of course you can make the reasoning look liked flawed nonsense. But that's not my argument. I'm saying that 30 months is arbitrary and ignorant of resource constraints.
