It goes both ways though. If we don't want people to act elitist and to make fun of use for where we live, we can't be ignorant and willing to change. People that think they know more than doctors and scientist and that hating others because they're not like them (immigrants for example) or "they'll take the jobs" can't be tolerated as well.
