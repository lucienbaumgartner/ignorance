When someone has PTSD their norepinephrine, adrenaline, and cortisol responses are completely jacked up and it physically changes their brain. It is not someone using it as an excuse or being weak. When they are triggered, it can be measured in their blood.  It is involuntary and unpredictable. 

People can develop PTSD with events that are not even the most traumatic things they have been through and not have it for the event that was the most traumatic.  The exact mechanisms for developing PTSD are not fully understood, but it shows measurable changes in brain chemistry and function. 

Maybe you have trauma that did not cause PTSD, but dismissing it in others because you don't understand it is ignorant and arrogant as fuck.
