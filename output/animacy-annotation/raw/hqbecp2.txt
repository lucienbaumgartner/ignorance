So you see no path outside of working within capitalism?  I don't give a fuck about McD or Marvel or the endless bullshit.  

We're fighting worse than the Romanoffs 

I completely understand that the commodification of revolution by corporations packaging and selling it to an ignorant and own out populace is part of the problem.  

How can we get people in universities when universities cost as much as much as they do, but wages haven't risen since the 80s?  How can we get healthcare when the system is held hostage by billionaires through a corrupt insurance system?  How will intellectualism stop the police from beating and gassing people in the streets if they choose to strike and/or fight for their rights?
