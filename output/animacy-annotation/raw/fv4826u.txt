Okay fine. For the sake of finding middle ground for this argument. I will acknowledge the importance of watching porn to masturbation which you have mentioned is good for a person. That I will accept. 

But then again we cannot refute the fact that "some" porn, the ones I have mentioned exists in the net only because there are people who watch it. You cant go denying no one does, it wont be there if it has no audience, thus the negative societal impacts I have mentioned are indeed happening. They are not bizzare. You are just too narrow minded and ignorant that you didnt stop to consider that these things are happening. You just closed your mind to the idea that porn just brings pleasure because it is what it does for you, but you cannot say the same for more mentally impaired individuals. Do me a favor and please do some research. 

Ah. I am tired. I do not want to argue to begin with. I did not say that the world is better off without any pornography and I am not some zealot telling you to stop fapping yourselves because it is unholy. All im telling you is that you should pause to consider whatever media you are ingesting and not only be concerned as to what it does for you but for the general population. Is is that hard to swallow? 

With this I bid you farewell.

PS. I hate your attitude by the way.
