You know that it comes across worse if you're older than a teenager and still living at home complaining about the size of it and how awful it is living there? 

I don't mean to be an ass, just hoping to give a little bit of perspective here as you do come across as very privileged and unaware of it. With the housing shortage, rooms will get smaller and houses too. I hate to think of young couples struggling to buy a house now, only to read messages like yours about an inevitable situation their kids will have (if they are lucky - chances are their kids situation will be worse). 

I'd recommend moving out of your house to something bigger. If that's not an option because it's too expensive for you right now, perhaps it might make you appreciate what you have a little more.
