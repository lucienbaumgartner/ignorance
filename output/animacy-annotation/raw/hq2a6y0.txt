Yet you parrot each other, find 'evidence' without checking validity/accuracy, believe whatever crap you find online, state claims without knowledge, and put everyone else as well as yourselves in danger because you're too ignorant and selfish to do otherwise. And then end up dying because of the threat you claimed doesn't exist. 

The Dunning-Kruger effect.
