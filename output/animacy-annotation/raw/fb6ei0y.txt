You speak about being aware and then go on to make baser judgements about large swaths of people without considering (being aware) of their philosophical views on the world that might inform these decisions. Even worse, you don't give a fuck, which means you have no intention of becoming aware of why these things happen. You're your own contradiction. Unaware and unwilling.
