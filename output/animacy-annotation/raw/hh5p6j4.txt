On many exit ramps, you should still slow down to at least close to the advisory speed. On some of them a regular car can go much faster, but that is not always the case. Many exit ramp are tight or decreasing radius and require caution from all cars.
        
This is a sensitive topic for me, I'll admit. My cousin was in the "the exit ramps have the same speed limit as the road" camp for a while. He did not have a tippy vehicle, in fact, he drove a Nissan 300ZX. He took an exit ramp with a 25 mph advised speed at 50-60 mph not knowing that the turn had an aggressively decreasing radius and tightened just out of sight. Tried to slow down in time, but the rear end kicked out and he lost control. Went over the side of the road, flipped when falling down the bank, and hit a tree. ~15 years later, he's wheelchair bound in an assisted living facility with extreme brain damage.
       
He is not an anomaly. We had two people die in the same night at the exit ramp near my old house. They took the turn ignoring the advisory and unaware that the road tightened just past the tree line. Went flying off the edge into the lake and drowned. They found both cars the next day.
     
As a rule, I slow down to 10 mph over the advisory, unless I know the area and know exactly how fast the turn is, and I never take exit ramps at 60+ mph.
