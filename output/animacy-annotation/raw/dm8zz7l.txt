I was a neuro nurse.  A coma us much more complicated than being unaware and unconscious.   There are different levels of unconsciousness,  and the thought is that many people who are not able to react are actually experiencing things  around them,  although maybe in a very altered way.  Some comatose people can obey simple commands,  such as squeeze my fingers.  Some can withdraw from painful stimuli.
