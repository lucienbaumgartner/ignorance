Germany should be a pretty safe place, tbh.

Most germans, especially older generations, are still very numb and unaware of gaming and internet culture. If you'd pick 100 germans between the age of 18-50 and ask each of them if they know what twitch tv or online streaming is, I'd not be surprised if most of them didn't have a clue.
