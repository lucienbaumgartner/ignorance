Suffering is intrinsic to life as a thinking being. We can certainly reduce suffering, and we are, but having no suffering at all is not a realistic goal. It's one of the things that makes 'paradise' impossible for me to accept. If it were possible, we would lose too much in the bargain. It wouldn't be human beings that inherited that Earth. 'Wipe every tear' might as well be accomplished by removing our tear ducts.

Needless suffering can go. We're working on it and deserve the chance to continue doing that. It's helpful to remember that the 'paradise' we supposedly lost was one in which we were naked and ignorant of everything, including our own vulnerability. In that sense, the serpent saved us from a monster that would have been happy keeping us that way. Knowledge was a better thing to have than immortality under those circumstances. Everything we've gained since has been a net positive. Even the terrible aspects.

Not that I think there is a shred of truth to any of it. We're on our own. If there is something divine about human beings and it's our responsibility to let that shine into the world, then empty heaven help us if we don't manage it.
