why are you surprised by his ignorant and misogynistic comments when he has openly expressed his misogynistic beliefs (jokes, you claim) right in front of you? 

&gt; I take them as jokes and usually they’re fairly funny. 

what’s funny about sexism? you realize jokes come from a place of truth, right? why would someone who is not sexist, make sexist jokes in the first place? 

&gt; My husband said “men don’t paint their toes.” 

b-b-but he’s not sexist, he’s just joking 🥺🥺 

it’s 2021, not 1942, men should not be making sexist remarks and women should not be tolerating them.
