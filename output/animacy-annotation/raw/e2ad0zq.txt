Dude, hate to break it to you but that is never happening in CA. This is a democratic stronghold which supports socialist ideals and open borders at any and all costs.

They acquitted a 6-time deported felon and illegal immigrant of murder and manslaughter charges after he shot and killed an unaware and unarmed natural born citizen in the back. California's soul is already dead â€” you don't get your soul back after something like that.

This state is never going back to federalist ideals like law and order and the sooner you face and accept that, the sooner you'll realize this place isn't for you (or me) anymore.
