Dude,

Whatever other judgement you think is being passed on you, I literally don't care.  But, your interpretation here is really stupid.  You are talking about a sign that literally just re-states the law.  It doesn't even need to be there for you to come to a full stop before taking the turn.  That's actually the law.  

If you said "hahah RI drivers are so stupid and ignorant of how to take a right turn on red they had to put up a sign explaining it." that I would agree with, and that you have proven is the case.  Well done.
