How is it asinine? I don't even know how to approach your argument because it's so profoundly flawed. Like, where do I even start? Your assumptions are slow flawed and ignorant that it's like... I can't even tell if you're trolling and trying to pull a gish gallop, but here we are.

So I'll keep it simple -

I lived in Brooklyn. My one building on my block had 1,000 units. It was a minimum of $150,000 in annual income to afford the minimum rent requirements to live there. Many people had roommates or were a couple. The 1br, 2br and 3br were even more expensive and required more income.

That's $150,000,000 in taxable revenue my one building had living in it. Let's pick a low-end tax rate... at 30%, that's $45,000,000 in taxes that the denizens of my ONE building generated for state and federal taxes. ONE building on ONE block in ONE neighbourhood of NYC. There were a dozen other buildings around me with even more units and more expensive requirements.

So yes, our building contributes far, far more into revenue than whatever crap, podunk town you're in. By \*several\* orders of magnitude. If you receive state or federal funds? Our money, not yours. The vast, vast majority of that revenue was generated by the wealth of a city.

Your gas taxes, tolls and town taxes? Nope, they don't cover the costs of building and maintaining roads, not even slightly - it's us, the tax payers in cities that fund your lifestyle and car-dependence.

I find it so funny that suburbanites are so weirded out to find out that, in reality, suburbanites are the welfare queens that the right has been screaming about for decades.
