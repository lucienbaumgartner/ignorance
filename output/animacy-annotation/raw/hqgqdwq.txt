Most people seem to think that wasps are just yellowjackets, paper wasps and hornets, even though social wasps make up less than 1% of all wasp species.

Whenever wasps come up on reddit, chances are a bunch of morons come out of the woodwork, spewing bullshit like "I got stung once so they have no purpose!!!!", "Nothing bad would happen if they all went extinct!!!!" or "they don't even pollinate!!!!", and it's pretty tiring.

Plus you *did* link a sub about hating wasps that is full of ignorant and awful takes, as well as just straight up misinformation.
