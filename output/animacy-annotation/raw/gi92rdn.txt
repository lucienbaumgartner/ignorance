That's so true! 

I often think back to how I didn't appreciate the opportunity enough as an undergrad. Putting it down to being young and unaware of life (I tell myself). As a mature student going back to university I'm looking forward to it more and value this opportunity a whole lot more, but also before pursing a Master's I took the time to manage my anxiety and stress. 

Good luck to anyone else at University as a mature student!
