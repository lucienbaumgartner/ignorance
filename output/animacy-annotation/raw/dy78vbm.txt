But the final girls do it because they know about Jason. The rest of the people are killed because most of them don't know what is going on. You are refusing to read my point. Early Jason Voorhees took most counselors down because they were taken unaware and unprepared. The final girls survive long enough to realize what is going on and then win. In this game, this is pushed aside. All the counselors know what is going on. Against Part 2, Part, 3, Part 4, and Part 5, this would prove his downfall. Yes they're scared at first, they saw their friend die. But if they got together with weapons, which isn't unrealistic, they could very easily take down one man. Especially with access to guns.

I'm not lying, you just have really strong opinions about a slasher character. I'm sorry, but your precious Jason in the early films would lose to a group of counselors armed with machetes. That's just the facts. Even if they don't outright kill him, he'd be down for the night like in every single early Friday movie when he gets beat by a lone average girl.

You say "being that seemly cannot be stopped" and yet he is stopped constantly. Each match takes place over a single night, and Jason is stopped for nights at a time each movie in the first movies. You're honestly going to tell me a group of counselors couldn't do what all the final girls did if they gathered themselves for it?
