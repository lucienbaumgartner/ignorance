As an English man, I feel embarrassed about it. 

When I’m in another country I feel stupid and ignorant that I can not speak their language but they make an effort to speak mine.

Unfortunately it’s not our fault, the English education system is very bad at teaching languages and we don’t get any opportunity to practice. All our films, television, music and print are all in English. The only way we could get to learn another language is to live there for a long time. 

Interestingly the hardest thing I find about trying to speak another language is getting the pronunciation correct. And masculine, feminine, formal, informal is totally new to me.
