We have to use the ventilator when the patient is not getting enough oxygen while on the maximum bipap settings, or when their lungs tire out. Typically at my hospital we will intubate them based on their blood oxygen levels from a blood test known as an ABG; if the oxygen in the blood is too low and the carbon dioxide is too high it is time to intubate. We also look at the patient’s pulse oximeter level which is the 94% in the first picture, if they’re consistently staying below 90% while on 100% bipap it is time to intubate. Lastly we can tell when a patient is tiring out because their breathing becomes very rapid and shallow and they are very anxious, and  it will not improve even with Morphine, then we know it is time to give their lungs a break by putting them on a ventilator. 

While on the ventilator the patients are sedated and we keep them completely comfortable and unaware of what is going on. The machine breathes for them and allows their bodies to rest and their lungs to inhale and exhale the perfect volume and percentage of oxygen that their bodies need. 

The theme around ventilators probably isn’t optimistic because they are scary to see someone on and when people get to the point of needing them they are very sick. Like I said with COVID there is about a 50% chance of coming off of the ventilator. However it is a nice break for the patients and allows their bodies to rest so they can hopefully improve.
