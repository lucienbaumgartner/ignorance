Just a lil story to stoke the fire around the housing and rental market.

I live beside a couple (maybe in their 50s) and they own a handful of rental properties (mostly in the downtown area)

This spring the wife decided that she wanted an extravagant she-shed and started occupying the house immediately beside their "main house". They even merged the two back yards into one.

No idea what happened to the previous tenant but I hope he left on his own terms.

In every aspect, these people are greedy and unaware of what's happening around them.
