Hey asshole, this is a well researched topic with lots of qualitative AND quantitative data, including experimental data to show the integrity of the research. Because YOU are willfully ignorant and unaware of the evidence does not mean there isn’t actually a mountain of peer reviewed research on it that I’m familiar with.

But go ahead and say another stupid thing. You’re quite good at that and I wouldn’t want to hold you back.
