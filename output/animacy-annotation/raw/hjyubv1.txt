i hear you, i get it, i see where you're going with this, but i learned the hard way and rightfully got my ass chewed out by jewish friends cause it's antisemitic and ignorant of the cultural and religious context of those laws when you make them the butt of a joke about how stupid and nasty evangelical christians are. those parts of the bible do not got a lot to do with homophobic christians and christians tend to bastardize a lot of the hebrew testament anyways, and i don't exactly wanna do the same thing as a clever comeback.

if i have to say anything at all, i'd point out that the oldest manuscripts we've found don't actually say what is in almost every english bible (and thus every bible translated from the KJV or NIV bibles to other languages). if you aim for a more literal or culturally-aware word, you end up more or less with "pedophile," or you end up on a long screed about how the word "lay" in the oldest manuscripts means more or less "procreate" and could be understood as encouraging baby-making sex, rather than forbidding homosexuality. but doing that all takes nuance and historical context and cultural sensitivity and, if you so please, an embrace of the ambiguity of the bible because it's incredibly, incredibly old and is basically thousands and thousands of manuscripts shuffled together and assembled with popsicle sticks and hot glue. and we all know how much evangelical christians loooove careful linguistic analysis and respecting judaism.

and then if they tried to bring up what St. Paul says in Romans, ~~i'd tell them to eat shit cause St. Paul can eat my whole ass~~ i'd tell them that St. Paul was living in a pretty specific context where both Christians (his religion) and Jews (his ethnicity/his previous religion) were severely persecuted by the Romans, who were pretty gay, and thus he had a bone or six to pick with them and their culture writ large and just throws homosexuality (and the Greek practice of pederasty) on the whole pile with all his other beef with the Romans
