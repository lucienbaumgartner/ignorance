It's content farming.

You go to a place that's mostly irrelevant, cause shit, post out of context videos to help boost the so-called movement's clout.  Usually by making shit up on the spot, or re-using videos with different stories and narratives.

Israel and Palestine have been doing this shit to each other for years, it's not new or groundbreaking.

It's just sad, ignorant and pathetic.
