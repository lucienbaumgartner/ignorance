He's taxed on the gains. Why should he be entitled to them?

I mean you want to label me too biased, or ignorant to the consequences of policy that's fine. Seems to me a better way of getting that point across would be to address the actual issue being talked about.

I hate to reason by analogy, but I do you also think all other countries who have capital gains taxes on primary residences are also too biased and ignorant of the consequences as well?
