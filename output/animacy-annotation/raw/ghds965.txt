What lies? That I live in Silicon Valley? Okay, you’re right... I live about 20 minutes from where the valley technically starts, since I’m up in the Santa Cruz Mountains now. lol

But I work in the Valley as a *librarian*, and have lived in this region since 1983. Why is that so hard to believe? Like 2 million people live here, and not all of us are rich. I never claimed to be one of the wealthy, did I?

So no, you didn’t “hurt my feelings.” Just proved you are very sheltered and unaware of the world outside of your shit town.
