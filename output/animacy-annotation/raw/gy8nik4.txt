I think you're spot on here.  It is always the case that any industry that generates profits is welcomed by governments, because wealth is taxeable and so becomes revenue for them. They really would much rather let things remain unregulated and simply earn without spending time, attention or money. But when people start to complain and make a fuss, they have to be seen to be doing something. Far, far better that the crypto industry keeps its own house in order rather than shrug it's shoulders and points out that people shouldn't be stupid and gullible and ignorant.  That will always be the case, naturally.

It's always going to be the same from government, sort yourselves out and play nicely or we'll be forced to step in and sort you out our way. That rarely ends well.
