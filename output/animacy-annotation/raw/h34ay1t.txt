When I was really young and unaware of what was causing a lot of my life 'distresses'... I would isolate... but.... It wasn't healthy though because I ruminated a lot and sometimes to the point of feeling suicidal... it was so bad... as I got out of the house on my own, when I isolated my life started to fall apart... I would lose people and employment... and need assistance  from disability at my jobs luckily to keep me afloat... Its like I fell into a pit of despair. That I believe, can be the negative part of isolation... it can take over your life because you're too busy running from what ails you... or drowning in it. I've had to overcome a lot to stop letting the floor drop out from underneath me every time I was triggered. Now I can go to my room away from the everyone for an hour or two when I'm really struggling... that's years of therapy and self work... and I'm still doing it.
