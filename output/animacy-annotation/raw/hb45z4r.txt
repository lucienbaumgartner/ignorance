 Yeah this absolutely screams that Stephen Ross was driving this and then flinched. 

 Being interested at this point seems absolutely delusional and ignorant of the logistics involved from a salary cap, locker room, and competitive standpoint to a degree where I can't imagine it was from actual football people. This smells a lot like courting Jim Harbaugh all over again.

 It sounds like Ross put Flores and Grier out on a limb, let them take a beating, and then suddenly realized the absolute shit-show he was going to call down on himself as well and leaked some "OH IT WASN'T ME" shit.
