Again, back to the reading comprehension comment.   I said it to emphasize you wrote a paragraph in response to a point I never made.  

I’m happy to engage in civil discussion but it takes 2 parties and I found your delivery both rather abrasive and ignorant of my response   - so I don’t know that I would consider it constructive.
