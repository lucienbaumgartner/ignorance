You clearly didn't read any of my other comments. Trans women know it's important. Everyone who's responded to my comment act like trans people dumb and unaware of the blatant hatred we face in society. They have to sus out if you're going to attack us for being trans or not. No one wants to get harassed or assaulted for their identity. If they think you're going to have a massive problem, they will move on. If they want to continue, they'll tell you. I'm really tired of repeating myself.
