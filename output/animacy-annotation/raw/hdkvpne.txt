As a non american, I find hilarious how conservative people don't understand that "freedom" in the US has always been about specific economic policies for markets. But no, they are so entitled and ignorant that they believe it's all about themselves, their own comfort, their own unwillingless to wear a mask and protect the community because it's uncomfortable, their own denial of science just because they won't take a vaccine that's been proven effective. In the end, people will use any excuse to justify their comfort zones.
