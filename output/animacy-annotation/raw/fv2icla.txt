If they support a racist who does racist things that have negative effects on individual races specifically due to their race, then yes, it makes them a racist.

If they are truly unaware and ignorant of his racism (and, unless they were raised in the wilderness by wolves and just re-emerged last night, that would be *impossible*), or do not see his racism as enough reason to not vote for him (i.e. if they are a single issue voter who only cares about abortion, or gun rights, or lower taxes), they are still racist regardless of those factors, because their actions spread and permit racism exactly the same as if they actively were racist.
