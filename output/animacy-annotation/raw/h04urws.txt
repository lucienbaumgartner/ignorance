I'm tired too. Everything is a fucking mess, especially in the usa. It's just an endless battle every day to survive. Staying sane is a whole other fight in this apathetic society that values ignorance.

Most people feel this way, too, or have at some point, but it never is dealt with because of the capitalist propaganda. It keeps them distracted and unaware of just how fucked up this all is. 

Try not to ruminate on how fucked up everything is, though,  because there is a never ending amount of stuff wrong with this world. At least when you come here, you can know there are people who are just as fed up as you are.
