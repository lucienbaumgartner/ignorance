Well that is a direct shot against the direction of Alberta Education. It isn't just that the new curriculum being proposed is basically racist, it's also intensely obsolete and ignorant of developments in the field. Knowledge based education sounds good on paper, but fails tons of students, and then fails the rest once they reach graduate level studies. The province, in its ignorance, is abandoning yet another area where traditionally, the province shows strength.

Also, it's pretty telling that the Minister of Education couldn't even be bothered (or more likely, wasn't allowed) to speak on this subject.
