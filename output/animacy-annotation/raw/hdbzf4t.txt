In some ways, yes, and in fact this very question was first put forth much earlier than you might imagine, as a moral and philosophical question, and more narrowly in context of what should be the acceptable rules of violent conflict.

As early as the 19th century, when multiple-fire firearms were first being developed, some thinkers began to wonder about the appropriate role of various 'machines of war', as they became more sophisticated, deadly, and, over time, more removed from their human operators and commanders. Early multiple-fire weapons proved devastating, as they were intended to be, but raised serious questions by and about those who used them. While the general principle of superior power had of course always been central to armed conflict, the notion of deadly overwhelming power by a single operator was a relatively new idea in the world, and one which started to raise ethical questions.

Drones and other standoff weaponry press these questions further, by forcing us to ask if it's moral to kill other people at no personal risk. The drone could be shot down (and they sometimes are), but no human operating one is at risk, at least from the vast majority of adversaries we use them against. We would not consider it fair for a boxer to go into the ring in plate armour, while his opponent stood bare-chested in Everlast shorts. Warfare at least **implies** mutual risk. Otherwise, where do we draw the line between warfare and wonton murder?

I'm not proposing answers here. These are questions discussed in earnest by people who have many years of formal schooling in such discussion, and I am not one of those people. It would be presumptuous and ignorant of me to pretend to that level of discourse about these subjects. I'm only acknowledging them.
