The description of the subreddit might not officially be such but if you look through the comments of most threads that's exactly what it is.
Though I would call it 'celebrating'. Its pretty clear that a lot of people there take genuine joy in the suffering and loss of people they consider less than themselves. I liked the vibe of the subreddit in the beginning, kind of,  ut it's really fucking depressing at this point because I've for sure met or known people who could be stupid enough to be on there and it the thought of seeing their names on their with hundreds of points going "lol stupid ugly bitch deserved it hope rest of family goes too" really doesn't make me feel great. 

Meanwhile, a bit back I called out a poster on r/conspiracy who claimed rage against the machine's messaging was now suddenly forever corrupted by them performing in an arena that required vaccine for attendance, thereby encouraging responsible conduct by their fans.

For that, I got banned from r/vaxxhappened when posting to call out how ignorant and meaningless an idea it is that "unvaxxed people could be banned from hospitals" given how hospitals are usually funded by a mix of tax money, grants, and pure capitalism- none of which would work out well if you start stipulating it as being just for some people, not all.

Ban message basically just said r/conspiracy attacks r/vaxxhappened and for 'participating' in r/conspiracy I needed to be banned.

So- call out inflammatory misinformation on a subreddit that's mostly anti-vaccine: they didn't like it but that's all.

Call out inflammatory misinformation on subreddit that is pro vaccine: banned for the crime of posting @ the enemy/straying out of the echo chamber.
