&gt; would blame me for any and all of the smallest issue.


&gt; crazy and ignorant

That... sounds pretty toxic. Ive built my grandpa (well over 70) a pc, and everytime he has an issue he writes it down and asks me about it the next time we meet, but thats it. Usually solved in a minute without even turning the pc on and not in a blaming or demanding way.

Hes not really tech savy, but respects both me and my time. Sounds a bit like your parents dont do the same thing for you tbh.
