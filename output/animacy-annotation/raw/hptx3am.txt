Oof, for an “adult”, your lack of self-awareness is astonishing.

&gt;Doesn't matter. Lol

Then, *once again*, why does it suddenly matter now? 

&gt;Cause we knew like everyone else that doesn't have the memory of a goldfish that you can't long term vaccinate against the Covid family.

I’m not sure if you understand what vaccination was intended to do, based off of this statement. 

&gt;Nope. Always just watched the vaccinated numbers climb and pointed to the obvious.

The vaccinated case counts only started climbing in the last 2-3 weeks….maybe this is that goldfish memory you’re referring to….

&gt;Lmao it's a "conspiracy" now that you vaccine doesn't work?

It’s been a conspiracy the entire time. Look around at the retards who have agreed with your incorrect opinion for the last year and you’ll realize you’re all just ignorant and scared of the (many) things you don’t understand. 

&gt;How's it feel being proven wrong...again.

I’ll let you know once one of you idiots actually does it.
