The daughter of my boss started working with us a few years ago. She is so obnoxious and ignorant that shes basically unteachable  and would be fired anywhere else except her because she's  daddy's  girl. I absolutely loathe the girl. Last week I was listening the the HP soundtrack at my desk, very quietly. Suddenly she shrieks and says in her obnoxious female-Gilbert-Gottfried voice "I *love* Harry Potter". All I could think was I'm pretty sure she'd work for Umbridge.
