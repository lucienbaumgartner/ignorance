By many accounts it is not well written but others say it reads like a trashy thriller. The parts I've read were so bad and ignorant that they were almost laughable. But the issues go beyond that. 

\-It is not that well researched. There are many inaccuracies from badly written Spanish to getting well known cultural things very wrong.   
 \-There are parts that have obviously been clunkily copied and pasted from other books. 

\-There are harmful stereotypes some portraying the people as ignorant (mostly because of the lack of research) some echoing the whole "rapists and drug dealers" thing and others just marvel that a brown women could actually be considered "beautiful" 

\-The author and the promotion for the book declared this as a very important book to give the voiceless a voice and to build bridges. So if there are Latinos mad about it it is because she claims to speak for them and yet so obviously knows nothing about the subject. So their voices were really never considered. 

\-There is a very well known bias in the publishing industry and many talented Mexican/Mexican American authors who have fled violence and crossed the border have been told that "no one wants to read about Brown people" (actual note that one writer got, the one that was plagiarized in fact) so when the publisher gives A.D. 7 figures and Oprah and others claims that it is this some great important novel that speaks for asylum seekers it is going to get people who actually been through that hell a bit of a reason to be a upset.
