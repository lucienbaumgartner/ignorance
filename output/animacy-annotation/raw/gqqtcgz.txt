Vasectomies should not be considered reversible. While they are sometimes reversible, this is the exception not the norm. Additionally, not every unwanted pregnancy is the fault of someone impregnating you while "unfit". 

This is some ignorant bullshit, tbh. This isn't "omg let's make men uncomfortable", this is just someone who's trying to make people upset and doing so in a way that's so obviously wrong and ignorant that it makes the entire movement look bad.
