If you don't get it you are either uninformed or unintelligent.

Let's assume you're just uninformed. this virus flat out is approximately 30 times stronger than the flu. 30 times higher mortality rate, and that's across the board for ALL age groups. Not just old people. I have a 5-year-old daughter to look out for. I have a mother who's a doctor who's old and diabetic. Not to mention it's not just about me and my family and my loved ones, I don't want to see people dying left and right because other people are so selfish and ignorant that they refuse to inform themselves or they're just plain stupid.
