You seem to be intelligent enough to be honest with yourself. Just not honest enough where you are becoming your self. 

Basically you know what you are, but who you are is keeping that from becoming a reality. 

The hardest part is breaking your base code program. This is the programming you where TOLD or shown to you when you were young of how you should be. 

But the older you're getting the more you're realizing there is way more to it. You're just dont have the program to completely believe in yourself because your perfectionist programming is not allowing it. 

You're currently living someone else ideal for life instead of your own!

Take some time off. Look within yourself. Have a honest talk with yourself and learn to accept the truth of what you discover. 

You should never be who others want you to be. The perfectionist mentality is usually a defense mechanism from when you were younger and unaware of the world so the best form of survival then was to be perfect. 

Now that you've had more experience with life, you're more aware of the realities of what you need to do to have a good life FOR YOURSELF. Last thing now is to let go of the old program or change it to suite yourself now.  

Go study people instead of information so that you can finish rounding yourself off. You already said you know that life is more about social networking than hard data. 

Remember. You have to BE the change you want to see in the world. Not just discover it. 

Hope this helps.
