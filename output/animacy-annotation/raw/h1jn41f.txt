In my experience whenever I saw someone try to sell sharia or the caliphate, it was always someone very naive and ignorant of how that system working in the real world rather than an ideal world. I used to be like that too, thinking that sharia would've worked and solved problems if only it had been attempted properly, but the truth is that corruption isn't the only reason stuff like that fails.
