&gt;I only see it for 12+ or is this what you meant? 

Yes, thats the age group. India hasn’t recommended vaccinating much younger kids yet.

Also, I find it interesting that you didn’t even bother to give credit to the Indian Medical Association for approving the first ever DNA vaccine in the world. And recommending zydus to kids, just goes on to prove that India has made the safe recommendation for kids while here in US, kids are getting sick from Mrna vaccines.

When you dont give credit where its due and ignorant of the fact that India makes the lions share of vaccines that the whole world uses, just goes on to show the true colors
