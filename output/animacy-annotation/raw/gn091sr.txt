Im sorry that happened to you. That's a horrible thing that shouldn't happen to anyone. Every organization has individuals that do not, and should not represent the whole of whatever organization.

However, it's completely unfair to base your judgement of all religion off of only your experience. What happened to you is horrible, I believe that individuals who commit such a deed betray the very teachings they subscribe to. But why should I be berated and attacked for the things others have done. Why should everyone who believes in a religion be attacked because of someone who also belongs to it doing something bad.

Im not saying that people should join Christianity, or even stop paying attention to the downfalls, but it's horrible that people make no effort to see ANY good whatsoever. I for one am embarrassed that anyone who does the same as they have done to you would even claim to be Christian. I'm ashamed of all of the conservatives who claim to be Christian and then vote for someone like trump. 

Again, I'm sorry that you had a bad experience with religion, but it is naive and ignorant of you to brand every one of them with your own personal experience.
