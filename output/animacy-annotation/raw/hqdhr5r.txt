&gt;So Tammy who's going into her 11th face lift  doesn't need therapy?

The fact that you're comparing that to a person seeking gender affirming care is an ignorant and transphobic position. Your comments consistently show you do not understand trans issues and are not informed about how to address gender dysphoria. Please, for your own sake and the sake of any trans or enby person you might interact with, go do the necessary work to learn about these issues or refrain from trying to express an opinion.
