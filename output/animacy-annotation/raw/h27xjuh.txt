You can define sex by looking at what sort of ability a person had, has, or will have to produce a certain gamete. Gender (if one defines it as some kind of behavioural expression of sex) doesn't fall out of that in a deterministic fashion, but to say gender 'has nothing to do with those things' is strictly false and ignorant of basic biological and psychological research that established this a long time ago. Hormones have nothing to do with gender, at all? Come on now.
