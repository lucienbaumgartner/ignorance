For an in depth comparison, I'd recommend reading the 1998 guidebook Domains of Dread. 

However, in every previous edition, there was the Core. The Core was essentially the main continent of Ravenloft. It allowed for inter-Domain politics, invasions, things of that nature. There were also Clusters, which were more like islands and separated from the mainland. 

Of course, in the new edition all the Domains are separated and unaware of each others existence. Which speaks to the genre shift from horror to grimdark that many old school Ravenloft fans (including myself) are not a fan of. WOTC made the Domains scarier, at the price of being less realistic and less hopeful.
