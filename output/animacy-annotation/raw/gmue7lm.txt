I wouldn’t say it’s the exact same thing. It’s bad to try and exploit someone, yes, and I think that’s already being shunned. All over the world, you hear people accusing young people dating older people of being gold diggers. It’s essentially exactly what you’re describing, and it’s nothing that doesn’t already exist.

As for older people dating substantially younger ones, that’s often another type of exploitation. Someone in their 50s are likely to have more maturity and overall power than someone in their 20s. They can easily force the 20-year old into a situation they’re not really comfortable with because of this fucked up power dynamic. It’s rarely going to be an entirely healthy relationship if there’s such vast differences between two people. It is easy to exploit and because of that, too many people exploit it. I’d still say that exploiting anyone is terrible, but oftentimes younger people are more naive and unaware of the situation, whereas someone that’s older can probably decipher different power and relationship dynamics more easily.
