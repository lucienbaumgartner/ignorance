&gt;Eh, no. By my logic, at the time of Lincoln and the Roosevelts, there was no good data. But now that we live in the era of data, we should proudly indulge our inner Spocks and Rain Mans, make data-driven decisions, and not pretend that we don't in an effort to seem "relatable". Being the President is a tough job, and it should require a modicum of... I'm not sure how to say it, but... awareness. (In addition to empathy, fearless dominance and fundamental sanity.)  
&gt;  
&gt;It's that famous observation that the actual job of the president is far more introverted than the job of campaigning for the post. 


That's cool and all but you can't be president without campaigning and objectively she will go down in history as one of the worst.


Lincoln was one of the most Introverted and a depressant, somehow he had vision and everything else you just named to get *elected* and get **shit** done.


Awareness?? She was tone deaf and unaware that she'd lose the entire midwest. She was unaware that telling wall st to cut it out is not effective. She was unaware that accepting millions she didn't need wasn't going to play well, so why do it. She was "unaware" that using an outside server was outside the guidelines of the executive branch and could easily become a political football, all because she couldn't be bothered to use 2 separate cell phones.


Empathy? What about all the brown people in the middle east with bombs on their heads? What about the Palestinians? What about the innocent Iraqis she sold out for political expedience? What about that girl from Black Lives Matter that wanted a real response to calling us super predators? What about gay people before 2013?


So I'll give you the last 2. But the 2 aspects that don't fundamentally concern holding onto power, she woefully lacks and even her biggest advocates probably wouldn't note those as strenghts.
