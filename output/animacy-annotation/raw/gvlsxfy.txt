That's how her character is supposed to be. In way the show is doing a play on the classic nice guy after nice girl after asshole but flipped on its head. Showing the the asshole(Drew) was the only good person or I should say genuine and well intentioned. Jenna is the opposite of the nice girl trope. Where they're usually oblivious and unaware of the niceguys's affection or if she knows is being held to the "toxic" relationship through some higher power. She was with Drew willingly. She was using Ryan knowingly. When she was mean she was mean on purpose.
