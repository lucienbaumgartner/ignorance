Fascinating and ignorant of the very complex history of the civil war.  The North with its heavy puritan culture of work ethic and meritocracy (i.e., lift one up by bootstraps).  The South was Plantation Aristocracy class system with slave owners, slaves and poor whites.  What is sad the best examples of socialism during this timer periord was in the South with unionizing poor whites competing against slave labor.  

But, you guys donâ€™t know shit about history and just spew shit.
