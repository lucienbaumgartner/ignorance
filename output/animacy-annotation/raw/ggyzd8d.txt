Society (specially school) has always been incredibly mean to us. I have always had a very hard time making friends because of my unusual interests and behaviour, and definetly this played a role in all the hate I received. Sadly the society you are in is hostile towards you probably even because of your skin colour, and this is the demonstration of how corrupted and ignorant that society is. I think that people can "recognize" us through our facial expression, we really don't look friendly with our "default" face. My previous teachers thought I hated everyone to death because of the face I used to have in school, and sometimes (few) people ask me if something is bothering me.
I am really sorry that you also have to suffer from racism other than the already heavy hostility towards INTJs, but eventually you'll manage either to move or to gain the respect you deserve.
At least it's a common experience for all of us and you're really not alone
