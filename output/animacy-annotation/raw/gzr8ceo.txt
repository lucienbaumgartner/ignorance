They didnt ban you for that bro and u know it. I've been banned before in the last August banning and it was for refunds or using Xi. 

They will knock you down to 0 in pvp if you DC to much. 

You got banned for something shameful but wanna come complain here about it and rather than be authentic you think us stupid and unaware of how their bans work.
