If Mercy can sneak up on a perched Widowmaker then yeah, she has the advantage, but same goes for every other hero. Her pistol is not the best for contesting her at range though unless they're a very unaware and bad Widowmaker. Widowmaker has the advantage over every other hero in the game at a long range since she has no falloff, travel time, or spread. Every other hero in the game, with the exception of Ana (but she can't headshot), suffers from at least one of those things. Zenyatta is much better at contesting a perched Widowmaker than Mercy due to his rmb. I've bursted down many unaware Widowmakers from across the map using it by aiming for the head. Still though, if a Widowmaker is causing your team problems, then you should probably bust out a Winston or a Genji rather than a Mercy or Zenyatta.
