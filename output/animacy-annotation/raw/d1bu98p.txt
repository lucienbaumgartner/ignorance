Give yourself time, it has taken years for me to feel comfortable with my non-traditional perspective. Growing up in an environment that is unaware and judgemental of diversity makes the job more challenging. But you don't need the answer today, or this week, things will unfold as you allow yourself to follow your heart and let those experiences give you answers.

Some of it will be allowing for exploration, and changes, and facing fears. But it will all take time. Just take it one step at a time, find what you are comfortable dealing with today. Don't worry about tomorrow.
