If that is what it took to defeat Sanders then he had nothing.

And no one acted on that. It was an abhorrent suggestion but nothing was done.

SO how are those lawsuit coming? Sorry, but exit polls in the U.S. are never used to detect fraud, the polls are not set up to do that.

&gt;Hillary's campaign paid people to act like Bernie supporters can cause violence at a Trump rally.

According to a dishonest video by O'Keefe, a man with a history of dishonest videos. 

&gt;Why did DWS get fired?

Because it was publicly embarrassing. Her leaving is not evidence.

&gt;Why did super delegates pledge to her from the beginning creating social proof in her favor? 

Because elected officials endorse people. 

&gt;She only had to win 30% of the vote to get the nominee after that and she STILL couldn't clinche it until the end. 

You have drifted from your point. She lead from start to finish, she was never behind in delegates or in the polls. She got 4M more votes than Sanders. If we did not have the voter suppression inherent in caucuses she would have stomped him. 

&gt;If you believe nothing else, you have to believe that she is an incredibly weak candidate.

Who is goign to win tomorrow. You have made it clear that your only issue is vitrol.

&gt;The tried to control him because they couldn't beat him fair and square.

Control him? They had an agreement because both candidates were focused on winning in Nov. How is that somehow bad?

Yeah, I already looked at that steaming pile. I'm going to guess you haven't.

&gt;2. Hillary Clinton dreams of completely "open borders‚Äù

For energy. Which is a good thing, particularly regarding electricity. 

&gt;3. Hillary Clinton received money from and supported nations that she KNEW funded ISIS and terrorists

The Foundation got the money long before that email. The money is to fight AIDS.  I'd rather they kept people alive bu you disagree. I have no problem with taking money from people I disagree with. Would you rather the Saudis had more money to spend?

&gt;4. Hillary has public positions on policy and her private ones

Just like Lincoln. Why do you dislike Lincoln?

&gt;4. Paying people to incite violence and unrest at Trump rallies

According to the dishonest video. You may like Breitbart, I don't. I don't take Trump sponsored propaganda as truth.

&gt;6. Hillary's campaign wants "unaware" and "compliant" citizens

OK, this is a real delight. You clearly did not read the email or you just like deep dishonesty. The writer, not Clinton, complained that "we" have come up with a candidate like Trump. That is the "we",  the electorate. But I guess you are proud of an electorate that gave us the racist Trump.

Here is that leaked email you find offensive, tell me what is wrong in it:

&gt;Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his "George" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
