he writes:

&gt; **we've all been quite content to** demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry

I think if he thought it was a good thing he would have written:

&gt; **we've all have succeeded in** demeaning government, dropping civics... ....

or **we can be proud that...** or **well done for...**

In the next sentence he begins **This problem...** i.e. it is not a good thing

Also, few people refer *to conspiring to do something* about something they think is good.

I agree it presents the dismal picture of contemporary politics that we know too well, but any columnist might have written this. It is not a smoking gun of any kind, and to say that it is undermines the message on others that really are smoking
