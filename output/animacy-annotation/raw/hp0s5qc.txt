In retrospect, I do think that it was absolutely wild of them to go to Japan and tell people what to do with their lives as 5 culturally unaware and insensitive Americans (and yes, I know Tan is from the UK, but he's more or less socialized as an American now and has his citizenship, so I'm grouping him together with the others). Kiko was a cute host, but she was barely shown, and wasn't even in all the episodes - she was almost just like a glorified translator or a "doll" that the boys had fun with. I would have loved for her to be a lot more involved and accompany the boys with the heroes on all their outings so that she could give them a better cultural perspective.
