Have you read some of those rankings?  Have you?  Or do you just take them as gospel? I know that Saudi Arabia was ranked higher than the US on health care.  Yet I also know that kinds in the Middle East come to the US in order to get their health care because it is the best in the world.  I know my cousin, who is of Saudi descent, has to fly back to the Middle East to practice medicine because he can't pass his boards in the US.

You see, you are really uninformed and unaware that those rankings are heavily biased in favor of people who have socialized medicine, while your own former NIH director died on a waiting list in the UK for a procedure he would have gotten immediately.  You must also be unaware that in Canada, wealthy Canadians don't wait for months like middle classed Canadians, they come to the US to get the same procedure everyone else in the US gets right away.

I am not a rich man because I spent half my life believing stuff like you seem to believe: the system is rigged and hopeless and there is no chance in trying to be successful.  If I had done what I was supposed to be doing and been making good decisions my whole life.  Still, I am supporting myself and providing for my family and I while living comfortably.  That is how much opportunity there is in the United States.
