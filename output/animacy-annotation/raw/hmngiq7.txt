No. At 1:30 into the video he says “he was still in possession of an illegal firearm” then goes on to explain his reasoning using himself as an example. He is wrong and ignorant of the relevant law of this case; Rittenhouse was *legally* allowed to carry the *legal* firearm according to the *law*. 

The podcast is trash. It’s just three ignorant people who didn’t actually spend any time watching the trial or reading the law.
