Not haha. It’s ridiculous that men still don’t understand how vaginas work. It’s not supposed to hurt, and he shouldn’t get to hurt you just to use you to get off, without putting any effort in. 

For me, I would also struggle with talking about needing foreplay, or asking for new stuff in our sex life. However, if he was so lazy and unaware that he was hurting me and causing problems, I would honestly probably ask him to figure it out before we have sex again. Though I know I can be a bit extra about that kind of thing.
