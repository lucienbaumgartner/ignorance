I put my arm straight out, bent 90Â° at the elbow with my forearm straight up. If their umbrella hits my forearm and bounces back, it usually gets their attention. If it wasn't my arm it hit it may have been my face. I am not interested in leaving the sidewalk to get around these people and wet grass is very slippery and muddy this time of year. I consider this protecting myself against unaware and perhaps apathetic people. If there's someone being rude here, I don't think it's me.
