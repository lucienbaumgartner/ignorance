It does seem like a turning point to me. Half the world is asleep and unaware of the darkness happening around us. My hope is in Christ - I see His work through all of this more than ever. Trust that the light will one day have victory over the darkness.

“Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.”
1 Peter 5:6-7
