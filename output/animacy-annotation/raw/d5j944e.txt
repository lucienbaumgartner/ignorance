For the peer/experience side: have autism awareness training at freshman orientation. 

Also: SEPARATE ORIENTATION. 
Orientations will always be hell for me because all the "scavenger hunt/icebreaker/etc" activities just SOO clearly showcase how weird and unaware and different I am to the ENTIRE group and it goes to hell from there. And since I'd be so scared and embarrassed and tense I wouldn't be able to remember much of anything. 

For a start, have a separate orientation that includes walk-the-grounds until familiar with scope and all the transportation options, and repeatedly using room keycards/college facilities until mastery. 
This is the physical aspect that can easily be done. 

I was doomed right from orientation because I kept locking myself out and getting lost and the way orientation is set up, my whole group/floor knew about it and could often see it, and everything just made me look so weird and it was only a week into college and I was so scared people would smell the weakness and ruthlessly attack. 

And beyond the above basic level, have a separate, VERY literal orientation for autistic freshmen. Not the "oh college is best time of your life! All these groups and clubs I'm in are so great! You made the right choice and life is the bomb here!" pageantry/promo fest that college orientations almost invariably are. 
Like different circles and year levels of students showing you the real ropes by giving summaries like "extrapolating from my experience, this % of people do ( ) in terms of ( ) in their (   ) year"  "people move on from ( ) to ( ) mostly by (  ) and the most common reasons are (. )" 

I was so confused as to what I was supposed to do and how different things everyone was doing than what we were supposed to do and whether it was my bad observation skills or I was just not getting it or....

Not sure how it can be executed well though.
