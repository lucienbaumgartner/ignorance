Some context: My dad has worked at a large mill for 5+ years and knows pretty much everyone there. He has been telling everyone there, including the bosses, that his son (me) will be working there all summer to make money for college.

Here’s the catch, I have a job, I’m 18, and I’m going to a technical college which will not cost me that much (~15k for my degree). My mom and him both demand that I work there to save money for college, and every attempt I have by saying I don’t want to work 12 shifts 5 days a week, I’m 18 and can make my own decisions, and that I love my current job, are shot down by them. At the mill, I’ll be making 15/hr and at my current job I make 12/hr.

I’m living with them for college so I’m saving money but it seems unfair and ignorant that they think I want to waste my entire summer working 12 shifts which I don’t want to do due to seeing how unhappy my dad is after work, quit the job I love, and work in what I’ve heard is a toxic workplace from the stories of my dad and his coworkers. 

AITA for wanting to make my own decisions for where I work and not wanting to be tired all the time for 3 months, and not giving in to my parents even when I’m 18 and legally an adult?
