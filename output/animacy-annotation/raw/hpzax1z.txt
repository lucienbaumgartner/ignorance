If I were to become who I hate I would try to take people's rights away lol. 

But I do see what you're saying hating something soley Because you hate them won't solve anything and will ultimately further keep hate alive. But here's the thing. Alot of transphobes and homophobes have never met a gay or trans person in real life and that's a fact. Especially with what's the picture of this post. These people COULD be open minded and take to time to learn about other types of people and question what they even have these prejudices in the first place, but alot don't. You know why? Because they WANT to be intolerant. They want to be close minded and keep these prejudices because they don't understand much, nor are educated. And again, COULD learn to not be, but what sets this whole thing is that they choose not to so.

So the only right response is to just hate them back and outcast them. Because they are the ones who choose to be ignorant and hateful and keep unnecessary hate in the world.
