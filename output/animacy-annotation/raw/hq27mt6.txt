This is the most asinine and intellectually lazy response on Reddit today.  

Texas is NOTHING like Saudi or Iran.  Do the religious wackos in the state legislature deserve scorn for their recent idiotic (and unconstitutional) anti-abortion law?  Hell yes.  

Does the entire state, which is extremely diverse, deserve a blanket condemnation?  Hell no.

Quit with the fake moral equivalency.  It does nothing but make you look ignorant and foolish and less the outrage for the truly horrible.
