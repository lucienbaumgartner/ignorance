this all sounds made-up and weird AF. 'emo' is not a pronoun. if someone requests he/him, she/her, they/them, that is to be ALWAYS respected. as well as calling someone by their preferred name.

ESH - you for making up a post and (if real) being WILDLY immature and ignorant of pronouns and respecting them. the other person sucks for ALSO being ignorant of pronouns (if they are the one saying 'emo is my pronoun'), and making light of a very real issue that people face everyday.
