All of the " never talk about any other coin " thing is super short sighted and ignorant of us, imo. 

I know this is the btc sub and not the crypto sub, but we really need to try to be more open, kinder, and generally more helpful. All it takes is a well thought out answer to potentially bring more users, instead of driving them away from us and btc, maybe permanently.
