&gt; Yes, but it's something that should be shut down at the root.

Shut down what? Racism? You just agreed with me that it is just as likely to not be racism at all, just historical naivety.

&gt; Do you think ignorance of something makes it okay to justify the actions?

It depends what it is, and what the actions are. I **absolutely guarantee** that some of the things you believe are true will turn out to be false in the future. Should we condemn you, right here, right now, for your ignorant actions?

"Oh my gawd, imagine, back in the 2020s I actually thought adrenochrome was a made up conspiracy theory and white people weren't actually lizards! I can't believe that I voted for Hunter Biden the Lizard King! What an idiot I was!!!" *wink*

&gt; But if you look at his comments, that's a justified reason.

I did look at his comments, and saw nothing that I could interpret as racism. It was mostly about techno.

&gt; Classic BS. "I remember so and so when I see that my views are wrong ..."

Now you're just projecting.

Even if it is true that some racists believe the "Minoans in North America" pseudohistory, merely believing in that doesn't make you racist, it makes you naive and gullible and ignorant of real history. Racists also believe that gravity exists, but believing in gravity doesn't mean you are racist.

We don't even know that the OP was thinking of Minoans. There are plenty of fringe [pre-Columbian contact theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact_theories). Believing in a fringe theory, or merely being confused about locations and times ("we know the Vikings landed in North America, maybe it was them...") doesn't make you racist. It just makes you confused.

u/Mictlantecuhtli was the bad guy here, jumping to an unjustified accusation of "racism" immediately without giving the OP the benefit of the doubt, or the presumption of innocence. That is *literal prejudice*.

Mictlantecuhtli, if you are reading this, you should learn about the curse of knowledge. You are obviously very knowledgeable about the pre-Columbian history of the Americas, and I wish I knew even a tenth of what you know about it. But just because it is obvious to *you* that the Minoan theory is bollocks doesn't make it obvious to everyone else, or that people who ask about it are motivated by *racism*.
