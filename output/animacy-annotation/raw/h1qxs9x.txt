You don't know what you are spouting off about. The facts will always get in your way. 

If you want to stay uneducated and ignorant that is your decision. When you come to a message board with faulty logic or disinformation hopefully others will challenge your warped ideas. 

When it comes to WWII, I will be full on nationalistic. I know what happened and can thank those who perished by remembering their history. What's your excuse for not even learning it?
