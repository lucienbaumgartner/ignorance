No one. I actually have this socio friend (he doesn't know he is, I don't think) who I told myself (probably out of infatuation) I wouldn't lie or try to manipulate him, what ever happens happens. Needless to say that went out the window immediately after I thought it. Totally oblivious and unaware that I'm doing it sometimes, but it's really not that deep.
