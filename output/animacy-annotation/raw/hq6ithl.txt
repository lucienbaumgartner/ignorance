As someone who works in education this is going to make my head explode. 

Homeschooling can be a wonderful thing IF and WHEN the person doing the homeschooling is capable of doing it.  I'll begrudgingly admit that aside from the obviously atrocious beliefs she has had brainwashed into her and still knowingly adheres to, I do tend to have a soft spot for Joy.  That being said... Joy is literally one of THE ABSOLUTE LAST people who should be allowed to homeschool anyone!  

It is extremely frustrating that someone with her lack of education is allowed to "teach" others!  This is just ONE of the many reasons noone in this family has a decent job, joins the military or breaks free...hard to do that when you are willfully kept ignorant and uneducated.
