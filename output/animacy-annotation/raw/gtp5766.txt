Being used at full length on that trail it was certainly illegal, per the language I posted.

I was not going too fast. Much slower than that and it would have been a struggle to keep the bike upright.

You're reading an awful lot into a situation you weren't around to observe.

Bottom line, buddy had the dog on an illegally long leash, was failing to control it, and was clueless and unaware of his surroundings.

But no, you need to pick a fight with a stranger on the internet for some reason, about something you know nothing about.

Get a hobby. I suggest birdwatching. It's very soothing.
