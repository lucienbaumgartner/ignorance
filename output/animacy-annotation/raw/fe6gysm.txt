First of all, I don't care what people think of me on here. 

Second, I wouldn't call it rambling when I'm trying to be civil.

Third, I didn't get "super offended". I wrote my comment to seem that way, again, to start this conversation, which is becoming self-evident as to how unaware and ignorant this entire sub is, especially you. 

A "little bit of background" is that she painted the shoes for a cute guy? Why not just say a guy? Why not just say someone? Again, there's absolutely no reason to mention it at all, because the main point of the post is to display her artistic skill, which is entirely independent of her opinion of the person she's painting them for. 

I really wish I could explain things to you, but from your previous comments, it's unlikely you'll understand what I'm trying to say, and what point I'm trying to make. 
The "argument" you made didn't include any meaningful analysis at all. 

Again, I can see as how from your point of view, arguing with me is useless; however, you continue to respond to me -- why? People with opinions different than our own to a certain degree fascinate us because our perception is that they're unbelievably ignorant, stupid, or hateful, which naturally makes them feel obligated to comment, or at least downvote. 

The exercise is critical thinking, and demonstrative argumentative support. I can't help but notice how pitiful that skill has become, or has always been, and I want to help. 

I'll continue on my way, and I'll continue to attempt to make my points, and maybe try to influence some people to be more critical of the information they consume and the way they think. Until then, I can only hope that as many people as possible take it upon themselves to do that as well. 

Good luck, and I hope you can improve in the future.
