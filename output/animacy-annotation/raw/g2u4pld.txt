Okay, it's bad that people kill people, regardless of race. You apologists like to trot this fact out all the fucking time, and it's not telling us anything new. The police are supposed to be trained not to use lethal force unless it's necessary. They're not supposed to be a league of armed thugs who kill with impunity.

And saying Obama should have taken care of intra-racial violence is so disgustingly racist and ignorant that I don't even know where to start. With Republicans opposing him every step of the way, combating the racist policies of his predecessors, and with systemic issues that have been brewing over the last 400 years... was he supposed to wave a magic wand and fix all this shit? Because he's black?

You should be ashamed.
