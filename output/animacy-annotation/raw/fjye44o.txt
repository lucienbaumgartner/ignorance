I agree 100% with everything you just said except “good intentions” lol. 

When somebody ask for basic respect, and the nutter doesn’t give it, then that’s deliberate. When you get a dog and don’t educate yourself on the basics, I can’t see that as having good intentions. Also, when somebody is astonishingly unaware and disrespectful, intention means nothing to me. 

If you cannot respect your pet enough to know what it needs to thrive, that’s not love nor is it having good intentions. I can’t see it any other way. 

Birds are fucking smart. Long story but the tree in my backyard (more like a tall bush lol) has become the new breeding ground for birds. Northern mockingbird was the latest batch of baby birds that exploded in my tree. Love. Today there was a turf war. Hummingbirds dive bombing, 2 other species I couldn’t see clearly rusting around in there, mourning dove just trying to stay out of the way (think they live around my roof somewhere). 

Then the mockingbird comes back and starts making all these calls some of which sound like a hawk. I’m no expert but it seemed to me it was mimicking all these different predator birds to scare them off. So cool to watch. So smart. 

Then of course a stupid mutt starts barking at nothing and the contrast is so glaring. Anyway that was long. Sorry.
