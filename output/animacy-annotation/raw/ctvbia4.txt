The body still reacts to pain when someone is unconscious and unaware that anything is happening, I know that much from monitoring anaesthetics when I worked as a vet nurse. The heart rate escalates on the first cut every time, probably along with the release of adrenalin, and you have to tweak the gas to compensate during the surgery(bone surgery really set it off) or risk the animal waking up on the table. He might have even come around enough to actually feel the animals eating him before he died, but by that point it was too late(or being conscious of what was happening finally tipped him over). It's a horrible situation, for sure, but nothing paranormal in the least.
