ACAB is not a statement against an individual. ACAB is a systemic statement. There are plenty of local beat cops in "Summerville, Illinois" with 600 people and he walks around playing soccer with Timmy. 

ACAB means that there is deeply rooted bias and corruption not only in the highest of law enforcement departments, but also in place in law enforcement agencies across the country. And this bias takes on many forms.

ACAB doesn't mean every cop is a power tripping bullied kid or a racist.  It also applies to those that tacitly acquiesce to the negative. That see those other officers breaking "protocol" otherwise known to us as the law. Meanwhile people who speak up are discouraged or repressed. And those who are part of this system, ignorant and unsuspecting or not, are still part of the problem. Being a cog in the machine is just as bad regardless of knowledge. I doubt anyone here would throw support at an aide for the Epstein's, regardless of their knowledge.
