Mate, honestly, I know I'm probably unaware and ignorant of a lot of information. But one thing I know is that I'm tired of seeing all these depressing headlines, such as, "[Leader of Hong Kong democracy group attacked with hammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/diphsh/leader_of_hong_kong_democracy_group_attacked_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)" and "[Kurdish man, 74, brutally assaulted for speaking Kurdish in Turkey](https://www.reddit.com/r/rojava/comments/dioyvr/kurdish_man_74_brutally_assaulted_for_speaking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)". Violence is not ok. If people actually cared, they'd do something about it. 

And yes, I do learn most of this stuff from reddit. I don't actively go out in search of more articles to make me feel more and more depressed and hopeless.
