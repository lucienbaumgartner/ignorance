You are racist and ignorant... When a whole group of people ir marginalized in the society those numbers are reflection of this racism. You have to me dishonest as fick to say that a black kid and a white kid has the same opportunities and the same starting point... If you really think that what you're saying makes sense you are a lunatic, ignorant and racist... This is pathetic
