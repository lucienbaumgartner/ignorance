Yes it is. It’s *extremely* stupid. Unless this friend has degraded you and mocked you, then yes it is. And the other comments you’ve made prove that the only reason you don’t want to be her friend is because you’re jealous of the attention she gets. You need serious mental help because now you’re trying to place the blame on someone completely innocent. Based on your attitude in this post, the REAL reason you’re single is because you’re immature, disrespectful, and unaware of how much an AH you are. I’m actually going to change my mind, YTA.
