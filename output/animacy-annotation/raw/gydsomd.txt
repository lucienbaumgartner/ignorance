It does suck that we would be called un-American for stating the facts and telling the truth.  In actuality, we are being truly patriotic by upholding the principles of freedom and calling out those whose goal it is to deny equality to all people, to keep the population uneducated and unaware of their lies and deceit, their bribery of our politicians, and their abuse of the political and financial systems that allows them to steal from taxpayers and make laws that benefit them while hurting everyone else!  I love listening to the brilliant and wonderful Noam Chomsky.  I think that if you have not read his books or watched his interviews on YouTube you are in for a real eye opener.  I hope you will love him as much I do.  Check out "Manufacturing Consent."  He is the voice or truth and reason in this crazy world.  You are right, it is immoral what we do on a global level.  We can and we must do better as a society so that our society will survive and to ensure our own survival.
