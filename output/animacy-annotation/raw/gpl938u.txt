In Alabama, there's a bill that just passed the senate (but not the house) that not only bans blockers and other trans healthcare for people under 19, but makes administering them *a felony*. The penalty would be up to 10 years in prison or $15,000 in fines. Not only that, but under this bill, teachers and other school admin will be legally obligated to out transgender students to their parents, thus preventing students who have transphobic households from confiding in a trusted adult at school.

The most ridiculous part of this is that Shelnutt, the sponsor of the bill, admitted that he has never spoken to a young transgender person before, nor was he even aware that such healthcare was occurring in the state prior to his sponsoring the bill. The man's so ignorant and unaware that he honestly feels like a caricature.

I'll also note that I found an old article a while ago saying that the bill did not apply to people who had received a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, but I can't find any mention of that now.
