Realize that the vast majority of people who end up victims of crime are running with the wrong crowd, or are being stupid and careless and unaware of their surroundings and their own behavior. In other words, don't be stupid and the chance of your being a crime victim drops precipitously.

When I was in my twenties and thirties I lived in big cities. I lived in sketchy parts of big cities. I was small and young and female. But I learned how to be aware of my surroundings, how to protect myself in my own home, and how not to associate with people who might be more adjacent to trouble than I would naturally be. Here I am, in my sixties, traveler to the third world, and the worst crime I have ever been victim of is pickpocketing and that was because I was stupid.
