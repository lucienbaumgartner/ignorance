Not to a downer - my great grandfather rode in the cavalry (actual horses) in Poland against German tanks. He was immediately captured at the first battle and spent the next two years in a concentration camp. My grandfather speaks often of it. My ggrandfather passed away about 2.5 years ago in Wyoming - dementia ridden and unaware of his surroundings. My grandfather just held his hand calling him a hero.
