ADHD/ADD is an interesting condition. Because EMDR helps so much with presence and dissociation, dissociation essentially allowing your mind to be elsewhere while you go about your day to day life, it really impacts a lot of the symptoms of ADD, too. 

I know this because I have complex PTSD with strong dissociative tendencies that really overlap inattentiveness, forgetfulness, scattered thinking that you experience with ADD. I was diagnosed with ADD in early adulthood. PTSD late adulthood. C-PTSD a couple of years ago.   
There are theories that a lot of what is diagnosed in kids with ADD/ADHD is trauma/stress related. In today's world, that makes sense.   
Don't be alarmed in thinking I am suggesting ADD/ADHD is mental illness - it is not.   
I think of it as matrix thinking. It's a strong coping mechanism in a complex world to be tuned in to EVERYTHING at once, especially when kids are expected to sit perfectly still in class and learn in a linear way - not natural for lots of humans.   
In my ADD state of mind, I'm taking in everything at once with almost no filter or hyper-focused and unaware of what's going on around me.   
IN short, EMDR really cut back a lot of my ADD/ADHD behaviors and inattentiveness, lack of focus. The theories about childhood trauma and ADD/ADHD make a lot of sense. Life is hard and our world is not child-focused. We expect a lot of children in school, in activities, relationships and there is not a lot of support for kids in our complex world. Tuning out, checking out, not having strong presence strategies all attribute to what is often called ADD/ADHD.   
I'm not an expert, just really experienced in the life journey of trying to sort out what is atypical about my way of existing in the world and taking it in. I just know what has worked for me. I am not saying ADD/ADHD is not a \*thing,\* it certainly is. I also think ADD/ADHD is a blanket colloquial term now for a lot of what I described.
