But what if by being a lion instead of a sheep I endanger not just myself, but everyone else, too? Shouldn’t I be a lion in that situation?

Let’s say there was some random thing that pretty much every single expert said I should do because it’s perfectly safe and it could save my life and the lives of others. Shouldn’t I be a lion and say “screw that! It’s my choice not to do that!” even if it may seem very selfish and ignorant of me?

Shouldn’t I stand up for my personal freedom and refuse to understand my personal responsibility? Wouldn’t that be the real American thing to do? To give everyone a big ol’ middle finger because muh… I mean my freedom?
