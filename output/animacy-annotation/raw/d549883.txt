You didnt describe how Trump would be better in any way, all you did was suggest (incorrectly I might add) that he doesnt say racist things.  This seems to be a theme with Trump and his supporters...he's somehow better but no one can say how or why. You have to be a special kind of unaware and ignorant to support Trump  
EDIT: Just going to head this off before it goes anywhere, I am by no means a fan of Hillary, I'm pissed that once again my choice in an election is either trash or garbage.
