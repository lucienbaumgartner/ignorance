You see the 2 as mutually exclusive. The Tod is simultaneously greedy and ignorant. That is the exact behavior BugthesDUH has displayed with every single update, patch, hotfix, lack of communication,  and failed interaction with PvP, PvE and Multiplayer. 
They couldn't fix anything if they wanted to and they do not care. The sad thing is that support would like to help, but they simply don't have the tools. That is after you get past the layers of bots and overworked lackeys.
