I totally agree with you on this - and I hate that BLM is being co-opted by trans ideologues when they're absolutely nothing to do with each other.

I am particularly angry because I have seen sex-based oppression in developing countries, so I find it outrageous and ignorant that white TRA/liberals say being a woman is a matter of chosen identity. Boko Haram does not rape and kill girls and hold them as slaves because of their identity. It's because of their biology: because they are female. 

I'm mixed ethnicity. It's a measure of how cultish the TRA movement is that I'm terrified of saying anything more in case I get identified as being gender critical outside of reddit.
