Your wife is naive and unaware that her aunt is being extremely manipulative. *SHE STOLE YOUR CAR. FOR 3 DAYS.* I don't really understand why police WERENT involved in that period if aunt went off-the-grid, but ignoring that, your wife is being INCREDIBLY enabling to abusive behavior. Yes, divorces SUCK. That doesn't mean it's okay to commit a crime.

Tell wife "No. It's a new car, and given a track record of car theft, she will not be taking the new truck, or any vehicle we own, ever. We should have gotten police involved when your aunt stole my car before; the fact that we let that slide doesn't entitle her to use of my brand new truck."

And for pete's sake, don't let her keep using the "divorce is hard on her" card. Bad shit happens, it doesn't justify doing something shitty. Tangent, but maybe behavior like that is why her aunt is divorced now? Abusing the goodwill of those looking out for you tends to push people away, and it's a shame that your wife is enabling her aunt to walk all over you two.
