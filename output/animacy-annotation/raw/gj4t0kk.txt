Thanks for the thoughtful response. Taking a step back I have to concede on certain points you give. 

The whole flag and thread does scream political immaturity; it is  petty and unaware of the greater world as a whole. 

I reacted so strongly to your original comment simply because there is a lot of Republicans using that same logic regarding the democrats keeping America divided to simply skirt responsibility and culpability for those politicians who pushed for the terrorist insurrection. It's very frustrating to see certain Republicans using this unity argument to try and distract from the Democrats and other Republicans who are actual seeking justice.

I do agree while the name calling and generally echo chamber is not helpful. It's also very important we don't forget the higher ups who helped cultivate this current political environment that allowed this to happen. I do think we need to slowly reel back from this us vs them mentality that has been plaguing the culture as a whole these past couple of years. Part of it being these kind of threads.
