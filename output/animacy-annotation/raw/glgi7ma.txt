What baffles me is that when you're trying to educate people on what is a racial injustice you are using a certain amount of political or social capital as well as time and effort that could be better used to make real meaningful change. If you start calling out a children's game because they let a white character have afro puffs then people are gonna look at you like you're insane. They will be less inclined to take anything else seriously and they will be more likely to say "we already gave you x,y and z what else do you want?". Now obviously this is not a logical mentality but not wanting equality for everyone because of someone's skin colour isnt exactly logical either and these kinds of people will be stubborn and ignorant of this. In order to affect real change there has to be priorities over what comes first. I believe that if we deal with the inherent issues, the smaller issues will fall into place.
