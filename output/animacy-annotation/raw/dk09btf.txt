I just started to realize how arrogant it is to think that you know, unquestionably, about how the universe works. Do you really think you know everything and anything you need to know about what is beyond us? 

I believe that our consciousness and abstract thought that is unlike any other animal and it is that way for a reason. 

Whether God is a sentient being and we are all just ants, unaware and largely unable to directly communicate with him... or God is the energy that dictates that universe.. I just think it's so foolish to rule out the existence of something bigger and more aware than is. 

I believe more that Satan the darkest parts of free will than an evil entity. I think that God is more a part of us than a separate, uninvolved entity. 

Not sure if I would really call myself a Christian though, so keep that in mind..
