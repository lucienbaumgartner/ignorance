Dude so real talk. I didn't like Mother! It's the first movie I didn't like. And I think I know why. It's cause I watched The Man from No Where and Hon Bin is so capable in that and then in Mother he's like practically retarded cause he was poisoned when he was 5, even though it made sense why he's slightly slow I couldn't tolerate Hon Bin being practically unaware and uncoordinated.
