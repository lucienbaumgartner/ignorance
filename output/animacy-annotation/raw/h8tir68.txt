Remember when I read one guy saying he thinks the artist can’t have a female main protagonist in part 7 because that would make Jo-Jo series has two female protagonists in a row. (And somehow, it’s unacceptable)
Jesus Christ they just have five male protagonists in a row and somehow they are okay with it? So misogynistic and unaware of it.
