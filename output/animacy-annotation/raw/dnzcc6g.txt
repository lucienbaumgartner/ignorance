I had a lady right hook me. Sent me flying off my bike over her the front of her car. Thankfully I walked away with a broken wheel and a bruised ego. Also a lot of issues with her insurance company... 

Nevertheless, not half a year later I was forced out of my lane by a speeding driver. I saw that he was for sure gonna hit me if I didn't move out of my lane. Unfortunately, that meant ramming myself into the back of a parked bus.  Manlyhood in questionable state for the next few days, however again I think I walked off alright. I did try to call the police and report the incident. However, 2 hours of waiting, 3 phonecalls to the emergency line and no response, eventually I just went home after making sure I had nothing broken. 

Those things suck, but I haven't let it impact how I ride, or when I ride. I love my bike, and I just love riding. It sucks when it happens, but I don't see it as something that will eventually happen, more of an unfortunate turn of events. 
Besides, life gets pretty boring if you sit at home worrying what would happen if you would have went or done something. 

I recently moved to the Netherlands, where for anyone outside it might seem like bikers paradise. To some extent it is, but my new biggest fear is other cyclists. Clueless, unaware, and unpredictable.
