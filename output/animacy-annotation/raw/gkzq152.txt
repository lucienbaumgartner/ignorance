I accept my hypocrisy and inconsistency. As I continue to eat meat, animals will suffer. I am able to make that choice because of human nature, I am selfish and ignorant of my impact on the world. And the majority of people who eat meat are the same. That is why the meat industry will continue to be profitable. You can choose to save some animals, but I will continue to live that way I prefer. I’m not making an argument, not trying to change any views or opinions. I’m communicating.
