I'm not native, but I moved here about 3 years ago.  I grew up in SF and moved to Davis for 8 years (college down about 15 minutes away).  Here are my top 3 pros and cons:

Pros: 

* It's relatively cheap and affordable.  I am renting right now, but planning to buy something within the year.  My rent is $1k (got in before the huge spike and been renewing my lease).  I would never be able to afford anything in SF nowadays, even if I wanted to.  Rent is probably closer to $1300 where I'm at now.  

* I'd say, in general, Sacramento is more integrated than SF or LA.  People are more mixed up in Sacramento than other areas.  

* Good food and restaurant scene!  There's so much good food and beer here.  

Cons: 

* Transit is horrendous.  Unless you live on the grid, it's pretty tough to get around on mass transit.  In SF, there is MUNI and BART - I've never been to NJ or NY, but I assume the transit is relatively good.. Sacramento is a car city.  The grid has a lot of bikers and walkers, but if you live in like.. Natomas, you're not getting anywhere without a car.  

* People are horrible drivers.  Yes, you'll hear this about every city.. but coming from SF, Sacramento drivers are unaware and indecisive.  

* It's kind of a boring city.  There's not that much to do, unless you want to eat and drink.  I have absolutely no idea what the under-21 crowd does here since there isn't much.  

In general, Sacramento is an okay city.  It doesn't feel like a big city like SF or LA.  It feels a lot smaller and runs a lot "slower".  It's an okay city.  I mostly live here because it's affordable and it's a "larger" city.  I love the food.  Love the beer.  Not much to do though.  Hate that there's no good transit system.
