Well, did he wear a condom? Did have an active outbreak? Was he on antivirals? Honestly, if he wore  condom and didn't have an active outbreak it's unlikely you have herpes, not everytime someone with herpes has sex with someone who doesn't the person catches the virus. Also, what's his history has frequent obs doesn't have obs there's so many variables and honestly what he did was a shitty thing ghosting you after sleeping together he's obviously a trash human being to mislead you on where the relationship was going but if you have no symptoms you probably don't have herpes, and at least he disclosed its also a huge possibly you've slept with someone who just didn't disclose or was asymptomatic and unaware of their status. Just try and calmn down, get the blood test done at the appropriate time and go from there. Have u ever been tested before for the antibodies? I mean if he's had the virus less then a year doesn't take antivirals didn't wear a condom and was having an outbreak then yes be very nervous but we don't know all the details of your sexual encounter
