That's not what he's saying 

"Government controls every bit of your life" is exactly what someone who has never left their home state let alone traveled to China would guess at that Chinese life is like. As someone who has lived there as a liberal white dude, I can say that statement is pretty fucking ignorant and racist. 

Oh he's a Chinese. He must have no freedoms and ability to make his own decisions. Those guys arent good people for putting out that fire.  Its just chairman Mao controlling them to do it. 

Reddit has a hardon for labelling Chinese people and assuming they aren't capable of making their own decisions and you are one of those racist pricks.
