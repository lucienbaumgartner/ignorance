I had that happened to me one time. I literally walked out of the restaurant, got in my car, and the customer went ahead and cancelled the order. However, this is the part where you all can gladly call me a dumbass or anything beyond. Instead of keeping the order, I went inside, told the restaurant that the customer cancelled the order, and I gave them the food back. Even worst, it was from Bonefish Grill. In my defense, I was new and unaware that I could keep the food when that situation happen. Although I am a vegan, I shouldâ€™ve kept it because well, at least it was fish or took the fish off and kept the rest.
