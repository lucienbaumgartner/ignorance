You are using incredibly flawed logic to with concepts you clearly don't understand to explain why a certain race is genetically inferior. You are a prime example of pseudo intellectual racist. 

&gt;Education doesn't "grow" intelligence. It only expands your knowledge.

I'm am going to be nice here just in case you are just naive and ignorant. That is completely incorrect. That is not how intelligence works. Your current intelligence is not a static thing. Your brain grows and adapts and learns. Your brain learns how to learn. Your brain needs stimulation to develop the connections it needs to develop more connections to become smarter. An under stimulated brain is not gonna  be as smart as the same brain that was properly stimulated through education, social training, etc. 

To try to put in simply, your genetics are the base hardware you get, and your intelligence is the software you use to run the hardware. As a baby you start with basic software and it grows and adapts as you learn. Better education/environment means better software. Better hardware might mean you learn faster. When you take an IQ test you aren't testing the hardware, you are testing the software. We currently don't know enough about the brain or hardware or even software to be able to determine how fast someone's hardware really is or the way it impacts the development of the software. It's fucking complicated. Like really, really, fucking complicated. 

Hopefully one day will be able to read how fast someone's hardware is and what their potential software capability with the proper environment should be. Until then, shut the fuck up. IQ tests say the things you think they say. You are spewing racists bullshit.
