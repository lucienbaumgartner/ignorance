I'll explain it one more time in baby language,

There is a difference between conservative as in what you defined and the party, the two things aren't the same just because they are the same word. Democrats are democratic so why don't they go to the polls when deciding every single issue? 

Also your getting 4 different words confused and I'll show you how.

Your saying all democrats are progressive and all republicans are regressive/conservative

Suppose the founders gave everyone Universal health care.

A progressive republican would want to get rid of it 

A conservative democrat would want to keep it.

Therefore all republicans are progressive and all democrats are conservative.

Another example lets suppose I wanted to protect obamacare, I would be conservative despite the fact the ones that want to get rid of obama care are conservatives. Conservative and the Conservative party aren't the same thing. Honestly at first I thought you misunderstood but I'm beginning to think your just that stupid and ignorant that you think that history is all a lie. Honestly I pity your stupidity. Also I still don't buy your registered bull shit as I've already caught you in a lie once.
