&gt;I get the feeling you've never met anyone with bipolar

my guy you're speaking to someone with bipolar  


&gt;She could have gone on and off him for that reason, I've seen people with bipolar completely switch on the fly like that

and that is *them* doing it, not the disorder  


&gt;Secondly, alcohol does make some people genuinely blackout drunk and unaware of what they are doing

impaired reasoning and inhibitions doesn't mean the alcohol is in the driver's seat
