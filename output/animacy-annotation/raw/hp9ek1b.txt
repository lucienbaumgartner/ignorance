&gt;So if it's illegal to make, sell and transport, it's OK to consume how?

Because the laws enacted to enforce the 18th specifically made exemptions for personal use. I told you, you literally do not know what you're talking about.

&gt;I never said to give the kids to pedophiles and human traffickers- that was your interpretation of what I said.

You did when you implied they shouldn't be "in cages" but whatever.

&gt;Some were taken from their parents who can't be found now- so there's that.

Prove they were the real parents without detaining them and verifying it.

&gt;They should be in foster care NOT IN CAGES LIKE ANIMALS.

They're not in cages, they're not being treated like "animals", and detention is what happens when you commit a crime. You don't get a special waiver because you're from another country.

&gt;The "who" is being murdered is  no one is being murdered. That's my point.

Yes. I know. That is your opinion. You've repeated it ad nauseum despite me reiterating more than one that this is literally what the whole debate is about. 

&gt;Maybe if we didn't have one of the highest infant mortality rates I would think the point was saving lives. It's not. The point is more totalitarianism.

We have a high infant mortality rate because we count stillborn children as having been "born" when other nations don't. Again you show that you don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;And wherever the conversation is that is where the reply goes. You are not the only person with whom I have been communicating. My attention is divided.

Except you were jumping all over my comments to other people to put your two cents in, instead of just making your argument in one comment. 

I'm going to ignore you now because you've shown yourself to be ignorant and combative and I'm going to go to bed. I'm not going to block you though, so keep on ranting about shit you don't know about if you want.
