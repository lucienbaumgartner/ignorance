So the Duggar's have made it clear over the years that as his wife, Anna is his 'helpmeet'. She is not in charge of anything, not even her own body. So what if he chose the name and she really is that isolated and ignorant that she didn't understand the significance of those two names together. That is actually pretty fucking sad......
  

  
I didn't see it at first, but Madyson (Ashley Madison) and Lily (a girls name that is a flower) are both way too ironic to be coincidences. I will not reference the specific title of the horrific child sexual assault videos that he was busted for, but the girls name was also a flower.....when I realized that, I felt sick and got the chills.
  

  
I don't think this is Anna being smug about forgiving him for the Ashley Madison affairs/scandals, She is just not that clever anyway and likely not in charge of naming the baby, I'm sure that is a headship decision. I think it is Pest being a sick fuck
