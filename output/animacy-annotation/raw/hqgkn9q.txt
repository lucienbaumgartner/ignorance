All I can say is when someone only has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 

Racial fetishization is very real and very damaging. But to insinuate that all interracial relationships contain that element is ridiculous and ignorant. And it comes from an overly simplistic )and in my experience, a self righteous) point of view. 

To quickly step into the field of sociology- there are two sets of concepts- definitive concepts and sensitizing concepts. 

Sensitizing concepts are those kind of abstract concepts that alert us to a pattern, trend, system, set of norms etc. They are concepts that are intangible, but help us interpret the world through a specific lens. 

A popular example of this is "weaponized incompetence". Which is when a person deliberately doesn't learn a skill, or does a bad job performing a task so that someone else (usually a romantic partner) will stop asking for help and take on that task ad infinitum. I see this concept so overly applied and misused. It's a concept that when people learn, they start to see it everywhere. Even places where it is not present. 

I think the same can be said about your friend's perspective on your relationship with your boyfriend. If she has learned about fetishization, she might be overusing it, misapplying it, and applying it to situation where it is not present. 

All I can say is that her interpretation of your relationship does not define your relationship. If she listens to your description of what turns you on and hears alarm bells, that says more about her use and understanding of fetishization than it does your relationship. 

Particularly since you were open minded to this feedback, considered if it applied, and then consulted your boyfriend and asked him if he felt that way or that concept resonated to him.
