Absolutely. I cross posted this on several subs and many people have said ego death with cannabis is not possible.

That’s not true. Freud did some studies on marijuana’s effect on Id vs superego. He explains it as being completely aware of your subconscious and unaware of your external surroundings.

I do feel “awake”. I feel more carefree and sort of “matured” or like i better understand myself and feel comfortable with who I am. I feel like I am able to live purely. It sounds really crazy, I know...
