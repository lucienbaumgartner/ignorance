It can definitely feel lonely, I empathize with you in that. My situation is probably a little different because I'm AMAB. I havent actually made a lot of gender-queer / trans friends. I've met them, but we had nothing else in common. My one close trans friend I met when we both thought we were cis. But I think we understood each other on a deeper level subconsciously because of that.

I have also found it very validating to meet people who can understand different parts of my queerness, especially an ace friend who understands my mixed up feelings about romantic relationships.

Recently I have realized that some of my most meaningful friendships are with cis-women. It's incredibly validating to have a woman notice and appreciate my feminine side, in a way that I never really embraced or accepted when I was younger and unaware of my queerness. In fact I think I used to get freaked out and run away from that kind of connection. 

Maybe that would be different for you since we are opposite in some ways. Maybe gay guys would be a better option if you weren't comfortable being friends with straight men as much. But if you found some cool dudes who enjoyed your bro-side that might validate your more masculine side more. Idk know if that's what you're looking for, and maybe you already have a bunch of guy friends. Just figured I'd share a different perspective.

Also, cities are great for queer communities. The pandemic is making it harder to meet people. And you're still young. I didn't realize I was queer until I was 30. You've still got time!
