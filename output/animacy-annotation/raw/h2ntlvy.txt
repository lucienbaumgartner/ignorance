Thnks for replying kindly but im still going to diagree

Pashtuns born outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have a very diffrent view and opinions. Like i said your not from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa so obvioulsy your opinions come from a different place regardless about your claim of being Pashtun. Maybe a aspiration to visit what you claim is your ancestoral homeland wheras pashtun born in Khyber Pakhtunlhwa would rather protect it from party raves and destruction of tourism.

Ive also notcies people like yourself who claim to be Pashtun as and born outside Pashtun homeland especially in Pakistan tend to be more nationalistic and unaware of the social norms of people actually born in KPK or Afghanistan as compared to pashtuns in the diaspora abroad and in the traditonal homeland.

again like i said big diffrence beetween actual PASHTUNs and People like yourself born in Punjab or india who claim to have Pathan ancestors yet clearly it seems as if you dont speak the language or understand the culture. Hence why a lot of us see you as illegimates and pretenders as you dont represent any of us.

I also assume your from Hazara...place like Haripur and Abottobad which isnt even part of the Pashtun homeland. Idk why the British sided and includednit with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or the NWFP . People from there also tend to have these kind of views not to mention a lot of them arent pashtun but get sided with us just because there districts are part of the Khyber Pakhtunlhwa province

Your definition of "Gatekeeping" is my definition of Preserving my language, pashto, preserving my culture, my lands and my peoples honour
