Thank you for your kind words.  I was afraid I was coming off as bragging, was also afraid to come across as someone saying "It'S NoT AlL MeN!!!"  It's nice to hear that the effort I am able to make is appreciated.

&gt;With all the hate/discredit/shaming directed at women on the internet I started to believe that this is what men actually think. Sexism has always been everywhere (literature, movies...) so internet was the last straw, how could be men so ignorant and degrading toward women in every possible media? It must be because that's what they are and that's what they believe. 

My personal story was that other than the most obvious I never really noticed these things until I started reading this subreddit.  But once I took the time to read women's stories and learn about their struggles I started noticing it everywhere.  And by reading I now have the tools to make the arguments I never had before.  Like so many other things education can help.

And I do think things are getting better.  One example, consent was barely even talked about thirty years ago, and now here we are with things like the #MeToo movement able to happen and have an impact.  Another example is that the BBC now requires there to be at least one woman panelist on all their talk shows after a run of misogyny in their programming a bit over a decade ago.  And people are aware of mansplaining and we even have a word for it.  But just like the fight against racism we still have a long way to go.
