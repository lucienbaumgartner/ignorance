What do you mean alleged? You don’t trust the research? 80% efficacy is very effective. If kids even wore them as intended for half the time that a 40 percentage point gain in protection. Any protection is better than no protection. That study also found that nations without a mask mandate or universal mask use had a 7.5x higher rate of covid transmission. I think you are entirely dismissing the numbers and pulling skepticism out of thin air.

Compliance issues? Are you saying maybe we shouldn’t have mask mandates because some people might not follow them? Should we legalize murder since people still murder each other? That is foolish logic

You wonder why your position is less popular. It’s incredibly vague and ignorant of consequence. It’s contrarian and void of logic and just overall irrational
