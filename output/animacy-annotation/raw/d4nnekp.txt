I hadn't even considered that. I assume that everything is THE play, the MacArthur grant play. Early on they react not knowing he's performing, most of the middle he's giving lines, not always putting himself in the scene. Sometimes he's reacting to the scene honestly. 
[Synecdoche scene with doctor (youtube 1:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt99BOivmP4) (This isn't the specific scene I'd like to reference, I couldn't find the "you can't tell me if you can't tell me" scene, but this is close enough). The doctor appears to be delivering lines and Caden is serious and concerned and unaware that they may be lines he has given the doctor...  
Unless it was the actor (Sammy) he hires to play Caden...  
I also assume only a few years pass. The audience (us the viewer) are being presented THE play. Like Adaptation, the main character has written himself into his own work, only this time Kaufman avoided putting himself in.  
I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I haven't really thought this through while trying to type it out. I've THOUGHT about sitting down and trying to explain it, but now that I have it just seems rambling, with poor grammar.  
**TLDR** - hmm, maybe, who knows.
