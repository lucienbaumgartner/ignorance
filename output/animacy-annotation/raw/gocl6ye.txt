&gt; Life pro tip: there's something known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect and illusory superiority.
&gt; 
&gt; If you condescend at someone, but have no data to back up your beliefs, it probably means that you are the one who is ignorant and unaware of it.
&gt; 
&gt; It would have taken you only a few minutes of googling to find things like this, but you didn't even bother. Instead, you simply talked about how I have been "enabled" to become so "ignorant".
&gt; 
&gt; You are the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; You, personally.

For a guy that spends so much time in here accusing just about everyone of attacking and insulting you...holy fuck.  

I think we need to add your post history to the wiki page on Gaslighting.

What a complete piece of shit you are. 

Pics, is this sub really so bad that you let people like this run around rampantly accusing everyone of every thing they are in fact themselves doing, and at such a level as to be akin to _spam_?

This asshole accuses everyone of insulting them while actually insulting them.  

This asshole accuses people of spreading propaganda while literally spreading propaganda.  

This asshole accuses people of being ignorant while literally spreading ignorance and disinformation every step of the way.

This asshole literally accuses everyone they come across of _exactly what they themselves are actively doing_.

How shit like this continues to exist blows my mind.
