Do you not think this could possibly blow back on leftists as well? The precedent has been set and a new war on domestic terror bill is in the works.

 Any group expressing sentiments that the state deems dangerous to itself can and will be labeled as terrorists. So all the far lefties calling for a communist revolution will be gone, BLM people who had been calling for a revolutionary uprising all summer will be gone. Anarchists calling for a stateless society will be gone.

At the moment these groups don't pose a real threat to the status quo, BLM especially has been useful to the democrats, but a time may come when these groups are no longer useful or are seen as posing a legitimate threat (think another Occupy Wallstreet type of movement only effective) and this same power will be used to censor and persecute them as well.

There's a really good reason why the public needs freedom of speech. It is the single most important tool against tyranny. Thinking that this will only be used against your political opponents is extremely short sighted and ignorant of history.
