My take, and I'm not saying this is right just how I saw it, the first guy that was killed by the reaper looking demon was killed in the same way as the wife at the end so I assumed it was her who had killed him.

After the final segment I took those two mens story to be that they were taking revenge for the guy who got stuck in the motel room's daughter being murdered.

Either by the husband or both the husband and the wife, the guy killed by the reaper demon in the beginning whispers something to the wife before he chokes her to death with the towel. That's a nasty way to kill someone and it suggested to me that both the husband and the wife were involved in the little girls murder.


I think that because the reaper demons didn't come after them until they had killed the couples daughter that she was innocent, that they were being punished for killing her not her parents.

Because of this and because they were murdered by the little girls father, his punishment was to be locked into the motel room with her but only see fleeting glimpses of her and never be able to catch up to her or hold her.
We can see how quickly that torment starts to effect him and how much pain it causes him.

I don't have any explanation about the loop on the highway that they can't escape, but the characters have no idea what's happening either, again my assumption is they have been living in that post apocalyptic world for a while but that was as new and fucked up to them as it was to anyone watching.

Someone else who replied to my post about this said they liked how the world hadn't turned into an indiscriminate hell devouring souls all over the place that there seemed to be some rules. And I think this stands up well, both the band and the business man seem to be normal and unaware of any strangeness at the start of their segments, and I'm unsure why some seem unconcerned while others are having a harder time.
