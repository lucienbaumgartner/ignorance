He isn’t gaslighting you. Gaslighting is making you question reality and the things that have happened around you. Nothing about what he’s doing fits the definition of gaslighting. 

That said, he was wrong to leave the door unlocked for hours while you were asleep and unaware, and he’s being a jerk for trying to equate it to other situations that really aren’t the same. He’s also a jerk for continually losing his keys and refusing to use a key ring to fix the problem. He left you in an unsafe position, and he should be apologizing and changing the way he handles his keys moving forward.
