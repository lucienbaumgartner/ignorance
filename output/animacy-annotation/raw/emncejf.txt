The thumbnail is idiotic and ignorant. That is not what free speech means.  Have any of you read the bill of rights. It is easy. It’s right at the beginning. 

Free speech means nothing in the private sector.  You guys love to call out laws you don’t understand. And you love free enterprise. This is a business making decisions on how to survive. You lunatics are so far in the minority you can’t see reason. 

You free-market folks should like the idea of a business conforming to popular demand and changing their business model. You all don’t understand you are in the minority.
