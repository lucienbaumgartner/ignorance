I see very few people in this thread arguing to prioritize the athletes over the general health of the population.

What people are saying is to not be a dismissive dick about the level of effort they put in/how this will be many of these competitors' last and only chance when taking the stance that the olympics should be cancelled this year. 

Saying "they can run fast next time" comes across as incredibly dismissive and ignorant of these athletes' life's work. Showing some basic respect to them is not mutually exclusive with arguing the Olympics should be canceled.
