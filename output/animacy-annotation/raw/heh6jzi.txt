Well he's not on a ventilator, his vitals are probably pretty normal, he's not dying in the hospital, unconscious and unaware of what's happening around him, so yeah I think it's saving his life. 

You would say an airbag didn't save someone's life if they're in the hospital better off than they would have been without an airbag deploying in a car accident.
