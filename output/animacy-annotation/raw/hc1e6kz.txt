The way I see it there are several problems that just keep adding up:

1. It feels like her lore is a bit too similar to Sona. Seraphines kit was already seen as too similar given that they are both music champions, but then her lore comes around and she is another floating, musical empath that tries to unite her people with the power of music.
2. Her lore feels like it misses its biggest potential by ignoring the fact that Seraphine can hear the brackern, her original lore portrayed that as a big deal only for it to suddenly shift into a "lets unite Piltover and Zaun"-story all of a sudden. The updated version fixed this, but it still feels like a missed opportunity.
3. In general it feels like her lore is a bit bland. She wants to unite the 2 cities and thus sings songs about it and that is about it. She doesn't seem to struggle with anything really and I don't think that her songs will really bring about a big change in the conflict. It might inspire people to take a more active role in the future, but that doesn't make Seraphines own lore more interesting. 
4. She comes off as painfully naive and unaware of the big social and political problems of the relationship between the 2 cities.

Personally I would have made her lore about the problems with the modern showbusiness and money. Make it so that her parents gathered a huge debt by moving to Piltover and then making Seraphines headphones and they are essentially now relying on Seraphine making a ton of money with her songs or otherwise they'll have to move back to Zaun (or might get killed by their loan shark). In this case Seraphine would struggle between doing what is right and what would help her make money for her parents. Or really you could cut the money part and just have her struggle to become the biggest star in PnZ to spread her message of peace between the cities instead of just having her start there.
