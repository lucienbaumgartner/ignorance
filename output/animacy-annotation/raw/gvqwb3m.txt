Yeah you're right, but the sad thing is that i was so immersed with the fight, i was 100% in it, then out of nowhere the creators decided to add boring flashbacks and a Naruto that is charging his rasen-shuriken for 5 minutes.. I mean really the end of the battle didn t feel natural at all, that awesome ninja that mocked Hidan for not being able to make the difference betwen the real and the clone got caught off guard because of the clones.. also rasen shuriken takes quite some time to charge, why was Kakuzo just watching Naruto..
So this is how Naruto vs Kakuzo was for me :
K : Omg he s charging some incredible technique, i can't be hit by that. 
N : fails
K : Ok, his team helped him, oh look he s charging that again, this time I surely won t be hit.
K - get s hit.
 So why didn t he try to stop Naruto while he was charging rasen shurkien, and no it can t be because he was aware of the others, he could just send one of his hands or spit some fire on Naruto. He also attacked Naruto second time completely reckless and unaware of the others, he was way clever than that, even Shikamaru said a few episodes back that he is clever and he won't make a move without knowing what is facing. 
 Also how could Naruto make a rasen shuriken mid air and how tf did Kakuzo didn t manage to avoid that hit when he was 1/1 at speed wih Kakashi.. came from behind? No, it was a raging kid with a extremely loud technique, it would have been easy task for him to avoid that.
 At the end i want to say that I am way to involved in this, but hey that s the way I am, when something is pissing me off, I get very "personal". Naruto vs Kakuzo is the worst fight in the while anime, and i haven't seen it all, but I already know that.
P.S: I love the series so far, maybe this is even why i'm getting so involved in it :3
Also sry for the bad English, not a native speaker.
