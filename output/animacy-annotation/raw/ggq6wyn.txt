That is actually the worst part about it. The criminal assumes you have a lot because Zillow says your house is worth $700k and you for sure bought a ledger. You had a couple hundred grand in crypto but you sold out at 20k. Now you have none. The criminal won’t like that answer. What if it’s the truth? What if you reveal your wallet and they’re convince you have another password to open the real wallet. Now you have someone increasing the level of discomfort until you break or until they’re satisfied that you’re telling the truth. If you don’t think there are ruthless criminals out there doing far worse for far less potential gain, you’re sheltered and unaware of the dangers in the world around you. It is totally legitimate to be concerned for ones safety over this. It isn’t like a normal company leak. It’s a leak that tells bad guys where what they perceive to be poorly guarded ATMs inside people’s homes are located. They feel like they know there is an atm inside, they just don’t know how much is in it.
