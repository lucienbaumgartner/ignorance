You swear like a sailor, probably because you think it somehow emphasizes your point, you use crude insults, you're immature and arrogant. 

I'm not going to bother about your next point, you contradict yourself the NEXT sentence.

Lmao, you're literally a middle schooler, other people may be more stupid and unaware of it... But that's kinda the way it goes for kids your age, just about everyone was stupid and unaware, you call people retards, I think that's incredibly stupid, and from the way you try to deflect criticism, you seem to be ignorant of *that* stupidity.

No, I haven't used the slur "retard" since I was about your age, I realized it was immature and wrong to use it, just like using a gay slur, or a racial slur, I haven't used slurs for a long time, it's something I'm proud of.

So, as I said, with your use of a slur to describe people you hate, with your flagrant use of swearing in just about every other sentence, you don't have any room to talk about people being immature.

Edit: also, with everything you say you hate, I'm pretty sure you have zero social skills, hell, I'm sure you're in the negatives at this point.
