The deal that brokered the US withdrawal was signed in early 2020 (February I think), with the withdrawal starting a month or so later and ending in May 2021 (we missed the deadline, it only finished in early July). Biden made the decision to not undo that deal, but he didn't start the withdrawal at all.

The people in these comments saying Trump wanted to stay in Afghanistan and Biden pulled us out are frankly delusional and ignorant of very recent history.

Getting us the fuck out of Afghanistan and Operation Warp Speed (that got us vaccines much faster) are probably the two major achievements of his administration.
