1) how do i explain blah blah?  I don't.  I'm telling you the facts of my experience.  I couldn't care less if you believe them.
2) no one has seen it.  Like those 2 new organs in the body?  Can your feeble mind not see how that correlary is set up and executed?
3) You have said that you hear countless stories.  "Literally everyday" your words, not mine.  But they somehow are all fabricated?  "Literally everyday"?  And "they all sound like mine"?  And yet you somehow think I'm the incorrect one?  Is the wad of old gum you call a mind incapable of seeing how arrogant and ignorant that mindset is?
4) "proven you wrong multiple times"?  Damn.  "Bro, trust me" on this, if you think you've proven anything in all of this, your dumber than your parents think.  And that's pretty dumb.
