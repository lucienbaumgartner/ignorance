I relate to you! I think it's important to tell yourself that our life experiences are different from those in the US, so it's normal to have different values and worldviews. I found it easier to cope by educating myself on American values, but not necessarily actively adapting them- It's the awareness of the social issues and understanding of the values that make you woke, as opposed to being ignorant and unaware of the issues completely. But in the end, these issues are not my fight and I don't think I need to feel obligated to actively join in.

For example, growing up in and around the East, there was more than enough representation of POC. I did not grow up feeling underrepresented or discriminated against. My fellow American and Canadian peers are fighting for more east/south/SE Asian representation, and I understand it's very important in the Western context, but the fact is that I am not American so I can't feel as strongly about it. I will support and celebrate achievements like POC winning an Oscar, but I don't need to force myself to actively join protests or write Facebook posts on social issues with American POCs who have had a very different upbringing from me.
