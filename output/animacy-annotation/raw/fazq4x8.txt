Usually I'm a lurker. Death has taken best friends from me. Ones I've loved have taken from me, abused me, made me feel horrible about being who I am and the body I live in. I live far away from my family, and they are dying as well.


My best friend betrayed me yesterday by sexually abusing someone I loved with everything I've ever had.


 I've been homeless, watched my mother struggle with depression while dealing with my own as a teen. I was raised by television, alone and ignorant that it wasn't the norm. But I'm still happy and capable of happiness. But the hurt keeps piling on. On and on.


I try my best to respect others and myself. To not let thoughts crush me every day. But it's too much. After 4 solid years of being happy I almost let it all slip away again. I wanted to leave this world. I had resolved to.


I really don't know how much more I can take. My struggle is to stand up every day, but I'm still fighting.
