This also raises one of the many hypocrisies of the fundie belief systems.  JB and Meech’s generation breeds like (and with the same consideration as) rabbits, to the point their female spawn take on all of the parents’ parenting obligations.  As soon as possible, the slave children are expected to marry and reproduce SO LONG AS they continue to support their parents.  Duggars:  the children are expected to film the reality show without compensation.  Caldwells:  Kendra and Joe provide housing for the ever expanding Caldwell family.  At the same time, the popular SOTDRT fails to not only provide marketable job skills but also keeps the children ignorant and dependent.  If the JB/Meech generation truly cared about creating an army of Christian soldiers, they would support the younger, more fertile generation, not suck resources away from them.  The Big Fundie Con guarantees generational poverty.  That’s why for most (other than Duggars and Bates, who else has TV shows?) it won’t last more than a few generations.
