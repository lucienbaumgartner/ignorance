That statement just indicates how stupid and unaware of business she is and that she hasn't seen all of the patients on the show. There were a number of people who weren't train wrecks. They had eating issues, but they weren't terrible people - Nikki, Chad, Tara, and Milla come to mind. Having an imperfect life does not make you a train wreck.

No business is going to send a rejection letter that says "You aren't enough of a train wreck for the show."  They'll just say, "We're sorry, but we were unable to select you for the program. Good luck in your weight loss journey." 

AL &amp; FB forget that their viewers have lives, jobs, and educations. They can't just spout BS and not expect someone to call them on it.
