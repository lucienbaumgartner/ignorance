I already told you that I watched them but don't prefer them over films made for adults. I really don't get why that's such an issue for you. I doubt you're watching a lot of pre-school content, right? There's value in that content for kids of a certain age. They learn valuable skills and can be highly entertained by the right show, but that doesn't mean that, I as an adult, want to watch Blues Clues or other shows like that as often as I watch HBO's Sunday night programming. Does that make me dismissive and ignorant of the entire pre-school kids content slate?
