Honestly, you sound unaware and apolitical. Admittedly, I'm a leftist who studied political science before not using my degree and working at a large financial institution. I know mouth breathers on both sides, political alignment doesn't determine intelligence. You have to be intellectually dishonest with these comments here. Birtherism, pizzagate, q anon, and the icing on the cake Donald Trump is religious and a good Christian... Totally rational logical stuff here.
