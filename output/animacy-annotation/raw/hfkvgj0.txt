Fascism and libertarianism share zero principles. Again, I’m not reading anything else you have to say because even comparing fascism and libertarianism once reveals you to be an ignorant moron, but to repeatedly insist the obviously moronic conflation is valid reveals you to be so grossly misinformed and ignorant that to even spend seconds reading whatever other nonsense you have to say would be a complete waste of time. You don’t know what you’re talking about, you don’t understand economics, you don’t understand politics, you believe in conspiratorial nonsense. You are a moron.
