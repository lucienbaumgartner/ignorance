Huh? What's all this noise about not wanting to break the law? And who mentioned kids growing? No kid could even begin to attempt to do so without their mom's CC to buy seed and costly grow gear, effectively ending it before it started, ya dingus.

And thank you, kind colleague, for passing such weighty responsibility to me with such class, such respect; I can only pray to become such a dignified and qualified teacher and molder of minds as yourself. You sir, do flatter me.

Now, are we done acting like children?

If you're getting high on anything but weed or alcohol, you're breaking the law.
And nosey neighbors wouldn't call the DEA, they'd call the local shitdicks if anybody.

I genuinely don't understand your angle here. Are you against growing somniferum, or against growing somniferum INDOORS? And if you used your head for just a second, you'd realize that indoor cultivation is infinitely safer than outdoor cultivation when it comes to legality and risk-taking.

And no, the only reason YOU would grow somniferum would be for drug harvest. Believe it or not there are people who have grown it, both aware and unaware of the plant's potential, and not consumed it after the bloom was over.

You get way bent out of shape and imply that I'M the one who started this thread by referring to all possible readers of this thread as "students", when all I did was illustrate how shitty and condescending of a tone your original post has by using your very words; grow up, guy.
