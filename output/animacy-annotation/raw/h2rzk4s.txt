In a societal context, both publicly and privately, Iâ€™m all for the changing of names, prefixes and the use of hormones and other medical treatments to achieve sex changes and expressions. A man who wishes to be a women should be permitted to do so and referred to as they wish to be referred to. 

What I am not for is blatant revisionism and the denial of objective and scrutinised science in the most blatant and ignorant of ways. You can change your appearance and the inner workings of your body. You cannot change the fundamental differences between the genders that are expressed genetically on a chromosomal level. Men and women are not born the same and they do not develop the same. There is zero percent chance of women being able to successfully compete against trans-women. If we continue to permit this foolish exercise in political correctness we will see the complete eradication of female sports in favour of pseudo-female sports full of reassigned men passing off under the guise of women in a physician context. Men are stronger than women, there is no comparison. A man who swaps to a women has physical features that cannot be replicated without excessive abuse of male hormones. This is just anti-science.
