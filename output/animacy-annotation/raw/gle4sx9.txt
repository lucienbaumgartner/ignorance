Can you imagine? First responders are working day in and day out bc of COVID. In addition, they are now helping deliver vaccines! And this lady is so privileged that she needs her own personal body guard bc her trash can was turned over?? How to people like this become so selfish and unaware of how this kinda call can literally make it so that other people who are dying don't get needed help. I'm at a loss in understanding...
