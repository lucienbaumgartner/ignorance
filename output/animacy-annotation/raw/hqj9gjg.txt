Hi, I REALLY am sorry if this question is coming off as super ignorant and insensitive. But I’ve lived in SE Asia all my life and I only remember ever talking to 2 black people in my life but 1 of them was from my college and was from Africa and had more of a British accent and the other was from England.

Can someone please explain to me how Tammy’s accent is more black than it is “country”? 

IM SO SORRY IF THIS QUESTION SOUNDS SO STUPID.
