If I’m understanding the “white lens” concept correctly, the whole point is that it provides a perspective through which relatively disengaged white people can become engaged in the conflict and underlying issues of the film. 

If that’s the case, then wouldn’t Olsen’s character serve that role perfectly? The relatively disengaged audience member identifies with her initially (because she’s also relatively disengaged and ignorant of life on Wind River Reserve) and then we’re brought along for the ride as she learns more and gradually becomes more engaged throughout the movie. 

Like you, I’m a little leery of this concept to begin with. But I think Olsen fits the bill of the “white lens” perfectly.
