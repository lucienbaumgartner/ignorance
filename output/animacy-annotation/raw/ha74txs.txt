NTA. This is a very painful experience and reminds me of that incident in the news where an asian mother was caught pulling her kids out of the room after they wandered in while her husband was live-streaming on national TV. Everyone thought she was the nanny. 

Everything you said is valid. The real blame in on your neighbors and your nanny was probably too privileged and unaware of this sort of racism to realize the harm. Maybe she didnâ€™t want people to know she was a nanny either? It sucks she lost a job and I do think that you should have discussed with your husband before making a decision that affects both of you (the child care) but I think ultimately she would have had to go. She was not a good fit for the situation.
