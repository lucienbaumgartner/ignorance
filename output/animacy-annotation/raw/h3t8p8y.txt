Don't bother m8, you're talking with mostly hardstuck gold console players who are completely delusional and ignorant of the topic. Some of these guys think mouse gets aim assist because they've had aim assist their entire life, and despite being hardstuck gold think they're actually skilled and knowledgeable.

You are completely correct, by the way, what you've said is common knowledge among upper skill levels. 

Controllers have so much aim assist that they will beat MKB in CQC even at the highest levels of gameplay, and because it's computer assisted, controller players will have significantly more consistency than even the most elite KBM players ever could maintain. KBM &gt; Controller is always true, except in the case of aim assist. And aim assist is Apex is really high, despite what the hardstuck gold players will tell you, because they can't hit shit even with it, lmao.
