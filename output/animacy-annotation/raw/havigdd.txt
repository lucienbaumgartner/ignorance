Well I'm pretty sure that after the next round of quarantine this particular taboo will be downgraded just like most of the others. And probably the fact that incest has a much closer to home obstacle because doing all the quarantine porn binging is kind of been given a hall pass as far as appropriateness but if all that porn binging is being used on possible leering and preying upon unaware and non-consenting family members, it's going to be the last wall to fall down. Yeah to remember everybody is going to think of the worst possible agenda worst possible intentions when they hear the word incest it causes a knee-jerk reaction and has been and negative stereotype for the South..
Ironically the truth of it is that they had to repopulate the south after the civil war the noise was replenished with fresh immigrants and no wrecked cities that needed reconstructing. But it's funny that nobody cast the same judgment on immigrants from Sicily because I look at old family photos from Ellis Island and everybody looked like a clone and I could Little John Gotti in short pants adult John Gotti and even a grandmother dressed in black John Gotti look alike. That was because they lost so many men to vendetta's they were in the same position as the Deep South and every village in Sicily everybody was basically cousins. Rudy Giuliani was married to his second cousin nobody gave him a hard time but Jerry Lee Lewis was raked over the coals
