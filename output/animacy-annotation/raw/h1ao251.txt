You literally called people on this sub anti-semetic because they follow Jordan Peterson, that is extremely gross and ignorant of you. You aren't creating any safe space either by calling people anti Semitic, racist, or nazis with nothing supporting your claim, and others in this specific post have not done so and even if they did it is not tolerated in this community at all. Jordan Peterson has openly spoken against nazism as well and contributed to organizations that have sought to educate those on the holocaust and honor their memory so please tell me how he's a "nazi" specifically?

I didn't compare crt to eugenics, you argued that it was something "widely accepted across academic institutions" my argument was specifically in regards to that statement trying to justify crt and other theories.

You continue to ignore all my questions and arguments as well, if you would like to continue making a fool out of yourself here and acting with malicious intent thats on you.
