This is a very disingenuous take.

The person you are debating with is simply saying that bipartisan support ensures the safety of the bill going forward.

And as far as:

&gt;Republicans act like a mob and block absolutely any proposal and then want to blame Democrats for it.

Both parties block bills they politically disagree with. I personally am more on board with a lot of Democrat bills but I am not blind to them covering them with wishlists. Nor am I blind to them attaempting to block any Republican bill they dislike.

You seem to be heavily biased and unaware of it.
