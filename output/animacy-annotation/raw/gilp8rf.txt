You're very welcome.  And I don't know the answer.  In my opinion, members of the Senate or Congress who are attempting to excuse away an attempted violent coup of the US government, shouldn't be working in that same government.  But to-date, trump cultists haven't been held accountable for their behavior...and I don't know if that will change substantially with the Biden administration or now that the Democrats hold all 3 branches.  I'd imagine that they're going to push for the real ring-leaders like Hawley and Cruz to be removed...and for the others to be censured...but truly I don't know what they'll do.

And I've been seeing on the news today that the Dems have started calling for Congressional investigations...and that phone call will be part of that.  What comes out of that is hard to say.  Its already amazing to me that trump hasn't been indicted multiple times for the crimes he's already committed.  Campaign finance fraud, tax fraud, collusion with multiple foreign governments, grifting from Covid funds, grifting from his own inauguration funds, etc etc.  So who knows.

But if America fails to openly investigate, try and indict this President and fails to put laws in place ensuring that this can't happen again, the next fascist criminal that comes along will be the end of this country.  We already know that there is a massive contingent of Americans that are so incredibly gullible and ignorant that they'll be fine going along with a fascist as long as that fascist hates the same people they do.
