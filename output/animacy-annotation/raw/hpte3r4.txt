There's never been a vaccine that is 100% effective. 
Vaccines, in the case of covid, are the difference between being sick for a couple weeks and dying alone in an ICU on a ventilator. Vaccines, in the case of covid, mean you shed less if you do get a breakthrough infection, making you less likely to get someone else sick. Vaccines, in the case of covid, protect those who are unable to be vaccinated *because* you're less likely to shed virus. 

You sound paranoid and ignorant and it's just... sad.
