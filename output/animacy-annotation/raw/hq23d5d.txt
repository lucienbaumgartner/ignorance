Not very smart. 

You understand glasses are step one, step 2 is contacts and step 3 is brain implants. 

Tech is iterative, and I’d bet one the company with tons of cash and expertise in the area. 

But hey, let emotions guide you; that always works out. 

Also it’s hypocritical,  let’s use Tesla as an example. They kill and impoverished more people than fb every will from the precious metals needed. Facebook lets advertisers show ads to people based on input information in an effort to show them relevant ads. 

Which one is worse. 

If your talking about how fb fuels idiots, we’ll sorry to burst your bubble but that’s any social platform, because humans are ignorant and narcissistic. 

Get rid of fb and you’d just have Reddit, Twitter, tiktok, in the headlines. The same shift happens in all platforms fb is just the biggest. 

It feels like no one remembers a decade ago when the only ads you’d see would be weight loss and get rich schemes. I guess you all want irrelevant ads because you think your privacy matters to a computer algorithm.
