Jesus man are you capable of listening. So you're saying that because a minority of people that are selfish and ignorant, that pay taxes, have the right to do as they wish and put all the rest of us at risk because their decisions are causing the hospitals to be overwhelmed and unable to help others. So you understand the sheer stupidity of your red hearing arguments?
