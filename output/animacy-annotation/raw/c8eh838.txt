The book locked below the Citadel in the vault is:

## *The Death of Dragons* aka *Blood and Fire* (unknown author)

&gt;And of course there was even less chance of his coming on the fragmentary, anonymous, blood-soaked tome sometimes called *Blood and Fire* and sometimes *The Death of Dragons*, the only surviving copy of which was supposedly hidden away in a locked vault beneath the Citadel.

The book Sam found at Castle Black is:

## *Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons* by Maester Thomax

&gt;The book appeared undamaged. Maester Thomaxâ€™s *Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons* had not been so fortunate. It had come open as it fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks.

**THEY ARE DIFFERENT BOOKS.** The confusion arises because "Death of Dragons" appears in the lengthy subtitle of *Dragonkin*. Tyrion notes that *The Death of Dragons* has only one surviving copy and no known author. Some think Tyrion is simply mistaken and unaware that Maester Thomax is the author. I find this exceedingly unlikely since Tyrion is a very knowledgeable character and more importantly because he actually mentions Maester Thomax by name and is therefore likely aware of his works:

&gt;When the Halfmaester appeared on deck, yawning, the dwarf was writing down what he recalled concerning the mating habits of dragons, on which subject Barth, Munkun, and **Thomax** held markedly divergent views.
