You are shaving your head even though you aren't bald because you don't like having hair, then go on to say "just be who your body wants you to be". Pretty sure your body doesn't want you bald, eh?

More seriously, just because your "body wants something", doesn't mean your brain is agreeing with it. Your advice is akin to saying "just be happy" to someone suffering from depression.

Everytime someone balding who isn't instantly shaving their hair is posted on Reddit, we have comment like yours everywhere, I'm starting to believe we have a lot of balding dudes pushing a message on this website.

Body image issues are extremely complicated, if it was that easy we would know. And contrarily to what this *wonderful* place tends to say, it's not just societal pressure, social media and people wanting to look good for the approval of others, it very often is about self-worth and self-esteem.  
And sometimes, more than you'd think, the solution is to fix what's bothering you, with hair pieces, implants, surgery, medication...etc 

Why wouldn't you if it's possible? Living life miserably to make a point is not an achievement, and making people feel bad for going this way is simply terrible for their mental health.  
We have solutions, using them is not a shame. 

That's before we even get into serious issues like body dysmorphia who is absolutely terrible and can damage, both psychologically and physically, even people who are conventionally very attractive.

And finally, we have gender dysphoria who is in a league of its own I'd say. Don't say to a transgender person that they should just "be who their body wants them to be", it would be very offensive and ignorant of the struggle they are going through. 

This is backed up by the fact that in many countries, like France (mine), cosmetic surgery can be entirely covered financially speaking if they are deemed to be psychologically damaging to you.  
That's the case for everything related to my gender dysphoria, and I have a friend who had terrible psychological issues with her small breasts and had the opportunity to get surgery entirely covered.  

You might think those are very different than balding issues, and yes they are more complex issues, but the point is that whenever someones feels bad about their body in any way, we have armchair experts either going "just go to therapy" or "just accept who you are", when the best solutions in these situations are very often the simplest : change what's bothering you.

This is a long comment, but this is subject I take at heart and it pains me to see this backward mentality everywhere on Reddit, as if any procedure or method to make your body looks more like you want it too was ridiculous.
