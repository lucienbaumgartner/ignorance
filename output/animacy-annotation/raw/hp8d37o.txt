USA. Tourists from there are always so loud and ignorant. And seem not very open minded people because they think they're the greatest. Of course not all of them I think. But at least the ones I got to know

But they have very beautiful landscapes. On the other hand so. Many. Guns. And. Murders
So no thanks
