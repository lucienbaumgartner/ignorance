&gt; Just that rationing will not satisfy everyone's needs.


If you’re talking about the market form of rationing, yes. Since it’s only determining factor is an ability to pay. Other, *rational* forms distribute according to need. 


&gt; Many government interventions in market are done with good intentions, but they produce the counter-effect, opposite of what government intended. 


No. 


&gt; For example, the government controls prices by thinking that this will allow more people to buy goods, and on contrary, the supply of products will decrease due to price controls.


But they don’t, actually. And a supply of goods is not the same as delivering those goods, or those goods being consumed to satisfy some gymn need. Under public rationing, the number of goods fluctuates according to the number of items needed to be produced. With science, past production and consumption records, and polls and survey data, we do not need to begin each production cycle as if blind and ignorant. That is the irrationality of capitalism, the anarchy of production, which drives crises of overproduction.
