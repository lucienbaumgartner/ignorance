Re: Statement of Solidarity with Black Lives Matter 

Dear UCLA Students,


I am writing to you all to express my support to the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I want to apologize to the Black community for not knowing better on how to be an ally to my Black community members. I am actively trying to learn more on how to continue supporting the Black community. I plan to schedule a meeting with Black student leaders in our community to have a conversation and continue to learn from them."]

I also want to publicly apologize to any individual that I harmed with my tweets from five years ago. I was ignorant, unaware, and irresponsible. However, I want to reflect that I am willing to learn more from my mistakes. I want to understand better. I really do want to see change in our community, and I want to know how to be a better ally. This situation has helped me understand that I need to be more active with the Black community. If I have failed any of you, I am sorry. I will let my actions in the future speak for the commitment I have to the Black Lives Matter Movement. 

I want you all to know, I am here to talk, I am here to learn, and I am here to help. 

In solidarity and support, 

Moises Hernandez"]
