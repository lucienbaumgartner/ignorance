north americans are fat and ignorant of a lot, true. That is a big generalization though, there are plenty who are not. You can say this about most countries. The big issue is that the US largely exports media, not imports, so the outside knows a lot more about the culture and little trickles back in. Its an island. Its also a massive place, a continent just about so you could never leave the place and still not run out of travel destinations. Still not cool to be an obese pandemic and closeminded, but it makes sense.

That being said, the country was incredibly free less than 100 years ago. Much of that has erroded away via political bloat, patriot act bs, perpetual war graft, corporate regulatory capture, debasing of currency, stalemate duopoly political parties, etc.

Its still incredible free compared to most overall. Freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms and protect your family and keep tyranical dictates at check, mostly free entry into the marketplace where the little people have a real chance of moving up, etc (so long you stay out of heavily regulated and red tape sectors like healthcare, etc). The ability to inovate is still there. The concept of freedom is still there, and that should be cherished, not dismissed.

Without freedom, we are all Australia now.
