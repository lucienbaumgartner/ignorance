I mean you're taking a few liberties here. If you're talking about the comment from answers.ea by EA_Barry they were very careful in their language to not commit to a hard date. I called it "non-committal language." So it's not contradictory really, it's more a politicians answer than anything else. I get people are frustrated, I get it's annoying and making playing EASHL on PS4 a chore. But I don't think they are unaware and unwilling to work on it. They have addressed they are working on it pretty frequently since launch. 

Call in to question their competence, sure. Call into question their skill or anything else. But come on, you are acting like they are being intentionally negligent.
