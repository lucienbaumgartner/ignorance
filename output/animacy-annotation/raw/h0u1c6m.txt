I have researched a lot on him, but it has been a long time ago. Frankly speaking, unless I have missed some very important bits, I highly doubt it will convince me. He was simply not an individual that I respect as a political leader and nor do I respect his approaches for his end goal. Way to servile, philosophical clouded and unaware of realpolitik.
