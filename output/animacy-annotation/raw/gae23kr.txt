First off you're responding to the wrong person. Second off you sound like a paid shill. The only words out your mouth are lies and "CCP". Is that who you work for? 

No one has asked for violence or extreme violence against protestors, you troglodyte. I made a statement, other user backed it up, and now just the original subject matter being 1984, you are literally now unironically telling us to reject what we see with our own eyes, just like a 1984 quote. 

How about portland, shill? 150 days of "peaceful protests" and the statues are destroyed including Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas, businesses destroyed, and people hospitalized for violence. Is this the peaceful people you're talking about.....

You just slander and lie to get your point across because you are a paid shill doing your job or you are actually so incredibly stupid and ignorant that you buy up the insane and obvious media lies. Which one is it buddy???
