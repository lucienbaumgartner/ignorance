I've found that very often when people make bizarre, absurd, ignorant and bigotted remarks, after people call them out on it then have a tendencey of declaring something to the extent that they're tired of explaining to people what they meant. If you had any sense of self awareness, you would realize that the problem here is more you than the people you're responding to.
