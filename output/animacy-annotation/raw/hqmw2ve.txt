&gt;Bruce was laser-focused on Superman’s threat potential, he rationalized to himself that he needed to be stopped at all costs. He’s under confirmation bias, ignoring all information that may clash with his established mindset, so tracing the letters wouldn’t really be in his radar.

That's silly. He's laser-focused on Superman's "threat potential" over an attack on a city that Superman was clearly trying to stop. The slightest bit of background check would have shown him who Clark Kent was and that he was living on a farm for thirty years. LEX LUTHOR figured it out and Bats couldn't. Which one of them is the detective again? Oh, but the plot requires Lex to know and not Bruce so that he can be ignorant and dumb and the movie can still happen.

&gt;He’s not a real person you can make a behavioral summary of

He doesn't need to be. Years of stories to inform that. And at the very least he's always depicted as smart. Not the case here.

&gt;And just because BvS doesn’t have that, it doesn’t mean it lacks any value period.

BvS lacks value because the story is dumb. Plain as.

&gt;We are talking about the same movie in the same thread.

Only one of us is still trying to make a case for it though.
