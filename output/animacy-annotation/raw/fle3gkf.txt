I 100% realize that I'm probably only feeding a troll but here's something that makes sense in the off chance that you're being genuine; When you go out of your way to correct people in the comments section of reddit you only sound pretentious and unaware that voicing your political beliefs alongside a lame-ass and unnecessary correction only detracts from how others percieve your intelligence. 

TL;DR - You're making yourself look like an idiot that is trying to appear intelligent.. but failing in the most cringe-worthy way. 

Don't get mad though, i'm only here to help you like you're here to help correct other fellow redditors.
