No thereâ€™s actually hundreds of videos from France, Germany, and the Netherlands of cops being much more violent than this in much less stressful situations. Go look at any website that hosts videos of police brutality and you might notice that half of them are from EU cops getting scared and overreacting.

And assuming you know how a crowd of teenagers will react is incredibly self possessed and ignorant of human nature. Speaking from experience, when teens see someone get arrested they get really fucking stupid, you can see multiple literally squaring up before they bring out the tasers. Should they have just stood back and acted calm so they could be assaulted by a mob as they attempt to deescalate?
