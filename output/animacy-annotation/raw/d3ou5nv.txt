The problem isn't ratatoskr or susanoo. The problem is casuals themselves have been just awful lately.

Seriously, I have never seen such an influx of terrible people. This past month in particular has been really bad. People now seem to be so selfish and unaware that more experienced players like us have to put on our ultra try hard boots in order to carry them Kicking and Screaming to Victory. Winning isn't fun anymore when your own teammates are frustrating.
