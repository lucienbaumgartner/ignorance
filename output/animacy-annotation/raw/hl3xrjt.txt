NTA NTA NTA! People can be so unaware and unsympathetic to the people who put so much effort jnto cooking and much less so for people who had to cook for big families. It's not just the cooking, it's buying groceries, preparing them, cooking them and the cleaning up after. 

I feel for you truly. It's high time that they should know how you're feeling. On top of that, you're not well and hubby's not helping - they always think they are helping by 'commenting' or 'stirring food'. And we're too exhausted to give instruction to every single thing - it's just more unnecessary thinking.

Your in laws? F them allll - all of them entitled
