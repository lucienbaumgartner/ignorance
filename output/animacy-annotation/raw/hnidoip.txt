God I really hate when people compare our conditions to slavery. It makes you look so entitled and ignorant of slavery’s actual horrors and it makes me want to puke. I fully agree that people shouldn’t have to work more than 40 hours and get paid more and management shouldn’t be awful and unempathetic and corporations shouldnt steal from us and all that but at the end of the day I get to go get a beer at my home. I can watch tv. I can sleep for 12 hours and not do shit if I want, even if that means that Ill starve. I have the freedom to die. Slaves didn’t get that right. They had none.
