I think its cause ADHD is seen as a quirky personality trait and autism is seen as being "stupid/braindead". I know people used "thats autistic" as a way to describe things that are stupid, annoying, or bad even. But ADHD is always "omg im so quirky i must have adhd".

People only see the surface of adhd. They just think being distracted and low attetion span is all there is to it. But executive disfunctions, inattentiveness, memory troubles, recklessness, mood instability etc are all parts of the ADHD that mess around with people's daily lives. But bc people are unaware and social media, TV media had made ADHD look like a quirky trait(which is equivalent to being unique and fun, so no one wants to correct it minus actually adhd havers) 

Meanwhile, Autism is "annoying" bc people with autism are seen as screeching, flapping, and incapable of normal human interactions. And especially since Autism was demonized for so long in TV media compared to ADHD(Fuck Sia). Therefore more is done to correct that negative perspective perspective by the Autism community.

Everyone thinks ADHD is positive, so no one corrects the inaccuracies. But autism had already been demonized since the beginning of time, and people are trying to reverse that.
