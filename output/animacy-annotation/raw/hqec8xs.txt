I agree, and I find it hilarious the people that are arguing with you when the name of the sub is **ANTIWORK** and the description is : A subreddit for those who want to **end work**, are curious about **ending work**, want to get the most out of a **work-free life**, want more information on **anti-work** ideas and want personal help with their own jobs/work-related struggles.

Most people in this group from what i have seen belong in this group, and its sad, they are ignorant and naive.
