I don't know if it will wash out, I don't have any experience with toners but I know that you were supposed to say something once you saw your hair was done in a wrong way. And honestly I think it is very rude and ignorant that the main hairdresser didn't say anything to you once she saw the final result to your hair because she knew that it was not what you wanted. Go there again and ask them to fix your hair for free.
