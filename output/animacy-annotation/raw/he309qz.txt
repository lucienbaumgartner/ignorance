I can deal with the blatantly racist. Easy to spot, easy to rebuke, easy to move on. At least for me. But it's those white people that are just so privileged and ignorant that are hard for me to deal with. That sub has had its issues for sure, but some people there are the worst. They dig in and refuse to ever try to self-reflect. It's like witch and pagan groups. Go into any of them and tell a white person they shouldn't do this or that because it's disrespectful or a closed practice, and they freak out.
