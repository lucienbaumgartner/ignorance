&gt;She called and spoke to her son.

But not before first calling the gf, asking her why she wasn't invited and declares she's going to come regardless. How is this outlandish behaviour considered acceptable? 

&gt;He tried to illustrate a depth of hurt and people are using it as a character attack on his mother as if it's the gospel truth.

The reasons the gf may have for not inviting the mother might be more intricate and telling. OP is hopelessly unaware and uninformed about why his gf did this, once he finds out he can figure out best how he wants to move forward. Without this critical piece of information we will not know. However, characterizing a young woman's choice to not invite her bf's mother to a party thrown by her family members as a *selfish cow* is not okay. 

&gt;people are saying it's the OPs job to support his GF even if she's wrong, even if she's being selfish and unreasonable and dissing his family. Wrong. His GF is being a selfish, narcissistic person who is not considering the needs of HIS CHILD in the long term and he doens't have to support her in that.

At some point, OP needs to cut the imaginary umbilical cord and realize that this "woman" is the **mother of his child** not his mother. So it is imperative that he takes her seriously and hears her side/reasons for doing so because for the next 18 years, they are in this together. They aren't married at this point so they need to be able co-parent successfully **she** will be raising the child with him, not his mother. So that amount of understanding and hurt he is trying to convey to us? Yeah some of it needs to be redirected towards his gf, and perhaps after he sits down and has a conversation with her like an adult, he will.

You said it yourself "she has the choice to invite or not invite the grandmother" projecting your reasons as to why you think she made that choice is not your place.
