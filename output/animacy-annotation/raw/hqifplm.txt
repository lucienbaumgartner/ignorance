I took a look at the Snowdrop search in Twitter and oh man my brain seriously cannot handle going through that again. Do the people defending Snowdrop at the behest of Jisoo understand that Jisoo is not going to come to them and give them a medal for blindly supporting her? Ppl be acting like their lives depend on defending their idols

At a certain point I really wonder who these people are and where they are in their lives to be so ignorant and insensitive. Like get a life and put all of this time and energy into improving and educating yourself instead of mindlessly simping for someone who will never, ever know - much less care about - your existence
