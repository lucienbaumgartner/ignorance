&gt;Strongly disliking an entire group of people doesnâ€™t come out of nowhere.

for sure. again, i understand your curiosity. i personally don't see a problem with the first question you asked: "Why do have so much disdain towards them?" their answer is demeaning of black men.

i'm just saying i think people downvoted since your second question "Can I ask what is your relationship like with your father and male family members?" is proposed out of the assumption that her hate is out of family trauma. to think her opinion is solely because of that is not respected because it's assumptive and ignorant of many other influences for why people form opinions. you further confirm that narrative when you commented "I take it you refer to him as the sperm donor." *yikes*.
