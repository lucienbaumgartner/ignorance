It's not so much that people are biased against those with initiative. It's more that hiring managers / HR are inundated with applications since it's become so easy to apply online (compared to the distant past when people actually mailed in paper resumes and cover letters). So it really just a response to the huge volume.

The people who are still following up are not seen as having initiative but rather as annoying and unaware of how the business/social norms have evolved. If you do this you are basically shooting yourself in the foot. It's an easy enough fix though to become clued in and stop doing it. (There is no point in complaining that things don't work the way it used to.)

Alternatively, the better approach, if available to you, is to reach out to a contact in the company through your network (friends, family, alumni, past co-workers) and have him/her/they check on the status of your application.
