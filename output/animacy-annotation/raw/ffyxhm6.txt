Ah, yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I'd rather them be unaware and liberal than unaware and conservative, but either way it's unpleasant. I find the best way is to gently guide them towards a clearer understanding of their views, because nobody likes being told that they're ignorant or wrong, you know? Sometimes, time does the trick. Other times, we end up with Ben Shapiro or the sexuality alphabet. So many people want to be a victim. Regardless of race, gender, or sexuality, too many people take up political stances solely to validate their victimhood. Good on you for trying to express it healthily(?).
