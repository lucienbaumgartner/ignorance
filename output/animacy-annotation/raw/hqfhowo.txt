Oops I deleted my comment- don't know what happened. But it was probably too long. I guess we don't agree on this one- I see pregnancy as a natural process and not requiring that every request they make be honored. I am in a job that requires travel- plenty of my pregnant coworkers have taken those opportunities and been separated from their partners for work opportunities, and a lot further than this is. Barring safety issues, I don't think anyone should be forced to change their religious or cultural beliefs to accommodate someone pregnant who has chosen to stay at their home of their own free will. And pregnant or not, I think cutting our your parents is giving your child exactly the wrong message about family. 

Look, you are entitled to your beliefs, and you can say the parents are ignorant and stubborn. Just as they are entitled to their beliefs about you. But you don't go stay at someone's house and make them convert to your beliefs with emotionally abusive ultimatums- let my boyfriend sleep in the same bed in your home or you'll never see your grandchild.
