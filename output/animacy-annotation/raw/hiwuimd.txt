Oh I agree that it's insane that Trump got elected.  Worst president so far.  The Republican party is a blight and should be stopped at all costs.

And maybe there's a decent argument to be made that the average American is all those awful things (even though Trump supporters are a minority and even though many of them are still decent people - just inexcusably ignorant).

But that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about stereotypes of American people, and those aren't commonly believed stereotypes of American people.

Americans are known for being generous, friendly, and hardworking.  Also fat, loud, and ignorant of world affairs.  But hateful?  Quick to anger?  Maybe *you* think that, but it's not a common stereotype.
