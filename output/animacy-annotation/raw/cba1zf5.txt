I think that argument is made because the mechanisms of the surveillance state, all of the really obscene big brother stuff, The Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security, the Prism spy program, Gitmo and the torturing, in fact, the whole "War ON Terror^TM" were all *created* by Bush and the Republicans as a response to 9/11.

Because of the average age of Redditors more then half of them were in middle school or younger and unaware that after 9/11/2001 a Republican congress, a Republican president and a Republican Senate acting in lock-step with the help of Rush Limbaugh and Fox news jammed all this repressive crap down the nations collective throat along with two useless wars.

At the time the main resistance to all this was all Democratic, the Republicans were "all in" with Bush. The argument against the new surveillance state was that once this stuff is created it will be near impossible to reverse.

[There was a big outcry against this in 2006 but if you read this USA today article you will see that half of all Americans thought this was a proper response to the war on terror and any politician that dared to oppose it would be labeled as "soft on Terrorism" by the Fox/Limbaugh noise machine.](http://yahoo.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-11-nsa-reax_x.htm?csp=1)

Millions of people still believe that bullshit. 

And so here we are, and its near impossible to reverse, but it was all a Republican creation.
