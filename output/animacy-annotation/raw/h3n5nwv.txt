Damn I am sorry you had to go through all that plus the trauma you endured. But you don’t gotta feel guilty those kids knew what they were doing and they lied to you. They were 12 but they weren’t stupid and unaware of what was happening. You can’t blame yourself because you didn’t force anyone to do anything. They messed with your mind though you told them you are a trauma survivor. So  as harsh as it may sound fuck them don’t give a shit and don’t feel bad. Whatever happened is now in the past and it can’t be reversed. There is no punt of feeling guilty. I know it’s difficult to forget whatever happened and I understand that it would be very dífficult to trust people after facing something like this. So my only advice is to take things slow next time, don’t jumó to doing things. Take time to know the person and don’t reveal too much about yourself. Make sure they are who they say they are and that they aren’t lying about their age. :)

Take care of yourself :)
