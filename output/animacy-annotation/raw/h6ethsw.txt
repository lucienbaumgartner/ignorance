I do understand your point about wanting to spread the information about Semen Retention , but my take on it is that all of us need to understand that not every man would do it . There will be those that are so lost and ignorant that they probably will shame it for whatever reason . As much as I would want to spread the information , understand that a lot of men would not be on the same page .
