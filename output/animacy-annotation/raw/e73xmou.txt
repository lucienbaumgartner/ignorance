Yes I did. I run a different build and don't have mana issues at all. (and I have her at level 19 so it's not like I don't play her). 

[This is the build I normally run](https://www.heroesfire.com/hots/talent-calculator/nova#kbEn) and it's pretty solid and reliable. Plenty of kills and assists, no mana issues, and can easily change momentum of late game in your team's favour if you catch players alone or unaware, and also great in teamfights.
