1. It will not get us out of lockdown because it is not intended to get us out of lockdown. This is a seizure of power and they're not letting go of that power.
2. The odds (by a Norwegian study) are 1/50,000 of an asymptomatic person infecting a vulnerable person (about 1/325 of infecting anyone). Those odds are in my favor, even assuming I were sick and unaware of it. And if I wore a mask incessantly, it wouldn't make a difference because, again, the odds are so small.
3. I prioritize freedom over this virtue signaling. Not just freedom from government tyranny, but freedom from social pressure and freedom from fear. That is the example I want to set for my children.
