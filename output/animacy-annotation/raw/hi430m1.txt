That could be possible. And I agree that because we as humans have a certain understanding of what we feel awareness is that we may project the idea that other animals are not as smart of have the capacities we do. I am basing my opinions off of different behaviors I have seen with my tarantulas as well as ones in videos. The T seladonia example I have was based on some observations from some breeding videos where if the female was not in her trap door, the male seemed completely confused and unaware of her presence even if she was on the same surface as him. Instead he would tap and continue to try and court the empty trapdoor until he eventually just hid in the femaleâ€™s trap door. The keeper had to make the female literally run into his leg for him to realize she had been there all along. Of course I think other things were at play to confuse his senses like that, but it was very interesting.
