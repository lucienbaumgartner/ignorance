This is extremely ignorant and immature. If a woman suffered from vaginismus and struggled with penetration there would be zero shame in her using a flesh light on her husband at times. 

People use strap ons during sex for all different reasons that aren’t about the size of the mans dick. This is like saying it’s emasculating for a man to use a dildo on his wife. There’s no shame in using toys to help your partner have different or better sexual experiences.
