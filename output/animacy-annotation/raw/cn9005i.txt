&gt; expect people to play the game and follow the objective like they should?

So your interpretation is the only correct way to play?

I'm not too fond of people raging mid game either, but sometimes a player is either attempting something specific like an achievement, not in the mood to wait throughout custody, or just inexperienced and unaware that being downed does not mean the end of a heist.  Whichever it was INCLUDING the final reason I listed, doesn't warrant such toxic messages like your OP.
