I don't think that man knows what he wants. He's just terrified and fighting against shadows. He's winning, sure, but that's because the world is mostly defenseless and unaware. That, and shadows aren't real, so what Putin is really fighting is innocent, working people. Yknow, people who have no interest in fighting and will mostly just keep their head down until the attack passes.

But Putin has no plan, beyond survival and maintenance of his power. Him and every other dictator, from China to the Middle East, USA to South America, is on borrowed time. They can play their game for a long time, but it always ends with them dead and their legacy pissed on for the rest of human history.

Putin, think of your family. They're going to be suffering for generations because of you. And we'll all move on without you. 

The rest of us understand that the individual is only here to enjoy life. What actually matters is beyond that, though. And these fools will never grasp that and forever be afraid and full of hate. Always waiting for assassination or removal, by whatever means. 

I'd hate to be Vladimir Putin, or any dictator. They are pitiful, weak humans.
