Ya I’ve lived in the US (all over except west coast) and Denmark (Dragør) during the refugee crisis a few years back and Danes on average are way more racist and ignorant of other cultures than your average American- the difference is they’re basically all white. 


Danes would pick up immigrants and drive them to Sweden, they actively and openly were very against hijabs and Muslim face coverings, they use the n-word like it’s nothing, you’d see bus drivers be much more rude and short with black Danes than white Danes. They hated (I forget the country) but they blame some culture for all the drugs in Christiania. They also have words and get moderately offended when people call themselves Danes if they don’t look like it. They call them second generation Danes or something in their language and it’s derogatory. 


I love Denmark and they’re nice and overall I love the country but I can’t stand how it’s put on a pedestal from the us while we shit on our own country. They do some things way better and we do other things better. The diversity of thought and culture throughout the world will always exist and the us could never be like Denmark which inherently is tiny and isolated while America is a huge melting pot
