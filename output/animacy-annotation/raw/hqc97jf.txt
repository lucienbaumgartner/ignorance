Honestly, I'm just disappointed that someone in this subreddit would say something so ignorant and spiteful.

The coronavirus pandemic is a serious global issue that has killed millions of people worldwide and harmed many more. Vaccines are a safe and effective preventative measure against the virus that is widely available at little to no cost to nearly everyone in most developed countries. The vaccine (and booster shot) greatly reduces the risk of catching COVID and *dramatically reduces* the risk of hospitalization or adverse health effects from the virus.

There is no reason to try to persuade people to not be vaccinated, and it is incredibly disappointing that so many celebrities, comedians, actors, athletes, etc. are vocally against the vaccine. Joe Rogan, Aaron Rodgers, LeBron James, Nicki Minaj--they all have huge influence over millions, if not billions, of fans, and they put real people's lives at risk by convincing people to not be vaccinated.

It's ridiculous. [This blog post by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sums up my thoughts well](https://kareem.substack.com/p/dear-lebron-heres-the-covid-19-help).

If you are not already vaccinated, I strongly urge you to go get the vaccine as soon as possible. If you want more information about the vaccines, how they are made, their effectiveness against the virus, or anything related, there are plenty of free online resources from the CDC and news outlets. Staying properly informed is imperative in today's society.
