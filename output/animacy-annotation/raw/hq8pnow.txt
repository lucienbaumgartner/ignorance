As far as information goes this sub actually almost as ignorant and anti science as the antivax side with the rose tinted glasses around the vaccines.

The vaccine is still keeping people out of hospital but it is nowhere near as effective at preventing infection and transmission as most people here believe.  There is no science that supports the possibility of herd immunity, but the sub seems to imagine that there is.  And we are really still barely keeping up with the virus, with research into boosters and new variants.

There are places in the world approaching 100% vaccination where new cases are the highest they have ever been during the pandemic.
