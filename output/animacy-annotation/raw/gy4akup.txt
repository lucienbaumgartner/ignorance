Except that isn't why restaurants are having a hard time.  The fact is they pay shit and it's harder work than what those employees have found elsewhere.   When a lot of restaurant workers were let go during the pandemic, Amazon and others were on a huge hiring spree.  Amazon pays $17 an hour, so a lot of restaurant workers don't want to go back to a $10 an hour restaurant job that was worse dealing with than Amazon or other job.

I was talking with a woman at a local restaurant and she gave that same unemployment excuse as to why they don't have enough employees.  I asked her what they were paying to start, and her reply was "We start at minimum wage".  I just looked at her as she was completely serious and unaware of why they were having problems.  Hell, the McDonald's down the street has a sign out paying $13 to start.
