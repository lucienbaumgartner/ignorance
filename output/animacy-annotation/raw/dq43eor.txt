Yes exactly. Amami's video and his presence in the prologue contradics Shuichi's audition video. Amami *knows* his own name in the prologue and it's the same as during the killing game, and why would he strip himself of his own memory of Danganronpa 52, change his clothing, abandon his talent and remain completely unaware and calm when he supposedly ended up in another killing game in perhaps the same location.

As for Monokuma, he either didn't know what Tsumugi did until Shuichi found out in the final case, or he is under such a tight contract by TDR that he has to cooperate with "Junko Enoshima" or he just didn't want to lose his job so he fabricated Rantaro's death to keep the killing game going.
