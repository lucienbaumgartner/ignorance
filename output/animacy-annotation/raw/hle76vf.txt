This is a brilliant idea and one that alludes to basic necessities that people must know to be educated and functioning members of society. However, those in power don’t want to rule over an educated society. Our education system isn’t designed to produce well-rounded, thoughtful, knowledgeable students. It’s designed to keep people average that don’t know much about how anything works. Capitalism thrives when people are unaware and oblivious. Our shitty political overlords thrive when their constituents are dumb and distracted. 

This is exactly why we aren’t taught life’s basic necessities and instead we’re told to regurgitate names/dates for the test, forget everything until the next test, and graduate. Critical thinking has all but phased out of the modern curriculum. 

The Republican long-term plan to fuck with education has been terrifyingly effective in dividing society and fracturing people into dumber, angrier subgroups.
