Religion isn't necessarily fake in the way you're describing and I don't suspect most prophets or religious figures were out to tell lies. They were just very ignorant and very wrong.

First, I think religion has been a natural part of intellectual evolution. It stems from questions humans asked before we had the necessary intellectual and technological tools to discern ideas that are probably true from ideas that probably aren't. Yes, religion has been used to control the masses in some ways, but I honestly don't think that's the origin of primary reason for religion. Mostly it's just our ignorant first attempts to explain the unknown.

Second, I don't think we truly know what prophets or religious figures actually said. There's no reason to believe that most religious holy texts were written by the specific prophet or religious figure they are credited to be from. More likely, for very old religions, there were rote stories passed on for countless generations until someone was able to write them down as best as they could remember the stories being told to them. Have you ever played the telephone game? Not a good way to reliably pass on information. It doesn't mean they were dishonest, just ignorant.

Some authors like Paul in the Christian new testament may well have authored their writings with complete sincerity, but Paul's convictions, however sincere, do not give us reason to believe Jesus actually intervened with him on the road to Damascus. If we take all such claims at face value without evidence, then we would have to believe all manner of insanity.

So, I'd say that religion isn't necessarily fake, as in a lying conspiracy, but it is fake, as in it's claims about the supernatural and the nature of the universe are almost certainly not true (some more certainly than others).
