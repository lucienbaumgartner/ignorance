I learned to deal with this by approaching things differently:

1 - figure out how much time and effort each individual chore costs. Like hanging laundry takes about 10 minutes for me, vacuuming the house takes [X] mintues etc.

2 - consider the things that make you happy and the things that don't. E.g. it makes me grumpy if I need to clean my kitchen or do the dishes in order to even be able to make proper breakfast. I like a slow start of the day with easy serotonine boosts (coffee and yummy breakfast)

3 - figure out your energy span; I can do certain things weekly, others daily, but after 13 days of doing things, I need a day of not doing and just being a lazy bum.

4 - do the chores that make future you happy/proud of today you and balance them out over your energy span.

5 - routine created with regular intervals of rest and activity. Burn out and guilt avoided.

I gave myself a hard time by trying to follow some sort of norm. Turns out, there is no norm and everybody struggles (sometimes), we just love thinking we're not living up to someone's standards while those standards are often an illusion or down right unhealthy and ignorant of our own needs. Because I'm living on my own, I have no one to answer to about when and how I do things like my household and it's been so liberating!
