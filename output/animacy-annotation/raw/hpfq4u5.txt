AUDITORY PROCESSING ISSUES. 

Seriously. I was convinced I was going deaf but it didn't make any sense because I could still hear well. Lime I would hear the person next to me but I could hear the guy eating across the room. Turns out my brain can't always regulate my hearing focus. It also explained why I prefer subtitles whenever I watch anything. 

Time blindness is another HUGE issue for me. I'm chronically late for things and have only gotten better by using ALL THE ALARMS. 

Hyperfocus is something I still have to explain to my parents. "But how do you have ADHD, you used to sit and read all day?" Turns out not every human is immovable and unaware of their surroundings and basic needs when they read.
