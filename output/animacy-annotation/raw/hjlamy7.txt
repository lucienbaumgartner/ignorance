Yeeet there is no private ownership. There collective ownership. The primary definition of socialism is the community ownership of the means of production. Only a more stringent one is what you are describing.

One of the main sources of issues with capitalism is it's autocratic nature, i.e. Concentrating power in the hands of few.  Market socialism definitively does remedy this.

As I said it is well known that it's considered a lesser socialism, but you're a black-and-white thinking here is just incredibly stupid Needlessly reductive and ignorant of reality
