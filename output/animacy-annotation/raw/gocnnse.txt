I really enjoy this novel, the biggest reason is due to its characters adhering to the norms of nobility. Often times you see reincarnation into villainess manga set in fantasy worlds and they are dumb and ignorant of the laws of nobility. 

The author of this novel really emphasized on these laws and you can follow the story easily as the characters will let you know at every step of the way why they do what they do based on these laws.
