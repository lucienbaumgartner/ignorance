Debra Morgan from Dexter (Dexter's sister).  

Holy hell, she was the first glaring issue I had with the show. Didn't even get through season 1.  How did she get to her position as a police officer by being so incredibly unintuitive, unaware, and inept? Killed it for me.  Not to mention the glaring contradictions within Dexter's character being a "sociopath".

Captain Cold from Flash and Legends of Tomorrow.

He is so incredibly cheesy and such an antiquated persona of a villain, it's almost cringe-worthy. Yet...  for some reason, I can't wait to see what he's gonna say next. I think it's me just wishing he would do the old, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMDmEP5QE0.
