Free market capitalism is really good at  managing a economy than state managed capitalism.  We have evidence. Cuba, USSR and pre 80's China stagnated compared to the western world.  No matter what your political leaning is you have to admit that.

But there is also another  side to capitalism.  For example say companies can provide meat at a lower price by wrecking havoc to the environment  as shown here. Most consumers are simply unaware and unconcerned about this to do anything. So they will continue to buy. That is why there is regulation. Dedicated scientist and experts looking into these things and establishing guidelines.

Simply thinking the freemarket will make the right decision here is just as naive as believing everyone will work faily in a socialist/communist society.
