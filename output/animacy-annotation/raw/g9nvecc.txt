First time posting here so apologies for any mistakes-

So I recently got 4 kittens from a coworker’s mother, who feeds a feral mama cat and who keeps giving birth at their home. She recently had one last litter and I took 4 out of 6 of them.

Originally I was only going to get 1, since I wasn’t sure how I’d take to a new cat since my last one (a very old, 18+ year black cat who loved me to pieces) passed away this year. I ended up leaving with 2, and then went back for another 2...Now, I will say the last 2 weren’t originally my idea. My mother wanted one, and then my sister did, but we didn’t want to break up any of the kittens as much as possible since they’re so young (Theyre about 2 months now). So our solution was to have the 4 and when me and my sister move to a new apartment together, we take 2 and both pairs still have play buddies.

That WAS the plan, until I quickly realized I was the only one doing any actual care for them.

Feeding, litter training, vet visits and bills, all the costs of items and toys, cleaning up after them, bathing them, and being really the only one they get affection from since no one else is home enough for the kittens to even know who they are and feel comfortable to approach. We’re set to move into a new apartment this Friday, and my mother is under the idea that she’s keeping 1 kitten and giving the other one to her ex-husband, who I may mention is an alcoholic.

Personally, I don’t trust him within an inch of my life. The alcoholism makes him neglectful and unaware of his surroundings. My mother has stated she doesn’t even like cats, but somehow felt that one calling to her. She’s also not home for days at a time, and has a young son who is incredibly impulsive and, having seen plenty interactions between them before, is not that great with them. Neither my mother nor sister have had much, if any, time dedicated to them. While my sister isn’t an issue, since she is moving with me anyway, I have hesitation with my mother and stepfather.

I feel I am rightfully apprehensive about letting the two kittens go, and not only that but be separated as well. They’ve imprinted on me, I’ve been the only one to care for them, and honestly I’m a crazy cat lady...They’re my babies. I can afford their costs, I have the time for them, and I have plenty of love to give. Am I the asshole for asking to keep all 4, despite the original plan?
