If you actually had two brain cells to rub together, which you clearly don't, you'd recognize the distinction between a journalist or other party leaking documents for altruistic reasons, and an agent of foreign governments like Assange using journalistic protections as a shield for his espionage and election interference.

Sorry you're so simple minded and ignorant that you think this is as black and white as "oh he posted the right stuff so he should go free."
