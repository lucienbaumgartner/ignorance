You're just ignorant lol. I've spelled it out for you *and* posted the source for you. If you'd taken the time to read it you would've seen that the KRM-262 can in fact one shot kill out to 33.3ft. It's highly unlikely but it's possible, and Long Barrel has 0 effect on this.

I love how you're so lazy and ignorant that the only thing you can say is "YoU mUsT bE wRonG cUz mUh aNeCdOtAl eViDeNcE sUgGeStS oThErWiSe". Keep it up.
