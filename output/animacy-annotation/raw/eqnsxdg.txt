Maybe it is not a regular flight from Konya to Reynkavik thats why idk really but it should have been handled and planned better imo. Provoking our social media mob on unaware and innocent Icelandic people  is not helping the case.  I love how politicians jump the bandwagon too now.. sending an official protest and minister going to Iceland etc. for waiting 1 hour more than usual at best.  It is becoming embarrassing. Every single time there is a little dispute , politicians and media try to escalate it and they get away with it
