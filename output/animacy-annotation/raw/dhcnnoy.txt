the Trump Russia thing that has no bearings either? We saw evidence of the debate questions and so much other worse stuff. I mean god, Clinton staffers are on record saying how they want to create "an unaware and compliant citizenry" among the other stuff that came out. How could people vote for that? but back to the thing at hand, I mean if  true evidence arises that Trump colluded with Russia -  me, a Trump supporter, will be the first to join alongside all of you in calling for proper action, but all we have is he said she said he said she said. Did Russia meddle in the election? probably (we also have meddled in what is it, 23 elections globally?) but did Trump collude with Russia to influence the election, now that in my opinion is a tall order.. I'll be raising hell if true tho, but I truly don't believe that is the case.
