I get to be represented by Pelosi (head corporate stooge and corruption enabler), Feinstein (who doesn't even know who she is these days), and Steele (a more ignorant and worthless Rep you'd be hard to find. At least she doesn't have any real power).

Reagan is certainly when I started to feel the country start slipping.
