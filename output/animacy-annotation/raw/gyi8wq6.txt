Imagine being this stupid and ignorant of science. When they say “may”, they mean they think there’s enough preliminary evidence to support further research. The fact that the sample size was so tiny, and not replicated proves that this isn’t a silver bullet.

In fact there’s more counter evidence proving that it does than there is that it doesn’t. You obviously have never taken a statistics class in your life. Keeping living at the top of the dunning-Kruger curve.
