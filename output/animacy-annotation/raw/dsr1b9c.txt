I'm not a Trump supporter - I'm socially liberal and fiscally conservative.... I did not vote in this election because both candidates scared me to death. Tax reform and immigration - just because you don't agree with them doesn't mean they have no plans. Building the wall is a plan. Gov't checks and balances are in place for a reason.

I think he's an absolute embarrassment. At the same time - all modern politics revolve around immigration, taxation, abortion, and oil - this isn't a script that the donald invented. Trump is a moderate - he's pushing what would normally be a populist tax agenda and an immigration agenda that would have more to the left of anything Pelosi would have suggested a mere 12 years ago. The ACA is a mess no matter how you look at it...... The biggest problem with Trump is that he's just so out of touch and unaware, and downright stupid. If he weren't such an idiot, he'd likely be a very popular president.
