You dont know what ur saying.One time ur comparing potato to this word abrahamic religion as a definition and than ur saying its a word.This is what u said lol ''Because it’s not about the word, it’s about the definition'' Trust me even ur imams and scholars wont be able to answer it. Because my questions nobody can answer .Nobody is asking u what is the definition of abrahamic religion.I asked you who started this word which u dont know.i cannot believe islam's satan allah worshipers are so brainwashed and ignorant that they dont know what i ask and yet they claim they know everything  lol based on a deceiful and lying scripture like quran.You believe what you heard from people who have no direct connection with god
