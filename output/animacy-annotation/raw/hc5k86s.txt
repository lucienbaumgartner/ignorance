(1 John 5:18) â€œWe know that everyone who has been born of God does not continue to sin; but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. 

 From this verse we can deduce that if you are born of God for the rest of your days you will not sin. Speaking from personal experience many Christians like myself who have accepted Jesus Christ as our lord and savior have sinned multiple times even after devoting ourselves to God. Would this not mean that we are NOT protected and that the evil one can indeed touch us? As a Christian who is skeptical and ignorant of the quality and grounding for people who perform deliverances, are there any other pieces of scripture that further prove that demons can no longer dwell in us? Or do they indeed dwell in us and do we require deliverance from our fellow brothers and sisters? 

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to take time out of their day to clear this up for me and bless your heart!
