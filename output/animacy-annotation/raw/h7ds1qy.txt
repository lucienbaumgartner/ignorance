Ok. So quick story about that phrase. It was in year 7, out of primary school and still innocent and unaware of the deeper parts of the internet. But one prank to pull on the more innocent guys was to put your index finger up, close the rest of your fingers, go up to a girl and say "come here" whilst beckoning with your finger. You then say "I made you come here with one finger, imagine if I did it with two". My friend did that and the girl who he said that to slapped him. He had no idea what had happened and had no idea what he had said.
