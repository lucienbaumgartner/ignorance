I was following r/bitcoin for a couple of days and had to unfollow cause my feed turned into this triggering stream of dumbest posts I've ever seen. Likes of people who refuse to understand how calculator works, everybody repeating how 'bitcoin is for everyone' and 'just hodl forever'. I  have a feeling they are not deliberately evil there, just painfully dumb and naive, so kind of unintentionally trollish and unaware of consequences of their actions, though there are MLM level of depraved among them. Lots are a bit retarded and expecting to get rich of their 1000 buck investment at 60K BTC, and get scared of fluctuations very easily. I wonder if they even know how to cash out, like what is their exit strategy, though maybe you don't need one if you are planing to never sell
