I'm legitimately curious -- how do conservative voters resolve this evil?  Are they so incurious and ignorant that they can't *comprehend* the idea of their party's un-democratic and un-American policy positions?  Or are these predominately old white people so invested in the idea of their unearned social status that they don't care about their leaders' boasts of voter suppression and desires to subvert democracy?

Are either of these excuses acceptable to a civilized society?
