Where and how do I start this post? I think I've been asleep at the wheel for far too many DECADES. Blissful in my ignorance with such a naive outlook. It's embarrassing now when I look back at how content I was with what was. I don't know if it was blinders I wore or that I was just oblivious thickheaded obtuse. So it was a very rude awakening from bliss to horror after Obama  left the presidency. Sure there were blips here and there of discourse through the years of which I was aware but I never once took any of it seriously or worried about our country being overrun by what it is being overrun by and with right now. I wonder how many others out there were like me? So thank you for fighting the good battle from the get go. You're obviously far more aware and intelligent than I. Right now I spend all my time being shocked and feeling impotent which doesn't help anyone at any time especially me..We are on the road to far far worse and the speed is accelerating. How do we STOP what's going on immediately throwing it in reverse without stripping the gears? Beats me. I say keep it up please and thank you. Separate subject. I'm kinda new here and I'm not sure what you mean by downrates. I post what's on my mind and I reply to those who comment back to me. That's it. What else is there that's going on about which I am clearly ignorant and unaware? Thanks again and Happy Tuesday to you! :)
