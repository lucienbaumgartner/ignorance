For real. No one avoids human interaction like that without some sort of severe pain. His level of hubris to think he was beyond needing human connection was glaringly ignorant and highly annoying to me - like an emaciated dude bragging that he can win a boxing match. Sadly the last thing that he wrote in his journal is the truth he needed to embrace all along - his level of pride just wouldnâ€™t let him embrace it until he was an inch from death and had no use for it anymore.
