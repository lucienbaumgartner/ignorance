Note to E Musk , attn: lots of Americans are gamblers behind the wheel of a car. Lots of drivers aren’t drivers they accidentally leave home and drive around and return home without hitting anything solid along the way , lots of American drivers are stone assed blind .lots of Americans 
Aren’t quite sure which side of the road is the correct side. Most American drivers have only the barest
Minimum of driving instruction, they don’t even know what the painted stripes on the roads mean . I blame
Stoned ignorant and stupid drivers and 
Pedestrians for causing accidents with 
Your autos . Your automatic driverless autos will always be having accidents 
Until all autos have your driverless system on board  , only then will all
computers will know where all other autos are , wait , there may be more 
Of this logic coming , this is just my cursory overview , im sick of hearing about this problem, yes , we know 
Tesla autopilot has bugs and that Mr. musk knows this , give Mr Musk and his team room and time to work it out!
