I don't think that's so common. I was just a regular asshole -- arrogant and unaware that I was hurting other people's feelings. The main difference was the reasons for those things: I was arrogant because the only value other people ever found in me was my IQ, so I thought that was all that mattered, and I was unaware that I was hurting people because I couldn't sense it, not because I didn't try.
