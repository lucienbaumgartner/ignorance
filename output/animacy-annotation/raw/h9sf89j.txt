The vaccinated need to make more noise than the anti-masker fools. They are the very loud and unaware of their own stupidity. Itâ€™s time to call them out and tell them to sit down and be quiet, just like they feel emboldened to tell the science believing elitist educated. Enough of this absolute nonsense. Since when do the village idiots get any say in community matters?
