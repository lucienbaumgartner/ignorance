&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

Quote from bi@[globalculturalstrategies.com](http://globalculturalstrategies.com/), signed "Bill".  This guy is Bill Ivey.

From the GCS website:

&gt;Cultural Policy shapes and directs the Expressive Life of societies through the framework of law, regulation, and customary practice that governs the creation, distribution, consumption, and preservation of knowledge, information, and art.

So Bill Ivey's public position is that he's a cosmopolitan cultured sort, but his private position is that his job is undermining cultural progress to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
