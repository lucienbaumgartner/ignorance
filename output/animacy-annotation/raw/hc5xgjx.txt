&gt;*If government policy becomes "strand people in the middle of the sea", then I think we can abandon the tedious comparative arguments and finally admit we are, in fact, the bad guy.*
  

  
I'd agree, except that is hyperbolic and ignorant of the geography of the Channel

You made that equivalence not me, the article you linked said that is what is happening in Greek waters. 

*"Dinghies travelling from Turkey to Greece are blocked from landing on Greek soil by the HCG. This could mean either physically blocking the dinghy until it runs out of fuel, or disabling the engine. After the engine no longer works the dinghy can then either be pushed back into Turkish territorial water with waves, or towed if the wind is not favourable.* 
  

  
*The second type of pushback is employed when people have managed to land on Greek soil. In this case they are detained, placed in a liferaft with no means of propulsion, towed into the middle of the Aegean Sea and then abandoned."*

You were making the comparison there, in an attempt to deflect criticism from poorly planned government policy. 

Is this what Patel is planning to do? Who knows, like so much government policy it will is mostly just a headline generator, rather than an actual effective set of actions. 

Still, we can only summarise the plan is either to force boats back to France, prevent them enter British waters or force them back to French waters. All of these options are stupid and dangerous and ridiculous policy platform. 

As others have said, these plans will end up killing someone if they are implemented, they also totally ignore international laws we have signed up to.

&gt;Maybe not public policy
  

  
Frontex is headed by, and has been largely moulded by a Frenchman and his French team Der Spiegel France Télécom 

The idea that there is no difference between individual action and public policy and law is ridcolous. 

Having said that, I never once suggested that the EU (or France) is some haven for migrants. The EU is trying to deflect incoming migrants to poorer countries as much as we are and it's pathetic and does nothing to alleviate the suffering. 

That's not the point you are making though, is it? You are saying, "well the EU do it, then why shouldn't we?"

My easy response to that is that **no one** should be stranding **any one** at sea and the fucking childish retort of "well, they are doing it to" is not in any way a defence. Especially when it becomes actual government policy, i.e, we as a country are mandating putting lives in danger.
