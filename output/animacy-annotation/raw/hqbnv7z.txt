They can have an opinion. I'm not stopping them. I couldn't if I wanted to. But to dismiss the Haka as dumb or silly or stupid looking, from a position of ignorance and particularly with no personal connection to Maori culture, is ignorant and racist. They can have their opinion, but it's ignorant and racist, and so ill-founded and invalid.
