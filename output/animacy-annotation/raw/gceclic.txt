okay....

so I don't personally have a favorite character; i feel each character has its own importance and role. The story is not a typical story and the character developments are amazing. We remember Yona being delicate and unaware of how the kingdom's status actually was and how later she becomes a total badass and helpful and also lets go of her feelings bit by bit for Soo-won and also becomes grateful for everything. 

I love the fact that the story shows different events and the pasts of the characters and the dragons and how diverse and well written the story is. It also shows despite being a princess she had no influence on the people of the kingdom and now that she personally (with the help of everyone) is solving problems and how she gains trust and influence. 

The story always keeps the readers on the edge of their seats and is so interesting.
