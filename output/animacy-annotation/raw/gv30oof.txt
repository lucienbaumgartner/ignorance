I feel like all these columns about vaccinated folks being too careful and wearing masks outdoors are forgetting that A) most people aren't reading up on the latest scientific literature and B) humans remain scared of threats long after those threats cease to persist. We don't belittle veterans who are afraid of loud bangs, and we shouldn't belittle people, many of whom have lost loved ones or watched others around them suffer, for being overly cautious with covid. I'm sure we'll get to a point where most people realize being outside without a mask is safe, but people are emotional and need time to process the tragedy of the past 13 months.

By all means, write a million articles touting how safe people are from covid once they're vaccinated, but calling them morons for trying to be safe and/or considerate of others is incredibly childish and ignorant of how humans process trauma.
