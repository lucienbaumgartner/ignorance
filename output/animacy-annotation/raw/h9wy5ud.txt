Yeah I believe it is possible, when people are very young and unaware of themselves. But even then it’s not an excuse. It is our duty to set standards for how we want to be treated, conscious or subconscious abuse doesn’t matter, it’s still not something anyone should accept. 

You also help other people grow by not allowing their bullshit into your life and setting standards. However, in almost all cases (if not literally all) it is better to simply find someone who is already a healthy individual than putting your sanity and mental health on line to help someone grow - they usually don’t want it anyways and the dynamic is already skewed. You probably have very little power over him if he is already busy with abusive behaviors towards you. This unfortunately doesn’t change for the better with time, it only changes for worse :/.
