As usual, with people that have a bias, your anecdote is based off incomplete information:

1. Men drive more and longer distances than women so it stands to reason men would be in more accidents

2. Men are generally more aggressive drivers than women (because men generally take more risk in life), but more women drive obliviously or passively. Aggressive driving requires more focus and attention to detail

3. Many times, passive driving can be more dangerous than aggressive driving. Driving slower than the traffic around you while being in the wrong lane is a bad idea. Women and men do this, but women more often than not do not think about the left lane being the passing lane -- or other cars around them. For example, most people believe The left lane is the "fast" lane -- whatever your dingbat idea of fast is. But it is not the "fast lane." It's the passing lane, and using it for anything other than passing is stupid and ignorant. Of course there are exceptions in some places, but generally speaking this is true
