I agree with you. It's not very uncommon that I get asked, if I am a 'real woman' or if I am one of those \[insert trans slur here\] when confronting people about how they are referring to me. But if that happens, I always try to educate that person, as most of the time, they just don't know any better. I believe that people are generally good, but often simply confused and unaware of actual reality.
