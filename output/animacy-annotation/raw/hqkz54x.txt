A gender non conforming cis person is not trans. I’m sick of this watering down of what being trans is. It’s a serious fucking thing that many of us struggle deeply with most days of our lives. It often requires therapy surgeries and medications to treat. It’s is not the same as being quirky and wearing a dress every now and then. The comparison is incredibly ignorant and incredibly offensive. Don’t tell me you’re an ally when you don’t know the most basic thing about the thing you’re virtue signalling about. There’s nothing more annoying than a cis person who says they support trans people and then they do fuck all to support us and know nothing about us. We are not a tool for you show how awesome and progressive you are.
