And its my grandma, lol, what am I supposed to do, turn her into the cops?
Nah, I guess I dont care that much about them stealing the election because it's not worth starting drama in the family even though its clearly wrong and illegal.
But you can't even talk to her about things she disagrees with, kind of a nutcase, say anything bad about Joe biden or democrats, she will get very angry.

I see her and I realize there's probably a lot of people like her out in the world that believe they are correct because they have been spewed hatred by the Democrat media. And also the media she watches scaring the crap out of her, every time I see her all she talks about is covid this, covid that, so annoying.
It's my grandma but it just breaks my heart that people can be so ignorant and close-minded.
