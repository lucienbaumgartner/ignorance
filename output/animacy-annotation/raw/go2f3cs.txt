&gt; I am honestly pissed off because they will act like him gone kills the corruption. 

Yeah that was most likely their idea. Especially having a Kirchner militant speaking up about it. My guess is that they wanted Gines and crew gone a while ago, and this was the perfect opportunity to ship him out. There’s dozens of labs like this one...

Plus their voters are so naive and ignorant that they will pass this as being just an anomaly or a one-off. So that when voting comes (if it does) not only they will have forgotten about it, but everything will be fine as there’s a new minister at the helm, and they can shit on Gines all they want.

Absolutely despicable shit. From every single one of them. Que se vayan todos
