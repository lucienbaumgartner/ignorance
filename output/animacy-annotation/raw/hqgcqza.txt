Well, homosexuality is vaguely and generally criminalised using the excuse of morality laws. Merely expressing public support, a gesture as simple as possessing a rainbow flag, can and will end you up in jail.

The people are so ignorant and uneducated with no exposure at all to what homosexuality even is. Everybody I've met has their own wild theory about what it is. Only thing they share is the same religious excuse to hate them and the negative outlook.

Grindr is allowed, but it's known for having undercover officers going there to ambush. The technology is still far behind from being able to track phone activity and whatnot. The society is generally hostile towards us and approves of the cruelty against us.

Homophobic behavior is very common, even in everyday conversation, the Arabic equivalent to "queer" and "faggot" are used regularly as insults or "jokes" among straight men.
