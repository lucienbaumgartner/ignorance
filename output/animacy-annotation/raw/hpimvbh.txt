&gt; Something can fail to arouse you without you finding it repulsive. 

That does not refute the existence of aversion and feeling repulsed by something, especially when those responses have been repeatedly documented in tests exploring reactions to sexual stimuli in human beings, in findings that go back almost a century at this point in our history.

&gt; You can also do yourself a favor and dive further into correlation between bigotry and conservative and/or religious ideologies.

So...you're saying this tendency at the group level has a direct application to an individual conservative (Shad)? You know, there's a very simple shorthand for what you just did there: stereotype someone. Because if you can't see someone as just a person, and can only see them as black, or a conservative, or gay, or female, or only as a part of any larger group identity, then you are engaging in extreme prejudice and stereotyping.

And promoting that type of discriminatory thinking quickly exposes the person doing it to others as simply lazy and ignorant, and rightfully leads to people dismissing and ignoring whatever they have to say, because they are clearly an idiot.
