I think you're right that people who benefit directly from the uneducated voters-bloc would have issues with ***any*** kind of mass education reform. They'd probably conjure some narrative about the fed'rul guvmint trying to indoctrinate kids. But even in the south, many teachers (esp. female teachers) see through this BS and are willing to make curriculum changes before anyone on top gets on board. I think the trick is to ensure the curriculum is nonpartisan on its face (as it should... civics education shouldn't seem to be partisan at face value, of course when you have a POTUS who hates to read and lies all the time, sometimes telling the truth can sound partisan to some people). After that you just need capable teachers to spread it. I think it will likely start at the bottom if it does happen at all.

edit: another thing to consider is that the people who benefit from voters being generally unaware and incapable of understanding nuance in public policy, well if their voting bloc becomes more aware then they will simply have to change their platform. It's as simple as that.
