Those male friends are human, not supernatural beings. They don't have control over these women's lives. 

What did Cas really want then? What were his expectations? Did he romantically/sexually want Dean? If yes then everything becomes creepy even if Cas isn't human and unaware of boundaries. If not then what did Cas meant by not "having" Dean? He already had Dean so what exactly was he looking for? Did he want to absorb Dean's soul? 

No matter how you slice this, it is fucked up and creepy. Sure Dean might not process the implications but I do which is why I find that scene objectionable.
