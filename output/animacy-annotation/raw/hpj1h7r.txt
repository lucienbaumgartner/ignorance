I appreciate the advice. I'm trying to be more patient and more understanding. Being a parent is definitely a learning process. Even if someone has had multiple kids, there's still something to learn or get better at; like you said, every kid is different. 

I love my son to the moon and back. I'm trying to keep things cordial with the mother. I'm still kinda annoyed with how she did me and been treating me but anything we talk about now is only about him so it's whatever. 

People told me becoming a parent would make you emotional towards them so disciplining could be challenging, especially at 2 where they don't really know or understand but imo it's good to start disciplining and teaching things at a young age. He's definitely my joy tho and I really look forward to teaching him and watching him become a man. 

I'm always open and want advice from other parents. Some parents hate it, some hate being suggested anything, some just completely ignore what's said/offered/suggested. Imo everyone could learn something from literally everyone. Being closed and judgmental is ignorant and selfish, especially when people are genuinely trying to positively help you. I'm all for peoples opinions, hearing their experiences and learning things. Parenting is it's own journey, one where support and help is definitely needed and should be appreciated. And again, it's also a continuing learning process, for the kid(s) and the parents. No parent is perfect but no parent is beyond becoming better.
