Appropriate to whose standards? The press secretary is solely there to act as a public facing outlet for the will of the executive which by definition is not in sync with the will of the people or else we wouldn’t have bothered with other branches of government or even attempted checks and balances (which are by this time wildly out of step with the needs of the populace, but that’s beside the point). Again, if you assume that the Biden administration is 100% truthful and well-intentioned you’re just naive and unaware of the history of the American executive regardless of occupant.
