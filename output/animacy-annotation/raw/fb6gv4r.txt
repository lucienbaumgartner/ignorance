I donâ€™t think people cared about that as much as the fact that Leo was sending d*ck pics and being extremely creepy on Instagram to others. And the worst part of all was how completely unaware and unapologetic he was to how disgusting it all was. I also think that this account who is either Leo (which is really narcissistic) or a creepy fan makes things 10x worse.
