&gt;However, our reality still contradicts the idea of an all-powerful, all-loving god

Do you mean the problem of pain? We dont think he created suffering. I'd imagine suffering is a prerequisite of consciousness. 

&gt;Why does he instead leave people in confusion? God wouldn't need 
to infringe on freewill to do this, he could simply reveal himself to everyone

It is possible that that would scare us into belief. It is also possible he is revealed at some stage before death

Conservationists will find value in a tree in the remotest of woods, a tree that can't possibly ever see, a tree that might not feed any other life. The tree just has intrinsic value... I think our lives are similar. There is an intrinsic good in living, although blind and ignorant of God, as we do.
