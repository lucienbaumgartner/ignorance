Preach it bro. The ideas you shared are some of the main reasons I left r/nofap. I think r/nofap has good intentions, but ultimately making relapse worse.

 Relapse after discovering r/nofap probably dropped my energy even *lower* than a relapse ignorant and unaware of r/nofap. The downsides of semen loss were compounded by constantly running from urges, and compounded guilt and shame by eventually succumbing to my urges.

It was like a toddler outside on a sunny day, sees its shadow outlined on the ground, is frightened by its shadow so begins to run away from it. Only for the shadow to follow the toddler of course.

Our urges are like our shadow. It's there. It's not good nor bad. It just is. We don't have to wrestle our urges.

I guess the good thing from r/nofap, was I became more aware of urges and other triggers (not just horniness or being aroused by hot women), but triggers such as stress, discomfort, loneliness, procrastination, etc.

Accept, acknowledge, transmute. Great post OP!
