I think you should look at the bigger picture, not so much on armor. The point is that Westeros is unprepared and unaware of the threat from the East. 

The Dothraki sea is the way it is, because they destroyed cities and towns out there. Dany enters dead cities, and she has no idea why they're dead. She is ignorant of the past, but lots of people in Westeros are ignorant about her as a threat. It's similar to this historical moment which is probably put in here to echo the future:

&gt;"the Tall Men ignored the threat from the east for far too long, even as the khalasars began to raid across their eastern marches. Some of their kings even sought to use the Dothraki in their own wars, offering them gold and slaves and other gifts to fight against their rivals. Khal Mengo took these gifts gladly...then took the conquered lands as well, burning fields and farms and towns to return the grasslands to their wild state"
