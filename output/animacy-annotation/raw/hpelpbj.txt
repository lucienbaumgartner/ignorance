None of that was a real reason, you simply restated your previous accusation. Quite frankly I don't care for this gatekeeping of furries in the community. Whatever your issue is with them, perhaps keep it to yourself or better yet, educate yourself so you can defend your points with real reasoning instead of a repeating yourself and expecting that to be answer enough.

Idgaf if someone screenshots my post to laugh at it(I've already done the same to this rude and ignorant comment so tit for tat), it's a perfectly harmless meme in support of an overall kind and welcoming community that has helped many trans people, myself included, find themselves.

Tldr; buzz off pal, nobody here is hurting you and your comments are ignorant and rude. Have a wonderful day
