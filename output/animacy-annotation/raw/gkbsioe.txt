You can't control other people's actions, you can only control your reaction. If it's really making you angry you will need to embrace that or you will become angrier and angrier. Try to understand that your discomfort does not mean they are malicious. Pedestrians are often unaware of their surroundings, add that into what you know about the world and move on. Cycling is relaxing, so if you remove your anger over it you'll return to that. You can't stop them from doing it, so why get angry?

It is the same here in Edinburgh. We have shared use paths crisscrossing the city where it's supposed to be shared between cyclists and pedestrians. Sometime pedestrians can be very unaware and dangerous on these paths. It really used to wind me up. But then I accepted that you can't control other people's actions, only your reaction to them. It no longer winds me up.

It's the only way you'll get out of being so angry over it.
