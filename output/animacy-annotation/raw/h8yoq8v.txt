No I didn't, I was a lot younger and unaware of my options.

I was highly discouraged because of what she did, and I was so desperate at the time mentally and financially that when his mom stepped up to pay some of the money for him....I took that option. I wanted the path of least resistance.

Looking back I should have found a way to appeal or make a complaint.
