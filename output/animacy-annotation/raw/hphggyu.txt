Don't feel me that crap and make me feel guilty because I have reached my limit. This has been going on for decades. I've had this diagnosis for 9 years. I am tired of a mental health system that is horribly broken and social workers who are so ignorant and arrogant that they think that giving orders means that the person is somehow capable of doing it. They are the dunning Kruger profession and very very few of them are trauma informed.  Complex PTSD makes it impossible for people to function so even reaching out for help is an effort. My own family has harassed me but somehow I am supposed to get better while that continues. People say that they want to help or they love me and then they do something that hurts me because they do not think before they act. I'm too tired to keep fighting to just survive so don't tell me that it's going to get better because it is my birthday. Birthdays have been hellish for many decades.  I guess that I have failed at life. My mother was supposed to care for me and protect me from danger but she was the biggest threat to me.
