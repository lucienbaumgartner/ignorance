Exactly. The only good for conservatives part is that the right wing propaganda coming out about the CHAZ / CHOP (like this dumbass post) filling right wing news media, conservative subs, etc. gave right wingers something to feel superior to others about and scream and get mad about, while taking some of the focus off of Trump and right wingers terrible response to COVID and their questionable views about police brutality and BLM protests. The only way it helped conservatives was helping to convince the gullible and ignorant that conservatives views about a lot of present day issues have some merit. But in order to do that they had to lie, twist, and strawman what was actually happening in the the CHAZ/CHOP and misrepresent/strawman liberal views as being 100% for everything going down there.
