When I married my first husband, he gave an impromptu speech at our small reception and was totally unaware and uninterested in where I was. I was standing right behind him and was actually trapped between him and the buffet table. There weren't that many people there, he could have found me if he had tried even minimally, but he didn't care - as far as he was concerned, it was HIS wedding. We lasted three years, but we got a beautiful son out of it who is now a wonderful man of 38 years. I've since been married to a great guy for the pat 30 yrs.
