Cops suck at this sort of thing (and many other things). They are supposed to enforce the law, but they *DON’T EVEN KNOW THE LAWS.*
I went through so much fucking hassle and abuse with in person stalking, trespassing, harassment, threats, etc.  Got all the evidence and info and witnesses I could find...and the cops said they couldn’t do anything about it unless the stalker was on my property, being physically violent towards me. So my only way to have this stop is to be physically injured or possibly killed, and simultaneously be on the phone with 911? 

Nope, there are actual laws! US Cops are lazy and ignorant of both the law and the justice system as a whole.
