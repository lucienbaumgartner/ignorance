Bingo. I feel that there's old societal norms that encourage men to just turn their brains off to not think about things, or at best taught them it's okay to dismiss it from thier responsibility. Take things such as the saying 'boy will be boys' (which is just full of shit tbh), how men aren't supposed to be emotional (devalues the idea to even CONSIDER being empathetic or compassionate listeners, which deroutes them from becoming people that seek communication or actively listen...also enables mental health problems to manifest for a lot of men), the perception about how women are 'supposed to be in the kitchen and clean and take care of kids' (which basically just gives men the I dont have to do anything or bother with things of that matter card).

Granted, I think some of these don't represent everybody and for all I know these could be on the decline. I just know that they're things a lot of older folks could be passing down to their kids whether they actively tried or didn't try to do.

Thankfully, I became aware of a lot of my ignorance in how I should be in a relationship as a grew in my long time relationship. I mostly understand it because I related to being a lazy kid that just didn't really know any better until I had to change my habits after hurting people's feelings in their expectations. My dad was basically babied by his mom and my mom has to deal with him being pretty passive and unaware of himself for a lot of things. I picked up on his choices/habits and was unaware of knowing any better growing up, which made me lazy and dismissive of how a man could be mindful for a wife or about sharing responsibility with house duties, or simply listening and communicating about meaningful feelings; Which is exactly what OP lacks with her husband right now.

Basically, there's a perceived level of "justified" laziness for a lot of men out there
