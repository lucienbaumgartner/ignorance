*I was a bit surprised to find a thread recently on the professors sub, where many echoed statements such as international applicants to grad programs are mostly just trying to make it to Silicon Valley and not really interested in the work, or just want to get out of their "shithole" countries, are desperate etc.

I was wondering if this is a common perception surrounding international students in the USA. I also wish to ask if there are any common biases or perceptions by professors surrounding international students that I should be aware of. Also, do these vary by country?

It probably won't change my decision arounf going to a school in the USA, but I don't want to go in blind and unaware of what to watch out for, or the common perceptions surrounding me.*
