Sweetpea, there is no industry. It’s people who want to be accepted. Hating their identity and how they express it is in fact homophobia. 

Being gay in a world that still largely doesn’t accept it is traumatizing. In many countries being gay is still illegal, and in a lot of those it’s punishable by death. Hell, even in the United States hate crimes happen all the time. 

I understand it’s likely you don’t know what it’s like being gay. I don’t hate you for that, I think this is coming from the fact that you (and the majority of the people posting this stuff) are unaware and uneducated. I don’t think that’s something to hate. 

Sure, certain people are annoying. I hate a few people who are gay and I AM gay. That doesn’t make me a homophobe. It doesn’t make people a homophobe to hate a single gay person.

Anyways this is probably weirdly worded, I just wanted to say what I think. 
Once again, have a good night. It was nice talking to you.
