Yup!

Hmm, another fun fact...

The Emperor ordered Russ to bring Magnus to Terra to answer for his mistakes. Horus manipulated Russ to ensure he would do his best to kill Magnus.

This served the dual purpose of BRUTALIZING the two Legions that would be able to stop him. The Wolves, who were decimated several times over by their attempt to destroy the Thousand Sons.

And the Thousand Sons, the only Legion that was knowledgeable enough in Sorcery to counteract the "gifts" of Chaos that Horus relied on to get an edge. Either Legion would have been a major thorn in his side, both together would have halted him cold.

They nearly destroyed each other, and the Thousand Sons (who were, in fact, loyal and ignorant of the magnitude of Magnus' folly) were driven to align with Chaos in order to survive.

Bonus fun fact:
