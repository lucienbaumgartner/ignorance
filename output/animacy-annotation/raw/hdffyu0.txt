It's not just game days and parents day, traffic has seem unusually worse than ever lately in town. I'm not sure if it is pandemic related from people staying in, more people here, or a mix of those and road closures but I have seen a wreck every day for the past three weeks. Drivers seem more aggressive and unaware of rules and my commute time to work has almost doubled even though I moved closer to my job than last year or the two years prior.
