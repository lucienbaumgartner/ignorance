I have a couple friend’s who live in the area and went to high school in Ponchatoula and college in Hammond. My SO lives in the area and attends university, currently. We love the accessibility in terms of shops and dining. We love the scenery. Love the vibe. 

Some of the people, not so much. My friends were definitely outsiders with a NOLA soul. Gay or obscenely Scene(tm)...or both. They will let you know it is RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC. There is a rumor that a gay man (I believe) was lynched within the last ten years. Some fucked up scary shit. 

The college kids are incredibly, incredibly unaware and rude. I am only recently not a college kid, so this isn’t a the on Gen Z or Millennials moment. I just do not like the frat/sorority vibe

Drugs? Not sure. I don’t believe it is worst than Belle Chasse, for reference.
