I think censoring the information to hide the US intelligence's hand is very unlikely. 

First off, once that post was made public the cat was out of the bag. Censoring it does absolutely nothing to avoid showing the Russians that we know what they're doing and how they're doing it.

Second, all of this information was readily available to the public, all it took was for someone to look. Revealing the information does not reveal any classified information about how we monitor Russian activity.

The admin response to why this post is being censored is because they blacklisted some domains on it. I don't know if people have tried posting without those domains but still with the archive, but reddit banning them the same day it was exposed means that they were unaware and willing to act on it, they were aware and got permission to act on it, or possibly ARE trying to bury the information but never heard of the Streisand effect.

What we should do is remove link to the now banned domains but keep the archives as is, and see if that gets picked up. If the archive links are also banned, that would be very suspicious as it'd show an effort to censor the information rather than the active measure domains.
