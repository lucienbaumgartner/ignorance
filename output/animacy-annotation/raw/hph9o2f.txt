No one's entriely sure why humans have flaws despite millions of years of evolution. Not the biggest priority when being killed by everything around us back then, I guess.

If you're religious the same applies, why would such a powerful God leave the project unfinished or imperfect? 

Humans have so, so many flaws. We have such materialistic views, and are willing to risk our mortal lives for scrap metal and paper. We place negative values on the most nonsensical of things: Colour, religion, love, cultures foreign and local, food, people, music. We are ignorant and narcissistic. Blind to perspective and reason. We value logic, facts and power whilst consistently evading them. We value peace and diplomacy but allow our leaders to send young men and women to their deaths before sitting down and talking.

Humans are by no means perfect. We will not learn from history and will blindly obey charismatic idiots and take their hearsay as gospel.

You think everyone is stupid because they are, and a lot of people, _a lot_ of people know. But like you, they'll do nothing.
