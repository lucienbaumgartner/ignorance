Agreed! Though when I was in 8th grade I broke my arm and at first with all the adrenaline it didnâ€™t hurt bad but on the way to the hospital it really kicked In. When the EMS guy asked me I said 12/10. But to be honest it was probably the closest to a 10/10 pain Iâ€™d ever experienced at that point in my life once adrenaline wore off ðŸ˜‚ also I was young and ignorant of the pain scale back then haha. Obviously Iâ€™d be more diligent about rating pain accurately today.
