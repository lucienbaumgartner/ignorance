Except it’s not truth in the fucking slightest. First off, **never** fake being normal, that’s literally one of the most damaging things someone suffering with mental illness can do, and a huge problem with mental illness and treatment is the fact that many suffering fake it, and as a result bury their feelings until it becomes impossible to untangle the issue. 

Second, while friends can be a support network you have to exercise caution with how you lean on them. If you’re in that state like the OP, it’s probably best to seek a professional. Another common issue when it comes to mental health is making supportive friends/family into your entire support system and can lead to issues if that friendship ends or can cause some people to become burnt out emotionally by constantly trying to help you. Professional help is so important for that last part, because as much as someone may want to swoop in and help, normal people are rarely equipped to be in that role. 

Obviously you haven’t a clue about mental health at all with the completely ignorant advice you posted. Funny it’s always the people who are blatantly wrong and ignorant that try to pull the “truth hurts” bullshit. Maybe next time type something *actually* true.
