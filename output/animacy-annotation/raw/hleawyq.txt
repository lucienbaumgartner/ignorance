It's plainly ridiculous that the rhetoric is always "shoot to kill!" but when it comes to actual court cases shooting doesn't mean intent to kill... 

If you point a gun at somebodies center mass, you intend to kill. When you point a gun at somebodies legs, you are reckless and ignorant of a guns purpose.
