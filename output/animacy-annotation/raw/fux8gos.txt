That's just bullshit and you know it.

Bernie's biggest issue is and will always be the red scare. You can't propose fucking public healthcare in the US without being likened to Stalin. The US is so damn conservative and ignorant that a plan that works in half of the world seems unreal.

That has nothing to do with Bernie's supporters.
