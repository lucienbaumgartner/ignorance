You have the right to your opinion but I don’t think it’s fair for you to diminish my experience. You don’t know my life story and I don’t have to share it with you. 

And frankly, stating “it’s pretty easy to just ignore peer pressure” is incredibly insensitive and ignorant of you. Peer pressure is incredibly harmful and in social settings people are very set on gaining respect or admiration from their peers so they are willing to do things they don’t normally do. It is a natural biological response. 

There have been studies that show that negative peer pressure in youth can lead to addiction or positive peer pressure can lead to success. All of these things can lead to conformity, obedience, compliance, and internalization. As someone who claims to be educated you don’t seem very educated. Or to have done your due research.
