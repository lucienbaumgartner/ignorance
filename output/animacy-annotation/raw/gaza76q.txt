OP, I’d like to offer some advice as someone who was in your friends shoes years ago.

In my early 20s, I was dating a guy and drunkenly cheated on him several times while he was studying abroad. This is something I’m still very ashamed of and regret to this day. I was out of control, drinking too much and unaware of my actions. We ended up breaking up later on, but I always respected how my friend handled things. 

I had a close friend that was in your position. I was very unhappy in the relationship and would complain to her about very trivial things my then bf did. Looking back, it seems so obvious I should have just left him. He deserved much better and I was not in love, but I tried to convince myself otherwise. My friend finally got so fed up and made it very clear she did not support my choices, the relationship, and would no longer listen to me vent about him. This allowed her to still be my friend and spend quality time without me zapping all her energy. Side note but I ended up leaving the boyfriend and can honestly say I have never cheated again several relationships and years later. Once a cheater always a cheater is not always true. You can hate the sin but love the sinner. However, she needs to do some serious self reflection and work on being a better person. If you don’t see any signs of progression after some time, your best bet is to cut ties. 

But I honestly think this is the best thing you can do. The next time your friend brings up her bf, be very clear and say although you love her, you don’t support her cheating and no longer want to hear about her relationship (unless she is working toward bettering herself). I do not recommend telling the boyfriend. That will only create a bigger mess. Chances are they are going to break up anyways because she obviously is not 100% happy. You will 100% lose your friend. You just have to decide how much you value your friendship without her crappy relationship in the equation.
