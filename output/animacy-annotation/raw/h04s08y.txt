THEY DON'T GET PAID BELOW MINIMUM WAGE ON PAPER.

Jesus Fucking Christ, you people just fucking throw that out there without understanding anything behind it. Servers make at least minimum wage. If they make less than minimum wage, something I have literally never seen or heard of in twenty years in the service industry, their employer pays them the difference.

Servers get paid extremely well, despite being lazy and ignorant of many of the most basic functions of their job. Given the choice, the overwhelming majority would choose to stick with the current system because no one wants a fucking paycut.
