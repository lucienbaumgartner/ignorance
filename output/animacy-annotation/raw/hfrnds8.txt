Well- I think it's less about you screwing up (which you didn't really) and more about you being brand new to Agile and ignorant of how things are done and expectations. Keep it focused on new to agile, eager to learn. Heard about the Agile Mindset and can't wait to adopt it and yes- that would be an entirely different conversation (because this one is about your agile journey!)
