I think you forgot what being racist is, you're assuming that all black people are a certain way because they are black? Or you seen someone act a certain way and now you assume anyone who 'looks' like them are the same. Or maybe you are just indeed, racist and ignorant of facts of horrible racism in the past and present and have no care of change for the future because...youre racist.

Edit: stop bringing down nordics with your further shit.
