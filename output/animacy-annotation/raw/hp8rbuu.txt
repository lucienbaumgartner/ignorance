You just keep saying I'm ignorant and wrong but you haven't made a clear or coherent point.

I explained what capitalism is. You are doing the straw man I described in my comment. You're saying "that's not capitalism, haha You're so stupid, capitalism is something else!" Do you not understand logical arguments? If I say "capitalism is A and A is bad" and you say "no capitalism is B and B is great" then you haven't refuted me, you've just misdirected the conversation. You haven't addressed anything about ownership, violence, and the evolution of law surrounding property. You're just saying "fReE mArKet gUd" like some slow troll.
