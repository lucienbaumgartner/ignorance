In all seriousness it could be a mantra. Perhaps hes a neopagan, a witch, or even a satanist. Maybe he calls himself nothing.

Of course people will say things like "time to move out bro", but that is just silly. Ide be more apt to move out due to paper-thin walls rather than "my neighbor is spooky to me because he does something I dont understand".

I enjoy getting a good spook out of someone now and then because it only really works on the ignorant and superstitious lot, but the "witchcraft=evil=spooky" trope just gets boring. This fella might just be practicing a daily ritual.
