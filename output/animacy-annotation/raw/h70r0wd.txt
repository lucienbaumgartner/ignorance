I don't think anything can beat the whoverse, since it's just so completely inconsistent and unaware of scale. Like they have galaxy busters as a thing humans just have, but then there's this Time Lord weapon called the Galaxy Eater, which is implied to do the same thing.

An entire galaxy is wiped out as collateral damage in the Time War,  it because they wanted to blow up the galaxy, but because it happened to be there when they wanted to blow up something else.

It's insane.
