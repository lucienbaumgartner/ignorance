 'It's fine I guess but that *sort of thing* can't touch THIS -points to area of media- because that's ours'.   


Then it's clearly not fine to you. It's not pandering. They're just people. These people exist. It's not about politics. I can't even begin to put it into words but I find it so frustrating and ignorant that these people don't see how *they* make it political. YOU are the one's that have a problem with it, and it's YOUR problem alone!! I can't wait for more LGBTQ+ to be put into more games, moves and series because it's not about politics. A company puts LGBTQ+ as an *option* and others will cry has it's a political move or pandering. A form of media puts in oversexualised women that's not relevant to the plot and unnecessary hetrosexual relationships? Oh, that's fine because as long as it panders to them, *it's fine.*  


Other people don't need a reason to exist in other forms of media, they can just *be* as CIS straight people can. It doesn't need to be their entire character arc for them to just *be.*
