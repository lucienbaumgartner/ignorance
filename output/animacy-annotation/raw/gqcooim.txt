That I got world top 20 on FFXIV and was one of the best players in the world on MMOs for a short period of time. When I was 12 I was worried that I would never make it to max level on any game ever because I kept rerolling my character.

Also that I ended up being much smarter than my older brother who I looked up to and thought was the smartest person ill ever meet. And I still consider myself very stupid and ignorant of a lot of things now. Though everyone I know would disagree. I know enough to know that I will never know anything that amounts to much. I've found that if I come up with some new earth shattering idea chances are someone else had that idea first and was able to communicate it much better than I ever could.
