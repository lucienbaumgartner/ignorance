I spoke with a Woodhaven parent late last week about the COVID situation, and she mentioned how cautious that she was being because she is concerned about her front line job. If she falls sick, she can’t make money to care for her high school aged kids. 

She went on to say that her kids had been invited to a “homecoming” style party in the last week or 2. She mentioned that while her kids didn’t attend, they estimated that over 100 kids did go to a hall party put on by parents. Upon seeing this story, I can’t help but be curious is this is more than a coincidence. 

Imagine being so selfish and ignorant, that your kid being able to go to some form of homecoming dance takes precedent over not only their education, but more importantly, the health and safety of them, their teachers and families.
