Why do you care about others opinions? Addiction is a brain disease and can effect anyone. Rich, poor, black, white, famous, politicians, can all have an addiction. Using the term “junkie” is extremely ignorant and judgmental. If someone is judging you for being an addict, or for just using drugs one time, they’re bad people and aren’t ur friend anyways
