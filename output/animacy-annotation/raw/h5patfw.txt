As someone who is autistic, kindly shut the fuck up and stop trying to diagnose fictional characters based on what is obviously a very limited (at best) understanding of autism. None of this stuff is something that would be symptomatic of autism. Being obsessed with a crush is normal for a young teenager and autism doesn't make you stalk people, being more comfortable spending time with someone you want to get close to while being anonymous is completely normal for most people (especially insecure teenagers), being impulsive and unaware of danger is literally what teenagers in general are known for, I don't even know how the fuck you could associate throwing shoes at a bully with autism (that's just what any good person should do, and what many people, autistic or otherwise, would do), being hyperactive is not a symptom of autism (it could be indicative of things that often correlate with autism, but it's way more likely that this fictional character is just a hyperactive person), nor is moving your legs fast while lying down (a lot of characters in anime do that), and crying a lot is also just normal for teenagers and autism doesn't make you more likely to cry. 

In other words, this character is a normal 13 year old girl who acts like a normal 13 year old girl. She sounds like a totally normal teenager, and most of these symptoms have little to do with autism.
