&gt;It's an argument that cannot end.

Maybe if you're 100% unreasonable but luckily we human beings aren't necessarily obstinate. That's why I said try /r/askphilosophy: philosophy relies on reason for its arguments. Without reasons, you are making no argument. Here you've written one reason for your argument:

&gt; In my opinion the fact that the animal will be unaware of its death after the fact makes the very short period of distress before it meaningless

You're doing utilitarian philosophical work here! Your argument here is that your pleasure is "more" than the suffering caused for it. However, you rely on the idea that the animal only suffers at the end of its life: unfortunately the meat industry puts animals into duress for the entirety of their lives, not just for a very brief moment before they are killed. 

Even if it were true that animals only suffer at the very end of their lives (and it isn't: look up the movie *Earthlings* for graphic candid examples of what goes on in animal industries), you'd still have to 1.) figure out exactly how much suffering you're likely to cause at the end of their lives and weigh that against your relatively short pleasure experience, 2.) figure out what other effects eating meat has and whether causing those effects are moral (if the environment concerns you watch *Cowspiracy*, which shows that the meat industry causes the most climate change out of all other factors, estimations ranging from 15% to 51%; if its health, try *Forks Over Knives*; if its convenience and lifestyle worries, try *Vegucated*) and 3.) make the argument about why it's moral to kill something just because you get off on it. 

&gt;So what if it suffers it will be dead and unaware that suffering even existed in seconds.

I really wish that were true.
