OMFG, what a tool!

If you dont like someone's price you're free to go searching for another service provider/ vendor.

You're the one who's desperate and ignorant of the fact that you've given next to no notice. Entitled idiot.

And after all that... I dont feel like paying? Talk about a lack of integrity.

 Well played by the editor/ OP here; very well played.
