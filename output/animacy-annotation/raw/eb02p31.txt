&gt; the carbon tax, caused the downfall of this once prosperous province!

Imagine being so uninformed and ignorant that you actually believe this.

I feel the carbon tax was ill-timed, and I don't feel it was necessary for Alberta to go above and beyond the federal minimum given our situation at the time, but if you think the carbon tax is why Alberta is where it is... oh boy.
