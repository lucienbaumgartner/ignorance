What if she's book smart but incredibly unaware and a little spacey. Because I'm currently working on my masters degree (in secondary ed with a focus on English teaching... So like not a tough subject but it's still a masters degree) but I'm also very stupid and brainless from time to time. Like most of the time I'm just a mess.

My bf finds my brain dead moments very annoying, as well as my blas√© approach to following instructions. But he's a mathematics guy so it makes sense.

Im just wondering like where does book smart and passionate but 100% brain dead fall? What i guess I'm asking is... What if they are smart but also genuinely dumb and it's not an act?
