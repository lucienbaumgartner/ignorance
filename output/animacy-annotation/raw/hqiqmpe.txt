Yea cricket is massive in south asia. 
My comment in toward OP generalisation of asia as a whole. If he is not, he should has specified it. It came of as ignorant and misleading especially at a forum where non asians are the majority and also a place where they usually derive their 'knowledge' from - n thus cummulating the asian stereotypes

If he is going to be specific on british-asiansn then i agreed as majority of them are from south asia and hence their favouritism towards crickets due to their grassroot hobby etc.

But besides south asia and minority part of south korea. Cricket is totally non existent among other asian folks.
