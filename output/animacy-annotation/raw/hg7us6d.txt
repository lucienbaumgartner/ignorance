There are a few other characters who imply they know who ZL is in their voicelines. Keqing doesn't like how much he resembles Morax, Hu Tao suspects it pretty actively, Yanfei has an inkling as well. I don't remember anyone else, but most of the characters that *should* identify him at least have an idea of who he is and go along with the play. Except for Ganyu, who is played as being rather naive and ignorant of what's going on around her despite her competence and age.
