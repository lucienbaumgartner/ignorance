**Character Rankings**

*Disclaimer: These are my opinions. You may not agree with them, and that’s ok! These rankings are in no way objective and are solely from the view of 1 watcher. I am simply offering my opinion on the season.*

**One World**


**Season Ranking: 36/36**

**Cast Average**: 466.06

18: **Colton Cumbie 1.0** - Colton, in a span of only 6 episodes, was able to be racist, classist, and generally despicable during One World. He spends his time solely with the girls, then is somehow in power, gets his entire tribe (including Bill!) to throw immunity away to vote Bill out because Colton is an aforementioned racist and classist person, but don’t worry he has a black housemaid so everything is ok! He then bonds more with Alicia during the postswap by making fun of Christina for being Asian. He is then anticlimactically medevaced instead of getting the downfall he so desperately deserves after his insanely negative edit, killing both his character and the season. Awful.

Overall Ranking: 646/653

17: **Alicia Rosa** - Does plenty of stuff that is just as bad as Colton does, such as the mentioned above mocking of Christina for being Asian, or that time where she compared Christina to a special-ed kid even though she was a special-ed teacher at the time, which is just such a great look. Also she has one of the most laughably unaware and egomaniacal jury speeches this side of David, funny that they ended up hooking up, they fit perfectly together!

Overall Ranking: 639/653

16: **Tarzan Smith** - Lucky for him the two below him are some of the worst characters Survivor has ever produced, because if he was on literally *any other season*, Tarzan would be recognized for just how awful of a character he is. He feels only a shade less forced than Phillip, which isn’t a good thing, he does visually repugnant things like walk around in what is basically a bikini bottom, which is fucking disgusting, and he says things that are morally repugnant, such as the time he claimed racism wasn’t real because at the time we had a black president. Oh but he’s funny though hahahahahahahaha (spoiler: he’s not).

Overall Ranking: 637/653

15: **Kat Edorsson 1.0** - Delusional characters can be funny. Unaware people make some of the best moments in the show. Kat is not this. Kat is so clearly playing up her own delusions to try and make herself look dumber, and it is not funny. Not knowing that a BLT has bacon in it? Not buying it for a fucking second. Her family visit is one of the hardest I’ve ever cringed at watching Survivor. Ever.

Overall Ranking: 611/653

14: **Leif Manson** - Such awful stunt casting it hurts me to even write about how he was stunt casting. He was only cast because of his size and does nothing worth a damn during his small time on screen. He is notable for genuinely being the 2nd worst casting choice in the history of the show.

Overall Ranking: 587/653

13: **Nina Acosta** - She called Kat an idiot (which isn’t false at all), and started some fights. That’s all I can remember. 

Overall Ranking: 580/653

12: **Matt Quinlan** - Bland, boring alpha male who gives Colton power in the game because he can’t count.

Overall Ranking: 577/653

11: **Jay Byars** - Is genuinely one of the most boring and bland people ever cast, and this is on One World! He ruins the sole attempt of a coup on Kim by squealing like a pleasure pig as soon as Troyzan comes up with a halfway competent plan.

Overall Ranking: 566/653

10: **Troyzan Robertson 1.0** - He brings something, but the problem is most of the time that something is generic and/or boring. I don’t like generic underdogs, and Troyzan is just that in the “THIS IS MY ISLAND!!!!” episode, where he also gets an ungodly amount of screentime for no real reason at all (fun fact Troyzan in the This is My Island episode gets 14 confessionals, which equals his total confessional number for GC).

Overall Ranking: 505/653

9: **Monica Culpepper 1.0** - The first iteration of our Neat Lady is fine. She doesn’t do anything wrong nor does she do anything spectacular, but she is a nice older lady who works hard which is seriously helpful on NuManono with bottom-tier shit like Tarzan, Leif, Colton, and Alicia on her tribe.

Overall Ranking: 449/653

8: **Bill Posley** - He’s a pretty funny guy, who knows how to use some good self-deprecating humor (or so it seems), early on. But then his content is literally 100% related to Colton being a bigot, so he can’t actually rank high on my rankings, even if I have a bunch of respect for him and feel bad for how his experience turned out.

Overall Ranking: 432/653

7: **Kourtney Moon** - She was the best casting choice on the season and went out during the first challenge due to an injury. Speaks to the quality of OW. I liked her aesthetic though and think she had some stuff going on.

Overall Ranking: 427/653

6: **Kim Spradlin** - She is so good at the game of Survivor she single handedly ruins a season. Kim may be a great player, but boy, as a TV character, she is not great. Kim is just boring and mostly dull, but she has her moments, like the pig slaughter or the idol in her crotch. Otherwise a very mediocre character at the very best because she’s just so boring.

Overall Ranking: 380/653

5: **Michael Jefferson** He’s ok? He just has some weirdly odd or quirky yet funny moments that kinda just happen in the background away from the action. Like him stealing from the girls supplies at the opening rush when it was totally unnecessary, just weird shit that you kinda just tilt your head at in genuine surprise, which on a shitty season like OW will get you this high.

Overall Ranking: 365/653

4: **Christina Cha** - Is laughably bad at Survivor. She is so bad at Survivor it is comical, and not in a played-up, forced way like Kat. She is genuinely an awful player. She basically quits at F4, and that always makes me crack a smile, plus she brings out some really good stuff from Sabrina. Also she stays likable in the face of Colton and Alicia so that helps as well.

Overall Ranking: 319/653

3: **Chelsea Meissner** - I like her. She has some (good) spunk and attitude and that can’t be overstated on such a terrible season. She has some fun moments like her getting on Tarzan over plastic surgery (anyone getting on Tarzan is a positive to me), or when she talks about liking Jay and Troy, but liking money more. It’s the only time I laughed while watching One World, and yes I kept track of that.

Overall Ranking: 252/653

2: **Jonas Otsuji** - He’s one of the few charismatic speakers on the cast and that carries him a lot. Other than that he’s a pretty good voice of reason for the shit that is this season and he has some fun background moments like being genuinely astounded to the point of having to bury his head in his hands when Tarzan goes off on his race spiel. I like his FTC speech too.

Overall Ranking: 223/653

1: **Sabrina Thompson** - She has some really good if not great moments and that easily carries her to #1. Of course the main one everyone will think of is her top-tier Day 39 confessional which is of course excellent, but she also has some great voting confessionals towards the end of the game, to Kat and Christina. I think she was the most engaging speaker as well and that easily makes her my #1 for this season.

Overall Ranking: 194/653
