Omg UGH that's so rude and ignorant of your mom to say.

SWERFs are the bane of my existence! The U.S. has really strategized its anti-sex worker laws around conflating sex work and trafficking and it's really hard to undo that propaganda. If they actually care about people getting coerced or exploited, decriminalizing sex work is part of the solution! So it's really frustrating to hear all the doublespeak that justifies laws that endanger everyone in the sex trade. If we wanna protect people from trafficking we need to end poverty and open borders to free migration so people don't have to rely on third parties to smuggle them into other countries. Not to mention, the majority of trafficking is non-sexual labor such as fishing, construction, and domestic labor, and we don't ever hear about that.

And it literally makes zero sense to say that you doing sex work is enabling child trafficking....what ???
