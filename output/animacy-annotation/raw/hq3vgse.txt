Thank you for the honest reply. I truly appreciate it.

I would argue there's a key difference between "dishonorable" and "sinful," would you not? The verse seems clear to me, that God caused them to embarrass themselves with because of the list of actual sins that you seem to have overlooked. 

&gt;&gt; they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles.

This is the sin being condemned, and the text indicates as much. But Paul continues, and context is key:

&gt;&gt; They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious toward parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

Here we see a mix of sins and just bad behavior. Foolishness isn't a sin, I'm sure you'd agree, though it is dishonorable. Boastfulness isn't a sin, though it's ill-advised. So to take everything mentioned here and treat it as equal sin is to misread this verse, no? Or do you believe that if I boast about my grades, or my prowess on the basketball court, I'm damned to Hell?

&gt; marriage is between man and woman

It doesn't have to be -- David's covenant with Jonathan matches marriage rites of the day beat-for-beat, and indeed David adopted Jonathan's son, and when Jonathan died David cried out "My love for you surpassed the love of women!" 

To dive a bit deeper than I imagine you have, the Hebrew word translated to "soul" (**נֶפֶש**, *nephesh*) in English isn't what we think of when we say soul; it means the whole of your being, including your physical body. And their "souls" were "knit" (**קשר**, *qashar*) together. Common use of this phrase is to indicate physical or romantic entanglement, or both.

There's also the fact that same-sex unions are a matter of law, and I'm illustrating now they do not violate God's law, so **Romans 13:1-2** seems appropriate:

&gt;&gt; Obey the government, for God is the One who has put it there. There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power. So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow.

--
&gt;He also never explicitly said anything about bestiality. 

This is a weak argument, because His ministry focused only on adding to or augmenting the Law of Moses, which explicitly declares bestiality as a sin in many places. You're welcome to bring up Leviticus here (I hope you don't do so while wearing mixed fabrics!), but that'll just lead to more Hebrew lessons. I'm happy to have that conversation, though.

&gt; Jesus did mention the Genesis account

He quoted Genesis in response to a question about divorce. You're taking a verse out of context to make your point; you do that a lot in your comment. This usually indicates a shallow understanding of the Word, or worse an intentional distortion. This verse is not a condemnation of anything except divorce.

If you can't make your point in context, you have no point to make.

&gt; Jesus also mentioned Sodom

No, he mentioned the *punishment* of Sodom, and he was talking about the End of Days, not homosexuality. Again, you have to take out all context to make your point, which means you don't really have a point to make. 

If you have to twist the Word to fit your beliefs, perhaps you should think about changing your beliefs and not the Word?

But let's discuss that story. Sodom and Gomorrah is *not* about homosexuality; you would be hard-pressed to find a rabbi or Biblical scholar who would agree with that interpretation. First, in that story we see the angels treated appropriately by Abraham (**Gen. 18:1-8**) immediately before they approach Sodom, setting our example and necessary context, then we see them treated in the direct opposite manner. Unless you believe *every* person in *both* cities was gay, *and* that angels even have a gender, *and* that these two chapters are completely disconnected from one another, my hope is even you understand that your interpretation is misguided. Look at the verse you're talking about!

&gt;&gt; Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building

Great opportunity to toss in an opinion about homosexuality, but he didn't. So either you agree this is unrelated to the topic, or homosexuality isn't a sin, and either is fine for me.

Further, we see a different version of this same message (probably an older telling of the story), with the same beats, in **Judges 19-21**. This version doesn't have angels (it's a priest and his concubine), or fire and brimstone (the village is destroyed instead by the tribes of Israel), but the details are otherwise the same, though without any indication of any homosexual acts or impulses. It's a moral fable about how to treat guests in a desert culture. Two tellings of the same story from different times happens a few times in the OT (**Genesis 1** and **2** are a good example since they occur back-to-back; **Gen 2** is the older tradition).

With all this needed context, do you still think the story of the destruction of Sodom was about homosexuality, or do you agree with the broad majority of Biblical authorities who argue it was more the *rape* part, and the degree of mistreatment of guests, and especially guests who were messengers of God, that caused the destruction?

You have to make your case free of all context, and specifically in English, to even try to have a point. Do you not see how weak a position that is? You're justifying persecution by distorting the Word, twisting it to your ends, and I know it's because you were taught these things by someone you respected and accepted them without study, so I'm not condemning you, I'm just asking that now that you've been educated you please stop. 

&gt;&gt; And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. (**2 Peter 3:15-16**)
