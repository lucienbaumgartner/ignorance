Settlers to the US came from ultra religious types in Europe seeking religious liberty. You can still see it today. There’s all sorts of fundie protestant churches in the USA.


 The Canadian establishment came from 2 clusters, British settlers and French. The British were religious but much more mellow. French were really Catholic and the state conspired with the Catholic church to keep Francophones ultra religious and ignorant. That ended after the quiet revolution in the 50’s. Obviously other immigrants from Europe and beyond later came, but the establishment in Canada came from those two groups
