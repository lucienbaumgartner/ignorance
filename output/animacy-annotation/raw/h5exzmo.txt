I think OCPD has more to do with being unaware and unconcerned of how their black and white rethinking or compulsions affect others and are convinced they are right. As opposed to knowing compulsions are out of the normal range of behavior and aware of bothering others and wanting to stop but can't. 
I know someone with it, she's 100% sure she is correct and will argue to the end that everyone knows she's right and they are unwilling to admit it. 
But it doesn't have anything to do with cleaning it being orderly as that can be a trait for either OCD or OCPD.
