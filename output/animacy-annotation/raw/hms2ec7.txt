/ub I'm sure there were Albanians that fought alongside the Greek partisans, but I'm talking for the majority. And when they claim there was a "Cham Genocide ğŸ¥´" I just can't believe there are people that dumb and ignorant of history. Chams indeed left, but for a very different reason than genocide. We don't have a problem with Albanians either, in fact we don't even consider you foreign anymore. There are so many Albanians in Greece, even 3rd generation, and it is impossible not to have an Albanian in your circle.

/b never happened but they deserved it ğŸ˜Œ
