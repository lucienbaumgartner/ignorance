I think our system of representative democracy could be improved, even overhauled on a fundamental level. But only people who have never experienced autocracy, or worse -complete breakdown of supply chains and government services- would ever long for the system’s collapse.

It’s a special kind of sheltered entitlement that imagines something about this way of life represents an intolerable level of oppression. I think most of these people are just bored and ignorant and childish. The offspring of a society that has been too stable and too comfortable for too long.
