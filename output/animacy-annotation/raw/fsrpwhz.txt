I literally deleted my FB because of all the morons I grew up with. It’s insane how someone seems reasonable then all of a sudden they’re spouting insanity AND STILL supporting him and police. They’re also doing tons of what-aboutism with stories about white people being beat by cops or racially motivated beatings of white people. I saw a thing about Amy Klobuchar not prosecuting Chauvin(which is only partially true really) among other things. They’re so indoctrinated and ignorant that no amount of debating or arguing with these types of people will change them. They have no issue with press being beaten up or the military being called to be used.
