&gt;biological independence 
&gt;Please define this.

Not being physically attached to someone else, while being unable to be removed through a non-invasive procedure. Newborns are biologically independent. A fetus cannot have autonomy, a being that is psychologically unaware and incapable of biological independence (autonomic ability to adapt to varying levels of supply-and-demand outside of the womb) or achieving said independence through non-invasive methodology does not have autonomy by definition, as they can have no present existence separate from a sentient being, nor can they have feelings about it. They cannot be individual, even if the rest of their timeline is biologically individual, or if they are philosophically an individual by having a complete set of DNA.

&gt;Like the shared DNA?

That’s a loose comparison, but isn’t consequential to any legal reasoning. DNA doesn’t change the longer it sits, it’s always what it was. Sperm and egg sitting next to each other in a freezer is like shared human DNA, it’s questionable whether it’s value increases upon combination, though if it did, value doesn’t play a role, no high enough value could enslave a woman to pregnancy.

&gt;No, the child(human being) does not exist.

Existence is more abstract than you are letting on, in relation to sentience and perception. If I combine sperm and egg in a Petri dish, it’s a child (even though they can’t survive upon being combined unless implanted or frozen, they cannot survive as an “individual”) but the second before they touch, it isn’t a child?

&gt;Can a newborn in a coma be deprived of life?

Of course. Though, they are biological independent, so we can take measures to keep them alive without the permission of the carrier of the child, so whether something can be deprived of life or not doesn’t play into the legal argument, only a moral argument.
