Under section 3 of the Theft Act 1968, a person commits an offence if:

* payment on the spot for any goods supplied or service done is required or expected of a person;

* he knows that such payment is required or expected; 

* and he dishonestly makes off without having paid as required or expected and with intent to avoid payment of the amount due

If person C is so drunk that they do not “know” that payment is expected, then they do not commit the offence - though you’d have to be rendered utterly insensible through drink to forget that taxis need payment… like, he’d have to be unconscious and unaware that he was in a taxi. Let’s assume that C understands he’s in a taxi and that taxis require payment.

A and B still *took a taxi* - it matters not a jot that they only did so because of C’s “vulnerability”. They know that payment is required from the passengers of a taxi (i.e. them), and they make off.

In my view, all three are jointly liable for paying for the taxi, and if they failed to do so “dishonestly” (rather than, say, by mistake) then all three commit the offence.
