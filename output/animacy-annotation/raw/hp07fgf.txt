Actually, yes. It is. When I see a brother or sister of humanity who is gouged out of thousands of dollars to get treatment to keep them breathing, its quite upsetting. I would absolutely love to have massive reform in corporate tax laws and spending, but our system is too blinded by petty partisan warfare and corrupted by corporate incentives to make any real change happen. All while thousands die, unable to receive treatment or medication, or forced into lifelong debt to stay alive. 


It must be quite amusing to you. 


I'd love to have the US withdraw to 19th century isolationism. If only to watch chaos consume the world as the floodgates of US deterance release Iran, Russia, and China, and whatever warlords emerge from the chaos, to run rampant on the blissfully unaware and smug critics of the US policies. How long would it take for nuclear proliferation to occur until the middle east, Europe, and southeast Asia were just irradiated wastelands? You dont have to pray you never find out, because you have US bases, warships, and satellites to postpone this eventuality. And who foots the bill? That poor fool, unlucky and stupid enough to pay his taxes for the security of the world at large, all the while being victimized by the inadequacy and indifference of the very same government that won't give a damn if he dies without the medication or healthcare to survive the very next week. 

And you have the audacity to laugh at and blame the typical citizen, as if we don't see the problems as clearly as we see the corrupted mechanisms that prevent change.
