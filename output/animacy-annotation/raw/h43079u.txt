Idk if you're Republican or not, you're just making their same old tired arguments. Also amazing how you call out strawmanning in your second paragraph without any thought to how that's exactly what you projected on to me in your first.

&gt; This also is not my argument. I'm calling out the inherent double standard in the above comment in straw-manning capitalism for a failure that the state has also been unable to fix.

I get what you're trying to say I'm just telling you that's not how it always works. Big business has way more power and influence over our state government and the those government officials here in Texas are often on their side at a minimum if not in their pocket. If you think unfettered capitalism will better care for the environment because of personal interest you're incredibly naive and ignorant of how the world works. And yeah, government that's in the pocket of those interests aren't gonna do any better.
