It's a good question. Hard to say which one is my favorite, but I can at least point a spotlight at an under-appreciated one. In Small Gods, everyone, upon seeing a sizeable tortoise with Brutha, tells him "there's good eating on those things." 
First off, it's perfect as a running gag- kinda cute in a dramatic irony sort of way when the first person says it, growing funnier as more people do, getting nearly frustrating when people keep saying it, pushing through until it's really funny again when it just keeps coming up. But that's not why I thought of it.
Literarily, the hag is also a device that shows, no matter their ideals or who they think is good or evil, how everybody in the book is truly equally morally on the same level: a sort of amiable and ignorant-of-the-whole-truth sinner who is nonetheless trying to be friendly. There is,of course,  the very notable exception of the few characters that act differently when first seeing the tortoise, which tells us more about each of them than pages of exposition.
But the BEST part is that, round-world historically, this joke is more true than you'd imagine. Despite the giant galapagos tortoises first being known by europeans in the 1500's, they did not have an official scientific name and taxonomy until 300 years later in the late 1800's, principly because they were such delicious and convenient food sources on ships that none survived a trip back to Europe until then.
