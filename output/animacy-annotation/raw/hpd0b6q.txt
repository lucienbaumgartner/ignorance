I have never said every guy who struggles in the dating world must be some horrible misogynist. Only that men who do tend to be that way, **will** have trouble with dating and relationships. 

Not to mention, there are *many, many* shallow men out there as well. There also many kind, loving and empathetic men, and woman out there too. **So again**, if a person is only able to attract shallow individuals, they need to take a look at themselves. Man or woman.

I'm sorry if that bursts your bubble of "it's not me, women are just bitches".

&gt; I’m sorry, but I don’t work out 5 times a week, eat right and keep my presentation on point to date some fat, lazy loser simply because I’m not tall. Fuck that.

When did I say you had to date some fat, lazy loser?

It's also probably important I mention that presentation isn't the only thing the matters in a relationship. Someone can appear to be put together and of high value, but beneath all the superficial and physical attributes, can lie an abusive, entitled, ignorant, and just overall mean-spirited person. 

While working on your physical health and appearance are important, no amount of exercise and healthy eating will make up for the fact that someone is boring, ignorant, and unpleasant. If all you can seem to find are shallow women who bring nothing to the table, it's because women with depth and value aren't interested in you.

&gt;As a short guy, it’s been made abundantly clear to me that I’m expected to settle across all aspects to have a partner.

Short men aren't unattractive. Short men with an obvious complex though, are a turn off. If you're short, just own it, and the right person won't be bothered by it at all. I know short guys who are in relationships in which they certainly didn't settle.

That said, I'm curious though, would **you** be willing to date a woman who (for example) is tall, has a lot of body hair, thin lips, a big nose, small breasts, or broad shoulders? You clearly view being short as a negative on your SMV. So as a short man, are you willing to make that 'compromise' and date within your own league, or is it only okay for you to have physical preferences?

&gt;How can you not have contempt for such people? And if that drives them away, great. Who the fuck wants them anywhere near you anyway?

Sure, have contempt for bad people. Not sure where I said you had to out to put up with shitty people. To assume though that they're representative of all women (or all men) is nonsensical. I know women who've been used, cheated on and assaulted by men. Should they therefore hold all men in contempt? Of course not.

&gt;The main problem in dating is women bring fuck all to the table but a body that will be used up and worthless by the age of thirty.

Ah, and this is why you seem to be having problems. You view women as deprecating assets who exist to serve you. What do you bring to table? Besides a bad attitude. I've already said it, but why would any woman chose a man who views women this way over a man who treats them with love and respect? Why would any self respecting woman settle for man who will view her as "used up and worthless" by the age of thirty?

&gt;Honestly, if you talk to women and get something more valuable out of it than an empty nut sack, I just think you’re probably a little gay.

Yet here you are, complaining about women being selfish and shallow.

The complete lack of self awareness is astounding.
