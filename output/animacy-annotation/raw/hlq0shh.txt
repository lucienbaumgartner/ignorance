&gt; No, he wasn't. 


He actually believed the world was pear-shaped, in defiance the evidence-based round-earth model that had been accepted fact for more than a thousand years.


In his own words: *"I have now seen so much irregularity, that I have come to another conclusion respecting the Earth, namely, that it is not round as they describe, but of the form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk grows, at which part it is most prominent; or like a round ball upon part of which is a prominence like a woman's nipple."*


Well, I suppose he thought it was *mostly* round at least. A very round pear.


But his belief about distances was far from what was generally accepted.


He was something of a kook.


&gt; You *honsetly think* that the royal family of Spain would have funded the expedition if they thought the man was an idiot?


I never suggested that the royal family of Spain thought he was an idiot.


But they were in a hard situation with Portugal getting a monopoly on the spice trade, so they likely thought it was worth taking a chance.


&gt; Then that idiotic idea that he assumed Native Americans were Indians because *he*, who had never met a South or Southeast Asian native, was a moron is completely ludicrous and ignorant of how first contact between dksparate cultures occurs.


I don't think he was a moron because he couldn't tell the difference between two races of people he never met.


I think he was a moron because he supposedly knew how to navigate based on star positions using a sextant/quadrant but didn't realize he wasn't even on the right continent.


Perhaps I should have called him incompetent rather than a moron.


&gt; Also he didn't "invent the slave trade." That professions is ten thousand years older than him.


Perhaps I should have specified the *American* slave trade. He was the first European slave trader in the Americas, transporting more than 5000 slaves.
