Your Manager should listen and observe more about common practices. Not a good way to start. I am a store manager for TJ Maxx. We have to advocate for associates. Period. Call your DM. Use the open door. And as a side note, remember they are new and unaware of the store so mistakes like this will be made. Compassion and empathy are key here for everyone involved.
