No that's actually a very fair point and one of the reasons why I tolerate my parents as much as I do. I recognize that the time and environment they grew up in is EXTREMELY different from mine. And I agree, change to someone's core beliefs would need to be a slow process for it to be effective. I just think in the current context of the US political climate we need to put some hard lines on what needs to happen. Just one example, since Trump took office people have started to believe that it's ok to be openly racist. An idea that great and many people suffered to change and rectify. So yes, I agree, tolerance and slow subtle changes can bring about progress in an individuals perspective and ideology. Just right now there's alot of problems coming about because we've tolerated the behaviors and ideas of those who are violent, greedy, and ignorant. That needed to be fixed "yesterday". Also, sorry for the wall of text, your comment was thoughtful and engaging lol.
