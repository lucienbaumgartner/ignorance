There are plenty of people who think rationally and concluded that ending their own life is the ideal choice for them and the world/environment.

Besides, as mentioned, death leaves them in a state where they can't be harmed any further while not missing the "joys of life". Hence the personal consequences to them is not an argument. You can't just say "death bad" just for the sake of saying "death bad".

If they're ill but unaware and truly think they want to die, death does not leave them in a worse state.
