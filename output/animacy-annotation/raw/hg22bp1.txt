Nobody wants to give away money. I’m a firm believer in socialised medicine and housing, welfare etc…But even I would  probably jump at the chance to have an extra 3-5grand in my pocket every year, given I’m just barely above the poverty line myself. I gladly accept the tax burden put on me by the government, but if that was not an obligation, I’d probably not go out of my way to burden mysel.

Relying on human altruism is foolish and ignorant of millennia of human history
