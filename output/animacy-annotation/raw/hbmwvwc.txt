The same things could be said for Vivi. Vivi and Momo are both heirs adored by the people, their fated role is to govern their nations, but we are getting to a stage in the story where the enemy will be much beyond the local tyrant, and all their efforts and that of the SHs in ending local (national) oppression will be for nothing if the global system of oppression is not brought down. The real enemy is not Crocodile or Kaido, it is the WG itself. In a way, this vindicates Oden, as his flashback shows him adventuring with Roger while his nation is falling to Kaido, so he is made to look irresponsible and unaware of what the real threat is. In reality, his efforts as part of Roger's crew are what laid the road for the SHs to take on the real enemy of Wano, its ancient enemy from since the Void Century, the WG itself. And Momo, as his successor, would be taking the next, final step in that battle alongside the next Pirate King. As for ruling Wano, he can do that after the journey is over. At the current time, he is mentally a child and is unfit for the role. Wano can still be immediately brought under Kouzuki rule again under Hiyori, who would frankly be much better suited for the task at the moment. One of the main things in character development in OP is that it's not a coming of age story, but it doesn't mean character still don't have a lot to learn. Luffy is already a man sure of his ambitions and with his character formed when he leaves Dawn Island, but his journey teaches him how to be a leader. Similarly, Momo is currently going through his coming of age, but he still has much to learn in being a leader to properly rule Wano, and there is no better way for him to do that than to sail with Luffy and Vivi (and I would also add Jimbei as a wise leader he can learn from).
