Are you kidding me right now?! You’re literally saying that it were the Gazans that started shooting rockets after which Israelis started shooting missiles which are much powered than what Gazans were shooting to “protect themselves”?! Seriously, you need help. 

Israelis randomly started shooting Palestinians when all they were doing was pray during Ramadan in World’s third most holiest site, i.e., Masjid Al-Aqsa. They randomly started firing bullets on Palestinians. Out of boredom and to illegally settle on Palestinian land, the Israelis started firing missiles. Only AFTER which the Gazans started defending themselves and shooting rockets, half of which landed in the desert. 

It’s unbelievable and ignorant of taking the terrorist’s (Israelis) side without educating yourself first! Go read the facts and then come take a stand for Israelis. If you still think you’re right, then you really need help. Sick!
