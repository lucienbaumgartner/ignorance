When you say "aggressive," do you mean boisterous, stubborn, and unaware of his surroundings (like he'll smash through a door while he's playing), or aggressive as in he'll growl and snap in anger (like he's trying to smash through a door because hearing another dog on the other side has triggered rage and he wants to come kill it)?

If it's the former, I wonder if he's going through an extended obnoxious doggy adolescent phase. If it's the latter, that's a bigger problem because it's suggestive that he might be growing into a vicious dog.
