The way I see it Passive Perception is the thing that lets you roll perception. 

Example: an enemy rolls lower than your PP. That warrants a perception check to gain further information. If the enemy rolled higher than your PP you would be unaware and unable to roll for perception. 

Intent comes before the roll and the roll determines the results.
