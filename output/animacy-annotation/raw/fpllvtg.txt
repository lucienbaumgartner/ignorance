Im an introvert and have social anxiety and I would be so annoyed if anybody invited themselves to my home and then insisted on taking a separate trip without the one person I'm comfortable being fully myself around (my SO). I've gotten much better at dealing with my emotions over the years and outright saying when I need alone time, so this probably wouldn't happen to me these days, but when I was younger, and unaware that my annoyance was caused by needing people to leave me tf alone, I would've lashed out and been rude like OPs sister.

Both of them need to communicate better. OP to ask if things are OK or if the sister needs space, and the sister to actually explain what's wrong.
