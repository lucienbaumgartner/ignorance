&gt;2. It’s pretty ignorant and presumptuous of you to imply that the contestants are “incompetent and immoral” just because of how they look

It's pretty ignorant and presumptuous of you to imply that the OP was implying that the contestants are "incompetent and immoral".

The OP clearly stipulated if contestants are, then beauty is not a redeeming characteristic/ feature.

Said contestants with competence and morality, clearly don't need comment, so ofcourse you would only stipulate in the absence of those.

&gt;3. I’m not a fan of beauty pageants either, but would never presume I have the authority or right to stop anyone from holding them.

Same, not a fan. But where society participates I  something unhealthy, we do act to mitigate the damage. Eg we do not let individuals to smoke and drink uncontrollably. We have age limits, drink drive limits, education to advise the dangers.

The arguement here is clearly that beauty pageants are unhealthy and toxic in that they primarily promote an importance of body image.

Therefore, it is a legitimate arguement to suggest should society act to regulate.
