N-no. It's dividing people by skin-color or ethnic background, and then they get treated differently systemically based on that. Systemic racism is a problem, and that's exactly why they like people putting themselves in little groups.

Thinking it's to "mix cultures" is an ignorant and outdated way of looking at it at this point...
