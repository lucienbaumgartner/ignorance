It depends. It has to be very ignorant and offensive for me to say something or walk away. I can bite my tongue and ignore little jabs but full on racism/homophobia? I’m walking away. I know we want to make money but there’s no amount of money in the world for me to tolerate a customer being highly disrespectful or degrading. That’s just me
