Yes. Very good point. Im all for green energy, but nuclear-powered is always the odd man left out because people are ignorant and irrationally fearful. Its by far the best option thats great for the planet. (for the time being at least, until the battery issue and efficiency issues are solved in relation to other, more publicly favorable, green options.)
