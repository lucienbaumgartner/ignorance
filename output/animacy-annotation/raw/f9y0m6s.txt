Telling a child who's being bullied to just fight back or attack them is telling them it's your problem, you sort it out. Blaming them by telling them they're the cause because they're not fighting back and isolating them by telling them only they can fix it. While reinforcing the attitude that problems can be solved by lashing out with violence. 

I took the fight over flight route and got regular hiding and it was written off as 'fighting'.

Violence is a solution for people who do understand the problem and its sad that in this day and age there's adults still so fucking thick and ignorant that they'd tell a child to attack someone to solve a problem.
