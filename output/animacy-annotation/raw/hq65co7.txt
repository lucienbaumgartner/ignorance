That we don’t travel internationally enough. I know on its face that we don’t and it makes us seem ignorant and complacent. However, no one ever takes in to account that we, mostly, don’t get paid vacation or guaranteed time off. If I get time off miraculously at the same time as my husband, it’s usually max two to three days over a holiday.
