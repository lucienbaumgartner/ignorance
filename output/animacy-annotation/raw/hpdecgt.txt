I'm not necessarily atheist per se, but I'm not religious either. From what I have experienced, people who claims that they're devout [insert any religious belief] are the most insufferable, inconsiderate, narrow minded, ignorant and dangerous people. And the experience lasted long enough to convince me that, IF there's this God figure in any form or shape, it just doesn't care at all what happens to its creation.

What's good with God if it can't draw goodness from the people that claims to believe in it?
