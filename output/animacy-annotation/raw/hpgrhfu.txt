&gt;Yes and Iâ€™ll do it again if you keep acting like a braindead buffoon
  


I find it ironic that you're the one calling me "braindead" when I'm the person who's saying that kids *shouldn't* be allowed to gamble. But hey, have fun saying ableist slurs and holding hands with your fellow ableists who can't muster an ounce of empathy for anyone!

&gt;Also, itâ€™s literally the childrens fault for buying the bundle. You canâ€™t say just because theyâ€™re â€žinnocentâ€œ and â€žignorantâ€œ that they arenâ€™t at fault.

Let's say someone is babysitting a ten year-old, but is neglectful and leaves a bunch of Advil mixed in with candy on the counter. The unknowing ten year-old with a naturally low wisdom score then eats the candy and Advil and gets sick- so who's at fault here? The person charged with the care of this child who can't care for themselves, or the innocent and ignorant *child* for ""willingly"" ingesting the Advil?

Any reasonable person can agree that CrownsIsle's pet bundles are a scam. They are insanely overpriced for what little they offer, and only those who don't know any better would purchase such a thing. Tell me, how is it the victim's fault for buying these scams when CrownsIsle is the one manipulating people into buying them?

&gt;Youâ€™re talking in a circle and blatantly ignored my arguments. Like brother you even quoted the segment where I literally refute your arguments, yet youâ€™re not acknowledging it.

Says the person who is refusing to believe that lootboxes are gambling and can cause gambling addictions, despite all of my sources. ðŸ¤¡
