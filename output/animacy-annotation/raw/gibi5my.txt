I literally didn't say that all products should come the same box, and it is dishonest and ignorant of you to say so. If you want to rephrase what I was saying then at least take the honest intent of my message:  Products shouldn't have a bunch of dead air in them. 

The dead air is deceptive and wasteful.

No amount of writing on the box changes that. You are willfully ignoring people who can't read whatever language the box is in. This world has illiterate people, dyslexic people, and people who speak other languages. There's also a pollution problem a bunch of extra packaging contributes to. There are a also people who just want to grab a quick snack or buy a quick gift. You're pretty much saying: fuck those people and the environment because we should all be cynical and shouldn't ever expect decency from people and that makes you an asshole.
