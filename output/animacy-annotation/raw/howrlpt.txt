We only see what we are shown. Meaning, social media is not always real life or the full story. The details of Aldo and L's relationship are only known to them. As is any other relationship. At the end of the day and behind closed doors it's just the two of them. No one should judge any relationship based on outward appearances and especially social media. The end.

I see Aldo's point in trying to bring attention to Atlas and his unethical, unprofessional and questionable practices as a coach. He has a very large following of bikini athletes who have drank the Kool-aid and basically signed a deal with the devil. A lot of these girls are more than likely unaware and oblivious to what has and is currently happening with his former athletes. This could easily happen to them as well and I believe Aldo is trying to sound the alarm. L is obviously limited in what she can and cannot say right now due to whatever suit she has been served. However it seems Aldo is not effected by and can speak more freely on the matter. 

L's choice in men and relationships are her own journey. She has to go down these paths by herself. That is life and part of being a growing person. So theorize and speculate all you want, this is L's journey and what she decides to share is entirely up to her.
