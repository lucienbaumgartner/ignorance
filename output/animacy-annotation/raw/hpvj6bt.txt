&gt; Cool, but most of the time, it’s not gender/dysphoria issues

Yea, see that's what's called a baseless speculation. 

&gt; And honestly, for you to tell me that because I’m ‘cis’ I can’t speak on this is just wrong.

No, actually it's wrong for a cis person to completely write off someone else possibly having gender issues rather than consider all options. And bully for you having felt dysphoria, would you like an award? For someone who claims to have an understanding of the issue you sure come across as an ignorant and transphobic ass.

&gt; and I’m tired of people always pulling the trans/gender card

Oooh, I bet you say the same thing about the race card. Not a cute look, but hey let  your transphobe flag fly. It just makes your opinion easier to ignore.

&gt; If she believed she were trans, she would’ve posted this in a trans or dysphoria sub.

I didn't know what being trans was at her age. Nice assumption though.

&gt; I can use whatever terminology I like

Sure can! And I can call you out for your bullshit in response! Isn't it just great! I sure think it is!
