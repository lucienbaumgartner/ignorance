Socialism might not be good, but it is strange that so many of the examples of bad socialism that people go for online are simply examples of private businesses operating under capitalist systems. Why not refer to a historical or modern day example of a socialist economic system failing?

My theory is that these folks are so sheltered and ignorant that all they really know about are things in their own country. They can’t offer good criticisms of socialism or Communism because they don’t know what those things are. That’s why they argue that Facebook is socialist even though Facebook has nothing to do with the socialism.
