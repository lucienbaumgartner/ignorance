Because our Constitution is outdated. Back then, when the vast, vast majority of the voting population were uneducated and unaware of matters outside their immediate region, electing representatives made sense.

Now, when basically everyone has a base of education, huge swathes of our population are even college educated, and everyone has instant access to unlimited information, politicians have become an outdated, useless profession. Imagine a democracy where everyone could just vote for bills directly, conveniently and easily from their phones.
