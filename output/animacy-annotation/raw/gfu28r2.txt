I understand the themes and the message, I just didn’t enjoy the way in which those themes played out through circumstance. I didn’t like how those themes were shoved down our throats as if we already didn’t know these problems existed. I could almost say that the film was made for those that are sheltered and unaware of the complications of the world.
