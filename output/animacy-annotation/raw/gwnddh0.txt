Ok first of all — this is a lesson. Absorb that so you can stop panicking. You sound incredibly young.


• always move money from those platforms quickly, because people can do that and in which case you can dispute it but when the money isn’t there it’s a different process than them just taking the money back.

• always do MONEY ORDER for rent with roommates, especially ones you don’t know well

• the deposit shouldn’t be only $600, if there are no other damages to the property it’s time to negotiate with the landlord who sounds like a college slum lord trying to intimidate you from the entire deposit 

• you need to stop being scared, start with her name and last name along with general idea of the state she lives in. I’m not going to disclose what I do for a living but if you need help getting her info PM me. Her parents should be aware of her less than responsible behavior and if her name is on the lease she can be held liable. It sounds like she’s also young and unaware of how shitty her behavior is.

• small claims only an option if your state allows rent to be pursued via small claims if not, then it gets complicated 
• is your father your only point of contact? Do you have any other family who can loan you the money that you can pay back bi-weekly? 

Worst case is you have to haggle for the deposit back and you can but you NEED to read that lease and know what you signed.
