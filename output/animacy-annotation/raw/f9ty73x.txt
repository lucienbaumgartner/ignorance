As a single, practicing Catholic woman, yes!
I’m upset by people’s chatter right there in pews, loud and unaware that this is still God’s sanctuary, His presence indicated by a lit candle near the altar or tabernacle.
But right outside, absolutely. A comment on the way, like “can I talk to you for a moment, outside?” should be enough. “Can I buy you coffee?” not so much, in my opinion. 

But I’ve wondered the same thing, where are the good, Catholic men and how/where are we supposed to meet?!

My parish, and the few within 30 mins drive, have a “widows circle” or “singles group” attended by seniors (not the high school type). That’s all. 
Bible studies would be a perfect place to see how each one thinks and their fundamental beliefs, while we all grow closer to God, except all churches here have segregated groups –girls here, boys there.
