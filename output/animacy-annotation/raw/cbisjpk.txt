Well on the first point let's face it humanity does not want clean energy. Not only is next gen nuclear totally buried by environmentalist bigotry but the public sees radiation as magic that kills you. They're uneducated and unaware that coal plants produce like 100 times more then the average nuclear plant. So if the world went Manhattan project on Fusion or we'd have it by now yes. 

And let's not even talk about Throium and liquid reactors or 2 fuel reactors such...

I can't really agree that Nuclear would be somehow more expensive then Fusion. 

The problem in this project is, it too good to be true. 2/3 of it is pure electricity 1/3 is Xrays. It's small as fuck and it produces energy out of well almost nothing. Some people might scream ECAT or Rossini and such. 

But yes I do agree it should get funding and it should be looked into. But I'm not American and I don't really get a say in it. Even if it was EU I wouldn't get much of a say in it either.
