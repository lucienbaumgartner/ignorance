Holy fuck. I’m so sorry you had to deal with such a scumbag. What a total tone deaf thing to say/do.

Do you have this person’s number and/or are you going to have to see them again in a similar setting? I know you said you didn’t say much at the time and that’s totally ok, you were caught off guard and probably just shocked that a human person could say something like that. If it were me, I might seriously consider sending them a text to let them know how horribly insensitive and ignorant that behavior was - not only to protect yourself from them in the future but also to make sure this asshole doesn’t ever say some shit like that to anyone else. Not that anyone should have to tell someone that kind of comment isn’t ok! Damn!
