This was an unprovoked and uneccessary "attack" by her on a child. If she does that in public view, who knows that she does at work, behind a closed door? Her company is 1,000% correct for removing her from her position before she becomes a direct internal liability. She's already a PR problem. Better for everyone if she is somewhere that aligns with her values.

On the other hand, if she was a good person, she would have been wearing a mask at a large function and no one would have seen her face to identify her. She's also too dumb and unaware of herself and surroundings to have a job with any responsibility.
