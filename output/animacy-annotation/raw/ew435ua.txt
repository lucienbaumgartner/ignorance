I was dating a guy who I thought would make a decent enough husband down the line. Didn't know that "decent enough" wasn't the same thing as "my soulmate". He made me happy(ish) and his depression got dramatically better as we were together. Things were okay until he cheated on me with some skinny blonde college bimbo he had only just met. I tried to leave but he started threatening suicide and made me afraid to go. I was young and unaware that he was trying to manipulate and guilt trip me into accepting his bad behavior. I did end up leaving but maintained a close watch on him through our mutual friends because I was still worried. He never tried anything dark and attempted a relationship with the blonde bitch but got rejected. He can't even stand to look me in the eyes now. Every time we pass each other in public it's like we're total strangers. I don't regret leaving. My own mental health and self-confidence isn't the greatest yet but I know that I deserve more than a manipulative cheating ass.
