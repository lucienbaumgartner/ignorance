You dimwits are arguing that it is an infringement on your right to travel to require a vaccine shot to get on a plane, and I don’t know law but you do.  

Please - find me a single judge in all of western civilization who agrees with you.  Please.  I will wait.  Public health restrictions trump most rights because your rights end where the interfere with someone else’s.  Your right to travel cannot be used to give you the right to put other people’s lives at risk.  You don’t have the right to drive on the wrong side of the street.  You don’t have the right to fly a plane without a license.  You don’t have the right to drive drunk - all for the same reason you do not have the right to get on a plane unvaccinated.  Your argument is juvenile and ignorant of the law and just plain old stupid.
