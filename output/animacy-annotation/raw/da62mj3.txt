I go through the same thing, and I understand that my family doesn't get what I'm going through because I don't communicate with them. They're a big reason of why I am the way I am, and I've thought about cutting off contact several times, but I just don't know if it would make anything better.

They fucked me up, but I know they didn't mean to if that makes any sense. They were shit parents because they're unaware and stubborn, not necessarily because they're bad people which makes it even harder for me to get pissed because it's like yelling at a brick wall. It doesn't go through.

Hope all is well with you man. It gets better.
