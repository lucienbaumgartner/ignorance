Who, exactly, do you think is interested in pursuing criminal charges against the former President? The “rest of the world” seems to be ignorant and naive and only paying attention when the media screams loudest. We have been sold out to the military industrial complex. The media is a propaganda machine and the army are a bunch of mercenaries. The politicians are just the soulless, depraved con-men dastardly enough to step in and profit from America’s downfall. The illusion is not real, but the magicians are. Why would a bunch of magicians come together to give away trade secrets just to screw over one of their own?
