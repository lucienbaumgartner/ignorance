We've been trying to work with them from the begining, and even some trying to outpace them when the first tactic didn't work. Victim blaming the women in the work force for not "trying hard enough to work with the men" is ignorant and insulting. There's studies and physical proof showing that even in women dominated work forces men are *still* preferred. And of coursed preferred in male dominated sections as well. 

I could go on but honestly your comment was just very pompous and ignorant of the real issue.
