There is only one problem player in our group. He is a rather loud guy. He also loves wine, and after a glass or two he gets even louder. Unless he is DMing, he can't focus on one thing. Because of this he was DMing, but then 'ran out' of time to prepare. Sometimes he walks away from the table during combat, other times he just starts side conversations with other players. The problem with his side conversations is that not only are they distracting, but he's so loud and unaware that the table often ends up just stopping altogether until he gets the hint because it's no use trying to talk over a person who will simply talk louder.

He also is very easily offended. For some context, we are (almost) all post-grad fraternity brothers. Most of us have lived together at some point in time, so if we have something to say to one another, there isn't much tact. We decided one week that we'd play on a Tuesday. As such nobody should drink that night, as per our running joke that drinking on a Tuesday leads too bad things. He took this as an attack on himself and stated, "I wasn't even drunk" to which all other players explained that drunk or not, he was VERY loud.

After that he decided that he no longer wanted to play. Whatever I guess. He has done this in the last, just decides that we're assholes and he doesn't want to join us.

Here's where it's weird. He lives in the house that we play in with 2 other players. So while we play dnd he sits in the next room over, and yells input from the other room. We are discussing a rule, he throws in his two sense. He knows what monster we're fighting, he yells the name from the living room. It's all really strange.

Part of me hopes this break of his is permanent.
