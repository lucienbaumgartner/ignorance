I originally thought he sounded like a shill - we are heavily brigaded - but looking at his history he's definitely a Trump supporter. What can I say? Fuck him. He is doing god's work arguing for us in the other subs though lol.

Yes, it's always funny when liberals run out of arguments. And that's exactly the sad thing. We're all boxed into our own little categories, like you just did to yourself. Instead of being just 'a guy', you're 'a Mexican-Arabian immigrant underprivileged bla bla bla'. Instead of being 'a guy' I'm a 'white male conservative bla bla bla'.

It makes it easy for liberals to dismiss arguments, and just go for the Uncle Tom slur, or Uncle Juan or straight white male or  whatever the hell they use.

You're dangerous to the Democrats and Republicans because you're a free thinker. In the wikileaks it was revealed that Democrats wanted an 'unaware and compliant citizenry'. We are guilty of groupthink though too. I was downvoted today because I said I didn't agree with Wilders banning the Qaran.

It's funny how they block you. They pretty much block me, too, because I just laugh at SJWs. They criticize me for being too white and liking hockey and country music. I just laugh and don't give a shit. I know hockey is a predominantly white sport. If other people want to watch it that's fine. If they don't, that's fine too. I watch it because I'm a fan, not to boost my diversity and cultural enrichment portfolio lol.

The only way to beat the game is to not participate.
