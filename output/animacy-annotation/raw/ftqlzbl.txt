How many kids will even know it was cancelled? I know I didn't notice as a young kid. I did eventually grow tired of the same episodes airing and eventually stop watching them. As an adult I realized that happened because they got cancelled. But as a kid I was blissfully unaware and satisfied with reruns. Why even tell your kid to upset them?
