Imagine being so anti-American that you demand people swear allegiance to a politician. 

And not just to any politician, to sippy cup Caligula.

Imagine being so stupid and ignorant that you call anyone who isn't loyal to said politician a traitor and a "communist". 

Well, you don't have to imagine. You just have to call yourself a Republican
