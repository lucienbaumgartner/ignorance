It’s pretty straightforward. If you put a rule in place for the people, you are to abide by such rule, correct. If you or I decided against it, there are ramifications. Executive privilege does not make sense as an excuse in this matter as the rule was to prevent spread of a deadly disease. The insinuation here is that either a) they feel they are above the law and willfully comfortable with the spread of the disease or b) they didn’t think this was a big deal. Either way the picture here painted is ‘one rule for thee and another for me’ and it IS a deadly disease and in having such gatherings, runs a fair chance of spreading a disease that at that point, they knew little about. Boris caught Covid, as did some of his team. The rules in place were to minimize stretching the health services. In meeting like this you’re running a high chance of further stretching those health services, no? The impact of this is what frustrates me. There are soooo many people who will see this and think ‘well if they’re not bothered, why should I be’ and that will just further the spread of this disease. Now, that stance is stupid, ignorant and immature, but it’ll happen and is already happening (and agree or disagree with that stance, is irrelevant, as they have helped develop that thought process). So there is my issue. It undermines them as rule makers and people in positions of elected power. In your example of whether someone cheats etc, no. I’m not expecting a saint, people are people. However, if you’re caught doing something you shouldn’t and are an elected official, you have to own up to it and face the ramifications. They clearly are not owning up to this, the extend of these ‘business meetings’ the frequency and the fact that it exploits their own rules. And in doing so aren’t facing ramifications.
