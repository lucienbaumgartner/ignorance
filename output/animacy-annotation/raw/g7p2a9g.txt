No it’s called calling out a pompous Canadian who is shoving his nose in other countries political landscape while simultaneously thumbing his nose at an entire population of people.

You really think you’re that right? You’re that narcissistic and ignorant that you’re actually saying an entire side of a political spectrum is wrong, because you don’t agree with them? 

Worry about Canada ya fucking lump of shit.
