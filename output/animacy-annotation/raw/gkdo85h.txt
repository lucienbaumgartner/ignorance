Cougars don’t necessarily take wolves out of desperation, just opportunity. If one of your chief competitors and enemies wanders into your territory, without any backup, you’d take that chance to take him out. That’s one less competitor. However, no amount of desperation would make a cougar go out of its way to hunt a wolf unless the circumstances are perfect (the wolf being alone and unaware of the cougars presence). To do otherwise would risk an encounter with a pack, and that’s not a fight a cougar stands to win. Besides, there are easier targets and cougars are more than capable of subsisting off of smaller prey.

In my opinion, it’ll be the same story with jaguars. While a Jaguar will certainly kill a lone wolf should the opportunity present itself, but they generally won’t actively seek out wolves, even in desperation. They test their luck too many times, and they might run into a pack of wolves. Even a male North American jags would want to fight that, for risk of injury.
