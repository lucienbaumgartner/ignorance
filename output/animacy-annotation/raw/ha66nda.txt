&gt; they kinda were geniuses. 

I had a history teacher a million years ago who said "the late 18th century was the last time in history where a person could literally know *everything* that mattered." You had quite a few high-level scholar-statesmen, speaking 4+ languages, knowing science, philosophy, business, military, farming, diplomacy, etc. 

They were geniuses for sure. And they build a phenomenal system.

That system was just stress tested by a psychopathic idiot. Next time, it might be tested by someone smarter. You know people like Josh Hawley have been taking notes this whole time. I worry that a 250-year-old system won't keep us safe from someone who actually understands how to manipulate it.

The book is good. I can see how it would be infuriating. I thought it  filled in the contours of stories we already know - and gave a lot of the background color. 

It does a good job of showing why various people didn't come forward. For many of them... they were only involved in a couple episodes, not the whole story. A good amount of them were pro-Trump and still are. There are a few people who were pro-Trump, but also not interested in any of his election fraud stuff (like Barr, Pence, and Jason Miller). Some people who end up looking good, like Redfield, Fauci, Milley, Wray, Haspel, and Esper. Some people were trying to protect Trump from the world and vice versa. 

Most people just seem like they are trying to weather a storm and do good things. Trump, Giuliani, and Stephen Miller are the only people who come off almost universally unflattering. Miller is just reprehensible. Giuliani is awful, but feels driven by age, financial issues and alcoholism. Trump is pretty terrible, but you can also see how he built the cage he's trapped in, which is sad. Lots of times, he's not trying to be evil or anything... he's just very, very self-interested and ignorant of how everything works.
