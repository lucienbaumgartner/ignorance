Like someone else stated it really depends on what absolute filth is to you. Dirty clothes piles, dirty dishes in the sink, dirt on floors?… while messy to most it wouldn’t be considered absolute filth, and from what I’ve read CPS wouldn’t see concern there. Now dirty dishes absolutely everywhere, animal or human feces everywhere, bug and/or roach issues, etc, then yes they’d consider that absolute filth. Unfortunately my daughter’s dad’s place is like that. And he just seems completely oblivious and unaware of it. Like I can be messy but it eventually bothers me, and I could never just live with cockroaches crawling on my counters and stuff
