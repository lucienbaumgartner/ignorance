Its about an inspector with gadgets who catches criminals but the gag is that he's incompetent and unaware of his idiocy, his neice Penny and her dog have to secretly solve the case behind his back without him knowing and he always gets the credit at the end of the episode.

The main villain of the show is Claw, a guy with a claw for a hand who wants to kill gadget.
