&gt;I’m going to chime in here, with no bias, 

Are you sure about that?

&gt;and say you are being very close minded and biased.

I'm giving real data and actual facts.

&gt;It would be very wise to take a moment to stop and actually listen to what so many people are trying to tell you. 

Why? They are telling things that are demonstrably not true. 

&gt;But you’re human, so my guess is you’ll stubbornly dig your head in the sand.

Address the facts, the data, I have given.

Insulting me doesn't prove you're right. Quite the opposite. 

&gt;This Israeli Palestine conflict is so bad because so many people involved are being so ignorant and short sighted. The way you are arguing with people in this thread is a good example as to why progress isn’t being made.

Yet you're insulting only me, you're blaming only me.

You're definitely speaking from bias.
