What I put out here online and how I behave at work or when looking for a new job two entirely different things. And I find it absurd that we’re gonna sit here and hold two groups of people to 2 entirely different standards. Customers can be as rude, entitled, and obnoxious as they want but the workers have to bite their tongues and put on a happy face and simply take it. Just because the customers aren’t being paid doesn’t mean they get to be so rude and ignorant, that they shouldn’t exercise at least a modicum of decency.
