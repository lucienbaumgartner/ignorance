I’m sorry but that’s an abhorrently racist view in my opinion. 

Many young white South Africans weren’t even born during apartheid and many working class white South Africans never had any power within the SA white establishment. 

You can’t justify extreme racial violence such as rapes and murders on grounds of ‘sins of the father’. 

It’s akin to say it would be fine for Arabs to try genocide Israeli Jews since they are technically also a settler-colonialist movement. 

The sad reality of the prominence of these sorts of anti-white views in SA is that it not only undermines the ‘Rainbow Nation’ concept that anti-apartheid activists claimed to be fighting for but it also undermines the white anti-apartheid allies who were absolutely instrumental in helping to end it. 

And it validates their white critics who accused such anti-apartheid white allies of been naive and ignorant of the danger they were allegedly creating for the white SA community. 

Extreme racial violence against ethnic minorities such as white South Africans is never okay and never justifiable regardless of history.
