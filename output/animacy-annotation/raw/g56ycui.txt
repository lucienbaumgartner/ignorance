Do you think it could be related to this? This seems sinister. IMHO

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* **conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry**. *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "*

And John Podesta is no lowly stooge, but would have very likely been *Chief of Staff to the President*, had Clinton won in 2016.  So, I just wonder why the Democrats would conspire to produce unawareness?

The only thing I can offer is this, as an example:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

You can see Eric Weinstein (a former Lefty) pick up on that "sleight of hand" and try to educate his younger listeners by explaining to them that "Super Delegates have nothing to do with Diversity and Inclusiveness", listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast (or start at 2:58).

So, in order to get something over like that, you have to ***"treat voters like mushrooms: keep them well manured in in the dark"***.

And since you are the "Cerebral Gladiator", with a lot of intelligence, what do you think?
