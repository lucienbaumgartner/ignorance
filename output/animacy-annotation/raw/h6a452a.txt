It's sort of funny because the Vaughn family is doing the exact OPPOSITE of what they think they're doing. By going on and on and on about Kimberly's family being awful, controlling and crazy, to a frankly laughable extent (her mom was a bad cook??? Who fucking cares??), all I can think now is that THEY are the family that is awful, controlling &amp; crazy. Additionally, by piling on Kimberly, describing what a terrible person she is, and how their son, according to them, is the single greatest person who ever existed...I now think CHRIS is a total douchebag asshole, without even hearing word one from him. Anyone who deflects and blames and points the finger that much, without even realizing it, has to be the ones who are actually at fault. 

Also, even if they are convinced their son is innocent, they're describing him as a literal perfect person, with a perfect life, and i hate to be captain obvious, but no one is perfect. How they could be so obtuse and unaware that painting the picture that he was a complete angel makes them sound ridiculous is beyond me. I doubt they would admit that he ever put the toilet paper roll on the wrong way, so utterly convinced are they that he's a flawless, gifted, ambitious, selfless, perfect son, father and husband. 

The podcast is gross for letting the family ramble for so long like this. As others have said, so Kimberly's immediate family wouldn't comment. But did they not even bother to look for friends or coworkers who would participate?? Anyone to counter the Vaughn's offensive and surely inaccurate side of the story.
