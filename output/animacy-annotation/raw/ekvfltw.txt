This is unfortunate as they likely dont have access to vaccinations, not the mention the luxury of being so ignorant that they can choose to refuse them. 

This is why antivaxxers are frustrating. Back when small pox and polio were everywhere, and a tangible threat, people jumped at the chance for immunity. Now people are so stubborn and ignorant that they ignore proven science and spit on it until they need it.

Like people who are opposed to antibiotics or pharmaceuticals until they're septic. Or in cancer patients delaying treatments in favor of trying alternative, unproven, options due to stigma. (Don't get me wrong alternative therapies have a place in treatment, not all are snake oil scams I know) unfortunatly when they realize they should've pursued chemo or radiation it is now too late and they now have more cancerous cells than liver.

It's a strange world we live in, trust your doctors friends. To quote some random pediatrician I heard on the radio one time speaking out against antivaxxers suggesting they're bought and paid for by big pharma "we didn't study and work for near a decade to hurt children for profit".
