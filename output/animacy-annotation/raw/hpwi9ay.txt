“Now can you provide me with an explanation based on the clips I sent you?”

Are seriously that stupid that you expect me to go down to your level to judge by your irrational illogical judgement ? By using a cutted small clip from a whole lesson ? Like I’m just gonna let you go that easy ?.... You go and find the lesson and then bring your argument., Otherwise you’re wasting my time. 

You clearly don’t want to put the effort and face your reality and also don’t want to admit that your judgement is an illogical &amp; irrational. This indicates that you’re arrogant and extremely ignorant and you have nothing to stand on in reality which shows and indicates you are disingenuous since you don’t want to judge by a sound reasonable judgement because you don’t want to make a laughingstock out of yourself. And your arrogant and pride doesn’t allow you to admit &amp; accept that you are wrong. 

Your persistence even shows that. 

I’m not going to bother to reply back to you since we’ve been going back and forth and your arrogance just keeps on revealing itself much clearer every time.
