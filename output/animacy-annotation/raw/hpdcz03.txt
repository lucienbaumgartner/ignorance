This is (a) ignorant and hypocritical on your end to compare two different cities (like you accused OP of doing) but also to use Baltimore as your slum example instead of a rundown street in DC, but also (b) Baltimore and DC as 4 times that distance apart.

It doesn't matter that they are two different places in the same city, it's the same city and this is actually a great example of the point OP was getting at. Just because you don't like the reality of the situation doesn't mean you have to be actively in denial about it.
