Most rap is so incoherent and ignorant that it makes my first grade school journal look like a work of Shakespeare.  When I've asked people why they like rap/hip-hop/etc., they say they like it for the "beat".  So ignorant and repugnant.  It's like people are okay with the disgusting subject matter and illiteracy of these fucks.
