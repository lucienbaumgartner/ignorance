Why would you talk to the owner about it yourself? "Hello neighbor. I know we've never met, but I just wanted to inform you of your blatant negligence of this tree that is clearly and utterly blocking the sidewalk. Now that somebody has brought it to your attention, will you do something about it?" There's a remote possibility that the responsible person is disabled, unaware, and unable to ask someone to take care of it; but it's most likely that the homeowner is a negligent, selfish, jerk. Either way, let the police sort it out since dealing with stuff like this is their specialty, not yours.
