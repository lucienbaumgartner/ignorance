What stigma is that? That life is better without having STDs?

You sound like you’re advocating for having and spreading chronic infectious diseases like herpes. You must realize how crazy and ignorant that sounds?

It’s fine if *you* have it. It doesn’t make you less of a person. But that doesn’t mean everyone should just go out catch it now, because you don’t mind it. 

I personally like not having herpes and the only thing I’m *positive* of, is that I’d like to remain herpes free.
