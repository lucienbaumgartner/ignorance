Ok so your answer to the above is basically "nu uh". I figured.  


&gt;
&gt;When you cant work anywhere, you cant live. Current policies quite literally mean die or be vaccinated. That's obviously wrong.

If you are in the US, there is no mandate that says you must be vaxxed to work. You are being a drama queen.  Companies with 50 or more employees must require vaccination or testing. There are many options for work for people who don't want the vaxx. It will just be more difficult.  

This feels new to you because you're young and ignorant of history.  Vaccine mandates for schooling or work are literally as old as the US itself.  You've simply allowed yourself to get whipped into a frenzy and become terrified of something that is actually very normal.  

So,  why were you not terrified of other vaccine mandates? No matter where you live in the US, you have had to prove vaccine status to live a normal life.  Literally since the day you were born.  But you didn't have lunatics on YouTube instructing you to panic before.
