&gt;maybe actually watching the trial swung some peoples views? idk the media was terrible on that one

I agree with you on the media thing lol, but yeah, my hope is that as details were revealed through the trial, enough people realized that hey, this guy was defending himself. I've seen some people say the prosecution sucked, and that he shouldn't have been there in the first place, but ultimately, his verdict was correct.

But that's what's *supposed* to happen! Thing happens, details emerge about thing, public learns details, public comes to a reasonable conclusion.

I think this entire episode kind of puts to the lie this concept that the public is so dumb and ignorant that they couldn't possibly learn what really happened through watching or reading about the trial.

Encouraging, imho.
