She goes to a daycare where she gets social development, goes to playgrounds and on little local outdoor trips etc there. She just hasn't been in stores or gone to zoos, museums, etc. She was only old enough to appreciate it for the past year and we did other outdoor things instead like camping (hard to get reservations with COVID to do more), state parks etc. So shut up with your high holiness with my doing my child harm, she doesn't know what these things even are and she is happy and ignorant of everything. It's probably more my sadness that I haven't gotten to show her the joy of all these bonus things. You want to talk about harm, it's the millions of kids who have been sequestered entirely at home the last 2 years. I have risk factors for COVID, my mom would die if she got COVID, her half brother has literally been banned from visiting from Europe, and it's not only about her.

And to be clear, my point about others' comments was both that I'm too cautious and not cautious enough at the same time. Because judgemental morons are always right there to no matter you do (case in point). And the general public can't even be asked to do the most minor things to keep the unvaccinated-not-by-choice safe.
