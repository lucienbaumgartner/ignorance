That's how we met and knew each other for years. Again, just because it wouldn't work for you doesn't mean it wouldn't work for anyone. No one is forcing you to date someone you know only through the internet, but don't tell others it can't work for them. 

It did for me. My feelings for her then were just as real as they are now. I'm glad I can live with her now, but it doesn't invalidate what we had before we met in person, and it's very rude and ignorant of you to say otherwise.
