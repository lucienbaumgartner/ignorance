I'm starting to think I'm talking to a dick. 

Keep believing your Russia lies with no evidence. We will see who comes out right.

You just lost another election where the republican bodyslammed somebody the night before. Nobody believes your bullshit narratives anymore. 

You are weak minded and aren't capable of making your own conclusions. You are the perfect specimen to believe propaganda.

In the DNC emails they gave their opinions about their voters,

"weâ€™ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."

Sounds like you're being quite the good little voter there.
