Context is important. 

The racism here is to show that Stormfront is a villain. It brings out and comments on the idea that some people in our world would smile at you and convince you they're good people but are terrible deep down. It's different from the rest of the Seven because those guys you immediately could assume a fakeness because of the heavy corporate connections.

But Stormfront is presented as this anti-corporate greed, feminist, public voice. The reveal was to show the scary notion that we don't really know the people we're around. Like neighbours and families of serial killers who "didn't know" or "couldn't believe" that the person they knew did the things they did.

Racism is racism, yes and it is bad. And the point is showing that Stormfront is a bad person that we should not glorify.

As a conversational standpoint, it's there to provide us, the audience (those who were not aware of the comics or the website), to mull on the feeling of betrayal. For those that were both aware and unaware of the Nazi connections, it's there to smack the idea that Nazi's are evil.
