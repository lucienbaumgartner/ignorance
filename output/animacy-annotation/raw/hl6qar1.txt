U r totally right. And I personally never ride my bike on on campus cause I do training for races so I hit roads a bit farther out. But for any cycling on campus, u r either an ass for being on the sidewalk or ur ass for being on the road. And when u r on the road, following the laws of the road. Cars are buzzing by u unsafley, cars honk at u, cars often ignore pedestrian crossings and stopsigns more than bikes and yes I know that's cause there is more cars but it's true. And also, have u ridden a bike. Coming to a full stop, especially on older pad breaks is very hard to do quickly. When I'm a pedestrian on campus, I'm also not just walking across crossings with my head down and not paying attention, I'm crossing while being aware of what's happening which includes if a cyclist is gojng down hill, I'll wait an extra HALF a second before starting my crossing. Everyone just needs to be more aware of their surroundings and have more empathy for the other side. And to add to that last point, it's just so unlikely for both the cyclist to be entirely unaware of the situation and a pedestrian to be entirely blind and unaware of the road, for a cyclist to somehow hit a person. The profiles of most bikes r quite small. If people ON ALL SIDES, CARS BIKES MOTOR BIKES WALKERS SKATEBOARDERS ANYONE FUCKING ALWAYS PAYS ATTENTION AND LOOKS OUT FOR THEMSELVES WE WONT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS. Thank u for listening to my Ted talk.
