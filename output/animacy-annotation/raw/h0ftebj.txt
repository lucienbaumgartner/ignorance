Well I doubt I would have a really nice conversation with you because you seem very delusional and unaware of what you said. Either you are not aware what you said or you are very very delusional.
Unless you are ready to be so stuck up on your narrative an dhe open minded, we two will never have a proper conversation. Also, you are a hypocrite saying that I assume things when you yourself CLEARLY ASSUME THINGS AND ASSUMED THEM EVEN NOW! You just assumed I act like this to people when is actually not true at all and trust me it would show, but it doesn't show cause I do not act bad at all in real life. I used to hate myself because of people like you but thanks to a friend and some of my coworkers, I know that I am not a bad guy at all
