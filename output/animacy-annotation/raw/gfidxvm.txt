Yeah I don't understand how anyone can support a business structure like this, people supporting thus will just cheapen sales and retail jobs and making other businesses to see too how lucrative it's to abuse their sales people instead with not giving them any salary and benefits because people are so stupid and ignorant that they don't see the problem. 

 I'm so angry, these people who support the mlm business structure are absolutely disgusting, I just don't get why people don't see how important getting benefits when you get sick or old as example is these mlms give nothing, instead they work you to death and you do it for free, this blows my mind every time. I want to scream in thus persons ear to wake up and see how stupid this is, how can anyone be okay with people working and risking debt instead of getting a salary ðŸ¤¬

So many sales and retail people already work in horrible conditions (and it's probably even worse for the people in the factories who create the products, shitty salaries and often underage) why this specially makes me so angry, I don't want all these workers to get it worse (most big corporates seem disgusting and unethical and do anything to cut costs) and then these ignorant people support even more unethical business practeses when it's already bad.
