Note: Yuri Bezmenov was a High Level KGB defector in 1970. He was the former lead KGB propagandist and he left Russia because he feared what was being done with something called Ideological Subversion. He laid out in these interviews from 1985 what it is and it's purpose. What struck him when he visited America was two fold one that this subversion had gone far and wide more full than the KGB could have hoped for and Second that the people committing the Subversion was Americas left. As he said " It surprised me that it was Americans doing it to Americans".  The Clinton emails show this in action and in my opinion one of the best examples is 
"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."
