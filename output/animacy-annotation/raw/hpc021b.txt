Wow. Astounding.  Imagine refusing to do something that may save your life, or prevent you from dealing with potential long lasting chronic illnesses, just because you think the experts in that field are arrogant. If I spurned the assistance of every proudly knowledgeable health care professional I've had contact with in my life, I'd be dead. 

Would they prefer the experts condescendingly pat hands and draw stick figures with crayons to cater to the determined ignorant? Because a polite and caring approach and trying to treat them like adults has worked so well thus far. /s

From my observations, the arrogance of the deliberately ignorant and Facebook "educated" during this pandemic has far exceeded any arrogance of the experts trying to actually educate them.
