Typical and ignorant of you. Reddit’s damn hive mind/ group think is sick. You think the rest of the world feels that way? Bullshit. People all around the world would give anything to live in America. 

The people on this sub are the biggest bunch of lazy, arrogant, self entitled pieces of garbage I’ve ever seen. No wonder you all cower on the internet and hide, you probably can’t function in real life. 

Take your faux virtue and faux outrage and GTFO.
