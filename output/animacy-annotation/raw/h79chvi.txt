&gt;They sincerely believe he would reduce the control big business has over politics and that the democratic party is more corrupt than the republican party.

Ok, fine. I'll include "gullible and stupid and unaware of Trump's entire history of doing none of those things." Racist, sexist, classist, stupid - I think that covers them all now.

My perception of Trump voters is primarily based on the behavior and speech of Trump voters. I don't have to invent some boogeyman Trump supporter to have a negative opinion of them. I don't watch cable news, I don't watch local news. I'm on Reddit plenty, and so are a lot of Trump supporters. I'm drinking my hate for them directly from the hose.

Your grandparents got duped by a conman because they're stupid. Their stupidity enabled a lot of other people's hate. They share the blame for not being informed voters.

Also, your grandparents are probably racist.
