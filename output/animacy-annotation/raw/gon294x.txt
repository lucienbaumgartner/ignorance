Yeah, of course I would. Refusing to date a group of people based on speculative inferences about their character **and** about your own sexual or emotional interests is by definition prejudiced. It's also ignorant and wasteful. You have no idea if the xanny abuser nextdoor is actually unhealthy or your soulmate until you meet them. Which will never happen if you are prejudiced against that "type" of person and ignorant of the actual "people".

That being said, no one is forcing you to try dating anyone. You can date whoever you want. Just be honest with yourself that you have a prejudice. That's perfectly normal. There are "types" of ppl I don't date. But, I don't lie to myself about it.
