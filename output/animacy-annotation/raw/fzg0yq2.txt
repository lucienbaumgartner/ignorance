&gt; first of all it's not "real life" it's a construct made for the benefit of the people at the very top of society. 

so hunting is a construct?

hunting or starving is real life bud

&gt; second of all, capitalism puts power in the hands of whiny little rich kids who do absolutely nothing

their job is to allow workers to work

no saver, no means to produce, no production

&gt; I literally can't even make fun of this one

I know, it’s hard to make fun of truth

&gt; I can not fathom how ridiculously privileged and ignorant that statement is

said the privileged fragile commie

&gt; though I bet the hundreds of millions of unpaid workers both in America and the global south can

imagine thinking that people work for free, lmao

&gt; yes you are forced to give the value of your labor to a capitalist or starve to death

in fact you are forced to hunt or starve to death

“the capitalist” is making you a favor by allowing you another option

&gt; and that's excluding if your union is crushed and have to starve anyway

often unions makes workers lives worse, and I speak from experience

but you are too naive, spoiled, and arrogant to accept that workers move from strong worker unions countries to countries with more liberty and freedom
