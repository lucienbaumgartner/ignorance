Imagine thinking that someone teaching "the jews should be exterminated for their racial inferiority" is just the same as teaching "de facto racism persisted even after Brown v Board and the Civil Rights Act through various mechanisms like redlining and unequal enforcement of the 'war on drugs'".  

It's seriously hard to engage with this pov because it is so obviously shallow and ignorant of even basic facts about any point being discussed.  It's the most base-level "I'm rubber you're glue" argument that is seemingly impervious to any scrutiny.  It's either that or just textbook concern-trolling.
