Lah, ente yg pertama bawa2 durasi perbudakan sedangkan itu sendiri ga sebenarnya ga relevan dalam konteks perdebatan ini secara lebih luas.

The comparison being brought up by the other dude in the 1st place was just to point out how egregious and ignorant that sort of approach is, considering that (1) Indonesians are troubled people as well when it comes to colonialism and the aftereffects thereof (2) Race and social status shouldn’t have any standing on casual discussions of the matter. Sure generational trauma is a thing, but your average Indonesian guy is as prone to making uneducated assertions as your typical dutchman. i.e. There shouln’t be any gatekeeping into discussions of the matter, unless it’s academic in nature.

IMHO, you asserting over that fact that you did mention in a way is defending and implying that rando black guy as having the ultimate say on discussions of colonialism, which is particularly discriminatory.
