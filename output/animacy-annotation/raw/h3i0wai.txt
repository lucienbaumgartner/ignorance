china is definitely nuber one for that and i'd put brits/german/american  fight for the remaining podium spots. but for different reason.  


brits while being polite while sober are aweful drunks.  
germans are so loud and unaware of their surroundings while visitings places which they aren't in germany.

  
american are extremely entitled to non restaurant staff "the customer is king" is not a thing in france, interaction between shop staff and customer are way more on an equal terms than in the US, which their tourist don't really deal well, not even talking about them joking on stereotypes, it gets old really fast. it is mostly the american in paris though. if i see american tourist in other places they are usually much more informed and adjusted on local customs  


best tourists in france are definitely the japanese which you can only their tendency to hog a spot for selfies, but otherwise they are very nice to staff even though they don't tip  
and italians are overall very relaxed and since their culture is close to french one they  adjust really well  


i have travelled quite a bit and Paris, Venezia and Firenze are very special in what kind of tourist they get amongst the place i have been, people get really annoying trying to get their "perfect vacation" and stressing out for minor stuff, while in a lot of other places they are more go with the flow enjoy themselves more and are way easier to deal with for people working in tourism
