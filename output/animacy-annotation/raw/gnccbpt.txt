I never saw it as a break up song.

I feel like it's directly about KissGate.

After the video was leaked/released of her dancing/kissing karlie, "rumors" started more heavily and it's visual "proof" (I say with a lot of leniency in the word proof).  I'm sure she got a load of crap from her management after that incident. In my mind, the line "If I could dance with you again" means if she could go back in time to change anything, she wouldn't. she'd do it all the same- she'd kiss her in public knowing what the consequences would be-

*I'd kiss you as the lights went out* (kiss her dancing at the concert)

*Swaying as the room burned down* (uninhibited and unaware of the fallout)

*I'd hold you as the water rushes in* (I'll hold on to you through the backlash)

*If I could dance with you again* (I'd still do it exactly the same)

After that, things changed. They couldn't do the glass closest thing anymore. Calvin showed up. anyway...
