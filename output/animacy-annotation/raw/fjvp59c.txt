Look at what happened to the nursing home in Kirkland. They just kinda let it go until it got bad enough that people were dropping left and right now the quarantine is in place on the residents. I believe that's a good chunk of our state's deaths from covid19.

Edit: tldr yeah I'm sure there are way more undocumented cases. People are probably scared and ignorant that they'll be shipped off to some camp if someone found out.
