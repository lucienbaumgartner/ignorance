I'm with you as far as films go, or maybe cutscenes to an extent, full HD is a must. But let the blockbuster games be all glossy and 4k friendly, smaller innovative games are fine in 720, just have to have a strong art style or crisp polygons.

We can have low detail/pixellated characters and scenery and it still be 1080p/4K, if anything it'd retain a sense of the medium (personally I don't *want* to be that immersed and unaware that I'm playing a game) and then all of the freed up processing can be dedicated to some wild new leaps forward in mechanics. Current gen is realistic enough, 4K won't be predominant for at least 5 more years.
