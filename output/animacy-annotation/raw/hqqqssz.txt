Really consider what’s being said,

I’m saying by known science and math, for someone to accept abiogenesis, that is faith based. Not only is it faith based, it contradicts reality. 

Remember this is a convo against atheism. And the reason I don’t like atheists is Bc they’re often ignorant and complacent with their ignorance.

I genuinely can’t make you comprehend how ridiculously impossible all observation show the event of abiogenesis to be, but just understand it is faith.

And faith in God is immensely more reasonable when you start to consider other events like “origin of universe” and the historical evidence on Jesus and his disciples.
