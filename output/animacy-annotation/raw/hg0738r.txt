Yeah, because as we all know, someone who is delusional and unaware of reality knows not the sense of right and wrong, right?

...Right? 

Of course not. /s..Insanity is way more nuanced than people who learned their psychology from true crime podcasts and TV. 

As anyone who has ever worked in a psychiatric ward can tell you, plenty of people with legit mental illness (As in things like paranoid schizophrenia) demonstrated a sense of morality but also showed other forms of delusion and insanity.
