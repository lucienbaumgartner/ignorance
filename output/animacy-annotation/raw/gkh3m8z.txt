ive been diagnosed for about 2 years now, i dont really stick with meds for more than a couple weeks ( right now im taking latuda ) but it wasnt always a great relationship. i was very suicidal, emotionally tiring and unaware of how the way i reacted to things effected others. we have taken breaks due to my actions, but now we have been together for a year consistently and live with eachother. 
i used to retreat to cope with my symptoms, it didnt work for me at all. it drove people away, it was to the point that my boyfriend would have walls against me to not get hurt. ive improved a lot over the years, i chose to express myself in healthier ways, i tell people when i have an emotion and why, and spend both quality time with and without my partner. its a mix of things really that make it work for us.
