Genuinely, don't think it's a liberal vs conservative thing.  It takes a certain level of intelligence to be politically engaged enough to pick a side at all - frankly, the easiest thing to do is nothing at all and be completely apolitical, which most people are.  just completely unengaged and unaware of any sides at all.  There's a LOT of people like this.  Conservatives tend to blanket any young or non-white person as liberal but nothing could be farther from the truth. Most of these people are completely unengaged and certainly wouldn't identify with a liberal ethos.

(I'm center/independent, for context)
