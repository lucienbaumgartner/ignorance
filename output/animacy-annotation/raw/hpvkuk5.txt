I mean that’s true but still. Legally speaking it’s ignorant and stupid.  The right wingers are going to go after whatever they feel like though. Obviously I don’t agree with that other comment somewhere in this threat saying it was karma because he was anti gun, that’s dumb lol.  That being said, I am in favor of oversight, even if it becomes more convenient.  people make fun of OSHA but there’s a reason systems like that exist because of the precedents of neglect and disregard for human life.  

But going on TV to get your side of the story out can be useful but it can also be detrimental to a fair defense.
