No worries! I've done a *lot* of work on my own mental health to get where I am, and I've studied psychology in school, and siphoned as much knowledge as I could from my emergency therapists. I try to share whenever I can, because you never know who might read it, or how much someone might need to hear it.

It's completely understandable to have anxiety, or to be distrusting, in the world we're in. You don't necessarily have to have an external "reason" like abuse to justify being skeptical or even afraid to be around others. But if you ask me, this sentence is very telling:

&gt;I've had fairly supportive and over-protective affectionate family

It's wonderful that they wanted to protect and support you, and they sound like very good people with genuinely good intentions. But if you grew up sheltered and unaware of the atrocities present in the world, it can come as a great shock to learn about them later in life, which can be traumatizing! I've worked with several other people in my university days who grew up in otherwise problemless, comfortable environments, only for something traumatic to happen (such as a car accident, or an injury, or a death, or learning about how much suffering others can go through) and for that experience to shatter their perception of the world as a safe place, and make them frightened and distrusting. You'd likely be surprised how *common* it actually is.

I don't have very much advice for re-establishing a sense of safety, because I have PTSD as it is, and I have never in my entire life felt safe (lots of abuse and trauma in my history). But I can tell you that even if you're afraid, and the world is an awful place where safety is a mythical creature, you can still live a comfortable and happy life regardless. And you can still help reduce the suffering of others.
