Pride in the culture you come from? For an example similar to your own, I'm grateful that my ancestors fought for their independence against England, without that I may not have the background I have today. 

Its very strange, and ignorant of you to assume that African-Americans are the only race in history that endured sacrifice, dehumanisation, or pain. Many other races, and many white ethnicities have endured slavery in the past. Id suggest reading up about Ukraine under Stalin during soviet rule as a more recent example.
