It sucks, they sent my dad to die in a pointless war, refused me disability accommodations in much of public school to the point I have trauma enough to have rather went without schooling, health care is both expensive and complicated to get with long wait times, the police do nothing but harass homeless people and a bunch of abled straight cis white people yell "FREEDOM" at the top of their lungs every few seconds unaware and unwilling to realize they are the only ones here with any.
