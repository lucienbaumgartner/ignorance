Wrong.  Ignorant and wrong.  Socialist ideology is antithetical to authoritarianism.  Classless societies cannot have an authoritarian leader because that is a class above others.  Literally not possible.  Literally not socialism if there is an authoritarian in charge.

You just project what you wish were true.  Deal with the fact that you’re on the side of the fascists.  And if you don’t want to be on that side, maybe change your view points instead of seeking out information that reinforces what you wish was true.
