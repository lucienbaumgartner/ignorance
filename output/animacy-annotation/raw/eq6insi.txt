Yeah, I get it. I'm not agreeing with the people in here who are giving you grief for posting this - I think it's exactly what this sub is for. I just think it's fine to do both: post this shit to ridicule people, and say something to them so that maybe they'll improve in the future.

It *does* astound me at how ignorant and obtuse people can be in the gym. How could you possibly be so inconsiderate and unaware that you would, for instance, use one of the few benches in the weight area to store your phone and water bottle while you do unrelated floor stuff? I just imagine that these are the same people who camp out in the passing lane going 10mph under the speed limit. Either they're just ignorant about basic etiquette, or they know they're being assholes and don't care. The former can be addressed; the latter requires more drastic measures.
