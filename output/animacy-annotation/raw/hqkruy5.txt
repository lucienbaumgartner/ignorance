I’m sorry this statement is just so ignorant. I own 3 other properties besides my main residence. Yes I did this purely out of investments sake. I live in BC Canada were the housing market is one of, if not, the best place to put your hard earned money.  I never went to university or college. I am as far as education is concerned a plumber. I worked hard for the money I invested and still continue to work hard. I made the best choices I could and denied myself many luxuries when I was younger. It’s also important to note I’ve endured and still endure higher levels of stress and risk then most are able or willing to take on. 

With all that said. I know what it’s like to struggle. I’m not some uncaring conglomerate trying to scrap as much money as I can from everyone around me and every place I bought was because of my own hard work and saved money. I have kept my rent almost the same as when I first purchased these properties. All 3 of my rentals are priced way below market. I’m happy to cover my costs (1 house I feed the strata cost a bit outta pocket) as it’s an investment and I am already well into the black if I were to sell these properties now. No need to scrape anymore money then is needed. I want people to get ahead living in my places. It’s a win win. I get good respectable tenants, my investment covered and they get to save and move on if they so choose. 

Statements like the above from OP come across as ignorant and insulting. I’m not breaking any laws morally or otherwise in my opinion.
