I don't care what anyone says, Drinkwater is not good enough - he's slow, unaware and rash. If you're starting Nakamaba it should Hourihane over Drinkwater or vice versa, Hourihane must be so frustrated. He's our 2nd top goal scorer, he should be being utilised.

On the positive side, Reina was a good pick up and Vassilev looks hungry. I hope we have Samatta next game against Watford, he's a goal scorer and a great header of the ball which we need.
