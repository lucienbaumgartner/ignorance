Concerning the original point of the comment, though, is it really all that empowering to participate in the oldest profession in the world that has always predominately featured women?

Fwiw, I don't think it should be degrading either, but the idea that it's empowering has always seemed a bit problematic and ignorant of the majority of the industry. No matter how regulated it gets, I won't feel all that empowered being at the entry level of sex work, but it's easy to make it seem that way when you only focus on the celebrities.
