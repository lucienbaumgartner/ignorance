You were completely within your rights to not die because your in-laws are overly sensitive and ignorant of your problems. Take an epi-pen over some time, eat what she fixes and when she sees your reaction, have your spouse stick you with the pen, get better, then get up and leave without saying anything to either one of them. Either they get the idea, or they don't, and you have an actual reason to not go over there anytime they serve food.
