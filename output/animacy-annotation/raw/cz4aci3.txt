I've been bopping around a bit, 9/11, Oklahoma City Bombings, San Bernardino, the Occult influence on Masons, Jesuits, Qabbalah, MK-Ultra, UFOs, Yitzhak Rabin, CIA funding ISIS... The picture that slowly emerges from all of this is honestly frightening. They are going to tear the world apart to get what they want. Order out of chaos...

I've got two young kids and am scared thinking about the world they are going to be living in. I am trying to not let it get to me, because I know that they want to rule us through fear. But it's hard.

I really am starting to feel like I took the red pill. I walk around and can't figure out how everyone around me can be so unaware and complacent. How I could have been like that until recently. 

Some books I've been reading lately: Peter Levendra's 'Sinister Forces' trilogy (recommended!), Programmed to Kill, Who Murdered Yizhak Rabin?
