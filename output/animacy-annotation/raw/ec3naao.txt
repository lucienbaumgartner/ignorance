&gt;Also Iâ€™d like to point out that plenty of people on the left regularly disagreed with Obama.

And that's the fact they fail to acknowledge. Shit I was enlisted during his terms, I had a lot of problems with the shit he was doing, I would agree with somethings and call foul on others....but that's the difference.

Obama was a leader, who was subject to scrutiny, Trump Supporters hold up this buffoon as if he is the second coming of Christ and use mistakes of past individuals to justify his current fuck ups. You can't even compare an Obama Presidency to a Trump Presidency because thusfar, Trump STILL doesn't even have a full cabinet and those he does have or did have are just absolutely stupid.

People who use this rhetoric are so willfully deluded and ignorant that it's not even worth trying to talk to them about it. They're in it for "Making that liberal that called me stupid, mad. Yeah, that'll show'em."
