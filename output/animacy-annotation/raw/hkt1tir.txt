Ah, so if I understand you correctly you're saying that anyone who disagrees with you on these issues is someone you don't view as a Christian?

Just to be clear, moving forward could you maybe tweak your phrasing a little bit?

Perhaps if you said 

&gt; Christians (of the kind approved by /u/InChrist4567) battle the popularization of homosexuality because it's sin. It's that simple."

or maybe

&gt; /u/InChrist4567 verified Christians seek to get rid of abortion...

Then we'd all understand what you're talking about.

Otherwise you just come across as weirdly uninformed and unaware of the millions of Christians who don't see a need to make opposition to abortion and hatred of the LGBTQ+ community part of their religious identity.
