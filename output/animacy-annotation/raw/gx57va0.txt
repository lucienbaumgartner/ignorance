Honestly C, D, E and F are all being extremely rude in this scenario; they have decided on the spur of the moment to cancel, mostly without reason or for trivial reasons.

If players in one of my games short-notice said "I will not be attending tonight" for no reason, or "I have decided to do other stuff tonight", I'd be upset. If they did it regularly I'd seriously reconsider playing with them any more.

Being ill and wanting to support your ill spouse I get. The rest is just rude and ignorant of the amount of work and emotional investment it takes to prep and run a game.

A lot of people are talking about this being a "welcome to adulthood" issue but honestly those players sound like they're childishly inconsiderate.
