How does slavery equate to racism? You're ignorant of history. Slavery at the time wasn't based on race. Yes, the Arabs pre-Islam were very racist towards other ethnicities. Moses AS was described as a very tall black man. So the prophet was racist to one of the prophets? Your claims don't add up in line with history or the theology of Islam. 

"Again. Obey your ruler even if he is black and so and so. That shouldnâ€™t be something that he should have said in the first place."

You forget that some Arabs were still ignorant and racist. It absolutely should have been made clear to them. Of course he used an Ethiopian slave as an example. Some of them still looked down upon Africans such as Abu Dhar who was reprimanded by the prophet who was VERY angry at a comment he made towards Bilal. Abu Dhar Bilal "the son of a black woman". Not even a slur. Yet the prophet became furious at Abu Dhar for this comment.

I've read the prophets biography from both Islamic and non-Muslim sources. None paint him as a racist. I think you're the one with a skewed bias. I'm an African as well, but I value truth not feelings.
