She’s got to keep it private when it’s convienant for her... for example around the anniversary of her daughter that her husband killed after a shameless drug/booze fueled night. That weeks off limits . Within 7 days of that date she’s allowed to go back to her cringy posts and giving out personal info. 🤦‍♀️. I don’t even put on social media when me and my family leave for the weekend or getting on a plane and I have no where near her amount of followers but my point is to keep my home safe and my life private for the trip or whatever is going on.. waiting to post some memories from it until you get back home is a lot smarter than how she goes about it. But, that would make sense for someone who is tone dead and unaware of how hypocritical and dumb they are. In my opinion haha
