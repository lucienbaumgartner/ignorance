I just can't believe how the whole cop thing has turned into an argument between "they're all bad" vs "they're all good".

Cops are invaluable to a first world society, period. It's a hard job, but someone has to do it, otherwise we'd end up like ... well take your pick of the undeveloped worlds.

At the end of the day it's the wolves that consider themselves to be on a completely different strata than the rest of us, regardless of law enforcement.

Being a cop isn't just like putting in an application and you get the job and now you get to be a dick to the world. It's a commitment and a huge investment of oneself, and takes a lot more balls than most people in society have. To pretend like they're just soldiers for the pieces of shit running everything is ignorant and naive.
