&gt; Sorry I don't listen to a lot of groups

Yet you make the generalisation that "K-pop B-sides are trash". I hope you realise how hypocritical and ignorant that statement sounds, given your very limited repertoire of music you listen to.

It feels to me that you're just posting for the sake of it. Even an unpopular opinion can be a respectable one if it is backed up by substance and evidence. Since yours is backed up by neither of those, but simply the "I have to say something" as opposed to "I have something to say", I can't respect your opinion. You're wrong, and your opinion lacks research. Do better, OP.
