What you see on the TV and your phone normalizes behaviors. Have you heard of a frog boiling in water? And it’s not like the people presenting lgbt as normal are showing both sides of the debate, giving points and counterpoints, if anything they give a single straw man of “they don’t agree because they are bigoted and ignorant”. That is not critically presenting lgbt activities as normal. Not going to move forward with why it’s important this doesn’t happen until you concede this point
