Okay at this point, stop calling people names. It's childish and ignorant that you've resulted in name calling for this simple issue. To give you a better understanding, we are so short staffed that people just get thrown onto the line/dml without any training on how to roll a burrito/portion sizes or anything. We don't want to do that to new hires but sometimes we have no choice. So instead of calling people "idiots" and "inept" how about you either stop ordering chipotle or order a bowl instead and get a tortilla on the side and wrap it yourself ðŸ˜‰ðŸ™ƒ
