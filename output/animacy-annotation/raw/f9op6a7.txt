&gt;99% Koreans don't know what kurdish is

That made me shock when I saw how Koreans are unaware and uninformed about history.I have seen so many Koreans who claims Gokturks(돌궐) are actually Kurdish and also today  Turkey's %95 of population is Kurdish but people are hiding that.I understand Koreans habit of being side to weak ones but Kurds seriously doesn't need all of these at all.
And most of them thinks how it's sad to Turks doesn't think the same way as Koreans when it comes to being brother country. lmao our daily life includes caos every minute we don't time to  think which country is our brother.But Koreans had always been  a  different places in our hearts.
