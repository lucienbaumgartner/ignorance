I scrolled that sub for a solid 30 minutes and they're so fucking dumb and unaware of themselves. I saw a "meta" post about how they talk about "how COVID affected the economy and all that" but the only posts I saw were "memes" about how masks are bad and yadda yadda.

Don't even get me started on the post about how people who are vaccinated still stay away from unvaxxed people, like, you wouldn't want to stay next to someone with the flu now would you? Even though all of us get those shots?

They're fucking braindead.
