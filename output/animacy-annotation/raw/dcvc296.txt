Just read the Snopes article regarding this email, they contacted the author for clarification.

Snopes.com reached out to Bill Ivey for clarification of his intended meaning. which he rephrased for us as follows:

*If these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this:*

*“And as I’ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking…”*

*No “master-of-the-universe" conspiracy; just a lament that leaders and policy makers have not been sufficiently attentive to some of the basics that make our democracy great.*

*Bill Ivey*

Now I truly believe he is being sincere, but people are kidding themselves if they believe there's a government in the world that doesn't want a compliant, and uninformed citizenry.
