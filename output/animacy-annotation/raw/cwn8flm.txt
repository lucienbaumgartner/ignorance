The Id, Ego, Super-Ego are not things you can just turn off. As much as you might feel it's possible, some people are just incapable of ignoring outside stimuli. 

These are the people /u/LeeWeezley is commiserating with - those of us that wish we could just turn off our brain and that little voice in our head (from the ego, super-ego, id whatever) and live life blissfully ignorant and unaware that I'm ignorant (this is key).
