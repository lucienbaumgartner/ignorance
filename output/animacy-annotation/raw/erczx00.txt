Or actually, the trick is not so much that we think you support muslims when they say the same thing as far-right conservatives, but rather you’ll make excuses until you are blue in the face that *those* Muslims don’t really exist and we’re all islamophobic for not wanting to live near them.

So then when you import a whole ghetto’s worth of them and they go [right back to acting like they do everywhere else in the world](https://www.outline.com/9MYXPX), it’s cue the shocked pikachu face and [throwing your allies under the bus](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/muslims-halt-pro-gay-curriculum-in-uk-school).

So it’s not that you are technically being hypocritical, it’s just that you are woefully naive and ignorant that a group that has a worldwide reputation for being violent and ignorant, *actually has earned that reputation for a reason because that’s what their culture believes in*, and you’re not “saving” anyone, you are just destroying your own communities.
