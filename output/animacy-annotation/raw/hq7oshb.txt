The right wing are pandering, igniting the passions of the most ignorant and vicious people out there - this is not leadership and it's toxic, dangerous and does not end well.  

These right wing opportunists think they can start a bonfire in the house and it won't burn them as well.  

The most scary ones are those in office who actually believe this, lunatics like Marjorie Green are the next generation and they are pure fascists to the core.
