While I wholeheartedly agree that this woman is ignorant and selfish for thinking this way, I kind of find it hard to believe that the guy got **five** full-ride scholarships.

It's difficult enough to get even one.  Unless he's a real-life Sheldon Cooper, I find 5 doubtful.

(Of course, if he were a real-life Sheldon Cooper he probably wouldn't have a girlfriend, or at least not one like this).
