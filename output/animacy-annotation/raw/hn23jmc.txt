At the eikaiwa I work at, the owner and even the lowly student interns fail to take me remotely seriously (racism), and the foreigners who moved on called me illiterate and ignorant of the culture (jealousy). Being able to educate a native on the seismic ways of Nippon proves the value I bring to this society, and I'm glad people like you are finally acknowledging that.
