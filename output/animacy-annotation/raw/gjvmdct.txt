Believe me I feel the same way. It really just started to feel like she didn't care about me no matter what she said (I don't think someone who tells you coming to see you put 600 miles on their car in 2 months as if you forced them to make that choice cares all too much lol but oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯). I still care about her though unfortunately and I'm sure you still care for him, which sucks but I guess you just gotta realize these people are probably not relationship material anyway if they do things like reject your feelings/vulnerability, have trouble realizing that they've upset you when it's pretty clear that you are and still don't apologize properly even if you bring it up, or blame you solely for why shit went wrong even though you expressed a need and they just tell you it's too awkward when you ask for it even though that's how it should work. Like no, I left because you were being vague and unaware and nonchalant and rude, it had nothing to do with my attachment at that point lol like what the hell?? And yet you still wanna be nice to them and care about them and be friends (which I said I would like to be, but like you I think I'm also beginning to realize that's a bad idea lmao). Hopefully you guys work better as friends than as potential romantic partners if you choose to take that path instead, and I'm sorry that you see similarities between your situation and mine :( I hope you do what's best for you in the end!
