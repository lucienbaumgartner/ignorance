OP, you got in the shower and thought this dumbass thought? Fuck me I wish I could be so blind and ignorant that I think a worker shortage is because people were told jobs were “unnecessary “. The shortage is happening for many reason: limited access to childcare, people that found better jobs, changes in location and population, businesses requiring more workers, fewer immigrants, and many more. Inflated ego isn’t one of them, you are very dumb OP.
