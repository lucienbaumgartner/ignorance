&gt;You're being a contrarian asshole. That's what you are.

Where? Lmao.   

&gt;I really liked Ratchet and Clank. Very few people would describe it as a truly fantastic game, and being only 88/100 is evidence of that.

Gamers when a game only has a score of 88 lmao. If this magic number was 2 or 3 points higher than baby you'd have a great game on your hands, but sadly it's *only* an 88.    

&gt;You keep trying to use GOTY wins as a metric without using the tiniest bit of thought to realize why that's moot in this discussion.

I think I've made one mention of GOTY wins? Lmao.    

&gt;You fucking suck as a poster. As the other person said, you're being willfully ignorant and dismissive. Plenty of people have wasted their time replying to you with well reasoned arguments and evidence, and you just hand wave it away because you're upset by the general narrative.

Lmao cry about it dork
