Here's that Solidity dev being nice:

&gt; You're certainly welcome to your opinion. I just very much disagree and think **solidity is the best damn smart contracting language on the market right now**

Notice that he's being nice - but still unapologetic - and even boastful - saying "Solidity is the best damn smart contracting language" - *after* the DAO started being drained.

I'll take *arrogant, elitist, and right* any day over *nice but apathetic, lackadaisical, unaware and wrong* (and to blame for people losing a quarter billion dollars as a *direct consequence* of being apathetic, lackadaisical, unaware and wrong - and still unapologetic and even boastful *after* the disaster).
