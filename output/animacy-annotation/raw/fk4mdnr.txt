I mean, I just completely disagree. When Hillary was First Lady SHE took on both healthcare and big Pharma to try and pass a VERY progressive healthcare plan, and she paid a heavy political price for it. That is about as far from "they just want the status quo and they never lead on policy" as you can possibly be. 

She did lose that fight, so I guess if you only look at actual policy 'wins' when you make this criticism, then it becomes a more legitimate argument. I would definitely agree that we have failed way too many times at passing this stuff, but again I think it's lazy and weak to just blame the Democrats - the American public is so lazy and ignorant that they often go with the opposition talking points (which are all BS of course) and favor them over their own best interests. When the public support isn't there, it isn't there, and it's really hard to push against that. 

We are captive to our own principles and handicapped by our desire to "fight fair", while Republicans have no problem shitting all over the rulebook and the constitution (and the American people) - whatever it takes to win. This is the fundamental reason why we haven't won much compared to them.
