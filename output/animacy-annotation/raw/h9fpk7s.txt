This is so sad. Everyone should know the history about this country and the natives who were first here. So many people are ignorant and unaware of the truth of America history and the native Americans. Not teaching kids this will just lead to more ignorance. People should know about the first people here, and the atrocities that the natives experienced, the genocide that occurred for hundreds of years. In grade school they hardly ever talked about native Americans. It was always about the stupid colonizers. I learned about native Americans when I took US history in college. But not everyone goes to college. As a Mexican American, I feel pain every day for what happened to my ancestors and it's ashame I didn't get to learn much about them growing up. And many people are racist and hate mexicans, but we were here first! They don't even realize that Mexicans are Native Americans.
