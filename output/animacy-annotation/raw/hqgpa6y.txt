There definitely is somewhat of a smoking Culture in Japan. 

When I was in Nanba area of Osaka, I checked out a glass shop with some sick bongs and was offered a gram for 7,000 Yen ($60) 

Itâ€™s crazy and shameful that in some parts of the world how governments can STILL be so willingly ignorant and anti cannabis.
