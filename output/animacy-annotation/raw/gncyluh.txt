Yeah it would be pretty useless and ignorant of me to attempt to recreate an art style without first understanding its meaning and origin. 

I'm going to tell myself you were trying to be helpful and not condescending by telling me to read a thing or two first. The "though" really doesn't help your case though. 

To be fair, if some rando left a comment the way I did I might react similarly.
