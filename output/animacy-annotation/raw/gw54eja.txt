&gt; They have a large child "modeling" industry where convenience stores sell magazines with images of little girls in swim suits on the same rack as the comic books and news magazines.

They have businesses that pay middle school girls to play around and hang out in skimpy outfits in a common area surrounded by 1-way mirrors. Men then pay to sit behind these 1 way mirrors and watch/fap. 100% legal.

By Japanese GF, back when she was younger and lived in Japan, had people try to solicit her to work at "no pantsu shabu shabu" where the place would have mirrored floors, and the waitresses were all high school girls with no panties on, so dudes could get a full view. 

&gt;In the idol industry it is common for adult women to put on the affectation of being much younger by speaking in high-pitched baby talk, pretending to be virginal and ignorant of sexuality like a child

[This girl](https://twitter.com/enako_cos/status/1386311449891328004) is one of the most famous cosplay idols in Japan, and you can see video of her here doing the whole little girl act: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFTGjC1Ix5E

&gt;Oh yeah, there are also little girl idol groups that have adult male "fans" who follow them to every venue and buy swimsuit magazines featuring the little girl idols. And this behavior is tolerated by Japanese society and the Japanese government.

Yeah like "Babymetal" which was formed with 11 year olds.
