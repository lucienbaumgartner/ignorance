That may depend on environment and place.   Just because it has nothing to do with each other in your environment may not mean it has nothing to do with the others in that persons environment.   Honestly in my environment I run into a lot of "selfish liberal assholes".   I'm aware that this is not true of all places and in no way reflects on liberals as a whole, they just tend to be loud and unaware and do not care about other people or their feelings where I happen to be.
