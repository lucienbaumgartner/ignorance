&gt; And yes, if he found out the kid biologically wasn't his 25 years later, it would be less his then. 

I don't know about this. Mine are 22 and 25, and if I found out tomorrow they'd been switched at birth and weren't my husband's and my biological children, they would 100% still be my sons, who I raised and nurtured and taught and loved from the moment I knew they existed.

I'm not saying I don't sympathize. This is a horrible situation to be in. But I think about how many times this has happened, and the parents didn't find out. How many people are out there raising children not biologically their own, totally unaware, and completely happy? If they all found out tomorrow, I don't think a single parent would be "Welp, ya ain't my kid, so out ya go!"

The only difference here is that he knows, and he only knows because the baby is Asian. So he's going to reject it, and then what? Do it again? Never have children? I don't know. I just know I couldn't turn away that baby any more than I could turn away one of the two I've raised.

Thank you for engaging in a constructive way. Not everyone here seems to be able to do that.
