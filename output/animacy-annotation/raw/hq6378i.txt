its just not justified when the game makes the amount it makes

&amp;#x200B;

billions and you're telling me you cant afford to make some infrastructure changes to benefit the game in the long run.

every season the game hits big at the start but then sizzles out and poofs after 2 weeks, why? because they know how to hype this game up but dont know how to maintain it. They can fluff up nice ads for the game and throw money at influencers to play the game once but cant afford someone like server maintenance? a fleshed out dev team rather than the skeleton crew we have now? cant afford to take suggestions from the community when 99% of the times they've done that the game ended up benefiting and they act like we have no clue how this game is supposed to run, like we're ignorant and yest they play victim when the user isnt happy with the game even though they were told what we want and need, they play victim when the months and months of problems pilling on each other finally coming crashing down on them and its our fault?

its been 3 years and this game is still figuring out how to recolour basic skins and even then we might get one every few months. the game is still trying to figure out its identity 3 years in
