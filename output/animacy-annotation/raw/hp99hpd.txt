No, I'm very aware of the fact that it's of very little risk to my demographic, having had it twice, but I'm also aware of the fact that this virus has literally killed hundreds of thousands of people in a very short period of time and that's a number to take very seriously because, contrary to being left alone and left to make our own decisions, we all have an obligation to do what's best for our community.

You've had no one's back, you're a fucking idiot who was told that they have the right to an opinion too many times as a child and now you think you're entitled to be taken seriously when you go against published scientists despite having no background in the subject instead of laughed at, rounded up and put back through elementary school. You aren't a hero, you're a pawn in the game of a political party who tries to exploit the uneducated, ignorant and mentally feeble for votes.
