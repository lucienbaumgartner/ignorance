As someone who struggles with actual, diagnosed depression, this is so irresponsible and ignorant of Stacie to say. I work out 5-6 times a week and still need to take meds to keep my NEUROLOGICAL IMBALANCE from overtaking my life. There’s no workout plan in the world that’s going to fix my brain and how it’s wired, Kober. STFU with your bogus claims and check yourself into inpatient because like depression, eating disorders are mental illnesses too.
