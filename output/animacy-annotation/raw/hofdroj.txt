&gt;I really want to write the story but I’m afraid that once I start and I have to think about my experiences I’ll be overwhelmed with emotion

That's a good thing. You need to process those events and if you write about it you will be better for it. It hurts in the moment, but you're burning off dead wood. One thing that people do in therapy for trauma is to write out what happened. This is something that you should do. If you hear that little voice that says "avoid it," ignore it. That voice is not your friend, that voice is trying to make sure you stay afraid and ignorant of the past rather than incorporating it.

The cure for any trauma, and I do mean any, is to face it voluntarily. You are burning off the dead wood and allowing for new growth when you do that, it hurts, but the alternative is that you live for the rest of your life without ever facing it and are in constant fear of reliving it.
