Ok, so now you are claiming you're "not saying it's not a risky endeavor"    

so how do you justify this idiotic comment? "I just donâ€™t find it a major attack on our liberties."

". And by doing that I believe that opens the door for birth control."

You just sound incredibly dumb and unaware that abortion has literally been legal for more than 40 years. So that door has long been open, and yet somehow our society is thriving.  Keep up.

" Authoritarianism. How can you draw that conclusion based off this conversation?"

Already explained-  you denied that forced births constitute a major infringement of liberty. Did you forget that part, even though I've quoted it twice now?
