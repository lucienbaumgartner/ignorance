This is the classic leftist tactic of "playing ignorant".  They pretend to literally be so oblivious and ignorant that they simply don't understand the relationship between monuments and the story of history.  It's ironic that a group that so often likes to proclaim how "educated" and "intelligent" they are regularly reverts to pretending to be utterly and hopelessly oblivious in order to avoid discussion.
