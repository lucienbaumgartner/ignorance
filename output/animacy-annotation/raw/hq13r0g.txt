It's understandable why you've gone this way, but what you've really only done is manage to lose sight of what is *subjective* versus *objective*.  Subjective thought is not real, while objective truth is real.  Someone can confuse themselves and *think* that they have the ability to fly, and then die when they test that concept when they jump off of a cliff.  If I get some bread and go to the refrigerator and get mayonnaise, ham and cheese and make a sandwich, then this sandwich is objective truth.  These are all quantifiable and verifiable scientific happenings, while anything going on in your head is not.

When someone confuses what they think with objective reality, then you get all sorts of wild and unquantifiable claims, and of course anyone who challenges those claims is "wrong", because you believe what's going on in your head is truth when it's not.  It's just all based on thoughts.

Now while you're technically right in that the physical world is not "real", there is in fact scientific evidence in quantum physics that proves this, you're using that as an excuse to try to make anything real, when it is in fact not.  Your thoughts and concepts aren't real to me, and cannot be quantified by me in any way, so how in the world would I be accepting of things purely going on in your head?  Your understanding of objective reality is lacking, and your field has nothing to do with what is real or quantifiable.  It's just nonsense, and the ignorant and gullible are going to believe you and even pay you for that nonsense because it's what they *wan*t to believe.  Story as old as time.
