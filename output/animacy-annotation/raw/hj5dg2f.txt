I worked with a guy who was very socially unaware and strange. He was telling us how he likes to go to the pub and stare at women and he didn't understand why their boyfriends would give him attitude for it. We tried explaining that it was extremely creepy and he shouldn't do it but he just didn't get it. His argument was that he was just looking and they were in public and should expect it. I was so glad when he left.
