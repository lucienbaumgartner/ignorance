Yea, but you made it seem as if that's the case with this guy. That or you think OP is incompetent and unaware that there are some douches out there.

I've gone without a bed some nights in states colder than Texas. I can assure you there will be plenty of people sleeping on bus stop benches tonight wishing they could get out of the cold.
