As a prolifer I can confidently say this is NOT what pro-lifers are asking for. This mother is a garbage human being. She could have had an abortion but she didn’t. So don’t blame this crap on pro-lifers who simply believe that a fetus is a human being and therefore deserves the right to life. This happened even with legal abortion. You can disagree with the prolife position all you want, but to blame this on prolifers is just you trying to demonize people who disagree with you regardless of context. What an ignorant and intellectually dishonest argument to make.
