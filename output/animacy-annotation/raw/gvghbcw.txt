The more you talk the more its clear you haven't put any real thought into how all this works. You've heard ppl talking, demanding even, equality and probably ran away with some bizarre idea that all opinions are in some manner equal. you think having "equality for all" is something thats both obtainable and true- you fail to see how neither of those are actually the case.

What you want is for people to tolerate the ideas of the intolerant, and you fail to see how dangerous and ignorant that really is, or you just simply ignore that inconvenient truth. i say this because im sure you aren't hypocritical and would also go out there and defend the ideas of Nazis, the KKK, and other notorious hate groups. after all, that's their opinion, it may be evil, it may have the intent to oppress others, but its their opinion... right?  

\&gt;  Just that he should have the right to have that opinion. 

okay, so than why defend their ignorance? why come here to complain about this page pointing out someone's ignorance? what do you get from this? is it because it has to do with "the gays" ? lol

\&gt;  to live however he wants.  

that you say this so clearly without satire or irony is, to me, wild. to live however he wants? what does that even mean to you?
