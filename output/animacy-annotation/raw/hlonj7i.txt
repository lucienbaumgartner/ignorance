I hate when that shit happens! Especially because taller people need more dam room to get by, it just gets frustrating because some people just don't want to be considerate enough to move the fuck outta the dam way! Nobody should have to say excuse me to people who are taking up the whole sidewalk. I don't get how people can be so dam oblivious and unaware of there surroundings.
