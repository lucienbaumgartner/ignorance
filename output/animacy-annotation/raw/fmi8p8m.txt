There is blame here. When the federal government lied, and is now withholding supplies that needs to be addressed. When senators sold stock after a meeting saying a pandemic was coming, and did nothing to prepare their states, we need to discuss that. Yes, our health care system is also in shambles, but when hospitals were left unaware and unprepared this is what happens.
