I think you are being naive about the dangers, the article that says a city is safe is exactly my point. A city being safe in the middle of a dangerous country is not safe at all, its just relatively safe. No magic barrier prevents those bad people from entering that city, and if you have white ass skin like me you will stick out in most places in Mexico. All it takes is one bit of bad luck and you could be the victim of a crime. Pretending that since crime happens everywhere, its just as likely in Mexico is naive and ignorant of the statistical likelihood of being victimized in Mexico.   


Crimes can and do happen in other counties, however most countries dont have to deploy the military domestically to fight drug cartels who have bribed the president of the country with hundreds of millions of dollars(look it up.) Mexico is an unsafe place and the anecdotal evidence of "I havent been the victim of a crime" is not going to change that.
