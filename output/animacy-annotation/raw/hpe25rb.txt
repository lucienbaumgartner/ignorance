Come on. Just say the word “ignorance”. Saying “specific to my context” is such a round about way of saying “ignorance”. You’re ignorant and unashamed of being ignorant. I get it. Then just say it.  You’re in a thread in worldnews about a European only airline whose European CEO is talking about European policy and you felt compelled to make it about America because that’s the only framework your edgy and cliched arguments are rooted in and you got nothing else. Instead of reading more in general and expanding your “context” or just sitting this one out because it’s outside of your “context”you just chose to just limit your “context” and justify it by saying shit about half the people on this site being American. 

If I could tell you that being ignorant is not a badge of honor and if you’re ever finding yourself using ignorance as a defence in an argument you entered voluntarily then you likely need to sit this one out, then I would personally consider my contribution substantial enough. At least I’m not talking out my ass and then bragging about it.
