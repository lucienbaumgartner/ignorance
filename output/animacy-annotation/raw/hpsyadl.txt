I agree that you should try to understand the topic like the back of your hand before challenging it, but I don't like the notion of discouraging skepticism of theories just because they have been well established for a very long time. Paradigm shifts only happen when people maintain a questioning mind. I don't mean arrogant and ignorant of course.
