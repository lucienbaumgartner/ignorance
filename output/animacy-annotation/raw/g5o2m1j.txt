I think it was a family attorney but I'm absolutely certain it wasnt the DA. So in Highschool, a girl accused me and another person of rape. The prosecuting attorney/DA dropped the case because the girl admitted that she made it all up. People at school (Girls she associated w/ but not me) harassed her for the lie. Her mother (upset and unaware of the truth) tried to put a restraining order on everyone involved (including me) but it was denied. So her attorney talked me into signing one between me and the mother (Who I've never met). Seeing no drawbacks because I was young and naive I signed it.
