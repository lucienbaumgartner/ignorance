&gt;Well if we didn't evolve to try to look on the bright side or get used to tragedy we would have died of depression long ago.

What if? Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda...yeah. Well. what's your point? If humans were not continuously "looking on the bright side." Perhaps we wouldn't have evolved to destroy the planet the way we did. By overpopulating livestock and our own species. 

I wonder if you'd be so toxically positive if you were born in a third world country. Born a female. Intentionally kept ignorant and uneducated. Living in abject poverty. Forced into prostitution or sold off to be married as a 13 yo to a 40+pervert...etc. 

You may see this world on the bright side. Chose to close ones eyes and ears to others suffering. It doesn't make their suffering disappear when Natalist choose to adult in magical thinking.
