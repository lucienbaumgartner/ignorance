I understand now! We are talking past each other. You have built a very unrealistic interpretation of what communism actually means in your head.

&gt;not communism because people already tried that and it didn't turn out so well. Or will it be different this time?

Why did it fail? Certainly the USSR and China turning into autocratic one party states is an indictment against Leninsim and Maoism. But against communism or even socialism? There are numerous other ideologies under these umbrellas with completely different track records and to lump them all in as communism and then say communism is what failed is just incorrect and ignorant of the whole picture. What about https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936

What about https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia
Or
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria
Or
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation

None of these are utopian but all offer great advice about what is and isn't possible. Some are still around. Some aren't. Some are on a small scale. Some worked for millions of people. You could say that Spain failed because they were crushed by international coalition (involving the US and USSR). But did it fail because of its ideology? Because life improved for the people there under many metrics even during wartime until it was destroyed. George Orwell (writer of 1984/animal farm) went to fight in this conflict and wrote a book about his experiences and was a lifelong socialist afterwords. Saying we tried communism and it failed is such a black-and-white and completely nuance-lacking way of addressing questions regarding its legitimacy and no historian, political scientist, or philosopher would ever say something so silly. You can point to specific reasons for their failure: sanctions, war, corruption of leninist vanguard etc. But to pretend like all forms of communism or socialism failed so we shouldn't try them is to pretend to care about the scientific method and empiricism while discarding the rhetorical scalpel and replacing it with the hammer.


You saying that you would rather be on the side that does the destroying is a bit worrying to me though because you are saying you care more about winning than being good. If that's your stance then fair enough but I would rather be on the losing side and die knowing I fought for what is right than participate in evil for the sake of my own gain.
