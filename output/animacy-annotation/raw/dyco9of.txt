I have a quick wit about me and a way to get a conversation going.  I joke about meeting no strangers where I go.  I can talk to Wilson :-)

I say Hello but if I can find a way to make the person smile I will.

This happened at work today. A new man came to empty our shredded bins.  I said, Hello, I told him my name and said I'm the gate-keeper and you'll usually be seeing me when entering the front desk.  I said your company is always sending new people". Since you're new and unaware that we have 3 floors, I'll have to get you a babysitter.  Please wait until I page my someone.  He LOL and smiled and introduced himself.  After he completed his work, he came back to me and said I made his day and how it was a pleasure meeting me.  I told him, well you're family now and you will not be escorted again unless you misbehave.  See you in two weeks. It was a good customer service moment :-)
