1. In the OG they did mention that it's a good idea to leave Midgar as at that point it was dangerous to stay as they had become Shinra's most wanted enemies after the whole Shinra HQ part. Also, Aerith said she needed answers about her ancestry and role. Midgar is surrounded by a desert due to its pollution, with a mountain range to the south and coast to the west and north, Kalm being the only town that is near, in the northeast. That's why they chose it.

2. Yes. The in-game character models are a lot better.

3. Nobody knows. Some people think this is an alternate timeline, some people think that Zack is &gt;!dead and unaware of it, like Bruce Willis in the Sixth Sense!&lt;, some people think that the Whispers being destroyed saved him and he got to survive in the same timeline as our party.

4. Yes, at this point Red XIII helps the party so they help him escape from Shinra, he wants to return home. Maybe you noticed that he doesn't fully trust the party yet as he didn't want to tell them his real name. Later on he'll have his own character arc.
