&gt; You are now making a different argument, you realize this right?  
&gt;  
&gt;You went from stating that Stark served the same narrative purpose as Uncle Ben,  


If I had a fucking nickel for every time you've imagined something that wasn't there, I'd be a rich motherfucker.  That's kind of your thing, right? Seeing stuff that isn't there in movies. Imagining someone saying they said something in order for you to have an argument you want to have instead of an honest argument about what a person has said.  


&gt;   Can you please just answer my question? What was Uncle Ben's narrative  purpose in Peter Parker's character arc? If you can't answer this, then  it just feels like you don't actually know enough about this subject to  have such a strong opinion.   


I know enough that you're too bullheaded and ignorant that it won't matter what I tell you. You are wrong. I've proven you wrong with the link. You can learn from your mistake and make yourself better, or you can remain ignorant. That's up to you.
