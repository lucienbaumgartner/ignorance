"I don't even allow myself to find help, a therapist; AA, anything because then I could lose my job, let down my family, my boyfriend, my apartment, the life I'm trying to make. I'm trying to make it on my own after college." Finding help is the answer.  I started down this road using alcohol to sleep, not knowing in reality it ruins the sleep.  I would sleep at first then wake up at 2-3 am and not be able to get to sleep, .....and then, I would have some more wine to try and get back to sleep. This is ware I really was stupid and unaware that alcohol was the problem ruining my sleep. I am now sleeping:)  It feels so good.  I won't drink with you today.
