Wholeheartedly agree. I'm saying dumbass decisions last year have now led to further moral quandaries and tough calls. I do not think people realize how sheerly incompetent and ignorant of data K-12 leaders were last year around covid. That is what I'm trying to call out. 

I'm not talking some crackpot studies either. Studies signed off on by the CDC, performed by Israel. The same type of studies used to reinstitute mask mandates and better understand how the virus affects and is spread by vaxxed individuals. Now, there's such a greater case to shut down schools, but because of last year's terrible decisions causing such great harm it's no longer so simple as cases go up schools shut down. There's additional factors to consider now due to our malfeasance last year. That's my annoyance. We fucked up schools last year so badly that now we're forced to fuck up again one way or another. Due to piss poor decision making and blatant fear mongering and dismissal of data contrary to the narratives we're now forced to inflict such greater harm onto the most vulnerable in our society by either continuing to destroy mental health and educational progression, or by significantly increasing risk of exposure and negative consequences. I get the concern around schools. I really do. Even though kids are hospitalized at a 1% rate, if you expose millions of kids that's very overwhelming. I'm just enraged at how we handled this so poorly and emotionally before that we've managed to compound harm upon harm onto children and education that will have untold consequences going forward
