So, you're sixteen. You're just old enough to be aware of your own mortality, but not yet old enough to have had a long time to get accustomed to the idea. I was also afraid when I was your age. Despite the stereotype of young people as being reckless and unaware that one day they'll die--maybe the same day they perform some stupid stunt--I think it's normal for you to feel the way you do. And I think it's brave to face it without the comfort of believing you will exist forever in some different form.

When I was a teenager, rational arguments didn't help me get over my fear of being just gone. I already knew it was irrational. What helped was when someone told me that I wouldn't be so scared when I was older and had had some more life experience behind me. That turned out to be true. As I've gotten older, the fear has gone. I'm not ready to die, by any means, but I'm more or less comfortable with the fact that I will someday. 

So even though you're scared now, you won't be scared forever. You know why you shouldn't be scared and over time your emotions will catch up. It's just that you need a little time, I think.

As for your family, I'm really sorry that you're in that situation.
