I got in the shortest of debates with a moron on Twitter (because I too am a moron). He shared another users post basically saying “yt pepo called crackers cuz of owning slaves and shit”. I’m flabbergasted that these people know how to breathe being so unaware and illogical. 

Just assuming that’s true on its face, how can it not be understandable with that context that some people would have a problem being called that?
