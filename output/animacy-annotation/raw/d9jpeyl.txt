considering every other bloody thing they've done, media tampering (not like thats hard), voter manipulation, and all the fraud... yeah, it wouldnt surprise me. lets see... who was it that said a good number of the folks from the mess in Charlotte were out of town. which would then make ya wonder- exactly how many of those out of towners in those riots have been doing the burning, including by intention.

because i don't get the idea of being so mad about something that happened to someone else locally (then again... sod this perspective entirely) that you burn down the cornerstore on fifth and bumwhatever that you got your coca-cola at the day before. 

speaking as a black man who dated a white farmers daughter out in reidsville at th', we got looks, but no more than that. i worried about it, but... ehh. i don't get why people have to be the way they are about this stuff. shouldn't we be beyond it, or at least able t'laugh at it? this division on race and gender nonsense they force just muddles the waters. divided peoples are easy to conquer. to lead. what was it now? oh yeah.

Unaware and compliant.
