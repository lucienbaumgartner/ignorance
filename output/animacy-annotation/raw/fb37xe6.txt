How is this unsafe because of the driver? Did the driver hit the pedestrian on the side of the road after the car slid off the road, hitting the victim completely unaware and unable to defend themselves?

Or was the driver just minding his own business when the guy decided to walk onto the road misjudging the distance of oncoming cars? 

What is the problem here? Is it legal to cross a road? Sure, then why aren't hundreds of people running across roads on busy streets? These people are so myopic. It probably wasn't safe to cross the road, and the "victim" didn't see the car coming.

Add on ice, salt and probably a bit of speeding, you have a death.
