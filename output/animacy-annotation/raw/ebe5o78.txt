That’s certainly one of the downfalls of capitalism, for all the good it has given us. It’s made people very content and complacent with their lot in life and so it makes it harder to fight back against abuse and corruption when those people pay your bills. Back in the days of monarchy, so long as the subjects/serfs were armed, revolting was commonplace until a wise leader was picked that would rule with benevolence. People’s only loyalty was effectively to the state at the cost of low freedom and lack of private property in most cases. In that sense (nationalism) it worked better than capitalism which has bred globalism. Ideally we would just have an effective non-corrupt government (very small) with capitalism as was set forth by our founding fathers. It’s too hard to reign in global special interests when the money keeps coming in to allow people to live “happily” (but unaware and compliant). They control every industry and the laws that govern them now. They’re accountable to nobody except their own employees effectively, and everywhere except the US, those employees are unarmed.
