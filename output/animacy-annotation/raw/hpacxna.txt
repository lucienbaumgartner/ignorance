I agree with most of the answers here but I disagree on the part that these people feel very unhappy inside them. No I believe that these people are so ignorant and so full of themselves, they love who they are so much so they don't permit to anyone hurt them because they don't care about others opinions. They never feel guilty or shamed or worry that they may did something wrong so of course they have good lives. And these kind of people always attract the perfect victims and they always have a stock of people to use them.

These people never worry about the consequences and they never questioning theirselves so they thrive to life easily because they are ruthless and ready to do everything to succeed. And the world is made this way that nobody would validate a person with low self esteem, who feels bad with himself or had struggles to face who ditch his spirit. On the contrary modern psychology will enable this feeling by saying that you have the problem and you need to be fixed rather help you to accept and forgive yourself. To become the perfect slave and be inferior while others will have the best of their lives.

So I'm sorry if I'm sound too negative but I don't believe that the kind and compassionate, sensitive people are the lucky ones. I'm not sure if I'm one of those but every kind person I have met struggle with insecurity, guiltyness and balancing his feelings to not become a complete doormat. Yes these people are precious and it's blessing that they still can exist but I don't know if they win something by this life. Most of them come to a point of neglect themselves of taking care of others because society only enables selfiness and self love no matter what.
