&gt;I don't understand why my post above was so wildly down voted.  What the heck did I say that triggered so many people?  They all hate airports or something?

The reporter said that her own observations suggested that greater numbers of people are leaving Hong Kong than before. In addition, the reporter also said that the check-in employee also thinks that more are leaving as well. 

I think the problem here is that your post is seen as dismissive and ignorant of the realities of many Hongkongers. Of course people carry luggage and cry at an airport, but here we have personal opinions from two people that demonstrate how the situation in Hong Kong is no longer desirable.
