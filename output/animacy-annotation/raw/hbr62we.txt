TW SA

I was the weird kid because I had imaginary friends (2 spirited away type dragons) and because I would fake having boyfriends who didn't go to my school to try and fit in more, and because I never understood jokes and laughed at things others didn't find funny. I was always just really socially awkward and unaware of myself. Still am to some extent. But also i was the weird kid because I was inappropriately promiscuous from a young age due to sexual trauma. Ptsd really does things to you.
