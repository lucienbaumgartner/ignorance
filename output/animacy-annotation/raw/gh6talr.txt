The message is not harsh enough because there are tons of teachers on this subreddit with mental issues because they are underpaid and unaware of it. People getting into the profession/a school and then let themselves be held hostage because they donâ€™t know there are greener pastures.

Sucks that the message is harshly true for 95% of people on here. The fact is that as a new by teacher, you can make 2x+ a 40 year veteran in another district. COL is not 2x, but that salary sure is. Many vets will never make it to the pat I started my career at. To try and thwart the truth about the discrepancy  in pay and treatment is harmful and propagates many of our issues.
