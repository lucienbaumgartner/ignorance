For one, fat people do not die or suffer more from COVID than thinner people. That is false. You talk about not wanting to further hysterics but then say something as ignorant and inflammatory as that. 

Second, centrist thinking is one of the reason we are where we are. Centrist have no spine and are afraid of doing the right thing or taking a stand for whatâ€™s right. Look at Biden. He has chosen to not a stand against COVID or the crazy conspiracy theorists and look at how rampant that crap is now. Centrists allow bad to happen, and do nothing because they want to keep their privilege and comfort. 

You are obviously not a scientist nor anyone with any real authority on this issue so maybe keep your opinion to yourself.
