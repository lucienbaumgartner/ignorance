Honestly, this whole episode has been bizarre to me. I can understand laughing out loud in confusion in front of your computer screen due to culture shock. I understand less the effort of typing a bunch of ignorant and hateful comments into the livestream chat due to culture shock. And I understand even less the effort of writing paragraphs and paragraphs on Reddit defending the hateful comments.
