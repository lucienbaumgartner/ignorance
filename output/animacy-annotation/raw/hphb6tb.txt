From my perspective, I think the idea of attempting to classify economies based on the system of ownership isn't going to lead anywhere useful. It's an old fashioned idea, from the 19th and early 20th centuries when European intellectuals were very scathing about medieval peasants or poor farmers in existing poor countries, assuming they were backward and ignorant. That was when people believed that the English enclosures of common land from the 16th-18th centuries had prompted a boom in agricultural productivity. 

This view has been overturned in the 20th century - Robert Allen measured the returns on enclosure and they turned out to be only 10-15%, not remotely enough to explain the increase in agricultural productivity. Deirdre McCloskey made a strong argument that medieval farming with its scattered plots was efficient. Elinor Ostrom showed the effectiveness and efficiency of communal property. On the other side, economists like Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz and F. A. Hayek (as well as the experiences of the 1970s) made the case for the importance of prices in coordinating economic activity, and economic historians like Douglas North the case for the importance of inclusive social institutions. More sadly, the many costly errors of economic development institutions in Africa and Asia led to a growing awareness that perhaps the locals knew more about their local farming than the Western educated "experts". (I recall attending a seminar by a very experienced development economist who recounted an anecdote of his first trip to Africa. It ended with him gazing at the ruins of his experimental fields left by the hippos, when one of the locals slapped him on the back and said "Wait until the elephants come.") 

By only considering ownership structure, you're missing out on 90% of the interesting stuff..
