You believe that inflation made the price drop?!
It was BTC futures contracts coming to an end. The price always drops…

Yeas it is a hedge. If you only look at the recent drop and ignore the last 2 years, your attention spam is the same as a squirrel with ADHD…

Just look at some on chain analysis and you’ll get a glimpse of what happened. Everyone (that matters for the market) is withdrawing crypto from exchanges. Do you think they plan to make the P2P revolution and bankrupt Binance/Coinbase or they simply don’t want to sell?! Which one is more plausible?

Just because you don’t know what you’re doing, entered in a market totally blind and ignorant of the technology/context and got rekt, it doesn’t mean you know the truth. You’re just butthurt…

Edit: I don’t mean to offend you. You need to get a hold of your emotions and gain some perspective. I lost money when I entered the market years ago. Now, 5y later, everything is far better for me just because I decided to stay instead of crying for the little money I lost…
