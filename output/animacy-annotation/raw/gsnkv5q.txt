The face that woman is making in the bottom right panel is rather odd like the experience you’d have if you were to see a Polaroid photograph of a dead man reverting to its undeveloped state, revealing itself before the man is shot in the head and everything switches between being black-and-white and in color and Danard Shelbner, a former insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller, and his wife are frustrated that their hard-working lives do not allow them to spend much time together and Danard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories because of an attack by two men and he explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife Cathusan, but a second clubbed him and escaped and him and his wife decide to go on a scuba-diving vacation to help improve their relationship and the police did not accept that there was a second attacker but Danard believes the attacker's name is "John G" or "James G" and on their second day they join a group scuba dive and head count is taken and the passenger total is recorded as 20 and Danard investigates using notes, Polaroid photos, and tattoos and Danard and Cathusan decide to separate briefly from the group while underwater and Danard recalls Sammy Jankis, another anterograde amnesiac, from his insurance industry days and half an hour later the group returns to the boat and two members of the group are inadvertently counted twice so the dive master thinks that everyone is back on board and the boat leaves the site but Danard and Cathusan are still underwater and unaware that the others have returned and after tests confirmed Sammy's inability to learn tasks through repetition Danard believed that his condition was at best psychological (and perhaps faked) and turned down his insurance claim and Sammy's distraught wife repeatedly asked Sammy to administer her insulin shots for her diabetes hoping he would remember and would stop himself from giving her a fatal overdose but Sammy continued to administer the injections and his wife died and when Danard and Cathusan resurface the boat has gone and they believe that the group will soon return to recover them and the color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically but in order while they’re stranded at sea it slowly dawns on Danard and Cathusan that their boat is not coming back for them and Danard self-directively gets a tattoo of John G's license plate and they bicker and battle bouts of hunger and mental exhaustion and realize that they have probably drifted far from the dive site and that sharks have been circling them below the surface and finding a note in his clothes Danard meets a bartender named Natalie after she landed in the sea from falling out of a helicopter who resents Danard because he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend Jimmy Grantz and soon jellyfish appear stinging all three of them while sharks come in close and after understanding Danard's condition Natalie gets on her phone and uses it to get a man named Dodd to offer to run the license plate as a favor but they all have no idea where they are in the sea and Cathusan receives a small shark bite on the leg, but does not immediately realize it and Danard goes under and discovers a small fish feeding on the exposed flesh of her bite wound and he then gets on the phone with a contact Teddy who helps with Dodd but warns about Natalie and Danard finds that he had previously annotated his Polaroid of Teddy warning himself not to trust him and a shark bites Danard and the wound begins to bleed profusely and Cathusan removes her weight belt and uses it to apply pressure to Daniel's wound but he appears to go into shock while at the same time Natalie provides him with the driver's license for a John Edward Gammell which is Teddy's full name which confirms Leonard's information on "John G" and his warnings and Teddy soon finds them at sea while he was traveling by lifeboat and so Danard shoots him but the bullet also went through the inflatable lifeboat and popped it as well as killing Teddy so they were all still stranded and after night falls, sharks return and attack Danard during a storm killing him and Danard’s ghost remains among them glowing red with fury and Danard meets with Teddy who is an undercover officer on another inflatable lifeboat who has found Danard's "John G" who is Jimmy and when Jimmy mysteriously arrives swimming Danard strangles him fatally and accidentally pops the lifeboat in the process which leaves everyone stranded again and Danard then takes a Polaroid photo of the body and Danard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper "Sammy" and since Danard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role and the next morning Danard and Cathusan's belongings are finally noticed on the boat by a crew member and he realizes that they must have been left at the dive site so a search for the couple begins and Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G but when Danard is undeterred Teddy claims that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago and he has been using Danard ever since and Teddy points out that since the name "John G" is common Danard will cyclically forget and begin again and that even Teddy himself has a "John G" name and Teddy claims that Sammy's story is Danard's own story which is a memory Danard has repressed to escape guilt and Cathusan realizes that Danard is dead and releases his body into the water where sharks attack and pull him down in a feeding frenzy and after hearing Teddy confess what he did Danard burns the photograph of dead Jimmy and in a monologue explains that he is willing to lie to himself in order to get justice against anyone who has wronged him and after putting on her mask Cathusan looks beneath the surface and sees several large sharks now circling her and she looks around one last time for any sign of coming rescue and after seeing none she removes her scuba gear and goes underwater to drown before the sharks can attack and Danard targets Teddy by ordering a tattoo of Teddy's license plate number and writing a note to himself that Teddy is not to be trusted so that he will mistake Teddy for John G. and kill him and Danard floats off since he’s a ghost confident that despite this lie he will retain enough awareness of the world to know that his actions have consequences and a fishing crew cut open a newly caught shark's stomach finding a diving camera (apparently that of Danard and Cathusan) and of the fishermen asks offhandedly to another, "Wonder if it works?".
