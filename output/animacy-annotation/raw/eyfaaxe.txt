&gt; Except self-determination doesn't equal commiting crimes.

Correct. 

&gt; And that is why you're just downright wrong and a piece of s***

Because you lack basic reading comprehension and keep hallucinating that I've said things that I never said?

Because you've accused Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch of being genocide supporters?

Because you don't seem to understand that Zionists can do bad things without it meaning Zionism is bad, the same way that Americans can do bad things without it meaning that American independence is bad?

Because you're so closed-minded and ignorant that you can't imagine that someone could disagree with you without being evil?

Because you're a foul-mouthed, tantrum-throwing, name-calling, rule-breaking, hypocrite?

Sorry, got carried away, but I was just having so much fun.
