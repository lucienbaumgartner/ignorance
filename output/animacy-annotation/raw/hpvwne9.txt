The bottom line is do whatever you want if it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Your sexual endeavors do not define your worth as a human and anyone who thinks so is ignorant and shallow. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if this guy was worth your time he wouldn't be so focused on something like that, he would care about who you are inside. I know that the thought of people looking down on you--for something that's natural at that--is uncomfortable and scary but you're young and I promise you won't always feel this way. Try your best to keep your head up in the meantime because you're worth so much more than the opinions of others.
