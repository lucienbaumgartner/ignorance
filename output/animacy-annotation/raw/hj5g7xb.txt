The Arians, The Nestorians, The Miaphysites all seperated from the Catholic Church after the Councils of Nicea, Ephesus and Chalcedon respectfully.

&gt;Do we call the Armenian Church Protestant? Do we call the Coptic Church Protestant?

Yes. 

&gt;Are they Protestants?

Again, yes.

&gt;That's just ridiculous, and ignorant of Church History. Protestants are a group that seperated in the 16th century and they have specific doctrines that they share such as Salvation by faith alone. They are identifiable, and they do not mean "every non Catholic"

Yes lol, they do.

Who gives a fuck about Church history? The word Protestant literally comes from *protest* as in "to protest the Catholic Church". Everyone who isn't Catholic is by default Protestant because they protest the Catholic Church. The 5 solas are something most Protestants hold, but not holding them doesn't stop you from being Protestant lmao.

If I don't hold the 5 solas but am anti Catholic, I'm still a Protestant. Which is exactly what everyone on this thread has said lol. And even so, if I wasn't Catholic and didn't hold the 5 solas, then I'd be non denominational by your own definition of what you think that means lmao

And **still** this is irrelevant because **it has nothing to do with denominations**. You can hold the 5 solas as *your own* doctrine, as I do, and not belong to a denomination because and I cannot stress this enough *Protestant isn't a denomination*.
