Interesting how you say "those of us who know the definition of dogma" as if it's not literally a google search away (that is, assuming I'm illiterate and unaware of the meaning of the term).     

"a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."     

There is no "authority" laying down the mere *fact* that animal abuse is wrong. There was no need for you to use that word in regards to veganism whatsoever, nor to be patronizing about it, unless of course you personally dislike those who hold others accountable for their immoral actions.

Just curious... Do you know the definition of "cognitive dissonance"? Really interesting how the first example on the [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) is people who eat meat...
