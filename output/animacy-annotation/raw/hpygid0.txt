You post to a Van Halen sub. You said you were old, you love classic rock. You’re ignorant of other English dialects that aren’t white. 

All of this, points to you being a WASP. 

You’ve never denied the claim, only that I’m weird for making it. 

Context clues are saying you’re an old white person, based on the cultural context I can glean from the information present. 

Again, you will die as you lived, ignorant and white. 

Merry Christmas.
