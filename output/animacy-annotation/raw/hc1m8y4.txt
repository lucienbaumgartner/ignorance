&gt;And it's not really whatever the consciousness in that table are really like. It was still my brain living that experience, not its. The actual experience of being a table would be much more boring and disconnected and unaware of itself and its surroundings. For that you would literally have to actually be that table, not a human taking drugs.

But you're not a human taking drugs anymore once you're past that point. You are simply fundamental conscious awareness. Your consciousness doesn't come from your brain. Your *consciousness* is *using* your brain to give you the human experience that your are having. Once you exit from that, nothing about the concept of humanity remains. 

Also, how do you know that the actual experience of being a table is boring and disconnected and unaware? It's easy to consciously decide how a table should move and act as an animated cartoon. But, one cannot possibly imagine what *being* a table is like unless they've experienced it
