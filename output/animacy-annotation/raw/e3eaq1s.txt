In many states (if not all?) jurors are actually instructed that a conviction requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt can be sustained solely through circumstantial evidence, which can be considered a less direct form of evidence than eyewitness testimony.

True, but courts and judges have mostly no say in whether someone is convicted--that's a determination for the jury.
