I had to explain to my dad why progressive people have to believe that the far right people they love are stupid and ignorant.

That it is a lie we have tell ourselves to we can continue to have to family bonds before we are forced to come to the truth that they are aware of the harm they cause and that they are infact bad people.

And we often continue telling ourself this lie long after we know it's a lie because we believe we can get them to see the truth, even though we know they know, even though we know they enjoy it.
