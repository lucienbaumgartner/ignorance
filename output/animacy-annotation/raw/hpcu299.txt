&gt;These are just a few of the struggles many atheists in majority Christian nations face everyday. So maybe try to find at least a shred of empathy and try to understand where others are coming from before you write them off as “edgy 14 year olds trying to be cool.” I mean seriously, come on. It’s so upsetting to see so many people like you who don’t even make an attempt to be civil.

OP is saying that reddit is filled with atheists who act like jerks and make shallow, negative bias and overgeneralise statement on religions or religious people. They call religious people stupid, brainwashed, ignorant and evil.

The so-called secular humanists love to ironically dehumanise people of faith.
