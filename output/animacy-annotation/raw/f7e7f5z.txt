Hey friend. I want to say, I get you. I also am considering deleting my Facebook account. I am actually going to move country entirely. I have understood now that they are all fake liars and don't actually give a shit about me. So know that you are not alone. I am a 23 year old girl by the way. I am "hot" according to others. So no, for anyone else readin: I am not "that guy" in society. So fuck off with that shit. I just realize people are so self-absorbed and egotistic and unaware that I need to protect my own sanity and bounce. To somewhere less stressful. C:

Okay back to your post: I have always had nightmares too, night terrors. Insomnia. Depression, suicide.. burn out, exhaustion. All of that. It seems it is the illness of this society that causes all of those. We are healthy though so I recommend you do the same as I have done. Say fuck it and leave the 4D box of toxic society and just start playing your own game. Get spiritual with it, playful. Stop giving a single fuck about peoples opinion of you. It helps a lot to laugh actually, just laugh when tragic stuff happens. Sending much love and support. ❤️
