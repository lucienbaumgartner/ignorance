This is something that is very hard for everyone to wrap their minds around, ideas like humans didn't come premade thousands of years ago with all the concepts we have today. That we make new concepts and new words all the time to grasp and describe all the varieties of phenomena we encounter, and as we progress in one field of study riding these concepts we make new discoveries and new concepts.

When new concepts initially arise they take a great deal of explication to describe and explain and interpret and defend. Then those concepts start to work their way through the culture as poets and writers and directors and priests and gamemakers learn them and apply them to their work to be digested by the general public. And everyone talks about it and argues about it and eventually these concepts become conventional wisdom common usage embedded in the culture. And then new individuals are born into this culture and find all these concepts ready-made as if they were eternal and had always existed and always will exist and were not the product of years of dialectic and propagation. 

Heidegger's writing is very difficult to understand because he was breaking new ground. He was dealing with questions that no one else (at least in Europe) had grappled with for centuries.

Many artists have drawn from Heidegger's work, and those artists have influenced other artists, and collectively they produced the world you were born into. Through a long cultural process of which you are unaware and uninterested in learning, these ideas were processed and simplified to be ready-to-hand for you. Then you look back at the origin and assert it is bullshit!
