Nah, there's no evidence of flouride causing cancer, just that it makes people stupid.

&gt; The U.S. ranks fifth in spending per student. Only Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland spend more per student. To put this in context: the Slovak Republic, which scores similarly to the U.S., spends $53,000 per student. The U.S. spends $115,000. The PISA report notes that, among OECD countries, “higher expenditure on education is not highly predictive of better mathematics scores in PISA.”

(Slovakia doesn't flouridate their water, but I'm not suggesting water flouridation is solely responsible - there's a systematic effort underway "to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry." 

&gt; The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
