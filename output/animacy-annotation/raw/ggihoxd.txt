I would also add that their are such cultural purification movements in the very countries you commend, but they're just as edgy. People in england wanna speak Anglisc, a reconstruction of english without the "norman invasive influence" and in France a lot of people wanna restore their danish heritage and you can find old norse french bands like skald, etc. Some irish folks wanna legally ban the english language and only speak Gaelic. Some norwegian and swedish lads wanna return to the odinist ways and reject christian imperialism. Some scottish people get angry at you when you call Scots a dialect of English. But the reason these movements never take off is that they're just unrealistic and unaware of the human social nature. It's a very primitive and tribal way of thinking ngl.
