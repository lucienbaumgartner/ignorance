I do like this I just feel like it would get exhausting for the oppressed or minorities to have to have the patience to explain what should be basic decency. I'm not argumentative or combative at all but I feel like if I tried to "educate" people who are actual racists or just bad people, it would just hurt and make me feel worse. But, with people who are unaware and willing to learn, I support calling them in instead of cancelling them.
