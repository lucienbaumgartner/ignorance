Wait so you're estranged from your mom but you had them talk on video? Girl your responses are clearly showing me that you don't care about understanding their/our perspectives and you just think you're right...it's kinda scary and pointless for me to continue this convo if you aren't gonna get it. Your judgement in this situation was poor. Just because you talk to someone on a video chat for a few hours and they offer to fly you out, it doesn't just automatically mean "oh there's no way they are a killer"...you sound so naive and unaware of the real life dangers of this behavior.
