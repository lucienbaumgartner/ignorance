You call me ignorant, then say I am no longer ignorant thus contradicting yourself. Also ignorance means being uniformed and unaware that is because like I have said many times before I'm Canadian therefore I am currently keeping informed about the *Canadian* robocall scandal as apposed to US politics.

If I'm putting my fingers in my ears and 
&gt; screaming "LA LA LA LA NOT LISTENING."

then why would I even reply to your comments in the first place?
