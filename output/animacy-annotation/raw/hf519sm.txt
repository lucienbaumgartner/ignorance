Stats don't mean everything. Breloom is really good and it has pretty bad BSTS. Quagsire has the combo of recover + unaware and really good defensive typing, where zamazenta has good base stats but a bland movepool and not many tools to make use of its good stats. It has to run howl to even make a splash on OU, proving the point.
