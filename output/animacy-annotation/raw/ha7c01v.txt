It's condescending to assume I'm young and ignorant of other cultures just because you don't agree with me.

"Nigga" is literally the same word as "nigger", the reason it exists is because it's common to drop the "er" sound of a lot of words and replace with an "a" in a lot of English dialects.

It's a common practice in AAVE, and applies to pretty most words ending in "er", like sister/sista, brother/brotha, gangster/gangsta, cracker/cracka. They're literally all the same word as their AAVE variant.

They don't sound different, they're just spelt more phonetically.
