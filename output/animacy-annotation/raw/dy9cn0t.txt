Can we please, *PLEASE* stop comparing great whites to Jaws? That associates them with fear, and fear is what keeps the public unaware and apathetic to the staggering amount of sharks killed daily. Like, I love that movie, it's a great monster flick, but it has unintentionally stigmatized sharks since its release. I feel like journalists have a responsibility to start reporting sharks without drawing a comparison to a horror movie.
