If they are the type of person to belittle and hurt someone, how can they be telling the truth? You can't simultaneously believe what they are saying and BE what is being said. Were you any of those things, you wouldn't be feeling guilt and hurt. People who are terrible, are blissfully unaware and almost proud. It's those who are the least likely to be bad people are the ones who can be so effected.
