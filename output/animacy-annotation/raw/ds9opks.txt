I didn't like it. The opening scene is just odd. The big monster thing turns up and Lead Girl is the only one that notices or has any idea what's going on. But it doesn't seem to be a secret conspiracy or anything, she's just the only person paying attention. From the rest of the episode the monster doesn't seem to be some special unknown thing, they're just things that turn up. So why is everyone so clueless?

And why is the random lord villain so clueless about the consequences of attacking a mage? He doesn't even make it a secret really. And lead girl just decides on lead guy because he turned up. Plus the random soldiers are both useless and unaware that they're useless.
