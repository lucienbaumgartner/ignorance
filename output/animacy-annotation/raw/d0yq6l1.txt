Saying Alexis has been awful is incredibly unfair.

Please watch minute 89 onwards in the Watford game.

He drops deep, drawing 2 Watford defenders, plays a nice one touch pass to Ozil in space, immediately drives past the defenders he has drawn out, which gives him an acre of space. Ozil plays the ball back and Alexis then plays a brilliant through ball to Ozil.

Is this what you mean by him "destroying out fluidity"?

Many times during other games he makes similar brilliant plays to drag the opposition around, create space for his teammates, and get himself involved in the build-up play (unlike Walcott, for example).

Half the time the problem is that his teammates are too unaware and too slow to take advantage of his ability to open up space for others.

A lot of times during games he beats multiple opposing defenders with his dribbling only for there to be no one taking advantage of that by making runs behind the defenders he draws, which forces him to take useless long shots.

Too often it's his teammates that destroy our fluidity and blunt our attacks. Again, please watch that same play from the Watford game.

Ozil plays the ball back to Alexis. Walcott and Iwobi stand like idiots in a straight line, blocking his shot and allowing the defenders to congest the shooting lane. One of them should have IMMEDIATELLY dropped wide to give him a passing option and to draw the defender out of the shooting lane while the other should have moved in to drag the other defender out of the shooting lane. Instead they both stand in a straight line like they are queuing for a bus.

That horrible, tactically inept play by Walcott and Iwobi is much more of a fluidity destroyer and is a fine example of what kinds of players Alexis is surrounded by.

Bottom line: he has NOT been at his best recently, but saying he is awful is just dishonest and harsh.
