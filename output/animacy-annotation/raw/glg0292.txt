One of the suck things for the millions of other workers who already make $15/hr or more up to about  $20/hr is that these people once making good money now make just barely over the starting point and will again be struggling as the cost of living adjusts up.

If you think the cost of living won't adjust up you are delusional and ignorant of history just 40 years back. Those of us in our 30's and 40's parents worked at these types of establishments and made in the $1.25 to $2.75 range in the 60's - 70's, they were able to go to college, have an apartment, buy a new car and have enough cash to do things like go out to movies etc. In the early 80's with the doubling of minimum wage the cost of most more expensive goods and housing doubled or more. Our parents went from being able to afford a fairly good life on min wage went to barely able to afford an apartment and a used car in just a decade or so.

In 1968 the min wage was $1.70 and a brand new decked out Mustang GT(The Bullitt) cost $2854, today min wage is $7.25 and the 2021 Mustang Bullitt edition is $53,705.
