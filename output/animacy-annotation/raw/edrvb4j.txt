I mean, in general the recipe for revolt/revolution is three parts: motive, means, and method.

Motive: one of your key necessities must be removed. Food/water, shelter, clothing, safety, and something to burn free time on. Without this, the other two don't matter. This is what causes unrest, rather than just disapproval. Basically, a threat to a person's way of life.

Means: You have to be in a position to be able to revolt. Tokugawa Ieyasu mostly prevented rebellion by taking away the right to bear arms, and keeping the military occupied. The strongest dictatorships tend to keep their people so broken and ignorant that they're incapable of revolt. However, one person revolting is just a terrorist. Thus-

Method: There has to be some level of organization. This tends to grow organically over time as small cells of potent unrest link up with others, and collect impotent cells of unrest and give them means. This is often where peasant revolts fail or succeed. Generally (though not always), if you look deeply enough into popular revolts, you'll find a cabal of elite persons with something to gain from it. They're generally the ones providing Method to those with means, and Means to those with a method.

Lastly, and this is really the binding agent to everything else, people have to believe there is no other option. Revolution is a huge risk. Even if you win, you may still personally lose. That's why those other three pieces *must* be there, and why it can all still fall apart without this. If there is a less risky path, odds are you'll choose that path instead. In a way, that's the most deviously effective part of democracy. In some small way, you feel like you can affect positive change that will protect your way of life. And it really can have an impact. This is exactly why Trump was elected over some more traditional Republican.
