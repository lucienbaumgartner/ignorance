I thought about this email from Bill Ivey to Podesta when I read your post. I truly believe that this is representative of most actors who are labeled  elected "public servants". 

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

Ie. They don't care about the system, dismiss the system, and want citizens to be ignorant of the system. And they worry that good folks are catching on to their deception.
