Hey guys, I wanted to apologize for that "hick" comment I made earlier. Honestly, there's no excuse to use terms like that to describe a whole group of people, and it was incredibly rude and ignorant of me to say it.

I've been getting overly caught up in politics, which can fuel hatred and prejudice. That's not me trying to make an excuse, but just to provide some context I suppose.

I don't want to make a huge post, because I think that would come off as ungenuine, so I just wanted to apologize for the comment. Thank you.
