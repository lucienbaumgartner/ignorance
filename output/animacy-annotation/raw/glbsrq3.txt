&gt; Also infuriating that the ignorance of this post stating “this is not how shit is supposed to go in a normal government” What does that statement mean? 

It means that government is built on compromise. That's how government has always worked. Here's [an example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986) from 1986.

This tax reform bill took almost a year to do. It's [final passage](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/99-1986/s677) in the Senate was 74-23.

Republican Yays: 41

Democrat Yays: 33

This is how it is supposed to be done. This is how it's supposed to go in a normal government. This is what it looks like. 

If this concept is confusing to you or something you didn't know, you shouldn't be posting or talking in these forums because you don't know enough to comment. 

&gt; With dems holding majority makes it not normal? Thus they should do what you are complaining happened over the past 4 years because there ass hurts?

If you've been paying attention they've been doing the exact opposite. They've been trying to work with Republicans to help bring them back to the right side of things. You'd know that if you've been paying attention. 

&gt; This comes from Biden (who is not my president since that logic was applied 4 years ago) “I support covid relief with help of republicans- if we can get it” “but covid relief has to pass no ifs, ands or buts” sounds bi partisan right? 

Yes it would be nice if Republicans wouldn't block things like getting stimulus checks out to the American people (hey, that's you!), but that's what they've been doing since March. 

You hope that Republicans will do the right thing, like Biden is suggesting, but if they're going to operate in bad faith, there's no sense in trying to coddle that type of person. 

&gt; You basically say the past admin was wrong by doing what the current admin plans on? Or am i wrong?

You're 100% wrong and ignorant of this discussion. But I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to educate the reader. I'd advise you to read more into these topics and learn about it before you comment. That is, if you care at all about how you're perceived on the internet.
