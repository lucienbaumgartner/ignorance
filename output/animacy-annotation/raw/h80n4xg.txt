Hey im an esfp with ni. BEelieve me its like losing your own freedom you are really uncertain whats going to happen next you have to prepare yourself for the worst to come. Also your future is also uncertain and you are really unaware and unexoected of what will be going to happen also im unable to decide my priorities and couldn't able to make decisions i always self doubt myself i cannot plan about tge future possibilities for eg if my mom says that i have to go to a party today evening  but my exams are there and i haven't completed the syllabus cause im completely unaware for tge event then i got confused what should i do and when my mom forces me ti go the party then i have left with no choice but i think myself what would happen if i went to party and don't able to cover my syllabus .. my life us total confusion and sonetines boring too! It seems like things are not in my control
