I'm not complaining about snyder, I missed the part where he said "harley" as it (in my opinion, don't get fumed) sounded quiet and I didn't hear it on the first time watch. People who act like "if you didn't get it the first time, that makes no sense", are being toxic and ignorant of how other people think.
