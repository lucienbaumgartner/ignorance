Treyarch is probably making their own next CoD? I get what you're saying but you're making it seem like you know better when it's been clear about the dev cycle for years now. It seems like you're unaware and unable to accept facts given to you, you always have to be "right". It comes off as arrogant and annoying.

Activision has contracts and commitments to fulfil with each developer which probably include years and dates. Desperation cannot go around that. What you're saying is a guess. We know these contracts and dev cycle exist is a fact. Why would we listen to you?

If you wanted people to listen to what you're saying you should probably stop making fun of them also. I'm not even the most passionate fan and your posts irk me.
