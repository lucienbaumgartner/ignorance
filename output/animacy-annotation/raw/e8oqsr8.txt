Because instinct tells us to fear what we do not understand, and some people are so intellectually uncurious that they simply don't care to learn.  I don't really get offended by it anymore as much as I pity the person who is so terrified and ignorant that they feel the need to use broad stereotypes as insults.

It's a phase that society is thing through, and just as calling people "gay" is no longer widely accepted as an insult, eventually medical diagnoses will no longer be accepted.
