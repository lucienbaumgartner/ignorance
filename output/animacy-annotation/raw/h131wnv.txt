Has less to do with people obsessing over rich things and more to do with a need for price hikes to launder the magnitude of cash imperial societies like America steal. 

The entire structure of America is to commit war crimes, steal shit, and then use the citizens as "credit" sinks. It's literally a short-term suicide pact where the rich just escape to another offshore place. 

Yes Americans are really uneducated and ignorant of pretty much any worldly thing, but the issue is not that. The issue is we live in a cage of smoke and mirrors, and have none of the levers of power to create our own infrastructure organically. America is literally the "war/laundering" organ of the Capital that has been escalating in size for a long time now. American citizens are more akin to prisoners in the factory than genuinely complicit architects of the system.
