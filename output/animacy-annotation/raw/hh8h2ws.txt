&gt; prem league teams set up differently and seem to be much more drilled defensively. thats why you never see crotone level defenses in prem league.

Imagine if a grown as man typed this

&gt;this goes for a lot of teams across serie a in general, just not as defensively sound and the defenders are also not great and have very little backup. 

What is it with this place r/soccer and holding comically arrogant and ignorant of anything that isn't English related? And this isn't only go for English folks but even foreign fans who support English clubs. Its a total mindset of buying into the superiority complex and shitting on everything else.

&gt; shit doesnt even make sense to me

Yea stick to watching EPL game my guy
