Hey friend.  If a dom wants to guide and mentor you out the gate, probably a bad fit for you.  That stuff is earned.

See if a sub or 7 wants to be helpful friends and share their ways of setting boundaries without losing their dynamics.  What red flags to look out for.  When a red flag isn’t actually a red flag.  All the nuance involved.  

Don’t try and do what the other subs do.  Just see if some of it helps you and alter it to fit you and your needs if applicable.  

My advice is to assume about half the kink community is great and supportive and the other half are abusive assholes or selfish and unaware of other people’s needs.  So when you meet this one individual, you have it in your head that they could be either.   Take some time and see if they are capable of empathy and some of the things you might need.

Also, figure out what you actually want and communicate it.  Not all Doms are your type of dom.  I am not a sadist, but I can date a masochist.  Unless the masochist needs someone to need her pain, or needs it all the time.   It is a dynamic and sometimes people who seem like a good fit really are not.
