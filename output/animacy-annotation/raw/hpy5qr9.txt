OR and hear me out here...

OR they recognise that Edgar is a mechanically problematic brawler who could use a rework so his matchups aren't as polar. Not everything is so black and white. I am fully aware of how to counter Edgar but I don't like the fact that there is little to nothing that a Squeak or Dyna can do against him in a 1v1 (unless you are playing against a seriously inexperienced Edgar), or on the other hand little to nothing that an Edgar can do to a Jacky with Counter Crush in a 1v1.

Personally I find it annoying when people say that Edgar's still OP but to say that all people who complain about him probably have low trophies is ignorant and just wrong.
