Bad take and I'm sure you realise this based on other people's responses. Wanda was clearly portrayed to be unaware and confused in multiple instances throughout the show, even when Vision asks her about it. When Agatha tells her the truth she opens up the Hex for the town (obviously closing it after since her family would die) and then later closes the Hex completely.
