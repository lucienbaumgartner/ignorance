I’m sorry that they’re so self involved and ignorant that they can’t see that you only have the children’s and school’s best interests at heart. The fact that all the teachers are mad about a situation that presumably (unless I misunderstood part of your story) only 2 teachers at most were involved in, disgusts me. I hope they don’t try to retaliate in any way or make your job harder, because you seem very good at it.
