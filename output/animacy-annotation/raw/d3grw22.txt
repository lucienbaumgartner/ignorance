Yeah I almost said above that the worst part of it all is they don't do it intentionally. They are so unaware and oblivious to the idea of you posing any kind of threat that they don't see you as an enemy. Instead they will gladly just pick and choose the ideas of yours that they like, and hold that up as the only relevant part of who you are.

And by 'funny' I guess I meant in a gallows humor or soviet era joke kind of way. You're laughing because the only other alternative is to cry.
