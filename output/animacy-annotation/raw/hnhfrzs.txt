Worst drivers on the road by car

1 - big pick up trucks. Just the worst assholes on and off the road. Toxic masculinity in vehicle form. 

2 - BMWs. Entitled, oblivious and ignorant of every other car around them.

3 - Mustangs or other American muscle cars. This might be from heads of living on military bases, but it’s usually young dumb ass dude bros who drive like shit while trying to show off how bad ass they are in the car they pay $600 a month in payments for.

4 - suped up Hondas. Usually better drivers than the assholes in the mustang, but way more reckless. 

5 - Tesla’s. Those fancy camera and vehicle assists can’t save bad drivers from being bad drivers. Usually the same level of smugness of a BMW driver.
