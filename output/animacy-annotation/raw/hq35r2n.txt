Religion and spirituality are beneficial and have their place, but religious extremism is ignorant and dangerous. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or any denomination. I am infuriated about how narrow minded it can be (and, frankly, gives a bad name to others who are religious but tolerant and respectful.)
