This is a prime example of FUD. You don't even care to research your claims. The treasury is for all to see, so to claim "we don't even know what is in the treasury" is just ignorant and incompetent. The rest of the points don't need to be addressed if one of them is so easy to refute. I really don't get your motivation to stay around spreading unfounded negativity. You have obviously sold. And you are doing a lousy job "informing" the public. Or are you collecting as many down votes as possible? Seriously, move on. You are wasting precious energy, nobody is interested in your constant fud attempts. If you have something useful to say with actual proof other than empty claims, people are willing to listen to you. Until then, please consider to spend your time elsewhere. Thank you.
