Well none of what you said discounts that it's been established thst the military has been studying this phenomena for decades and apparently is sitting on a trove of radar and sensor data, flir footage, satellite data etc. only recently have they decided that is info should be released to Congress.

I don't buy that all the highly experts in military studying the phenomena and data associated with it are just utterly incompetent and unaware of lens flares and mistaken encounters with geese and weather balloons. You're telling me that all these highly trained people defense personnel missed something some YouTube influencer didn't?

The more interesting questions are why is the phenomenon seemingly camera shy when in proximity to humans and only shows its self for brief glimpses? And why is the government just now beginning to ease up on the secrecy?
