When Trump wasn't taking coronavirus seriously, and tweeting to 'LIBERATE MICHIGAN' and telling people that wearing masks was a political statement against him, I thought he was just dumb and ignorant. That was bad in a President.

Now it turns out he ***knew*** the virus was deadly, he just didn't give a shit that what he was doing would lead to deaths. That's even worse.
