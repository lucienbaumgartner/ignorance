In my experience it depends on if they every stop getting benefit out of the system. Basically there has to stop believing the family narrative working for them. Most often this happens if something they end up going through something that requires them do develop a greater degree of self awareness. If they already have strong blaming behaviors this becomes increasingly unlikely. 

Admitting what you suffered means also becoming aware of their own behavior. If they are already using blaming to avoid this awareness, something significant has to happen to make blaming useless as a defense mechanism. Blaming and scapegoating patterns are often signs that they have internalized the system and so don't need IRL contact to get the benefit of it. Especially if they are cruel.

Of my siblings, only the lost child admits what happened to me and any role she had it it. The GC still needs the denial to maintain her self image. She is no longer awful but remains completely unaware and unable to actually understand my experience. While she now blames our parents it's for OUR suffering and HER misery. Never mine. At best, she talks about how terrifying and damaging witnessing my abuse was for her. But all her success is built on the abuse our parents heaped on me and our other sibling. Becoming aware of it would expose massive lies in all her "hard work" (read enabled normal effort that allowed her to never fail) and "growth" (moving from entirely selfish and entitled mean girl to moderately greedy and entitled woman with communication skills). At best what I get from her is how terrfying and damaging witnessing my abuse was for her. I would laugh if she weren't also a therapist...
