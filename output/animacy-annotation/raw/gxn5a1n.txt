I completely agree with you on this. I also want to point that's kind Ozpin's mindset, he wants to direct society in the direction he feels is the best course for everyone, but he so lost playing the long game that he's unable to handle the short term issues that Salem plays. 

I do want to add a few things though, most of them are reasons why I think Ozma went about implementing these motions. One, Ozpin(Ozma) had a direct hand in creating the Academies because it gave him a position he could 'earn' that wasn't one that he had to be born into, plus it came with a number of benefits to it. It held a position on the governing council, one that wasn't voted in, thus allowing for Ozpin to hold it for long periods of time. It allowed him to train up warriors to be his tools in his shadow war against Salem, selecting those who were suitable for use as his 'agents.'

As for the military, he utilized public opinion which saw the civilian population direct their ill-founded belief that their existence was responsible for all the suffering that happened, because for what other reasons do armies exist except to fight other armies. Note: this is a very stupid concept that shouldn't exist in a world that many would consider a Death World.

Also, Ozpin wishes to foster a mindset of peace within the people of the four kingdoms and is willing to do anything to keep everyone ignorant and unaware of the danger that they are in.
