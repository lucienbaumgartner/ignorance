NTA

Your parents are being irresponsible, and ignorant of your property. I have a 1 year old, whom always gets into everything. We have to constantly lock baby gates, close doors, and move things from his reach. They should know better as veteran parents. Tupically, when a child is being quiet, it's up to no good. Sorry for your loss. I hope you he doesn't ruin anything else on you.
