So those policemen have been on trial. They have been tried. Then that means there is already due process. Enough said. Getting them to jail relies on due process, not based on your feelings.

You are the one who started commenting on a country you know nuts about. You cannot even understand the language.

Things about US police are well documented. What you know are from media, media that I have the same access too. Growing up in US does not mean you know everything about US because it depends on how much you want to read about it.

But I am very sure that you know nothing about China to comment that it has a better system than US. So get off all posts with regards to China then and stay ignorant.

It is commonly said that Americans are ignorant and arrogant. Yep, I found one.
