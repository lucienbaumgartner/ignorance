True, and because you are so knowledgeable and historically correct.  Other people are unfortunately have chosen to be ignorant and less tolerant of a diverse population in the North American continent (i.e., USA and Canada.)  
Since it is convenient to mention about the diversity in populations, of about four months back, the U.S. did not understood the Afghan's culture and their ethnic diversities that we overestimated the Afghan Military Forces and their defense capabilities and that they collapsed right away under the weight of the Taliban, in less than a half month (a guessed duration or an approximation.)
