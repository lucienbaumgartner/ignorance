Dude you look great, when I was your age I had bad acne and some facial hair that I did not properly take care of lol. Being a teenager is hard, high school is hard, you feel insecure and unaware of where you belong in life. You question what you are gonna do next with your life. But hereâ€™s some reassurance, everyone around you in high school feels the same way. They are just as insecure, they might just hide it better. Keep your head up, the better years of your life are coming. Also,  remember you are a tall attractive guy and ladies love tall skinny guys.
