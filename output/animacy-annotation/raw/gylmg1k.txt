In option one, you bring up atural pattern recognition again. My opinion is thst yes we have natural shortcomings but isn't it the point for humans to rise above those? be aware of our animal downfalls and not act out on them? If you were informed of your illogical conclusions, I would insgine/hope you as an individual would mitigate those things. right now you're just flying blind and unaware of whatever damage you may be doing. 

I say this and include myself in it. I am not proud to admit it but I've become very aware of my own personal biases and it amazes me how subtle it is. It makes me feel shame to think about it. 

option 2 is a quick and sure way to end up with extreme racial tensions, hostilities, and a path to genocidal concerns. 

as for your policy idea, its good but realistically we,ll never get anywhere just trying to plug the leaks. theres too many. we needa new boat.
