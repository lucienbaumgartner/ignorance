I understand that a lot of people were ignorant and skeptical in the beginning with all the conspiracy theories going on but a lit of people died of it, why stubborn until now ? Do you want you or your family members die of it ? I hate to voice it but sometimes I tell myself may we wonâ€™t loose too much if those morons die ? I feel sorry for their  children !
