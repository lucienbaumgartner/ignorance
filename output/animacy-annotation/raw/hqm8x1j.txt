This is just the next iteration of the crazy “pox parties” moms who force their kids to give each other chicken pox instead of just getting a damn vaccine.

I had chicken pox. It was a nightmare. My kids got vaccinated. No chicken pox. 

And yet… still so many stupid women making kids suffer because of ignorant and selfish vaccine paranoia.
