&gt; I found out through a friend who worked with his ex wife that he is a JW. An elder even

The most logical explanation to it all is that this information is not up to date. The only "legitimate" cause for divorce among JWs is fornication, which is also an excommunication (disfellowshipping) offence, so there's a good chanche he's an exJW/exElder/current shunee.

What is more important for you is understanding what you are dealing with. A large number of excommunicated or mis-behaving JWs are still totally brainwashed and unaware that the Watchtower Corporation is a religious pyramid scheme scam. They neglect scientific proof against Bible literalism (noachian flood, tower of pabel story etc.) and demonize opposing views. Long story short, the final outcome is that they belive they have to "get their act together" and return to serve the organization sooner or later.

So, my dear "quite a successful young thing", do some research and find out what is going on. Don't be pulled into a relationship with a bible literalist fundie.
