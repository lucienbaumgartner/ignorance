Sometimes I wonder if being around the elderly so much influences them a bit. Some people think everyone in an aged care home is senile and unaware of the news but there are many in there who have nothing to do but watch the news, and probably tell the staff what they see. And if you spend all day around people easily influenced by the media maybe it rubs off?
