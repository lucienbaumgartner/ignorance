It takes some grieving, but if a parent is unwilling and unaware of the fact that they probably have some things to look at, it's not worth it as their kid. We give them a million chances. Have you ever tried counseling with her or separately? Mine refused numerous times, and that's when I realized our "relationship" was over. Sad but healing.
