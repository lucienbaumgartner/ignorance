She sounds very insecure and lonely. I get that it's annoying, but maybe if you are honest with her and give her a chance to improve, she could get better. When she eats off your plate, ask her to stop. Tell her you need space at cheer practice so you can learn.

Try to be a little more understanding as well. Everyone is on their phones all the time and posts things more than they actually do them. And although it's rude, she's obviously facetiming her friends at family meals because she wants you guys to know she has friends, because she's insecure.

The tiktok thing is weird, sounds like she did it to seem cool, because if her cousin forced her into cheerleading, it must mean she's very desirable. Anyways I wouldn't read too much into it. 

Honestly, she's just totally oblivious and unaware of the social rules she's breaking. You should gently inform her of what she's doing wrong, but also take her under your wing and teach her how to interact with people, because she clearly needs help.
