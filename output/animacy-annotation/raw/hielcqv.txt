It depends on the cat and it's environment.   Does the cat have free reign of the house?  If so, it would be a good idea to segregate it to a quiet, out of the way room until it gets comfortable and then slowly introduce people for very brief and very limited physical contact sessions.  Toddlers tend to be loud and unaware of their strength, let alone understand fear and the need to go slow when approaching animals.  My niece is almost 5 and just got a kitten and the way she bugs that cat is unbelievable.   She is constantly told to put the cat down and to respect her.
