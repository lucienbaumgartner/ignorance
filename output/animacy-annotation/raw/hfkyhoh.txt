I lost a friend. He was hit by a car and in a coma for a week before losing brain function. His case was unfortunately unsolved. But I don’t think that true crime is purely for entertainment. If it’s not talked about and recognized for what it is people would remain oblivious and unaware of the dangers they could potentially be in. I’ve personally been in some really bad situations and my knowledge of true crime has saved my life. My ex nearly killed me several times and I never wanted to accept that he could be that type of person. Picture it like this. A long time ago people wouldn’t lock their doors to their homes and their kids could walk freely alone in town and stay out late with their friends without fear of bad people around them, until kids started getting abducted and murdered. People constantly live in fear that their kid could be next. People now teach their kids about stranger danger and now woman are often taught about domestic violence and rape. It’s unfortunate, but there are bad people in this world. Without the awareness people would remain oblivious and it would only help the bad people get away with their crimes because no one would pay attention to the red flags.
