They taught me history, and apparently critical thinking which you critically lack.

Genshin Impact's art style, and gameplay mechanics are heavily inspired. Also if you ever attended University, sounds like you didn't attend a reputable one if you have not dealt with students from mainland China who do not care about plagiarism as their culture encourages it.

Now to extend it, since you seem extremely ignorant, and evasive, they also are notorious for their ignoring of copyright, which, aligns with your point. Sorry, didn't realize I had to spell that part out for you.

But please elaborate what your backwater country provided to the world that was more significant than the literal internet or GPS.
