Well she's putting you down and cheating emotionally. Have some self respect and walk away from that relationship. She's with you but telling you she loves someone else.. being celebrity or not, let her live in her fantasy world because you deserve someone who will love you and be emotionally supportive...not someone unaware and damaging to you, don't let her put you down and set your boundaries. 

If she's in love with celebrity, why is she in a relationship with you? What are you to her?

Anyway it's her fantasy relationship that will never be real but it's damaging to you anyway so don't lower your self worth in order to be with someone like her.
