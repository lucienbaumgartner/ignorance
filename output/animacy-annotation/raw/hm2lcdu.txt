&gt;I’ve made it very clear that your continued digressions are unwelcome.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nothing you’ve said is of any value to me.  I intend to remain as unaware and oblivious as I am right now, until the very moment of my death.  Further, I intend to make as many people as possible as ignorant as possible, so that I am never challenged, or made to feel "less than".  Because the truth is something that has no value.  What matters is how I feel at any given moment, and I will rearrange my worldview in order to feel good about myself.  I know this is delusional, which is why I say:  
&gt;  
&gt;You are dismissed.

And yet you keep responding.
