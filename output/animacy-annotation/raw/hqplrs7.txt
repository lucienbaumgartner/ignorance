&gt; Libertarians are socially liberal

No they're not. They're socially ignorant and fiscally conservative. 

They are generally anti-government anything, so if some group is being discriminated against, they'd like to let the free market handle it if it's legal. 

"Yeah go ahead and be gay, but if the market discriminates against you for being gay, that's your problem to fix, not the governments."
