Why are you culture-bashing? Have you ever lived in the US? Do you know how the employer/employee relationship works in most East Asian countries (for comparison)? Usually comments like this are made by European/Australian-ish citizens who think their “progressive” employment is somuchbetterthanthetupidMERICANs. It’s not “fucking sick.” It’s a system that people agree to. Brainwashed? If Americans don’t like it they’re free to leave—or better yet—start their own business or company. That’s how Riot games got started. The bigger the company, the more policies they have to capture more employees. Do you think a family own business in the United States suspends someone in this manner for oversleeping? Do you think a mid-sized company does this? Your generalization is so overbroad and ignorant that it’s really hard to approach. I wish you well in overcoming your strange infusion of nationalism for your unknown country and hate for “those stupid sheep Americans.”
