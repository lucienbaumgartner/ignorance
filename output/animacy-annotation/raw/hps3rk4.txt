probably anime fans, or something similar. imo its kind of rude and ignorant of them to do so, but its their choice so they can do what they want. my chosen name is in my tribes language and it represents a really important connection for me of my people and ancestors and who i am, so personally i find it pretty rude and thoughtless to use other languages names/words just for your chosen aesthetic without really having an understanding or connection to that culture. as a minority and from my native american pov, language is something that can get taken from you or used against you a lot in order to minimize your culture and diminish the connection you have to it. its pretty irritating too when the same people who mock you for your name or language then decide they think some of it is pretty cute and they want to cherry pick parts of it for their own use, esp when half the time they dont know or understand the culture or context behind the name
