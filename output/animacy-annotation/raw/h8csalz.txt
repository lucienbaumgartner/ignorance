Pride formed as a celebration of the Stonewall riot, which happened when Stonewall inn got raided by police for being an LGBT+ friendly bar and the patrons were having none of it and fought back against the police in response, and it was incredibly political during a time where queer folks were heavily persecuted for who they were back then - it's the reason why we now have rights that protect us from discrimination and support us in marriage equality and support for being able to transition and be ourselves against homophobia, transphobia, etc. which we are still fighting even now, and this idea of pride being apolitical is entirely fictional and ignorant of our history
