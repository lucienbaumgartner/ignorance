My bad for getting heated, I'm an amateur animator you see, at least, I try to be. What you said is honestly insanely ignorant and insulting to all the hard work people like me put into this stuff. Good animation normally takes several viewings to fully appreciate, the idea that you can get anything more than a basic level of comprehension off of a single viewing with a significant portion of your attention devoted to reading subtitles is just dumb.
