Do you even early 2000s bro you had to take the wheel off and remove internal panels of several vehicle models to access the battery.  Thats not an excuse to remove right to repair. Many of us work on our own vehicles. Japanese bikes are a huge pain and have been for 20+ years. That doesn't mean i shouldn't be able. Adapt, not everyone is ignorant and lacking mechanical abilities
