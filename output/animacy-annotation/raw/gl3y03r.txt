Legally it isn't. Outside of our forming an entirely new form of government from the Confederation. It's as much the United States as the CSA was, i.e. not at all. You seem to be relying on a semantic usage. Yes, we can say its America, we can use it to define our civic culture; but the literal facts on the ground are that America did not form until the Constitution was ratified. 

Evidenced from your, 'someone could be a slave if they wanted to.' Firstly, your example is a contorted version of mine and more accurately describes a fetish relationship than chattel slavery, the type being referenced. There can be no contractual slavery in the US; 13th amendment, it would be nulla de nova; void from the start. 

See the numerical ordering of the French Republics. A successor state isn't the same as the previous state, at all even though yes it could still be France or Germany. Usually a new constitution forms a new state. 

Time to adapt? Are you fucking serious? 
Dumbfounding response...truly. 
It's imperialistic and ignorant of history.
You have set imaginary rules and are deciding the fate of people you dont know without their input; thats the problem. 

States cannot form new states without consent of congress and the state in question; Congress gives the mandate for a state to form. Territorial status is actually a growth impediment in most of these islands, which have been occupied since: 1917 USVI &amp; PR, [1986 CNMI, 1950 Guam freed from Japanese Imperial Navy in WW2], AS 1900-1904.
How much time do you think is necessary for them to decide they want full representative democracy we guarantee to all citizens in out country?

It is an imperialist perspective to keep people in poorer conditions because thats the history. They do not benefit the way they would had they full representation.
