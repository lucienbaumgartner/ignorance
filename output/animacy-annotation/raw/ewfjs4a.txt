I was young and extremely toxic with a lot of negative karma on ESEA. Although i try not to blame myself because i knew nothing better, i was simply stupid and ignorant. That being sad, a lot of advancements have been made in e sports and scouting which is seen in my small country Iceland. I bet there was a lot of stupid kids like me who were good.
