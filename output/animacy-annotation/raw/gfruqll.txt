Here's what I think:

1. When he died in Ose tower

2. Shulk did die. He was revived and kept alive by Zanza, but his conscience and thoughts was still present and unaware of Zanza. By the time Shulk died, he was outside the margins of fate and was able to will himself back.

3. One way or another, yes he is a machine of some kind. He takes on the appearance of a human to fit in with homs. 

4. My headcanon is that it's a recreation of Zanza's home universe for Zanza to basically live in.

Basically, Zanza lived in Shulk's body so that he could attempt to destroy the Mechonis again. If you remember Arglas, the giant that Zanza originally possessed, Zanza's plan was to basically use Shulk as another Arglas. Meyneth was defeated quicker than Zanza expected, so he took her Monado and abandoned Shulk's body. 

Shulk and Alvis have a little talk where Shulk realizes that he was and still is outside of the passage of fate because Zanza let him change the passage of fate with his visions. If you recall when Shulk first started having his own visions, not the ones Zanza gave him, that was an indication that Shulk was now outside of the passage of fate.

Shulk and friends travel to Zanza's area, where they see our universe, what is later revealed to be Zanza's home universe that he destroyed. They fight Zanza, and Shulk finally understands the nature of fate and his impact on the future. Alvis also reveals that he is the source of the Monados (they never really say why he let any of them use his power. Maybe it's because he's a computer and does the will of the "admins"?). Then we see Shulk kill Zanza, and Alvis shows how Zanza destroyed his universe, and Zanza (now also known as Klaus) and Meyneth became the gods of the new universe. Shulk, now being the only being outside of the passage of fate (basically a god), is asked what he wants of the universe. Shulk refuses to decide, and let's everyone make their own decisions, effectively destroying the concept of fate.
