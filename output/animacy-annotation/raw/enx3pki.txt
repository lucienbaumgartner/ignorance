Your way of thinking is so flawed and ignorant that i dont know where to begin. Since you grew up poor, you think it's okay to illegally help one poor person with public good since your tax dollars paid for some of it. Public funds used to subsidize school lunches is for every child at that school. Every child benefit from lower cost on school lunches. It is not intended to help one poor child to get a free meal. Poor people get welfare cheques and other benefits that they can use to put food on the table. If you want to help them because they cant help themselves, use your own money.
