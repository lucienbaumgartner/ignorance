It does make sense because it's called "keeping up appearances". The Time-Keepers are obviously nefarious beings with an ulterior motive. Think it's obvious they don't "protect" but "control",  and if they aren't actually in control as much as they want to be (how are there multiple Loki variants if everything is under control?) then it makes sense to lie and pretend everything is fine. They tell each timeline that there is only one in order to keep them ignorant and unaware of a multiverse.

But this isn't something I believe is happening. It's just an idea. I was spitballing. Can't say it doesn't make sense though.
