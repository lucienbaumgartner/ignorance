What he’s saying is true- it’s not on him how people interpret it or understand it.  I didn’t understand what he meant at first- I sick in stats, but when I read what he was saying it all fell back and made sense. Don’t go off say he’s implying anything while it’s WE as the uninformed and ignorant that don’t get what he’s stating.
