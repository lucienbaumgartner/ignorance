Having worked with the American Department of State, I can assure you that none of them are the country's best. They are an odd bunch. I don't think I've ever worked with a group of people so ubiquitously insecure. All of the American diplomats I've spent any time with have at some point worked in to the conversation the results of their IQ tests. I'm not sure why that is such a common topic, but it's very uncomfortable when its bright up. Yet, they are, ironically given their positions, very self unaware and socially awkward.

Pill addictions and extreme alcohol consumption were common with the group I observed. I'm guessing the pill problem is just representative of the opioid epidemic in the States. I can recall speaking to a public affairs leader who had just taken an assignment, having retired from a large brand, and he was confessing to me that the sheer level of immaturity within the community was causing him to rethink the position.

 I know that's a broad brush but the ones that seemed normal were few and far between. It was simply bizarre.
