The Boomers have always been given everything on a silver platter. As a generation, particularly in the UK, they've never really worked for anything or faced genuine hardship and they're so pampered and ignorant that they have literally no useful experience or skills to pass on, so what are they even for?

 Sympathy for them is rarer than bogroll and squirty soap here.
