Thank you for submitting to /r/unpopularopinion, /u/BBB_kakashi. Your post, *The people who spam "God is coming for us, regress your sins" are annoying and ignorant of other peoples beliefs.*, has been removed because it violates our rules:


Rule 3: Megathread topic.

Your opinion falls under an incredibly common topic, in which virtually all opinions are either not unpopular, or are posted about many times a day. Please visit the megathread hub, which can be found when sorting the subreddit by "hot", sticky'd at the top of the page, where you can find links to the current megathreads. If you're not sure which megathread your post belongs in, or your post covers multiple megathread topics, just make the best selection you can.

If there is an issue, please message the mod team at https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Funpopularopinion Thanks!
