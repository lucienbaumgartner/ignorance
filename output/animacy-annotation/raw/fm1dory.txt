I cannot give you a definitive answer, but suggest a grounding in the ideological implications of policy, with a view to the political contest of ideas in government and the wider world, might be desirable, even deemed necessary to put the rubber of your business acumen on the political tarmac, so to speak. 

I might further suggest, if you believe you have such political awareness that your analysis would not, for example embarrass your political masters by advocating for the policies of the opposition, that you apply anyway and address the issue in your covering letter. 

If your application is unsuccessful, there may be the possibility of communication on what you might do to remedy the situation, and it may be advisable to be aware in advance of any conversion courses, night classes, or work/study arrangements available, that would allow you to gain the necessary education in politics, whilst employed. 

If however, you are politically unaware and uninterested in politics, this is probably not the job for you.
