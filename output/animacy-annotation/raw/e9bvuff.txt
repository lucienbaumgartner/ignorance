I’ve always had this notion that climbing only enjoyed a select few, and unaware that there were several veins of styles. And with trips to JT every year and watching a lot of climbing vids, I’m starting to notice that this is a community a lot like B Jiu Jitsu. I’m relatively older (37) but keep in great shape and have been practicing Jiu Jitsu for several years. I love the outdoors and would love to pass time outside of the mat by weekend climbing (bouldering or free climbing) rather than sitting in camp/ fishing all day. I would prefer outdoor climbing bit would love to hear some realistic expectations for a first timer. Ideally how much to spend and if I should invest in some time for classes. Also, like BJJ, is this a sport where you need friends/ partners to improve? Or can it be enjoyed solo? What other skills are needed to be able to climb?How welcome is your sport to outsiders and newbs? Thanks all, stay safe!
