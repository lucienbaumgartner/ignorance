The whole point of splitting the games in to two was to keep them separate.  We don't need another situation where the survival aspects of this game take a back seat to yet another battle royal mod. Unless you are new and unaware that a battle royal version of this game exists, in which case I would gesture to the steam store and tell you to look up "king of the kill"
