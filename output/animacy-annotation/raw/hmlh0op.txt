Centrism has its place in politics but also in some cases it really, [really does not](https://thenib.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/centrist-history-2-0be.jpg).  There is no compromising with these kind of views. These guys immediately default to calling someone a Jew, a f****t and a woman as insults. Thats nazi rhetoric. Believing these guys would treat those groups well if put in power is just naive and ignorant of history. If a society does not manage bigoted hate groups their views become mainstream given enough time and then your country gets ruined for the next couple decades.

You can look up any polling surveys you want, white supremacist groups overwhelmingly support republicans and Trump with enthusiasm. 

Judge reality as you see it with you eyes. Do you honestly believe that guys using homophobic slurs and "woman" as an insult are going to support the party that is **pro** LGBT rights and has elected the first woman vice president?
