I wouldn't full-bore take over cooking quite yet - that's asking a lot of yourself and more importantly the rest of the family. 

But - do obviously consider taking over some.  maybe pick a night like and make it a bit of a ritual thing.  then that opens the door for future growth.  and it gives you the rest of the week to practice your own foods so you don't have to subject your family to every hurdle of your learning curve.

So some obviously basic tips? 

* more green things.   try accompanying meals with a small side bowl of salad, or make a good salad into the meal.  My wife and i will even do "steak salads" and "chicken salads" as a way to get meat on a mostly-green plate.
*90% of weight management is about calories in/ calories out.  so one of the things we did was to start using smaller plates/bowls.  not the big dinner plate, because the natural tendency is to fill it.   
* another big thing we do is we ask how hungry we are, on a scale of 1-15 before we plate up the dish.  rarely do we say even 9 or higher.  it helps put people into a mode where they're gauging that and thinking about intake.  you can have an 11 day, and you'll get a double scoop, but... but you are more aware of what you're doing.  you can obviously use whatever scale you want, 1-10 is fine.
* if you want to get good at cooking a dish, i highly recommend cooking that dish using a vast array of recipes.   Recipes are the real deal for learnign how to cook well.  some will be a bust, some will be great once out of the 3 times you try it.  but say you want to learn how to cook a home-cooked tomato sauce for pasta, you just practice that, over and over.   say you want to learn how to cook Kung Pao Chicken or Pad Thai, or turtle soup, you have to just commit to doing it many times.  then you'll get the hang of it enough to "wing it".
There's not much i know about over-/ under- supplying things like potassium  and sodium and whatnot - I do know that buying/using a lot of boxed foods is generally a way to get waaaaayyyy too much sodium in your system.  sodium is salt, if you're unaware, and most manufacturers just dump it in their food - some for preservation, some to simulate 'flavor', and make foods not bland.
* you also want to be very careful with sugars for the same reason - manufactured food has a bunch of it, more than necessary - shit - even food has been engineered to have more of it in the growing process - peaches, apples, grapes, whatever... they're bred/designed to have a higher % sugar than they did &lt;last year&gt;.



so that's what i know.  fair warning, i'm no nutritiounist, nor a health-nut... i just try to control a little bit of what goes in.  I don't control everything though.

good luck!
