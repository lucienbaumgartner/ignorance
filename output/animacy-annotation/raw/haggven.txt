1. two years is nothing, and will not solve the underlying problem
2. foreign buyers will just use domestic proxies to accomplish the same thing
3. What about domestic companies who are owned by majority foreign shareholders? which leads to
4. this does NOTHING to address the two largest single issues, which are a) lack of supply and zero incentive whatsoever to build more and AFFORDABLE starter homes and bungalows for young couples and seniors in particular, and b) massive private equity and investment companies buying up literally thousands of semi/detached/townhouse/condos in order to rent-seek, preventing any individuals from buying those homes, which further drives up already insane prices by reducing already scant supply, all the while ensuring that working class and now middle class people as well have less and less chance of ever getting on the equity ladder, of which owning a home is one of the few remaining ways to do so.

This is another typical paltry political theatre presentation, an action designed to look good to the public who are largely unaware and ignorant of the actual causes and exacerbating factors of the problem, and who will see this and think "good, the government is taking action against those foreigners who are buying all our houses!" when in fact most of the stuff purchased by foreign buyers were urban condos that were ALREADY priced well out of the reach of your average working class canadian, and have been for years.

As another poster has already commented, Trudeau was promising this shit back in fucking 2015, and it was garbage back then to, look what they were talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;provide $125 million a year in tax incentives to increase and renovate the stock of rental housing across Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Except the LAST thing we need is more rental housing and more landlords.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;finance the construction of new, affordable rental housing for middle- and low-income Canadians.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is literally part of the problem, we need LESS rental housing and more canadians in housing they intend to OWN, more people in rentals means LESS overall national economic security as fewer people end up with any kind of long-term equity at all

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;
take stock of federal lands and buildings to see what could be transformed into affordable housing.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, affordable RENTAL housing, gtfoh

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;
update the Home Buyersâ€™ Plan to help more Canadians finance home purchases. This program allows Canadians to dip into their registered retirement savings.

&amp;#x200B;

LMAO in other words, relax regulations to allow people to go even deeper in debt to "afford": houses that are wildly overpriced due to the supply issues you intend to NOT solve because you just want to build more rental housing instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck out of here with this garbage. Not that it mattered, that was 6 years ago and no one lifted a finger in the meantime. This is all garbage from people who don't even understand basic economics, and who, if they did, would just come down on the side of the massive investment groups anyways.
