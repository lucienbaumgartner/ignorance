Very common scam that's been going on for years, although typically they tell you to buy itunes gift cards.

I'm actually a bit surprised to hear they are using Steam gift cards.

...and for those wondering... typically scammers like to target the elderly who are far more unaware and more trust worthy of those who talk over the phone.
