If he hadn't been searched when he entered the courtroom.

If he wasn't bound in any way when in the courtroom.

If he was standing in a courtroom with his picks in hand and nobody noticed.

If none of the spellcasters expected him to try to escape.

If the door hadn't been warded or arcane locked by any of the spellcasters.

If the door was only locked and not barred.

If the door was light enough to just swing open with no action.

If the guards were unarmed and unaware that they were supposed to be guarding.

But it's ok to miss or forget stuff. Play it up, like everyone's bewildered that he would even try to escape. Nobody has even tried to escape this courthouse in the past generation. Roll with it, have fun, and remember for next time.
