Where exactly did she say that? That may or may not be true but spewing speculations about someone else's situation that THEY aren't publicly sharing, is disrespectful and ignorant of anyone to do. That's Katja's story to tell and not even remotely your business. You're not exactly coming off as the most level headed person in this situation either. Which begs the question, did Destiny see a way out of a life she didnt like and take the opportunity regardless of who or where that intailed? Was the Happy home you've painted a picture of happy for Destiny? Or just Happy for you? Does how Destiny feels matter to you? Or just that you're more  comfortable with her being home safe and sound?
