when did i claim my idea is "amazing"?  
  
&gt;such an amazing dev then how come nobody here has ever heard of any of this amazing stuff you've done  
  
are you seriously that dumb and ignorant that you truly think the merit of ones programming capabilities is whether or not reddit knows about them or not? do you legit think every programmer and database enthusiast ends up being a game dev?  
guess everyone on reddit knows the one and only "Steven Feuerstein".
