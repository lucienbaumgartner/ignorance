What do you think? I looked up “paid gov shill” on the internet and they hired me to sit on reddit and advise you that you might be a little gullible and are helping ruin the work people have done to advance the subject forward?

I’ll do that shit for free. This subject has been taken as a joke my entire life because of posts like this. **The government doesn’t need to pay people to ruin this subject, you are already out here doing it for them. Completely free and ignorant of charge.**
