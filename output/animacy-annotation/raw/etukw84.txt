FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT! This was all extremely coordinated and carefully planned. It was not a random coincidence that right after the Epstein scandals broke trump tweets the most racist shit he has yet. Pence standing there like a cold lizard looking at prey was no accident either. That’s how sick and ignorant that 40% of Americans are that support these pieces of shit.

These tweets and pence photos completely take spotlight off trumps involvement in Epstein scandal and it “empowers” their followers at the same time. And Lindsay “Cuck boy” Graham spewed that shit and his followers ate it up. 

Ignorance is America’s number one enemy. No one with a sound mind and a normal amount of wisdom would ever support these idiots. Yet here we are. It’s pretty sad.
