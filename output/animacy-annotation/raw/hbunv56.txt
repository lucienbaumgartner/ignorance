&gt; “Weapons that are mostly bought by white supremacist terrorists and fascist gangs”. 

You’re implying that guns in general are the weapons you’re referring to - if this is the case, cool, and if not please clarify if you mean some subset of firearms. 

So do you have evidence of this claim? It sounds pretty outrageous to me. 

Also I agree that almost all white supremacist terrorists and many fascist gang members have firearms, and want to add that those folks want to do a mass murder with those firearms. But I have a question: if they follow through with their murderous intentions on a wide scale, is it better for all of their leftist and liberal opposition to be unarmed and unaware of how to use weapons to defend themselves? Or is it better for as many leftists and liberals to be armed and able to safely defend themselves and others?
