NTA. I have a friend like this, constantly hitting me up at every hour of the day, even when I've explicitly told him that I'm tired/not in the right headspace to chat. You shouldn't feel pressured into conversing with someone when you're not in a conversing mood. It's selfish and ignorant of her to constantly expect you to be on her time at her convenience, as if she doesn't realize that people have lives outside of entertaining her. She then has the audicity to dub you a "bad friend" when you don't have the stamina to talk 24/7. Just know that taking time for yourself to recharge and reorganize doesnt make you a bad person. It is indeed a necessity that needs to happen from time to time at risk of your physical/mental/psychological health. Your "friend" is the only bad person I see here. Again, NTA.
