At one point, Logan - either not tracking, or just making everything about himself - says (even though they're talking about Logan's *brother*) that he fears Adam will pull up some of Logan's old videos. Logan admits his old stuff is "pretty cringe" and that he's now "matured."

He then proceeds to give the most arrogant, unaware and narcissistic interview I've heard on ACS maybe ever. Floyd Mayweather couldn't have done better.  He volunteers that he's:

* Pretty smart
* Pretty versatile
* Has a ton of business acumen
* A HUGE nerd/geek (in a self-loving way)
* Blew out his ACT scores and had a 4.7 (?) GPA and had a full ride to college
* Gets an adrenaline rush during sex, sometimes
* Is more or less a boxing pro who hasn't found a worthy competitor in the ring or anywhere else

Forgivable (but worrisome) for an 11 year old, but terrifying to think this is from a 24-year-old who has been so shielded from external feedback during key social development years that he's become a hyper-oblivious bro monster. The guy thinks he is Zeus. Guess that's what you get when you pluck a tween out of BumF--- Ohio and get him in the LA-transplant-YouTube-star positive feedback loop.
