they fund israel and support the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people, they interfere in so many elections by doing coups in many countries in the global south like Honduras and Cuba, there's so many more examples that you could read up on. All of these I listed though are done with the "goal of detriment for other nations and benefits for itself." The US was literally built on those principles. Colonized Indiginenous peoples and stole their land, then slavery and exploitation of Black people. This is relevant to today because the US is a huge imperialist force that still oppresses people. It's actually so ignorant and disgusting that you'd minimize US imperialism by saying there's no goal of detriment for other nations for the benefit of the US
