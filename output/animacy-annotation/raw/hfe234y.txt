Hey - first off, sorry you have to experience this behavior from your roommate.Microaggressions are **NOT OK** \- no matter whom it is made to or what stereotype/prejudice it perpetuates. You should make sure that she understands micro aggression comments are not tolerated if she continues to make you uncomfortable and you should bring in a RA if you are non-confrontational about it.

It's definitely possible because she comes from a privileged, non-diverse/non-inclusive background/upbringing &amp; is completely unaware and ignorant of the actions/words she makes on others (e.g. I am a male of asian-descent, and her words generalized myself and more than 50% the male global population). Compliancy and bottling this up while dealing with college life isn't worth the anger/stress, so I hope you can resolve this!!

P.S. I'm not sure of which umich governing body/department would take care of these complaints (others, feel free to chime in!) , but I think the office of Office of Student Conflict Resolution would take care of it: [https://oscr.umich.edu/](https://oscr.umich.edu/) . You've got my support as well!!
