sorry... it sucks what happened. I’m sure you have resentment towards her. All I have to say is though that she was probably unaware and curious. I told my younger brother we should practice a kiss once and just have him a peck on the lips. My friend and I showed each other our chest because we were curious. I’m very sorry it happened. Just keep in mind she was also a child. I’m sure she regrets it.
