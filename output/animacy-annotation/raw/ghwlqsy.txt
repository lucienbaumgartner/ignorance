I think you're really young and unaware of the changes that will happen in your twenties. You may feel ready for marriage now, but you might not in several years and be glad you waited. What is the harm in just dating for a while? If your love is really that strong and your relationship that healthy, you should be able to date for a long time before marriage. You're thinking in a very linear fashion, and relationships don't work that way. They are constantly progressing and deepening as you get to know one another, go through challenges together, take care of each other, etc. 

Think about why you actually want to get married. Do you equate it with safety, happiness, stability, etc.? You can feel those things in a relationship without being married. Do you equate it with maturity and adulthood? Marriage isn't a sign of maturity. Your brain isn't fully developed yet and it's reckless to make a decision like getting married when you're so young.

You should listen to your instincts. Someone who doesn't want to move in together before marriage strikes me as untrustworthy. It is recommended that couples live together before marriage to see if they are compatible. If you basically live together as you say then he is being a hypocrite.
