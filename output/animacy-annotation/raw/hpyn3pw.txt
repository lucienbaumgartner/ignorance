It sounds like a very tough position that you’re in. I’m sorry that you don’t have support from your family, and you’re feeling afraid of people at large.

One thing transition has taught me is that people are mostly good. The bad, bigoted, violent stories rightfully get a lot of attention, but they’re not the standard every day experience of being trans. Mostly people will be ignorant and awkward. Many will be supportive and loving, though.

Be vigilant and, as others suggested, assess your safety and support first. But know that, with few exceptions, you can rely on the compassion of good people.
