&gt;So how much is fair and equitable price of power?

A market price? People who can produce or comsume power with lower emissions footprints would be at an advantage, incentivizing a shift in that direction. The market works out the actual price. I'm not talking about taxing or regulating, just putting in a mechanism that encourages lower emissions.

&gt;What will you get for that?  So you choose to pay nothing extra for greenpower now, but you say you are willing to, you just don't.  Got it.

I've put solar on, I pay the extra couple of bucks for green when I can on a bill or plane ticket. How does a single consumer shift the mode of energy production and consumption meaningfully towards lower emissions? I have a fairly limited scope of influence as one person. As a country, we could do something.

&gt;She lied mate.  LNP have lied plenty too.  A lie is a lie mate, doesn't matter who does it or who reports it.

Did she ever say there will be **no price on carbon**? Before the election she actually said that there would be. She seems to have fairly consistently pushed for a price. The government just stumbled in its communication and adopted the opposition's moniker for their policy over time, which was disastrous.

Like I said, I would have supported any carbon pricing strategy. Call it whatever you want, I believe in the policy, move towards lower emissions.

&gt;On August 20, the day before the election, [Gillard said](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983):

&gt;&gt;I don’t rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism. I rule out a carbon tax.

&gt;When she announced the market-based carbon pricing scheme on February 24, 2011, the government’s [press release](http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/climate-change-framework-announced%5D) said:

&gt;&gt;The two-year plan for a carbon price mechanism will start with a fixed price period for three to five years before transitioning to an emissions trading scheme.

&gt;Only later did Gillard and the government begin referring to the pricing scheme as a “tax”.
It should be said that Gillard was probably quite consistent about wanting to implement some kind of carbon price, though it seems that she did not successfully enough ensure that her distinction between a “tax” and a market-based “price” on carbon was communicated to journalists.

&gt;The issue with Gillard’s statements was always one about political acumen rather than honesty. In hindsight, if she was always intending to price carbon – and it seems clear that she was – there was no need to utter those fateful six words in the first place. Once the government itself began to use the term “tax”, its fate was sealed.

&gt;You should try and stop being so biased.  Get out of your little lefty bubble mate. Try being fair and reasonable for once.

I'm well aware of where the other road leads. I know how far business will go towards reducing emissions when there is no financial incentive. It just doesn't, which is why Australia is still increasing its emissions. How long are we going do that? Is Australia so weak willed and ignorant that we can't/won't reduce our emissions?
