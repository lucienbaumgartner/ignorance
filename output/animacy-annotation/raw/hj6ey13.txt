Ryan and Blake are artfully cheeky and never insulting to each other. This is, at best, a weak misfire of emulation. At worst, itâ€™s downright offensive and misogynistic. 

And I thought Guardians of the Galaxy was funny as a character, but that guy had gone to space as a child and had an excuse for being emotionally unaware and obtuse. This is gross.
