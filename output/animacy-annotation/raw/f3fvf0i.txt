Strongly disagree. Language needs set rules to function properly. Ebonics has a tiny vocabulary; the words are slurred together; it's barely understandable. 

If I meet anyone who isn't at least relatively well-spoken, no matter their race, I'm automatically turned off to them as I perceive them to be shallow and ignorant. That might not be correct in every single case, but if you want people to think you're worth spending time with, act like you are and work on improving yourself.
