Idk if this makes any sense to you, but you’re not the only person who watches influencers and you are not indicative of anything other than your own experience.  Influencer marketing DOES work. It DOES matter when reviewers are paid to promote things they are supposed to review in the future. It DOES matter when film and game studios pay reviewers to hype up their products. To say that it doesn’t matter simply because YOU are too smart to fall for it is ridiculously short-sighted and ignorant. Of course YOU wouldn’t consider yourself susceptible to advertising techniques.
