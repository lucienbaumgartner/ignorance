I don't like how Israel's government acts and I believe the Palestinian people deserve their homeland, but saying they aren't states is quite immature and ignorant of you. I literally thought that Israel shouldn't be a state at 15 years old, I've had friends die as a result of Israeli policy in Palestine, yet they are still a state and you probably should grow up and get to a better understanding of the world folk🤷🏻‍♂️
