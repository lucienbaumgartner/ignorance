I think for me it's the fact that he was so unaware and ignorant that he is toying with our concerns for them (hence our mental health too) when he said he isn't about that and how he wants to promote mental health. It's the way that he is coming off that is just not right. The right way would be a simple "we are aware of your concerns and will be addressing them in due time, for now we'd appreciate it if you grant us more privacy".
