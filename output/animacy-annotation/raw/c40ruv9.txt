&gt; against people like you

You haven't exactly expressed who people "like me" are. You don't know me, you don't know anybody here for the most part, yet because you are a bigot you feel the need to post how everybody here are assholes and closeminded... yet the one most fitting these terms are yourself.

You are so incapable of handling any negatives for doing such actions, you are seemingly ignorant and unaware that people actually read these things. You sound shocked when somebody replies to you, and whine and complain when they don't just agree with you. Your upset, whining about how you're such a victim, yet you are the one bullying.
