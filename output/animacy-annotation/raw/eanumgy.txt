I see you are an ableist neurotypical who thinks himself loud and proud while stepping on the necks of those who were unfortunate enough to have been born with disabilities beyond their control. Morally repulsive, but expected for someone as scummy and ignorant as a blind partisan. 

The camps have existed for decades, including under Democrat administrations. You didn't care then. Most people didn't. I did. You are taking every straw you can find to use against Trump, not for the moral good but because you want your side to get power and their side to lose. You are not principled. The Democrats under Obama have done plenty of atrocious things that I am certain neither you nor most Democrats cared about. 

All you have done is again - show you know literally nothing about what critical thinking is and that you exhibit none of it. You are antagonistic to the idea of actually thinking. You don't have principles or a moral compass to abide by, you make excuses for the horrors your side is responsible for or even outright deny it. You are so naive and ignorant that you continue to blindly believe that the only reason I would be criticizing you and the Democrats is if because I am as blind of a partisan as you are, but for the Republicans.
