Where do I literally say you are “not even trying to make friends”?      I assumed you were trying and not having any luck.   You said you were out of ideas.    I offered ideas.   I did not mention that you seem to take things way too personally when you say things like  “They always ignore me on purpose”   And I’m suggesting “you aren’t even trying” like I have a clue what you do other than what you reported.

Your response was singularly unappreciative and unaware of anyone one else but yourself.     That kind of attitude repels people.   I’m happy.  I love my life.   It sounds like it sucks to be you but it also sounds like you want to stay friendless because you can’t even consider that I’m being as straight with you as I can be.
