Haha mom worries, I new it wasn't going to be a popular post. Was just curious to see if other people had thoughts on what sacred calf's they would sacrifice so that the herd survived.

For the record, I maybe overstated my thoughts about Baerlon. I think there is good stuff that happens there, namely us getting to see just how ignorant and clueless the main kids are about the world and setting up some initial tensions and foreshadowing like seeing Fain etc. 

I just think that it would have failed as an adaptation in terms of building the right tone and tensioner, and would have felt too much like what I think it was: a bit of lift of the village of Bree from Fellowship. Or if not really a lift, I think because of how the LOTR movies portrayed Bree, the comparison would have been too clear and distracting.
