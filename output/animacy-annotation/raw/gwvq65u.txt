I cannot remember the name of the story but it's where the ramen noodle hair MC falls in love with the white hair magician 

Anyway, I was disappointed by how they casted the OG FL aside towards the end of the story as if she didn't exist and wasn't the MC's friend. It would have been nice if she realized how her actions were wrong and apologized and promise to do better. She wasn't even evil, just spoiled and ignorant of how the world works.
