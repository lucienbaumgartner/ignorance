A lot of people have zero empathy. A lot of people are also completely and utterly clueless and unaware of what's going on. Ever since Covid hit, everything logistics has been thrown for a loop. Getting products, in almost every industry, has been very difficult and there has been a wide shortage. In our industry, we are now getting in products that we ordered back in June/August. 

What sucks for us (I'm customer facing) is when they take out their anger on you *personally*. Like, I understand you're frustrated, but why do you have to attack me *personally*. Makes no sense..
