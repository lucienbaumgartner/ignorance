If you're an atheist, it's a herb. No different than burning thyme or rosemary aside from some mild effect on opioid receptors. 

Getting sage from first nations is preferred, for supporting local farms and people, but further than that... It's not handmade like a dream catcher - not the handiwork and skill of a culture. Sage is from the ground.

While people may be frustrating, and their spiritualism shallow, without any regard to whatever beliefs they claim to uphold... devoid of any historical context... ignorant and ego-centric... appropriation is not plants.

No person "owns" plants, only cultivates them.
