It funny how everybody who mentions police report or a crime gets downvoted.  And that asshole drivers get upvoted for their stupid, ignorant, and unlawful comments. 

No more tipping from me. Heck, were supposed to get a couple hundred self-driving Lyfts next year. They'll have human babysitters in the car, but they sure ain't gonna be former Lyft drivers (unless you interview with Ford and pass extensive testing, probably). 

The cars can detect when a phone is left in the car before it picks up another passenger (Lyft and Uber already have this technology and they already KNOW you have the phone and you lied about not finding it).
