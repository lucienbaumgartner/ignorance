I see you’ve deleted the comment I was replying to, but I’d still like to post this for others. Reagent tests are a superb tool for harm reduction and are obtainable for most people. There’s no need for you to glance over reagent testing and jump straight to something like GC/MS unless you’re uniformed and unaware of their existence. I’d urge anyone bringing sand to the beach to test what they have prior to the festival.
