Led Zeppelin put out songs that weren't really that great. It's ok. Their live output was incredible. They're an incredible band. 

Your references are pathetic and outdated. The bands you mentioned are about 35-40 years old now, so if they're your reference point for LZ vs "modern music" you're way past due, oh and the PS4 is also a last gen console.

Just give it up man. You're incredibly ignorant, and sycophantic.  I adore LZ, but I've probably listened to Walters walk, hots on for nowhere, etc, only a handful of times.  Even great stuff like
.. you shook me is kinda plodding and slow on the album version, and made kinda redundant by I can't quit you baby on the very same album. 

I can identify some live versions of songs just from listening to them for a few secs, i can explain to you the differences in DaC, killing floor, ICQYB, from one show in spring 1969 to another show in spring 1969. They're not gods.  They're not perfect. You pretending they are doesn't make you a better led Zeppelin fan, it actually has contributed to you being very dense and ignorant.
