Being in the Medical Field for the last 16 years, you either haven’t “worked with” pediatric asthma patients long enough to actually see anything bad happen yet, OR you don’t really work “WITH” pediatric asthma patients either way, Your comment is ignorant and dangerous. 
A couple of good friend of mine, lost their son 2 years ago, on Christmas Eve, to an asthma attack. He was 18 years old
