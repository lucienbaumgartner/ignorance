You get it too. Sometimes I feel like I'm in the Truman Show, where Truman starts to see something is up, and everyone around him is just acting normal, oblivious to what's really going on. What's sad is the lost potential for what Australia could've been. We could've been a world leader in so many areas; but we've let things rot for so long now I doubt we can get it back. Asia may look to take us over in the future; we will be ripe for it. Maybe long after I'm gone, but we are sitting ducks for a hostile (or stealth; which is already happening) takeover. I love Australia, but we are so ignorant and unaware of what's right in front of us. Everyone just wants to know the cricket score. The only solution, to me, is to find another place to live which is what I will be doing in the years to come. There's no perfect utopia, of course, but Australia for me is just wasted potential and I'd rather be elsewhere.
