You had your son hand out invitations - to his own party - to EVERYONE in his class EXCEPT for this poor child...?  How cruel. 

At best, you are tactless and intolerant. 

At worst, you taught your son the worst lesson of all - that only HE matters. 

Either way, it is heartbreaking. 

It would be some type of karma - poetic justice, if you will - than in trying to give your kid the perfect birthday, your actions allows all the other families to consider you so toxic and ignorant that nobody shows up to the party after all.
