Maybe that's because of the context. Relatively benign offense, well in the past. And Justin Trudeau doesnt have racist politics. Trudeau has an otherwise excellent character. If you're a conservative, in my experience you're either ignorant or racist. Perhaps both. You won't accept you're racist, but if you're around a group of "safe" people or you've had a couple drinks, you're revealing racist beliefs. "It's not racist of they're true! Derp"

I've had decades of deep political conversations and most of my friends are conservative. Many strongly conservative. I haven't ever met a single conservative that was smart, well informed, and not prejudiced. If they're smart and well informed, they're prejudiced EVERY single time. I'm sure there are exceptions, but clearly there arent many.

People know this. They infer more about our character from our offense, and if this supports the perspective they already have you are held to account.

Cosby, Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Al Fraken, and many, many others were cancelled and are all progressives.

Your statement is more of the right wing, poor straight white man "playing the victim" bullshit that defines the Trump Era. And it's too bad. Because there is an actual good, logical argument about cancel culture, feminism, and radical changes to gender norms and their impact on men. But the morons ascribing to it are so wrong and ignorant that it's never made in a coherent logical way and so cannot gain traction amongst intelligent people.
