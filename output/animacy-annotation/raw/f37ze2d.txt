We may very well exist in a universe that was created by an entirely alien "external civilization", that may very well be completely unaware and unconcerned about sentient life in this universe. Maybe its one of many universes simulated to figure out the difference in nature of matter based on differences in laws of nature. Or maybe the point of interest is the nature of celestial formations based on different physical constants (such as the gravitational constant). None of these types of simulations would necessitate that either it is possible to even discern the virtual nature of the universe, or that the external entities are in the least bit concerned about living constituent of our universe, or that interaction with the external universe is possible.  

In such scenarios there is no reason particularly as to why we shouldn't make one of our own before trying to "get out", if the nature of our universe is such that getting out is an impossibility. Furthermore, I do find the notion that we are directly connected to the external universe, as opposed to inconsequential and unplanned phenomena that happened to arise in this universe, an indication of an inflated sense of self (meaning humans, as opposed to the individual) importance. 

Finally, when I suggest creating virtual worlds, at least in so far as this particular objective is concerned, I am not suggesting developing entire fully fleshed out universes, rather just individual planets we might wish to discover and explore were we to traverse our universe.
