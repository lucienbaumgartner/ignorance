It's not just Vallivue, it's practically every district in the state. Hell, nation-wide.

Part of the problem is local and state leaders, from school boards up, hamstringing what districts can do. There's also the funding problem. Add to that district admin who fear poor optics, and make stupid choices that actually increase the chance of bad optics . . .

Idaho passed a law that school districts can't be held responsible for this sort of thing, so if the parent in the article tries to sue . . . . she's not likely to get anywhere, sadly.

That said, the "confidentiality" excuse is just that, a bullshit excuse. No one's asking districts to name and shame kids with COVID, just to inform parents whose kids have been in close contact. And it's not happening pretty much everywhere. 

But also a part of the problem, are two groups within the community. 1) Those who are COVID-deniers and angrily protesting any reasonable precautions, sometimes with violence, and 2) those who are just apathetic and ignorant of what's going on.

The whole situation is a shit-show, with a high-chance of ending very badly for Idaho.
