What you're highlighting is the core problem.

There is no such thing as "politicised facts".

Facts are not "passionate beliefs".

Facts are not opinions to be used as the basis for endless rhetorical games where the more clever and witty player wins.

Reliable sources are reliable because they are drawn from research and/or first-hand reporting, and always facts that have been _checked for accuracy_ -- undertaken by organisations that adhere to journalistic and/or academic standards.

The dilemma is as you imagined it, /u/Superb_Introduction. The average person (or at least, large numbers of people) can and do say, "your facts look well-sourced" and then not bother to actually _check for themselves_.

Or even worse, they lack the basic critical thinking skills to be able to discern what a reliable source _is_ versus a conspiracy theory, Youtube propaganda/misinformation/disinformation video, or misleading blog post (or worst, a tweet) full of emotionally-charged opinionating that blatantly twists facts and/or completely fabricates falsehoods.

The world of ignorance easily slips into conspiracy theories and whataboutism precisely because ignorant people do not know what facts are or how to learn from them.

The problem isn't "politicisation of facts". The problem is that people who have a firm grasp of facts and persuasion use those skills to spin and lie to the masses of people who are largely unaware and unable to separate fact from falsehood.
