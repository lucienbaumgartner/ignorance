Same thing with child abusers.

You're not supposed to hit your kids AT ALLLLLLLLL!

No it didn't toughen them up. No, it didn't make them stronger. To the contrary: it disrupted the safe place where they are supposed to grow freely and securely and are now more fucked up than before because you hit them.

Most people are just so emotionally unaware and emotionally stunted and rationalize and suppress so many bad things.

Is this why the world is fucked up? I wonder.
