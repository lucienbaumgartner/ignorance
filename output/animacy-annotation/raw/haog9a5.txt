I used to hate Mexicans and middle eastern people because of the racism I was being raised in, I don't now. I was too young and ignorant of how the world actually worked to make my own decisions about these matters, and assumed that my parents would be teaching me the right things, but that's not how the world works. It's not hypicracy, but growth.
