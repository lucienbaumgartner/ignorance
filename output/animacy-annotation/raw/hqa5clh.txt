Joe skips over the info showing the efficacy of vaccines masks and selectively pushes any info which pushes the narrative the vaccines might be bad. Out of shape under insured at risk people listen to Rogan, Peterson, Weinstein thinking Covid is less risky than the vax and end up getting sick loosing life or infecting others; People listening can then justify and make the contrarian view point feel like a smart idea to them. It’s irresponsible and joe should know better it’s ignorant and dangerous.
