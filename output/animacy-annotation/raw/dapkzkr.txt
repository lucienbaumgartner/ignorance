I've read quite a few stories where women suddenly unlock the achievement of PiV orgasm.  Below is an article about the clitoris (very fascinating) and the other is a women who experienced PiV later in life.  

TBH, i think that the PiV orgasm is more likely to be physiological, however the 90 second part is most certainly psychological. 

And really the point of my post was to be an uplifting story for young couples who are afraid things will stagnate.  I see lots of stories that would scare the fuck out of me if I was young and unaware that sex can continue to get better the deeper the emotional bond becomes.  I have had a ton of sex in my life, and the best experiences HANDS DOWN are the ones with my wife because of our shared history and emotional connection.
