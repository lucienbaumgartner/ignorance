YTA.

I'd go for ESH but I'm not entirely convinced you're a fair judge of your sister's behaviour.

This was ridiculously petty and childish and actually pretty big on toxic masculinity. You didn't 'win' because your boyfriend was 'stronger'. You just showed yourself to be socially inept and unaware of the many different attributes that people find attractive about one another.

Rise above it next time. You're better than this.
