Ironically she’s in therapy, I should be too but I haven’t found a therapist that I’m comfortable working with. But she told me that her therapist felt like I was Flighty, selfish and temperamental. 

Me being fully aware that this is her Therapist take based on her description of events kinda let’s me know everything I need to know. 

She can be very self righteous and unaware of how entitled she is. Case and point, she asked me to take her to an appoint and that snowballed into a mall trip, a COVID vaccine appointment and she wanted to me to wait so the child’s father could come get her. She consta does shot like that and I try to be understanding because she doesn’t have car so I could understand wanted to get as much done as possible… my thing is realize that this is a huge favor. It’s time, mileage, gas. I could easily drive 200 miles in day running errands with her. But I’m selfish.
