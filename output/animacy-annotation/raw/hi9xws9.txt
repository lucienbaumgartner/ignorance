Okay, so the US travel advice is blatently misleading and ignorant of South Africa's context.

&amp;#x200B;

South Africa is still quite segregated (economically and racially), and because of the various affects of Apartheid and inability to address issues since the 90's, crime is very concentrated in specific areas, and even \*extremely rare\* in others.

Yes, crime can and does happen anywhere, but to varying degrees and of different types, and the warning is unsuitable

&amp;#x200B;

This is from the Website:

"Violent crime, such as armed robbery, rape, carjacking, mugging, and "smash-and-grab" attacks on vehicles, is common" and they've advised everyone to reconsider travel.

That is fear-mongering. Cape Town is labelled the crime capital of the world, but only because of the gangs - gangs only operate in certain areas, and as long as you don't go into those areas (which, as a tourist, you likely wont), you don't have to worry about them.

Cape Town is very much a two-cities in one - and as sad as it is, it does mean that you don't have to worry about violent crime in the way that advisory says - especially rape. I'd say the most relevant crime is mugging, but you'll almost certainly be fine if you don't walk around after dark, and be careful where you visit. If you're in the safe areas of Cape Town, like the Waterfront, you're far less at risk of any crime than you are in many areas in a city like London.
