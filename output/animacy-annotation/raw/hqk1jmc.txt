That's a tough question but it begins in the context of music as a wine drinking / erotic activity in the mid first millenium in Arabia. Couple that with it being considered a frivolous use of time and some sayings attributed to Muhammad plus a verse in the Quran that is interpreted to include music. There are theologians who rationalized it as music "letting someone take over your emotions" and thus affecting your soul. Basically it's ignorant and outdated like many things.
