I see what you're saying, but you are still clearly misinformed and incorrect.

Being homosexual isn't normal per se (in the sense that it is not nearly as common as being straight; a statistical abnormality), but it is a natural occurrence. In fact, there is no species in which homosexuality has NOT been observed to occur naturally (excluding species that do not have sex at all).

It is also not a mental illness. LGBT people are more likely to struggle with their mental health due to the stigma and discrimination that comes with being LGBT, particularly during youth. Being LGBT in and of itself is not the cause of other mental ailments. With a healthy lifestyle and supportive environment, LGBT people have been show to be just as healthy as non-LGBT people, both physically and mentally. This has been scientifically confirmed. (If you're interested, I will try to find the study relating to this claim).

Also, humans have evolved into very complex and aware creatures over the course of our existence. To say "a normal [human] brain is designed and built around reproduction" is incredibly reductionist and ignorant. That would imply that people who have no intention of having children are mentally ill, even though they are obviously entirely capable of living a healthy, happy life.

What is your goal in labeling these otherwise healthy people as mentally ill? Is it to treat them with LGBT conversion therapy, which has not only been shown to be innefective, but has also been linked to increased rates of suicide?
