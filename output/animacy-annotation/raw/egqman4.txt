Op, stay strong and be there for your dad. Your support is vital. Also if he has any specific requests or you wanna do anything for or with him, try not to procrastinate because you may not get a "later". Try to maintain peaceful surroundings which is essential for a cancer patient because they need rest especially after chemo. Talk to him with encouragement often.

My dad died due to colon cancer last year Feb. It was a shock to us and caught us unaware and unprepared. He was supposed to be discharged that day. 

Jiayou. If you need to talk can dm me.
