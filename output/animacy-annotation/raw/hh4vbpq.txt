Yep, it's always life or death when driving on a highway. I fear for my life when people make mistakes near me on the highway. You never take it as seriously as you should until someone hits you and makes you rethink everything. Vehicles are moving weapons, often driven by people completely unqualified to use them. I trust no one and will not subject myself to scammers, brake checkers or unpredictable people who are too unaware and selfish to merge onto a highway.
