I'm not a doctor so don't take my word as gospel. You are correct that if the heart stops, you need drugs or a defibrillator to get it going again. 

I would really question (at least in my mind) her feeling her heart stopping and the events after that because she should be clinically dead. 

I've not heard of a seizure happening after the heart stops.  Once you get it going again, yeah. But what is the reason that her heart suddenly starts again? Hearts don't just take time off and then come back online like a fussy internet connection.

Also her remembering a seizure (when she was supposed to be clinically dead) is suspect as many (if not most) people are unconscious and unaware that they are in fact having a seizure. 

These are just my .02 cents. I'm not a doctor; I've worked as a nursing assistant, ophthalmic assistant, and medical assistant and now I'm a medical social worker. 

I don't have any advice; hopefully one of our doctors will be along to help you out....
