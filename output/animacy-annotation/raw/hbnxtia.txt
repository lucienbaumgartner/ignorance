I’m surprised people aren’t talking more about this: have you heard of sexual grooming? For all you know, she could be uncomfortable and not as happy as she looks on the outside. And if she’s happy now, she’s very naive and unaware of what’s to come. Lawyer up, get your ducks lined up, and please tell her parents so they can protect her! You don’t have to be jealous of her, there is nothing to covet in this situation. You should direct more anger towards your husband, not her. He’s the one who actually broke his marriage vows.
