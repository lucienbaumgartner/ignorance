How so? You are straight jumping to conclusions, while I am basing what I am saying off what I have seen him say, and others have said about him. And it doesn't require having negative views of those who like it to want to help Reddit enforce their ToS about it. I'd agree only those who personally don't like loli would want to do that. But that doesn't mean they dislike those who like loli in any way. The more I talk to you the more unreasonable and ignorant of things you seem. You need to learn to chill, and only lash out at those who deserve it. This attitude of yours and jumping down anyone's throat who has a different opinion on loli then you is literally just acting the exact say way as the bad members of lolitary. Show those who call us pedophiles/molesters, who say we are criminals no mercy, fine, no issues there. But just for having a different opinion on loli, no, that's jsut wrong, and no different then them.
