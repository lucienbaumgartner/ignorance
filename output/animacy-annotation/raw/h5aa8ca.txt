You're missing the point. Just because you're OK with it doesn't mean everyone will be. If someone shows up with an OP character and everyone else is just starting out guess what? OP pc will get all the glory and everyone else will feel left out. Plus it's a good way of boring your players. Especially if you're fairly new and unaware of how badly power creep can fuck up your sessions. Exactly where do you go once you've fought all the biggest and baddest?
