Well, the problem is that anyone thinks they DESERVE to be valued at all.  No one deserves a fucking thing!!!  Your “right” to be valued has no basis in any reality except the reality where it’s my right to decide if I want to do it.  That’s why it’s not a right at all.  NOTHING IS A RIGHT WHICH REQUIRES SOMEONE ELSE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING FOR THAT “RIGHT” TO BE IN EXISTENCE.”  Rights aren’t given by anyone.  They are facts of your very birth.  You know something ISN’T a right when you have to demand or threaten or beg someone to give up something so you can have it.

Men should be valued BECAUSE they have value.  If they didn’t have value then people wouldn’t be going to such extreme lengths to take whatever men have.  (Just think of men like the horse in “Animal Farm.”  Nothing can run without him, yet he’s humble and unaware of his own importance and even the fact everyone else is exploiting him.)
