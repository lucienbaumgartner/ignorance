I'm not sure about the forces of the world but the notion that the internet doesn't forget is naive and ignorant. That is especially true for large, unprocessed, boring data sets. Archive.org and archive.is exist for that purpose but for the most part they're just hosters. And as explained by the op, they have their own standards which are often incompatible with leaked information.
