Yeah I disagree, you clearly are affected by what he said and it's not going to stop.  It's not going to be the last time he makes you feel this way, guaranteed.  There's no way you can be ignorant and unaware of that behavior unless you literally stick your fingers in your ears and sing "la la la" every time he talks.

You don't owe anybody sex.  Therefore ending your FWB relationship with him is not a punishment.  Just a choice for your own health and life and wellbeing.  As for his, that's for him to worry about.  Not for you.  It's up to him to grow as a person and perhaps become a reasonable adult who treats women decently. It's not up to you to punish or reward his success or failure, and it's not up to you to change him or help him through that process.  He is not your responsibility.  You can just cut him loose, tell him not to contact you again, and move on.  There are literally millions of better men to fuck.

You deserve to be treated better, even by your fuck buddies.
