It’s because the basis for your argument is misinformed. You claim there is no new content, and yet literally new content is being added today. 

It’s a loaded question. It’s like saying ‘when did you stop cheating on your wife?’  That question presumes that the person was cheating on their wife. But if that’s factually incorrect, then it’s a flawed question. 

There has been more new content released in the past few months than in the full first year of the game. Therefore, your question is viewed as trolling. Either your know that there is recent new content and upcoming new content and you’re trolling, or you’re ignorant and unaware of the current game state. 

That’s why you’re getting negative reactions.
