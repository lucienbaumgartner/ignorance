&gt;It doesn’t matter, it’s a common mindset and has its positives.

Zero positives that outweigh the affront to justice and negative impacts on community and individual. The fact that you're trying to defend your own torpor is on you, but it makes you a scumbag and morally complicit in the injustices others have been forced to experience. You suck. 

&gt;It’s not why poverty is considered a disease at all, that’s down to the low education quality, high health risks and low job prospects.

Neither of those are true, not in an aggregate. If it were, then the chances of escaping those circumstances would be close to nil. They aren't. Basic data on this subject is clear. 

&gt;None of those are the result of aggression, aggression is the result of them.

Absolutely wrong. The mere notion you're suggesting is wildly offensive and ignorant. That people will become violent due to having fewer pieces of greenish paper. 

&gt;Me calling the police is not worth it, I’m ruining someone trying to make a living

You calling the cops to prevent victims is worth it. You're a fucking fool and a coward to think otherwise. There is no other side to this coin. 

&gt;Don’t try out that on them you work with these people and you just said they have a corrosive mindset, why are you following their footsteps?

Calling it "busting cheeks" is following their footsteps? How much idiocy can you possibly pack in a single comment. I wonder.
