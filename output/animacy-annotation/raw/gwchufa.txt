An afterthought, sorry for the second reply. If this theory had something to it, how would that impact you? I mean what makes you, you, in this context. We have no memory of countless prior tortures, so there is no persistence of memory through entanglement, demonstrably. This should rule out the whole thing, should it not? But perhaps the most salient question is, if you died tonight and through this effect you continued to exist without knowing it, would that other you really be you? And does that you even matter from your perspective, because your suffering would be over. You would be dead and unaware that this entangled version of you exists, just as if the theory had meat, we must each be part of this ongoing cycle already.
