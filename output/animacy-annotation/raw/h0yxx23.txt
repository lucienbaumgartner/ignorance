Just a heads up, it's pretty bold and ignorant of you to broadly assume anything about anyone, or any situation from a few sentences on the internet. You don't know anything about my parents other than that they spanked me as a kid at least one time. You can't tell anything else about them, and you're in no position to generalize.
