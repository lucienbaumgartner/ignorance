&gt;!This would be a longer writeup that I don't have time to do at the moment and some of the issues may be addressed in the final two episodes. But key points: The White Walkers need to reach a position where there are a threat to at least all of Westeros. Limiting the problem to the North and mostly the Starks undercuts the idea of them being an existential threat. Winterfell probably has to fall.!&lt;

&gt;!Having the existential threat that everyone's been denying for years be completely handled by the handful of people that have acknowledged it and having the rest of the world unaffected and unaware that the threat ever even existed sits wrong with me.!&lt;

&gt;!Defeating the existential threat doesn't have to erase human evil and conflict, but it needs to have an impact on at least those who fought and barely survived the event. Dany can't immediately insist on going south, especially when her own people are in no shape to do so. She's more power hungry after surviving the long night than she is when she arrives in Westeros.!&lt;

&gt;!What we're getting isn't the Scouring of the Shire and bares only tangential thematic similarity. Frodo and Sam did not choose for Saruman to continue the war. Dany is choosing to go south and Jon is choosing to follow her.!&lt;

&gt;!All this said, I still love the show. I don't think it'll stand the test of time as a result of these thematic decisions however.!&lt;
