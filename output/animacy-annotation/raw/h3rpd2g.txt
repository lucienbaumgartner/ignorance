Set aside minimum 3-4k every year to travel and see the world. Minimum 2-3 weeks, better if you can stretch it further. Live somewhere else for 1-2 years if feasible. All of the above is much easier in your 20s before you start a family.

I find most Canadians to be naive and ignorant of this world we live in.
