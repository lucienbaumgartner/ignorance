&gt; I'm glad we know why Ted is helping Bristow out, because up until now it had been bugging me a bit that he was helping Bristow cause so much chaos when his stated intentions were to keep the peace and help people where he could.

Ah this guy wish he had the power to inflict my fate onto others... Sure I'll help him beat up children and innocents. Fuck you Ted, you can literally lie and leave him to dry, yet chose to help him fuck over other people. Clem and Daniel got excuses for being unaware and unable to leave.

 I really hope Ted gets another loop; of fixing all the shit he helped Bristow cause...
