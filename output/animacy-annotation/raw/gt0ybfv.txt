I’m calling troll. I mean, how can you type all that out and still legit think you did nothing wrong? Even if you are completely unaware and narcissistic (you seriously make yourself sound like a total incel here!), why would you come post in a group asking if you are in the wrong?
And yeah, nobody OWES you friendship, especially seeing how you treat someone who you thought was going to be your ‘bestie’.
