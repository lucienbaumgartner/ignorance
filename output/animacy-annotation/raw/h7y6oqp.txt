On one hand, I feel the way you do. I feel proud that I am not a part of the lynch mob and hysterical masses. However, I also feel depressed. Humanity has **so much** potential. Humanity can be better than it is. But humanity chooses to hate, to steal, to cheat, to lie, to injure, to hurt, to subjugate, to abuse... you get the picture. 

I used to be a part of a domestic abuse support group. I was abused by my parents. During the first meeting, I was shocked when I heard a girl admit that she was moving back in with her abusive boyfriend. The counselor was supporting this decision. I, being young and ignorant of how the world works, voiced that I thought that was a bad choice. I was told by the counselor to settle down, and that the girl had a choice to make. I asked the girl why, and she replied that she felt it would be easier, that she missed her boyfriend, and (this shocked me) that she enjoyed having him tell her what to do and how to live. I went home that night feeling incredibly downtrodden. I saw this same scenario unfold at some other meetings of that group that I went to...and I realized that some people want that lifestyle. It seems they only leave out of pressure, either due to loved ones or society or TV or whatever, but they will then crawl back to their abuser multiple times because they crave being kept on edge, having someone tell them when to piss on their cue, etc. 

I try not to victim blame. I've been told that feeling anger or disappointment at these people is victim blaming. I...don't want to be angry, disappointed, confused, and so on. I just can't help it, though. In time, though, I've come to realize humanity's true colors after much suffering I've received from abusers and bad people I've encountered in my life. And it still angers and disappoints me. I'm trying to come to terms with this, with humanity never being able to change. It's hard.
