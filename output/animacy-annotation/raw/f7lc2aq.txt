Just because something is practiced regularly doesn't mean it's not racist.  I always say I'm from North America/I'm North American because I respect all of the Americas as legit countries.  

If you want to be disrespectful and ignorant, that is your right...as a citizen of the USA.  In fact, as a US citizen, people expect racism and ignorance from you, especially the other Americas.
