I think he's dead, and unaware that he's dead like in &gt;!Sixth Sense!&lt;.
I mean, him standing at the church's door with white light behind him, *exactly* as in Advent Children when he says bye to Cloud?
Him appearing with the Buster Sword but Cloud-less? What has he been doing that he got there after Aerith left Midgar and seems not to know that the plate dropped as he looks at the people in the church very confused?
