Forgive me for saying this, but that's wildly immature and ignorant of you. Even when an autistic person responds, you double down.

That would be like me saying "Oh i didnt mean jewish people, i mean he's acting like a Jew! It's totally cool right?"  or "Oh i mean he's being GAY not that i have a problem with gays..."

Seriously people. If you want to sound like a dick, at least own it. Tell the autistic person what you really think.
