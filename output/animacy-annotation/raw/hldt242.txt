This is def true in my own life. I was raised in a small conservative town that is 95% white and upper middle class, then went to undergrad with primarily the same social group. I developed conservative views because I had little experience with any other group of people and fell victim to right wing stereotyping of others (lower income, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, left wing/liberal people, etc). I did a complete 180 when I went to grad school and immediately realized those stereotypes were completely off-base and I was simply uneducated and ignorant of real issues other people face. 

When anyone calls colleges indoctrination centers I always counter that small towns are a million times worse
