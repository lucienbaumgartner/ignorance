&gt; Well good luck playing hardly any Japanese games then. Removing face rubbing is far from the biggest thing an FE game has had removed from it, so you've likely played games with removed content without even knowing it.

Well I'm not too picky (I sound hypocritical right now, I know), but I have concerns when an entire feature is removed (which I was ignorant and unaware that the Live2D assets are still used). I am also not familiar with past FE games content removal, but as for Awakening, I only know of the small Robin dialogue thing getting removed.

&gt;  I don't think we should expect dual audio, just hope for it.

Ok, that does seem fair. But I still think I should expect duel audio. 1)because Japan doesn't get duel audio because it is a native japanese game (made in and for Japan primarily) and 2) a lot of people like the more authentic (because it is primarily japanese developed) audio. I understand this issue with licencing now and that is expected. As long is there is a Original Soundtrack I can buy, I'll be fine! :P

I was ignorant when I made this post, but most people have informed me, and I've had a change of heart. I will most likely get Fates! Thanks!
