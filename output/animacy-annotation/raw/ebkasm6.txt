They weren't jokes though. How is it a joke to say you would beat your child if they were gay? Where is the punchline? Where is the comedy? 

"If my neighbor was black I would beat the zhit out of him" 

Hahaha pretty funny joke right? Except it isn't funny. Because there are tons of fathers that DO beat their gay children. 

Even if he somehow meant for this to be a joke and it is just an awful joke, it's so trashy and ignorant that people have a right to call him out on it.
