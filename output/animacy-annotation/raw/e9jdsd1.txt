In a world where death is cheap and necromancy is common, prisoners are immediately murdered and their bodies are stored in preservation vaults with a descriptor of their knowledge and expertise, and, if relevant, name. 

Individuals serve their sentences as unaware and unthinking corpses, only to be returned to life should they be required for further questioning or if their term is complete. Obviously, prison is less about rehabilitation in this world as it is punishment. Usually, Political punishment. It is not uncommon for a statewide change of power to result in mass prison sprees.

The "Death Penalty" in this world is not to die, but rather to have your remains cremated and your bones ground into dust, mixed with dirt and the remains of others who have been damned to oblivion, and spread across the world in elaborate seeding rituals so that no element of your soul or being will ever have a chance to be reunited with another part.
