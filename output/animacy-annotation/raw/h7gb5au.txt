That was so ridiculous, rude and ignorant of them I'm so sorry....... I've dealt with the same kind of silly apprehension and judgement. What do they think our food alternatives have, spinach and weird things in it??? You just take the non-vegan things away, add a little bit more of another ingredient it was already using or add something new like banana, a soy product, vegan butter, flax powder or whatever. The idea that you have to put eggs and dairy in every little thing or else it's a failure is so strange and obsessive. Only because the people who profit from these false ideals have controlled what most people believe is healthy and normal.
