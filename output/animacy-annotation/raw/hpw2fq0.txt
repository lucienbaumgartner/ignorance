You know, I NEVER considered people were perhaps upset because of perceived slights to "nice white people" or whatever. 

I didn't see her critiques of Sig as misogyny either, and was kind of confused as to why people jumped on her? Not everyone gets along, and something about sig (though she is undeniably fucking gorgeous and talented!) sits badly with me  too...and I am in a female body.

I kind of just assumed I was missing some sort of gender prejudice because gender confuses me, and clearly there are some underlying issues within the gay community. 

Tl:Dr, I don't get racism or sexism.  Both are ignorant and just GROSS, and the Merrie Cherry drama ish seen thru that lens is fucking concerning, because it's so insidious.
