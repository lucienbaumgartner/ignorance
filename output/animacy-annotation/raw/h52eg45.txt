&gt; “The opposite sex is usually solipsistic and ignorant of what the other wants out of a relationship. **We give advice that will make the relationship good for us but might not necessarily serve the other party's interests. This isn't always done out of malice but just pure short sightedness and ignorance of the other perspective.**”

Good point.

&gt; “The best advice comes from people who have accomplished what you want to accomplish. For women that means getting advice from successful women, and likewise for men.”

In a way. For example, as a man, I’ve seen some attractive men give advice to men that was biased by their own experience as an attractive man. Some men need additional perspective from a successful average or below average guy who understands that side of the experience.
