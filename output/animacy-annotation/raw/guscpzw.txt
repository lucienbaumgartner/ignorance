My daughter (18) smokes weed, and i don't necessarily like it but she 18. I can't tell her not to smoke it at all, but i can tell her not to do it in my house. In the past i caught her smoking it in my house before, and I've given her warnings about it. Yesterday when i came home i could smell all through out the place. When i went into the living room she was smoking it with her boyfriend right beside my two sons (12, 8). She was supposed to be babysitting them, so the fact that she is doing it in my house right beside my 2 young son's pissed me off. I told her boyfriend to get out and told my sons to go to the basement (there's a game/play room down there). I told her that she was being disrespectful, and ignorant of what I told her. I said that this was my last warning to stop smoking in my house, and the next time she does it I'm kicking her out. She told me that i couldn't tell her what to do because she was an adult. I said " your right your an adult, but it's not yout house it's mine, and if i told you not to do something in my house then either you don't do it or you can get out of MY HOUSE". I ended off the conversation by repeating that if she smoked in my house again then I'm kicking her out. Since my ex called me telling me that my daughter told her what happened. She said that i was a shitty father for how i talked to my daughter and for threatening to kick her out.
