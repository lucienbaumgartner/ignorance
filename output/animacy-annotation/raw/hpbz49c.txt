One other measure that would be interesting is a happiness index or general well being. Not sure if it is taken into account here. Though, 50%+ in UP are poor, do they realise they're poor? They are blissfully ignorant and probably happy else these kind of numbers shoul bring up a riot.
Kerala on the other hand at such low % would mean you are always vary of losing wealth and being pushed down to the lowest % around that it takes a mental toll and bring the general well being down.
