&gt;Okay, so the US travel advice is blatently misleading and ignorant of South Africa's context.

I didn't say anything. That was just extra information.

A tourist in South Africa, no offence to OP, sticks out like a sore thumb.

&gt;I'd say the most relevant crime is mugging, but you'll almost certainly be fine if you don't walk around after dark, and be careful where you visit.

That's exactly why I pointed that out first.

This information comes directly from the U.S. Embassy. You cannot fault them for trying to ensure the safety of their citizens and anyone else who seeks travel advice in their visits to South Africa.

To a certain extent, many of the things they mention are true, but asking the Department of International Relations &amp; Co-operation for travel advice on South would be the equivalent of someone bragging about their best qualities.
