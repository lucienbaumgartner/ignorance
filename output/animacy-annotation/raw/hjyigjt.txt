I hear you man. Kriel wasn't amazing, I guess I'm just offering a counterbalance to what I think to be some underserved flak. I think he will handle Duhan well, which is important as you note

I fully agree RE selections based excessively on experience, and I think it could be this coaching group's ultimate downfall. It seems as though they have swallowed whole the dictum that players should play minutes based on experience alone, and only look to blood players steadily and when the time is absolutely right. This has certain benefits but it means that you have to bank on who you think the players with the most potential are early in their careers, and can make the squad quite static and ignorant of the form book. IMO we need to be more reactive when players are in form and out of form. It's crazy to think that someone like Tryone Green is not getting minutes for the Boks this autumn when you see how he plays for Quins.

Elton's tackling certainly won't be worse than Pollard's this season I can tell you that much!

Good call on Herschel as a starter not finisher too, that did work in our favour against Wales. 

As I said above - discipline is key for this win and for our improvement as a team. Enough excuses: we must be better!
