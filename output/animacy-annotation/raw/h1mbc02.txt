My in- game name is WhiteOutWolf, I'm 19. I have been playing Minecraft on and off for many months at a time since the very first release on the Xbox 360. Back then I was pretty young and I was too scared and ignorant of the game to make my own world or anything so I Just stayed in the tutorial world and built up a castle around it over many months as I slowly learned the game. To this day this is probably my Favorite gaming memory of my life.
