You should watch out for that person, if they are doing things like that they are probably ragingly unaware and incredibly insensitive. You get the vaccine so you don't have to worry about contracting the virus, I find it so funny how so much of science seems to have forgotten this fact and twisted it (with media approval) to make you believe that it's not the virus you should he worrying about, it's your fellow unvaccinated citizen who in no scientific way is any more of a threat to you than someone vaccinated possibly carrying a variant, use your brain!
