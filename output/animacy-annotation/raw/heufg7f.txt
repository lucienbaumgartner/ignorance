No. I didn't imply any judgement about people's dating preferences. You made that assumption.

People can and certainly *do* judge people on whatever basis they choose.

My basis is no authoritarians. An authoritarian is somebody who cannot handle dissenting opinions, and cannot simply have friendly disagreements.

My criteria are not explicitly political in nature, but it may not surprise you to learn that it frequently means I filter out lots of authoritarian conservatives and progressives alike. People who are ignorant and unaware that, in general, everybody is just trying to live their best life. People who believe that when somebody disagrees with them, it is because they are stupid or evil.

In general, I am filtering out good people who make other good people out to be monsters, just so that they can feel better about treating them badly.

Look at my downvotes. I got those by making a very mild statement about evidence. Look at your diatribe. That's because I touched a nerve.

I look for *curiosity*, not judgement. A curious person would have asked me to clarify. Instead, you told me how I'm wrong for believing what I believe-- Beliefs, by the way, you know nothing about.

To be clear, I don't think you're a bad person. I don't think most authoritarians are overall bad people. But authoritarianism is certainly a bad habit.

Why live with so much conflict? People should treat each other as friends by default. People should learn to let friends be wrong. And people should not make enemies out of friends.
