Well that's an interesting question. Does wiping your memories also change your personality? Because in my opinion punishment for a crime should be conducted on a person, not on his/her body. As in, by removing your memories all together, you have effectively "killed" your past self and you are now beginning a new life. Punishing your new you for the actions of your past you seems as silly as jailing a son for the crimes of his father, if you put it in this context.

It all depends on the context of the memory wipe and how it affects the person. A completely full wipe of someone's memories would impact his behaviour and tendency of conducts massively, so that person is effectively a different person than the one that got his memories wiped. 

However if the memories deleted were just of this crime, I do think that the punishment is warranted. You forgot the actions you did? Yes, but the core values that pushed you to do them in the first place are still intact, and they deserve to get corrected and punished. 

Let's put it this way, if the police came knocking at my door and told me "last week you killed 5 babies and an old woman, you are arrested", and my first reaction was "WHO THE FUCK AM I AND WHAT'S HAPPENING", then I would feel pretty fucking cheated about getting taken away for a crime someone i am completely unaware and unfamiliar with did. If my reaction was, however, "Well apparently someone wiped my memories of this but I did always hate those 5 babies and the old woman taking care of them", I would have to shut up and take the punishment as it was well deserved. Would I feel fucked up and robbed? Sure, but I think the frustration would come more from not knowing who the fucked wiped my memories and why they did it more than wondering how is it possible that I murdered someone (assuming i already had murderous thoughts in the past and I do remember them).
