Their rating won't matter. I promise. I got a bad rating yesterday from my first cunt of a customer. Accused me of not delivering his food timely so I could make more money...lmao so stupid and ignorant of them. I eventually told them, i was about to pull in and if they wanted their food to stop texting me talking shit or i was taking their food back. I drove around their sub division once waiting on a text back, they didn't so i dropped off their food.  I was thinking of taking a screenshot and posting it.
