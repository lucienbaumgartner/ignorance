It's occulted.  Hidden wisdoms abound.  ye have not the ears to hear or eyes to see...  There's tons of [flood evidence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5LCLljJho&amp;t=1h52m30s)  It's basically [everywhere.](https://nerdbot.com/2020/07/02/scientists-recently-discovered-a-lost-city-off-the-cuban-coast/)

Parting of the sea... I've seen that.  It was a tidal wave / tsunami.  folks were standing on a sand bar and the water just left the beach, the area between the beach and the sand bar still held waters.  Then a giant wall of water rushed forth and flooded the land, and those poor people who didn't get off the sandbar were goners...

Come with me and I will make you fishers of men... now, look in the waters you came into... see the little fish swimming?  What if I told you a whole man is stored in each of those fish?  Heretical, I know, but them's the breaks.  Sometimes those who decode the obvious wisdoms are called blasphemers.  One fish and one loaf, feeds a multitude.  I simply use two pools of water.  One for the fishery to grow a bunch more fish, and the other a pot of water to ferment the bread into more yeast, with which to make more bread.  It's not as "magical" when you have to explain the simple wisdoms... but you're the idiot here, not the biblical authors.  There is a "magic" to it, and you don't have to know how the magic works to perform the spell of continual sour-dough starter.  HE IS RISEN! (like bread, or the Sun of god in the ^(y)East...)

Resurrection... please, tell me more about trans-humanism... the sun is almost up.  Meanwhile, I can take humans apart in the dark, and stitch them together into a resurrection machine, if it weren't illegal and the common man didn't become squeamish around wizards.  The bones of this watery life support chamber have living marrow, producing new blood.  Carefully take apart people and arrange the organs around the chamber, and stimulate the diaphram and heart to pump the blood and oxygenate it... feed it with sugary salt water...   And when you throw a man into that tomb (womb, resurrection tank), the bones of Lazarus could indeed still contain enough magic to support the life of a mortally wounded man, and bring him back from what anyone of the time would consider the dead.  Vlad the Impaler had such a bathtub of blood, he was impaling himself (transfusion of young blood prolongs life).   Moses means "of water".  The basket he was placed in was this bony ressurection chamber...  Sargon of Akkad, same story as Moses.  Mises of Egypt means "of water", similar to the Moses wisdom.  A man of water is a married women, she'll have consummated the wedding, and thus be with the waters of child birth soon...  She's a man of woter.  Hence the "Wo" part of woman, and now we call her Misses (sounds like Egypt's Mises to me).  The Scabbard of x-caliber grants Arthur invincibility.  Scabbard means vagina, and this is how you make a man into one, pleb.  This is the old Hermetic wisdom everyone's knows about... /i\\

Egyptians didn't build the pyramids, of course "slaves" did.  These "slaves" are mechanical things... they follow orders and have no will of their own, like modern day cars and cranes and such are slaves to their operator's whims.   

Jesus contains the mystery of yeast... which do walk on water... they bubble when brewing and iesus (yeasts) float to the top, foaming like the sea foam.  Lumps are men.  These men of the sea are seamen, whenceforth comes aphordite / venus... but also, lakes can freeze slowly and look as if people are walking on water.  When you walk a lot with disciples you get blisters on your feet, which fill with water.  Not so impressive when you spell it out... but it's not just a single thing.  The process of compressing and layering more and more mysteries together, such as the water of fruit being turned into wine by iesus (yeast)... and then made a Virgin Drink by the **V**inegar **M**other, **V**irgin **M**ary...to create vinegar, with witch to pickle milk, thus making curds, and when filtered via cloth, you discover "men" (lumps) of the cloth, praise Cheeses!  Now you can have bread, wine and cheese and pickle things for the winter; Cure things with smoke along with the cheeses you nail to the crossmembers to let age in smoke...  Now, you can have proper civilization, and have preserves so you don't fight over food for the winter...  We're saved!

Whatever, idiot.  Especially if you're an atheist, those are the most mundane and ignorant of all people.  They'll point out inconsistencies in multiple stories and not understand that's a marker for you to discover some wisdom -- as if it's some gotcha, they'll shove it in your face, bunch of idiots.
