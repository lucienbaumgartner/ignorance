YTA. You’re completely lacking empathy and humanity and you come across in your post and comments as cold, cruel, and ignorant of the human condition. I hope your friend is getting the help and compassion she deserves for the awful thing she’s been through, and I hope your callousness hasn’t retraumatised her. She’s better off without you in her life.
