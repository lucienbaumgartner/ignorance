That’s a poor fucking excuse, and why do you think it’s a cycle of violence that’s ongoing? Do you realize that it’s literally a cycle of families getting ripped apart, because of once vengeance murder after the next? Everyone loves to bring up Chicago, as if it’s just arbitrary violence that wasn’t a result of a power vacuum after the city took down the heads of the gangs.

Point is, how the fuck would you feel if someone shot your son randomly? How would you grow up different feel if you grew up around gang violence and saw that stuff happen everyday? Honestly, how do you think they all ended up in one place where an actual war could take place? Right, because you forgot all the racist bullshit in the past that brought us to this place where you so comfortably write off black on black violence like it’s not clearly part of the fucking problem people have been protesting about.

The sheer fact that you’d bring that up, ignore the reasons why it’s happening, put a blanket on black people’s feelings about their experiences and say that none of that matters because there’s a literal gang war in Chicago shows that you’re an unaware and racist piece of shit.

You’re part of the problem, and you don’t even see it, because you can’t see past your whiteness and the four walls of whatever fucking room you’re in.
