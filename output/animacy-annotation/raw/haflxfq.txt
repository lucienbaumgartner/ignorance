I’m 22 and the things that keep me going when nothing else can are my special interests. Projects to think about &amp; crafts to do. I don’t force myself to be social anymore like I did in high school- I have friends that I can go a year without seeing, and they will still be my friends. I really love making collages (especially fun crafts on mugs/shirts/things they can functionally use) out of old photos of friends. Also great because I never go out, and never have new photos. Just a way to show I care about them without being physically there. 

The more I try to be social when I’m not good, the less I remember who I am &amp; what makes me happy. I become so lost and unaware of my own needs that I get easily manipulated, and sacrifice everything for the approval of whoever happens to be in my life. Even jobs I don’t care about, or worked 3 months at- I’ll get so lost in the need to be liked by them that I forget that they are losers who I don’t want to be friends with anyway. 

I’m white but I am also a female &amp; my mother was born and raised in South Africa (my dad went to uni there and met her). She is an extremely loving mother but she is also extremely uncompassionate at times. Had a much more traditional upbringing &amp; still doesn’t accept a lot of mental illnesses as ‘real’ (at least for her own child). Takes everything personally, or as a sign that she’s a bad mother. Had the same eating disorders I did as a teen, but I always felt punished rather than related to.
