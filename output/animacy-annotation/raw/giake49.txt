No I see it as real work, fuck with the way some people do it, it’s pretty much gymnastics but it’s a job that’s not possible for a majority of people. so being on a high horse about it seems ignorant. Imagine if I got a job purely because of an aesthetic characteristic, wouldn’t you say flaunting money made from said job to people who will never get the opportunity to work it is unhelpful and ignorant of their situation?
