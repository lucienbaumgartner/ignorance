No. I didn’t mean it as a season thing, more as a lifetime thing. Growing up Phoebe was the rebel, the screwed up, the one who moved to New York, the one who didn’t have a stable job like her sisters. Among the three of them, the underlying dynamic will always be Phoebe as the outsider. On the surface they grew closer and had a better relationship with each other but deep inside, Phoebe would always be the outsider among the three of them. You can erase childhood fears and doubts and insecurities but it would take a lot of time. Until then, stressful situations would evoke those feelings in Phoebe. 

This is why when she fell for Cole, she fell hard. Here was a guy who saw her as she was in the present and unaware of her past mistakes and blunders. It was a figure in Phoebe’s life who would never bring up her past mistakes and knew her as the new person that she became already. That was a great comfort for Phoebe, a comfort that nobody in her family could give. 

The outsider role would transfer to Paige after Prue’s death. Even if the new Charmed Ones became closer to her, she would always be the outsider as she didn’t grew up with her two sisters.
