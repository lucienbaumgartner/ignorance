I have a mental model for someone who eventually chooses to be an Elliot Rodger type. Shooters have negative self esteem. They hate themselves, but more than that, they hate society around them. More than that, they hate other people. They may also hate god/their parents/their community/insert entity they believe to be responsible for their creation, and therefore their subsequent suffering. If you hate the world itself, ending your life and nothing else would just allow it to continue unabated and ignorant of your suffering, so you might as well go out and hit the world where it hurts as much as you can before you go.
