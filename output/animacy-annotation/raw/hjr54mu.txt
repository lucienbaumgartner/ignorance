Oh yeah Odin is one of the strongest God's in that universe and his appearance is definitely more scary than base form Zeus. That why I think Simo is gonna fight since maybe Brunhilde probably knows no one can match him physically so she needs someone who can fight him at a distance and be able to stay hidden. I feel like Simo will have the same build as Jack so he cant get hit to often or he'd die. So he'll need to rely on his spacing and making sure he keeps his opponent blind and unaware of his position. Though if Odin does see the future he can foresee the shots so he can block them or move out of the way. Most likely block though since he doesn't seem so nimble.
