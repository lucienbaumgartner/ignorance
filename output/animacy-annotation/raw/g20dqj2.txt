Bro, us Canadians absolutely fucked the natives up, and everyone in Canada should know that. In 2016 we had a cross-country campaign to raise awareness on it, and so it's just sad and ignorant that some people STILL say that. It both pisses me off when people deny it, but it also makes me sad when I see these memes (which have been popping up everywhere) because most Canadians I believe ARE trying to be better. So fuck that guy, but just know that we aren't all pieces of shit. 

P.S. If you're interested look up the Downie Wenjack Foundation
