Dude where are you getting these stats from. Anti-raise is literally everyone here on Reddit and the activity on this Reddit does not  represent all of Waterloo lmfao. Most people still support the cause of raise. And like u/2ft7Ninja said: is anyone who’s anti-raise putting in the effort to make a change? All I see is people using raise’s fuck up as an excuse to be racist and ignorant of the real issues amongst people of colour.

Every week there’s some BS about raise. Like if you all have an issue do something lol
