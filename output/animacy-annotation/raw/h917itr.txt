You think I can't be desi and white skinned?
We may be a minority - a genuine minority - but we exist.

I grew up in a Bangladeshi heavy community, in England.  I saw the racism and entitlement up close.

I've had Bangladeshi friends compare my complexion to the soles of feet (sylheti rhymes, black = good, red = dog skin and white = soles of feet), to denigrate me and feel better about themselves, because their parents would coo about how fair I was, how rosey cheeked, how they wish their sons looked like me (this was in the infants!).

Still, being fair is undoubtedly advantageous and, seeing as I like desi girls, played well in my favour.

I'm only concerned with this racism, as it interacts with England and the natives.

As to "colonialism" that's just bs excuses for that envy and lust. It gives license to feel entitled, as if they own you personally. When 90% of the time, you were helped by the British Raj, as it hurt my people, the actual former elites.

We actually fought the British, we actually had most of our fortunes confiscated (escaping to Bengal, with enough servants, employees and manpower, to build a few villages and begin rebuilding ourselves). Your average desi was a peasant, marginal and ignorant of his condition. The British instituted universal education and brought industry to the middle class, rather than as hobbies of the elite (which is why industrialisation grew in Britain first, even though there were shoots in Bengal, too).

I'm no victim, I just dislike the ingratitude, hostility, envy and false victimhood that permeate South Asian Muslims. And, as I say, it is the driving force behind their islamist sentiment.
