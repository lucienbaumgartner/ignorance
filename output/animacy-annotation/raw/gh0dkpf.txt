God, you're a typical Browns fans. Uninformed and unaware of the situation. This move happened because the NFL proposed that the Browns become a team on Hiatus, while the former Browns move to Baltimore as a new expansion team. You knew you were getting your team back in 98. We entered the playoffs with three members from the Browns, and ZERO coaching staff from Cleveland, and then the Browns went into the playoffs only four years after returning to the league, which is the same time it took Baltimore to make the playoffs; but because your franchise is such a dumpster fire, you couldn't replicate the success or any success for that matter.
