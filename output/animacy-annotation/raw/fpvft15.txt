No, you're being rude and ignorant. That has nothing to do with what this post is about. What he is pointing out is that Newt is currently 'placed' on this Bronze page. On top of that, there are currently 5 fragments that will roll over to silver. If he places everything else on the page and then prestiges, those 5 Newt fragments will roll over. However, if he taps on Newt before prestiging, he is 'cashing out' those 5 Newt fragments for family xp and it will reset to 0/5. If he prestiges then, there won't be any fragments to roll over.
