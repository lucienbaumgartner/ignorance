You put a stop to the process. About as logical as it can be. If you could go back in time and stop someone’s parents from fucking, you stopped them from ever having existed. Yes time travel is a bad analogy, but it’s the same thing when applied to the future. 

You stopped someone from being born. That’s not an appeal to emotion that’s logically and objectively murder, regardless of the stage of development it was stopped at. 

The pro choice arguments are also appeals to emotion and usually followed by accusations of sexism and supporting women being in pain. 

Put him up for adoption if you don’t want him; ‘oh he’ll have a bad life’ appeal to emotion and not a reason for murder 

Someone’s father being a rapist is not grounds for execution. They can grow up to be a much better person. 

Pain/discomfort of pregnancy and childbirth is pretty negated by modern medicine, once they give you the good stuff you don’t even feel the baby leave. 

My body/consent shit - the baby didn’t consent to anything either and is an unaware and innocent party, this argument is bullshit and avoids the actual issue. 

Most of the cases aren’t even because of rape. A random accident, a condom broke, not taking your pill at the same time so that it actually works, OR straight up unprotected sex which is your fault. 

It’s excuses to get rid of an inconvenience at the price of a life and saying ‘you’re pro life because of religion and sympathy’ is horse shit because in every definition of the word you put a stop to a human life.
