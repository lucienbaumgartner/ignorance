Oh, didn’t you know?

I expect to be downvoted for putting the truth out there — but here it is anyway.

They exist as yet-another tool of the ultra-wealthy ruling class, to keep you in your lane, Citizen! 

Despite their carefully constructed advertisements and constant bombardment of bread &amp; circuses to the contrary — which keep you brainwashed and otherwise easier to control, you’re actually just a meatbag to extract resources from until you die (like all the other cattle).

And that’s it. 

Ditto with whatever offspring you might breed; another generation of exploitable cattle who consume, are easy to coerce into debt-oblivion, and who will continue to exist largely as fearful cattle.

Distracted, placid, and unaware that Orwell was an optimist. 

Unless/until there’s a 1789-style event in the West?

Nothing will change.

The wealthy ruling class aren’t actually worried about an uprising though — the cattle are too laughably apathetic to rise up in the quantities necessary to make any difference whatsoever — should you dare to moo in the wrong direction, the solution is for you to get your assigned captive-bolt treatment early.

I agree, that’s an unfortunate worldview, but that’s the reality &amp; it is what it is.

Therefore, your only option is to endure it, or ignore it &amp; keep merrily pretending that the fantasy you got sold is something acceptable.

Nothing will *ever* change in any meaningful way, without _globally_ yeeting the likes of Bezos etc. en-masse.

Get used to it.

Citizen.

TL;DR:  haha sucker, life’s a bitch and then you die.
