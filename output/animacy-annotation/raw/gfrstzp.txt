The thing is, everything Gaius says about Eorzea being hypocritical and corrupt can just as easily be said about the Empire, he's just somehow completely blind and unaware of his own nation's faults until he sees his adoptive daughter with torture wounds and it's apparently fucking news to him that maybe some of his countrymen are really shitty to the people they think of as subhuman. I'm kind of amazed that a 57-year-old man who has spent most of his life travelling across the world, even as a conquering soldier, is somehow unaware of this.
