I never understood how Americans (especially people who are ethnically not from Latin American countries) trying to change Latino/Latina to Latinx isn't the peak of racism/whitewashing/historical revision/cultural appropriation/colonialism/etc.

How can you get anymore culturally unaware and presumptuous to think that you have the right to change an entire group of people's historical language patterns under the guise of being "woke" lol? Why do 20 something white college kids living in one of the most privileged countries in the world think they can police another  ethnic groups speaking patterns (didn't we learn this was wrong decades ago when it came to white people telling black people how to speak?).
