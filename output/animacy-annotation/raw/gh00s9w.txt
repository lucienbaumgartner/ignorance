I agree that the accelerationist stance is so misinformed and ignorant that it actually delays progress by decades. Voting for Trump in the name of “burning it all down” is so fucking privileged and hateful that nobody should feel ok about themselves if they did that. 

However it is simply inaccurate to say Biden’s current platform is to the right of Clinton and Obama. Like that’s just not even a true statement.
