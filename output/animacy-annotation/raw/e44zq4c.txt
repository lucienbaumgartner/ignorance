He’s the only one that showed up to Pam’s art gallery to support her work and he never thought twice about it. But most of his ignorant, selfish moments don’t derive from being a bad person he’s just socially unaware and extremely awkward lol. But he genuinely cares about the people he works with, and when he wrongs them and realizes it he tries to make it up even if it’s in his own misguided way.

Except Toby cuz fuck Toby
