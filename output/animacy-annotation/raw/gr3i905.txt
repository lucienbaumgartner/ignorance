I'm increasingly convinced that we're having wildly different conversations here.  My original point at the start of this exchange was simply that Subaru thought his life was worthless because it was.  He had no prospects, no friends, no purpose, and the only people who would have missed him were those he was actively hurting.

Given the presence of the Ousagi and how Roswaal has him playing with what's effectively a marked and stacked deck, I don't expect him to handle his current situation alone (though obviously handling it alone is the ideal anyone should strive for), but the point is he's still the same lazy, unaware and weak NEET he arrived as.  He's found friends he doesn't deserve and a purpose in caring for them, but as it stands, the only thing he can do for them is, as he put it, 'struggle in vain'.  At least until his retries via RbD lead him to a solution, and the series is telling him he shouldn't do that, which frankly hurts my brain.

You're asking me to point out where you say he should be loved by someone else.  I'm saying he shouldn't love himself, *let alone* by someone else.
