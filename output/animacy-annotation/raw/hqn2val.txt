I also find it hilarious the length people will go to connect anything and everything to an authoritarian government and its leader. Nobody ever did that to Singapore (also a place where they originally just had one leader).

So you'll get a lot of this, kind of annoying because it puts a massive strain on Chinese-foreign relations, which ruins it for normal people like myself because I'm now fighting two battles, one with Chinese people about foreigners, and one with Foreign people about China. And both sides are kinda wrong. 

In regards to this specific issue, yes, comparing this to North Korea is ignorant and irresponsible. But I've noticed that Foreigners are all experts at politics (LOL). I think Vietnam is also doing just fine as a country, another great example of Western (US) "know-it-all-ism".
