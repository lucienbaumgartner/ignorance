While I haven’t been in your exact position, I did have a bf whom I can imagine this happening with. 

It wasn’t that he was a bad person it was that between him and me, his happiness was his priority.  Every damn time.  The only time he took my happiness into account was when it cost him nothing or when he felt that he “owed” me for something. 

What I eventually learned was that I needed to find someone who would make me their priority because I’m one of those people who gives my everything for my partner’s happiness. And I need my partner to give their everything for my happiness. 

Even if your bf is just being dumb and ignorant of what you are going through. I sincerely believe that you are a bad match because your priorities do not align.  I know that for me, if my bf was out partying while I was home from surgery of any kind, I would have an issue. But for him to be out partying after the conscious action of aborting a pregnancy that he contributed. That is unacceptable. 

You aren’t over reacting. You should be questioning if this is someone you want to live your life with. Obviously something went wrong with your birth control, and I do hope that you get access to more reliable birth control. Because next time the abortion may not be an option and then he will be in your life as long as the child is.
