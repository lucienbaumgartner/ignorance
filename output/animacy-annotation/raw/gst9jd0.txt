&gt;That's like asking me to provide links to prove the sky is blue. Absurd.

No, more like the sky is blue, but you're pretending it's some other color, even when scientists and others tell you otherwise, but provide no actual means of refuting or arguing otherwise. You're the one denying science here, since neurology and biology are part of the "hard" sciences.

&gt;You go ahead and continue worshipping at the alter of agenda drive science and social constructs, I'll just continue to live in the real world.

"La la la, all science is wrong and I'm right!"

That's basically how you sound. If science is on your side, I think you should prove it. But the lack of any actual argument on your half only shows how pathetic and ignorant of this subject you really are. Just like people who deny evolution, the age/shape of the earth, vaccines, and so on. You're literally just like them, but in denial.
