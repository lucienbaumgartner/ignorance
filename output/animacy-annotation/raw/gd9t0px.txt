Yech. I hope she warned a staff member! People can be so creepy. I haven't had that sort of thing happen yet here, people seem to mostly prefer to keep their hands to themselves, but I did encounter that sort of thing on the mainland.

In my experience, it's either someone high and unaware of their actual environment (as in they didn't intend to walk up to a random stranger and touch them), or a predator trying to test boundaries and see what he can get away with. I've heard of instances of guys doing that to distract someone to steal from them as well, though I'm not sure how common that actually is.
