It's not deflection, it's wholly relevant. The discussion is whether or not the US is the worst terrorist organisation in the world, and I'm making the point that that is an entirely ignorant thing to say. It's also not nationalism, I'm not from the US and dislike a great deal about America. That being said, it is ignorant and ridiculous to suggest they are the most morally reprehensible military force in the world.
