Hiw.many people do you think started their habit shooting heroin?  None.  They were all unicorns, just like you.  Until their hookups, hookups hookup found out they could make 100X profits by selling these identical looking, far more addictive pills instead as the price of real controlled supplies continues to get higher and the supplies and accessibility continue to be cut.  

Oxy 'withdrawals' after a couple months?  That's tge difference between being shot with a water gun and an actual gun.

You're not special.  You're not a fucking unicorn, you're delusional and ignorant of yourself and to the people you think you're above.
