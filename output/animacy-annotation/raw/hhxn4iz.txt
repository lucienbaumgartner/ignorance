Wow trying to gaslight everyone?

You said "You're thinking exactly like the idiots who will no longer have any say if this reform goes forward."

That is an admission that this process in and of itself is anti-democratic. 

These assets are created by and for the use of ratepayers, who in turn democratically decide the best way to maintain them and use them via. council elections.

“The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.” -Winston S. Churchill

Sure, an 'idiot' like me may be wrong, but fuck you for trying to pretend you're not advocating for the subversion of democratic processes.

If you really are part of council budget allocations that worries me, you seem financially illiterate and unaware that water assets turn a profit.
