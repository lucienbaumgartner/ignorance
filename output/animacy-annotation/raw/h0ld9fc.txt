What about my other points? What about those who work outside SF or commute in for work? What about freedom of movement? What about seeing family without being forced to rent a vehicle for $75 per day? If you're making claims for elderly and disabled people, you'd better be a member of those groups or an advocate thereof--otherwise it's just your own conjecture to "prove" the point you've already made up your mind about without considering them.

Downvote all you want--the SF subreddit is a tiny portion of SF and not at all in line with the entire populace. Until we literally solve public transportation through driverless cars and the last mile issue, we're going to have cars and the streets to drive them on. I'm sure you disagree and don't like it, but fortunately that doesn't affect legislation for SF residents and the 5M people Bay Area who can easily drive into the city for whatever they'd like (work, school, medical care, tourism, sporting events, etc.).

This is an entirely inconsequential conversation which is one-sided and ignorant of the problems faced when looking at removing cars from a city in our current state of public and for-hire transportation.
