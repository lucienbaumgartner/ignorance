&gt; So it’s not that you are technically being hypocritical, it’s just that you are woefully naive and ignorant that a group that has a worldwide reputation for being violent and ignorant, actually has earned that reputation for a reason because that’s what their culture believes in, and you’re not “saving” anyone by making excuses for them, you are just destroying your own communities, which unfortunately includes your neighbors along with you.

I'm sorry - I thought you were talking about other people's views of the typical American there for a minute. Fat, ignorant, gun-loving Bible beaters..... being from the Bible belt - they're not far off.
