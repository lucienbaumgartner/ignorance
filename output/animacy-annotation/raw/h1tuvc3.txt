(Ignoring the major leaps in your comprehension of the video)  


There are many, many things wrong with BBF, no matter the proposed solution - at least from all the discussed so far. The very idea of a BBF can not work, because it assume that we will be joining 2 states/people into one and further diving their power, rights and what not. By having to even label the people, it means they are not ready. They will never be truly peaceful as they do not see each other as equal/same. Let alone, the very idea of giving equal instead of proportional power to the turkish is insane.

Just because freedom of the country is not attainable at the moment does not mean we can give away what is rightfully ours for a/any solution. Agreeing to a shitty solution is disrespectful and ignorant of all the efforts and fights against the illegal invasion.
