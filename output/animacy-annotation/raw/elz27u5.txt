&gt;Are you blind, stupid, so far removed from working class folks (especially rural working class folks) that they are just entirely outside your window, or actively in denial?

We're going with insults now? OK. Let me have a go at it. Are you so narcissistic and unaware that you assume everyone is American? Hey, here's a useful tip: Most people are not American. Whoa! So you need to either stop assuming everyone you talk to is American, or you need to stop demanding that people who are not Americans should have more knowledge about your shitty country than you'll ever have about any other country. But most of all, you need to back up your god damn claims with some valid sources without crying like a butthurt bitch about it. When serve up a statement on how things are, you should not be surprised if someone asks for your facts, as if you're offended that your holy opinion isn't valid enough -- because it really, really isn't. I don't give a flying fuck about your opinion. Now give me facts or shut the fuck up.   


Yay, that was fun! Fuck civility, right?   
\&gt;Look at 

I'll be happy to, if you just provide the sources for your claims.
