I never said she shouldn't be punished. But most ppl are all assuming that she is inherently a shitty and bad person irl when all she did was be absurdly stupid. 

And they're still children/teenagers. Yes she's 19, but 19 year olds are basically still high schoolers and high schoolers are stupid and unaware of dangers all the time. Hell, college and university adults are jsut as stupid and willingly endanger themselves all the time with drug experimentations and binge drinking.
