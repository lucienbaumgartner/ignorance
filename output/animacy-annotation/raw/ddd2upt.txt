Same as me. After reading that email, I was determined to make sure I was NOT part of the "unaware and compliant citizenry". Now, I am actively learning about how the Elites are trying control us.

Yesterday, I watched Steve Brannon's "Generation Zero" and Andrew Breitbart, "Occupy Unmasked". Great documentaries!

I'm a stay at home mom in California, surrounded by Liberals. This sub-Reddit keeps me sane and laughing at the hysteria. I hope to post more down the road. I'm still figuring out how this all works. Maybe I'll get a coat someday.
