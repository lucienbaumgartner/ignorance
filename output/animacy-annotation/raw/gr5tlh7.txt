Being interested in the time period or whatever is one thing.... But hanging up a confederate flag?? That, as a history major, she would know is a flag created for all the people who didn't want slavery to be abolished..... Seems extremely suspect to me. I think she's either 1) racist, or 2) extremely extremely dense and unaware of any of the anti-racism movements right now, and the association that flag has with white supremacy, QAnon, Trump supporters, etc etc. So she's either a racist or willfully ignorant, and personally I wouldn't want to be with her either way. If you don't break up with her over this, I think at the very least you need to have a serious conversation with her about politics because there might be more bigoted sh*t hiding in her closet. Best of luck, OP.
