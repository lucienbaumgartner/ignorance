I think we should be looking for a deep playoff run, while also not being so emotional and ignorant that we refuse to consider anything else. 

You just seem to look at it in this in a childlike way, and you thought this would be easy, so had no framework for anything happening other than what you imagined on paper. 

How am I misrepresenting your point? You can read what you wrote above. You suggested SPECIFICALLY that these weren't some of the best teams in the league. So I addressed that directly, with actual data that proves that SPECIFIC statement wrong. 

So I will take this as you retracting that statement. These ARE some of the best teams in the league.
