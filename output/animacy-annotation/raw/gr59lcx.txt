I think you didn't really read my former messages, or maybe you are replying to the wrong message?

But dude, that was really condescending from you:

&gt; Then you're really stupid and ignorant of how China is, and how the CCP works. I suggest you research a bit on the reality in China

I am living and working in China since more than a decade, speak and read Chinese pretty decently, married a local and currently live in the country side with her family.

So you think you can teach me about the reality of China? I would love to see that.
