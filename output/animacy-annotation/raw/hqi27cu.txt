&gt;Said by someone whose religion sanctions pedophilic practices such as underage marriages etc.

Your ignorance and non-educational stance is indicative of a person who is ignorant enough to compare and contrast modern days norms to those of 1500 years ago. You are are too ignorant and uneducated to differentiate or know the difference between the two.

&gt;This religion have been imposed on this land through violence, violation of women and economic sanctions.

Where is your proof of this 'violence, violation of women and economic sanctions'? What land? You think America and 'Great Britain' were fountains of freedom, love and forgiveness? Again, your uneducated and ignorant stance is clear.

&gt;You have not been dealt with properly, my brother and the doors of living hell has not been opened on you. You have been faced with incompetent and restrained forces, not proper battle ready forces. 

The Byzantines, the Persians, the Crusaders, the Romans, the Mongols were not battle ready? Again, your ignorance and uneducated background is staring me in the face.

&gt;Be humble, be good to your people and stop imposing this foreign religion on your own people and violating their rights while there is still time for you.

Foreign? Islam never challenged culture. That is why Islam never clashed with culture and civilization as is evident by Ibn Batuta's travels and how every corner of the Muslims world has its own incredible diversity from Malaysia to Turkey to Indonesia to Arabia. All living differently yet following the same religion. 

Please. Your backwardness is painful to experience. Get some knowledge before engaging someone in theology, history or anthropology.
