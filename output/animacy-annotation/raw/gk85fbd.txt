Sigh.  I really shouldn't have to explain gun laws to someone who wants more gun laws.  You should understand the law before you want to change it.

Every fucking law I listed is federal.  You cannot drive to indiana and buy a handgun if you are an IL resident.  Its illegal for a dealer to sell it to you and that is a federal law.  ANd all dealers follow those laws all the time.  Always, because the ATF checks that shit.  

Its obnoxious to have to deal with people who are both strongly opinionated on a subject and ignorant of that subject as well.
