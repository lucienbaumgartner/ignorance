The stupid part is if (and then "if" is carrying most of this) your sex assigned at birth is somehow relevant to anything, leaving it to just be "male or female" is incredibly limiting and will eventually leave people to either not fill out a form or lie on it.

Some states have a non-binary marker (usually an X) for birth certificate, so if a baby is born intersex, or the parents are raising their child as gender neutral, their "sex assigned at birth" is not male or female. Hell, technically, since my birth certificate says X for the gender, even though it isn't the same birth certificate issued at my birth, legally speaking, my "sex assigned at birth" is also X. And I'm a grown ass working adult.

So not only is this a irrelevant question just used only to make people feel like they can ignore your gender while trying not to seem transphobic (they still are), it also is still very limited and ignorant of what that term actually means.
