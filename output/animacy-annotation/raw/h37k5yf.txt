I remember one of the first people I encountered in the US asking where I was from, told them Scottish.  He said he was Italian, I asked him where he was born, he said New Jersey (at this point I’m just generally curious and unaware of the American habit of saying you’re directly from a place, not “descended from” or something).  I then asked if his parents were born in Italy (thinking maybe he’s first generation), nope.  I asked if he could speak Italian, nope.  I closed with “if you were in Italy, would the Italians say you were Italian?”.  Maybe a bit of a d*ck question, but I wanted him to hear how ridiculous he sounded.  Got a bit of a chagrined shrug in response.
