Got turned down time and time again by shelters because the dominant cat culture here is that cats should be allowed to freely roam outside and I disagree with it. Almost every single profile at each of our local shelters specified some combination of a cat flap, garden and allowing free access to come and go as the cat pleases. When I questioned one shelter about whether it was a genuine requirement assessed cat-by-cat, or stock wording, I was told I was ignorant and cruel for wanting to keep a cat indoors and would never be allowed to adopt by them. Eventually gave up, but completely the opposite would be the case in plenty of other jurisdictions!
