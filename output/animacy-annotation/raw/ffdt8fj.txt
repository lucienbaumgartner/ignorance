Why would anyone listen to a thing you say(most of which is shit) when you can t be bothered to even look up the already proven blatant lie that is the amount of money sent to the EU. How can you say(you, a nobody) that in 50 years benefits will outweigh the costs when no one has no idea whatsoever what the world will look like. How can anyone take you seriously when you say you re an environmentalist and then you argue that because of the EU the UK is not growing fast enough? You do know that growing and consumerism go together right? How can your argument still be that you re sending money to the EU and get nothing in return? Every other statement you make is in contradiction with the previous. Why anyone will listen to a word you say when it's so painfully obvious that you are so misinformed and ignorant  that all you re intersted in is to keep adding layers to your bubble that you live in and never left since the referendum most likely?

Edit: So freedom of movement is racist apparently. This might be the most idiotic thing you have said. Well done.

Edit: Control over your borders? Yes you have. Party that you voted for decided not to use it. Party that has been in power for 10 years and you re still voting for expecting different results.
