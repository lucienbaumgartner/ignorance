Actually it did in countries that had them and enforced them properly.
Also it was wearing a mask, wash you hands, sneeze into your elbow, and social distance. No one actually did all those there was always people having get togethers that had more people than your supposed to, where no one was masked. People still dont know how to sneeze into their elbow and wash their hands.
You can't go around around say masks didn't work when the stupidest and ignorant of a population was fighting against the mandates
