You are not a slave. 

Your boyfriend does not have good friends.  They are using you and your boyfriend is enabling them. Red Flag.  He should see how you are being used.  I'm guessing he is enjoying the popularity of providing them meals.

If his friend's relationship is so precarious that he will lose his friends because they no longer have a personal chef that they don't pay for, then his friendship(s) are not real.

You didn't ruin the guy's birthday, good grief, it's utterly unreasonable to expect someone to provide a birthday party meal(s) without that person actually agreeing.  The birthday boy should have asked you himself and accepted if you declined.

These guys are so immature and unaware of how normal people go about living in our society.  They are so intrenched in being military where they go eat at the commissary and being able to choose what they want to eat.  That's not how it works when you eat at someone else's personal house.  You eat what they make.
