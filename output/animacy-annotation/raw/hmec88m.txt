Okay. So I can put this discussion to rest.

You are admittedly racist and ignorant of the facts which are available for anyone to witness. That's a pretty uncomfortable combination.

I would not comment on anything if I were in your position. An old grandparent's adage comes to mind. "If you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all."
