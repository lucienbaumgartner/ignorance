If you give the MT a good headstart (30s is usually fine, I tend to give them longer) and still take aggro without Provoke, it's not you doing "too much" damage (no such thing aside from some really high level mechanics where you need to not kill a thing), it's the MT being clueless and doing too little. If this happens, you can Shirk when you start getting too close. If you're still taking aggro after that, you're dealing with a real piece of work, and at that point you can suck it up and start toggling tank stance off when you're getting too close (usually recommended, since you won't know how the other tank will react), or just let it happen and take aggro (bad idea in some duties no matter how the other tank behaves):

* If the other tank is at least a bit smart, they'll just let you take the aggro, as they'll see it happens without any Provoking - and if that happens, this is the better solution, as one tank doing higher damage (by that big of a margin) often also correlates to better handling defensive tools and/or better gear (thus better survival) and thus doing better as MT helping healers, and results in overall easier enmity management for both.
* However, if the other tank is not only clueless about rotation, but also stubborn and unaware of their surroundings, they may try to fight you for that aggro with Provokes, which will cause an aggro war that nobody will like, least of all the rest of your team. While the other outcome can make "just stick to tank stance" a better approach, due to this also being a possibility, it's *safer* to take the "guess I'll just go out of my way to let you have it" option, as the aggro war is often a bigger negative than the appropriate change of tank roles is a positive.
