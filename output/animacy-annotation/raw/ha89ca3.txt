&gt; I wouldn't tell them "they should know better", and I never said that I'd ever say that to a victim.

Still, of all things you chose to say "people should not do X" in the context of rape **victims**. While you could have chosen to speak out about the atrocious humans that rape, you voluntarily chose to critic the victim. Prevention of rape is nice, but dictating that people should not "do X" is catering to the rapists.

&gt; I would simply be sad that they didn't protect themselves instead of putting themselves in a dangerous situation that increased the probability of them getting abused.

That's the problem itself. Instead of blaming the rapists, you blame the victims that just weren't careful enough. It's sad that rapists exist. Being sad that a rape victim just wasn't careful enough *is* victim shaming, putting the blame on the victim.

&gt; I wouldn't tell them not to get out of the house, I would just tell them not to put themselves into contexts or places that are particularly dangerous, just like you teach people to check both sides before crossing the road.

Here it is again, you'd tell a rape **victim** that they just didn't act good enough to not be raped.

Also, comparisons are fun and cute, but the victims of inatentive drivers are not to be compared with victims of cruel humans.

&gt; No, that's just wrong, plain and simple. Taking the chance to rape away from rapists is objectively the exact OPPOSITE of catering to rapists, literally by definition.

Telling rape victims to avoid the known places where rapists act **is** catering to the rapists, whether you like the sound of that or not. "Just don't go in these places and you won't get raped" isn't also part of reality. Rape prevention is far more than spotting dark alleys where we should just leave the rapists be rapists.

&gt; Your choice of words is incredibly stupid at best and incredibly dishonest and nasty at worst.

Thanks, I try my best. Very nice personal attack.

&gt; "To be in the path of a rapist" makes it sound like I'm saying rapists have a right to rape anyone who is naive enough to not be alert when it comes to protecting themselves.

That **is** what you're saying. You're bringing forward that the victims *could* have avoided to be raped if they just did X or Y. Which is victim-blaming.

&gt; Of course they don't. Doesn't change the fact that women have to be alert, we all know that unfortunately rapists still exist.

And it's **always** 100% the fault of the rapists, not the victims who hung out in place X instead of Y.

&gt; Recognizing that someone who is wronged can, out of ignorance or naivety, have done something unwise that facilitated a certain outcome is not the same as "blaming" them.

In that context of rape, yes it is. It is blaming the actions of the victim instead of blaming the perpetrators. A voluntary choice in your words.

&gt; "Blame" is a loaded word with connotations that we tend to associate with moral condemnation.

That word has an actual precise definition: "responsibility for a fault or wrong" which you are putting on the actions of the victims.

&gt; The only person who should be morally condemned is the rapist, because he is the only one who acted immorally, so "blame" should only be directed at him.

Then it's truly puzzling that you'd be blaming the victims then.

&gt; However, the victim can be unwise and ignorant of certain dangers

Rapists don't go around with a "I'm a rapist" sign on their person, we're in a context or rape victims here, not general "certain dangers".

&gt; and all I'm saying is that everyone should be taught to protect themselves so that they are careful with who they trust and what situations they put themselves into because the world is an ugly place and horrible shit happens to people who do not deserve it

That's true and nice, a change from your previous stance.

&gt; especially if they are not careful enough to avoid danger.

Damnit victim-blaming again, back to square one.

You could launch yourself into a quick Google with keywords such as "why is victim blaming bad" and you'll see why you **are** victim blaming even if in your heart it's not your intent.

Everyone loses in victim blaming, except the rapists. 

Again, a thousand passed-out drunk people aren't ever at risk of being raped unless a rapist is present. That doesn't change for alley Y or nightclub X, it's not the fault of the victim.
