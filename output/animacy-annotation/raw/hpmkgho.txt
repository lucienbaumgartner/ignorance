So instead of citing any of those tens of studies you go on a long tirade insulting people who disagree with you? Seems like your ignorant and delusional but go on, I expect a minimum of 10 sources that prove your stance of cancelling student loan debt completely is a net good for the majority of Americans.

Makes sense you’re a communist, you think working a job is equivalent to slavery. Failing to understand the old communist saying of... you don’t work you don’t eat.

Please though do go on and explain how enlightened you are despite believing in a system that could only work in a world where humans aren’t shitty and there isn’t rampant global inequalities between first and third world countries.

But who are we kidding instead of backing any of this up and providing your tens of sources you’ll cal me a bunch of ism, ists, and every dirty name in the book.

Kinda funny how you can believe in a system of equality for all and yet still be such a hateful human being, but to each their own.
