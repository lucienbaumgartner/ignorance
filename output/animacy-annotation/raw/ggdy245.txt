I had to do this in outpatient. We had 6 sessions a day and each session we would start with a check in on how we felt. Didn’t matter exactly what is was. It could be angry, weird, sad, happy, etc. It was weird at first but it helped me identify what I was feeling. It also helped me realize feelings can change from moment to moment. There was no judgement made on the feeling. If we wanted to explain that was fine, and if not that was ok too. I think it’s important because in a way it is a type of grounding. We can feel detached and unaware of what is going on. 

The more often I identify the easier it is to process the feeling. It takes practice and it can be jarring if we disassociate often. 

There are some good emotion/feeling charts on the web that can help place your feelings, and later connect them to deeper feelings or beliefs.

Hope this helps. Kinda foggy today.
