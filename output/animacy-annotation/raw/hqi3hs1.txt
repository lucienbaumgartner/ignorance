Way back when I was 19 I was working as a welder/apprentice millwright in a steel mill and I helped build some very intricate machinery.  One day, one of the big bosses came down from his office to see something we had just built and installed.  I was standing next to him when he asked a question and, having helped fabricate and install it, I answered him.  He turned to me, looked me up and down and said, "Go find something to do, you're too young to think".  Now that I'm getting older I always try to keep that in mind when I'm talking to a young person so I will always listen and think about what is being said, but it is also easy to look back and remember how inexperienced and ignorant of so much I was at that time of my life.  I hate to say it but it's true, you'll understand when you're older.
