Jane goes to a party.  
She gets infected.  
She doesn't know it. 

The next day, she goes to choir practice.  

She spreads it around.

That night she comes "down" with something.
She actually caught it at the first party, but she spread it at choir practice.

They are saying **UP TO** TWO weeks. The average time from legit exposure to symptoms is usually DAYS, if the person succumbs.

During those early days, the person is potentially contagious -- they are pre-symptomatic, and unaware of being ill. Most will get sick if genuinely infected.

This is the theory they used.

It is not as ridiculous as you make it out to be, by extending the timeline to the MAXIMUM.

The most common period is like 2-5 days, I believe.

Doesn't that happen all the time?
