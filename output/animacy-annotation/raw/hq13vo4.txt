The way she overreacted was ridiculous. But honestly is it that hard to park in a parking spot? I mean that’s what they’re there for.. It really dumbfounds me when I see a delivery driver park in a fire lane or a handicap spot when there’s open spots elsewhere. It doesn’t matter if you think you’ll be “in and out”.. It’s ignorant and lazy.
