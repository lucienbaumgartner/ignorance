No no no no... 14 year olds are always children who are complete idiots incapable of any rational or coherent thoughts or actions. 14 year olds can't consent to anything, because they are so stupid and ignorant that they can't make any decisions on their own and they constantly have no idea what they're doing. They can't even be trusted with any money, because they don't know what's going on when they spend it. They might pay as much as $20 or $30 for a single stick of gum. It's true. This is how I pay rent. I sell chewing gum loosies to these oblivious children.
