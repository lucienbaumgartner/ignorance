Dear Unfairsprinkles, you are dead wrong. I moved here from Guatemala city, I have lived in roughly 20 cities (Guatemala city, Mexico city, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Miami, Zurich, Madrid, Tokyo, to name a few) and have driven through all of them. I have spent the last 15 years traveling. Nowhere have I seen such zombie like behavior. Not for a minute did I expect someone to write a post saying that I should just accept people have become mindless walking corpses whose phone has become infused with their face. Thank you for insinuating that I don't drive seriously and defensibly, but, that is what just kept someone from dying on Killingsworth about an hour ago. Almost killing another human being is serious business and leaves someone unimaginably frustrated. Almost killing another human being 10 times in 4 months now that deserves a posting. I cannot absorb someone else's personal safety when they neglect it themselves, that is not my job. The best I can do is put my car in park, walk up to them, and ask them why they want to die today. Now that, that works. Blaming the driver for gross negligence or telling them their grievance is a shit post makes me think that is way YOU who I almost killed an hour ago. So when it is you that walking in front of me completely unaware and stupefied, I will walk up to you when you are bleeding on the ground and say....."adapt".
