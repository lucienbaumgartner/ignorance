I asked them how they can believe race is a biological reality when the world doesn’t even agree on racial parameters. I asked if Latin American racial concepts are the “biological reality” and they asked “is it different there?” Lmao. Not surprising that a devout racist would also be extremely stupid and ignorant of literally everywhere that isn’t their hometown
