Almost everyone in this thread sounds selfish as hell to me. In other cultures, sharing a room isnt a big deal and not giving someone their own room doesnt make them an asshole. They can't predict that they weren't going to make as much money as they do. They didn't expect hoising prices to skyrocket. The daughter is being selfish and ignorant of how much their parents provide for the family.

TLDR: those that are calling the mother an AH are kids spoiled by their parents or spoiled by individualism culture
