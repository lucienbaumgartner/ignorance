That's pretty insensitive and ignorant of the history of the area. Not to mention it's extremely disrespectful of the work the local historical societies do to preserve the history of the area. This isn't Detroit where there's abandoned building everywhere with no real historical value, Copper Country has a really rich history and those "abandoned buildings" are often MI State Historical Sites, or even part of the Keweenaw National Park.
