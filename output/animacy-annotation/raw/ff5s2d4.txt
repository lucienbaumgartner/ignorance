no one is forcing you to like homosexuality (however it’s very weird and ignorant that you don’t) but insulting people because of their sexuality, making people feel like being fat is a bad thing and calling them slurs is disgusting. it’s not an insult to be gay lol there is nothing wrong with being gay. LMAOOOO you acted like that was a good point. i’m lame? i’m a normal thinking person who doesn’t like discrimination and hatred against a minority and you’re a raging homophobe
