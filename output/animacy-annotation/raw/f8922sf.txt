Ok, here is your statement again. "the fact is, old white men have always been in power. Thatâ€™s the way the world has always been.". Well that's not a fact now is it since your last person in power was actually a black dude. Now how does me correcting you make me a boomer, and what actually is that" mindset" you're talking about, and who's "we"? You're generalizing a lot, and indeed, you're being racist like the other dude said as well. Tbh. you sound like some brainwashed 14yo who thinks he knows everything. If that's the case it's not really your fault for being so dumb and ignorant, that comes with the age. But if you where to be an actual adult you're actually what's wrong with society at this moment.
