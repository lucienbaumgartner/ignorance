A good litmus test (if you have a self awareness and no sociopathic tendencies) is to \*empathize\* with other people and imagine what it's like if the roles are reversed. Glad you grew up, but most people don't. You seem unaware and junior and sometimes it takes a knock to get back up again, but many people are intentionally malicious.
