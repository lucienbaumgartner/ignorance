What is interesting to me is that the Tiger doesn't seem to open its mouth. You'd think it was going for the bite if it was actually trying to kill.

Also as far as worrying goes, it is entirely amazing to me (or frustrating depending on the day I'm having because of it) how utterly unaware and unreactive people are nowadays.
It is like people have actually statistically reduced their radius of reasonable awareness to about 20 cm. It's like some sort of "CPU conserving" feature, where the brain is so self-obsessed/preoccupied that "being aware of things around you" has been sacrificed to the point of offloading all that "giving a shit" to a diminishing minority of people who actually want to coexist and coreact to each other.
