To preface, Beliefs don’t always govern actions. Many things govern actions — impulses, feelings, external pressures, plans and intentions. Any given Christian should know that they don’t always act in favor of their beliefs and values. That’s not always on impulse either. But I still wouldn’t call it choice. 

Believing in free Will allows the person to live naive and unaware of the shackle of moral responsibility they’ve unnecessarily placed on themselves. From a belief in free Will follows an intentional agreement with feelings of regret, shame, and judgement. Overall negative feelings that need not be agreed with. What positive feelings might follow, when we believe we’ve actually made the right choices? Surely pride, a feeling of which Christians also tend to be critical. 

There is obviously more to it than that, more emotions and intentions tied to a belief in free Will. I think, overall though, the result of belief in free will bears net negative product. 

So what happens when the shackle is realized to be what it is? Well, though you may sometimes still experience those feelings, you can stand in stark disagreement with them. You can relax about the consequences of your past wrongs and focus on how you might change in the future. You can more easily practice humility, compassion, and forgiveness. There are still a few inevitable negative emotional experiences that come with it, but ultimately less so, as I’ve experienced, than with a belief in free will.
