You are suffering from magical thinking - that because you think something is true, that it can magically become true.

But that's not how reality works.

The problem isn't lack of imagination, it's that you are ignorant of reality. Like many people who are incompetent and unaware of it, you suffer from a sense of illusory superiority.

I can imagine anything. But that doesn't make it real.

Reality is based on pesky things like physics.

Try responding to people's posts next time. The problem is that there's no way to store that much energy, and even if you were to pretend like you could actually make that many batteries, the amount of carbon emissions that would be produced by that many batteries would be in excess of the emissions created by building peaker gas plants and using natural gas.

I've worked in related industries and we were well aware of both the promise and limitations of better batteries. Our models showed that EVs were going to be viable, but they didn't show that grid-scale power storage would be. There's no feasible means of storing that amount of energy in an efficient manner.
