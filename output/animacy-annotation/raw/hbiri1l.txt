NTA. You found a woman crying in your house, on the phone with her mother, while her date, your stepson, was knocked out &amp; unaware and likely would be oblivious to her issue even if he was awake. 

In this specific instance anything you said in a fatherly advice vein was fine. Yes, crying in front of your bumble date’s step dad, during a global panorama, while you’re worried about your mom &amp; kid requires someone to reassess their current strategy and even shitty advice is probably better than repeating that scenario.  Even if the creepy step dad is what keeps you from repeating that mistake. 

OP, you are clumsy with your words. I’d suggest asking your wife for some strategies to manage these damsels.  Perhaps warn your stepson that you will go full on Mr Feeny on any women you find wandering your house post hookup if he insists on bringing them to your house.  Seriously, is there not a hotel nearby? Hotwire? Dayuse? 

As for understanding hookup culture, it’s hard but maybe check out some subReddit’s or books about it.
