As much as we critique and downplay ourselves (jokingly or seriously so), there's a lot of people on the outside who see South Africa as the "Gateway to Africa".

 It's the corrupt, greedy, self-defeating, ignorant and foolish actions we see our political, administrative, judicial and even corporate/business leaders do that keeps us back from really stepping up to that title.

We also pull a helluva lot of weight within the SADC region and we (along with our respective SADC members) are involved in many peacekeeping operations within the African country. 

Without rambling too much and eventually going off a tangent, I just want to reiterate that: 

* South Africa is a Gateway to Africa; 
* South Africa is a land that is still viewed by other African countries as a land of opportunity; 
* South Africa is still a country rich with so many resources that if utilised correctly will push us really far; 
* South Africa is a very important player in the southern hemisphere - if we collapse the way other African countries have collapsed, there are VERY serious rammifications that could result that will fuck up the region. 
   * And it's not a case of believing ourselves to be bigger than we are, it's a fact and why this bullshit mess like this year's "July Insurrection" was just as smart as sticking a giant firecracker up one's arse and expecting to shoot into space like you're the next Mark Shuttleworth.
