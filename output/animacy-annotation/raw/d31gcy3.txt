Some NTs hate being asked this because we don't actually know! We are so unaware and so attached to these behaviors -- reliant on them in fact -- that we can't see them from the outside or defend them as intrinsically necessary! No addition to having an SO with aspergers, I've had some training in intercultural awareness. 

These things truly are cultural and being aware of the cultural differences has helped me explain this stuff to my SO without being judgmental -- personal space is one that comes up with us that is very cultural and can be difficult to deal with.

Another field of study that you might find helpful is conversational analysis -- it is what it sounds like and is a field of linguistics that looks at patterns of communication and social interaction including non-verbal communication.
