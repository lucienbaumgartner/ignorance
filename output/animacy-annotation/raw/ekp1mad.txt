You can't raise the voting age. You can't strip people of a right they've been born with just because you don't like the outcome of them having that right. Sorry you just need to acknowledge they have a right to vote which you need to deal with in a more mature way than "I DON'T LIKE IT TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM :(". Would you also be in favour of stripping the vote from anyone aged 69 or over because chances are they won't be around for much more than 3 years either.

As for your argument against lowering to 16, yeah it's terrible that 98% voted for green based on one single issue of cannabis legalisation but it's laughable to suggest this isn't how people vote once they reach 18. Most people vote in a way which is entitled, bigoted, narcissistic and ignorant. That doesn't disappear when you hit 18 and it actually gets worse as people age so if you don't like the idea of ignorant people who only care about one issue having a vote you, again, should probably want to introduce a maximum voting age.

I don't necessarily agree with a lower voting age but 16-18 year olds are more enganged, more switched on and more aware of issues faced collectively by the country than anyone over 65 and this idea that life experience means you vote more sensibly is demonstrable bollocks.

I'm yet to see an argument against lowering the voting age which can't be used as an argument for introducing a maximum voting age. And I don't think anyone is even entertaining the notion of a maximum voting age.
