THIS. I'm a college professor in the US. I've been to a few multicultural-education seminars, and people are just starting to realize this fundamental difference between Western education and Chinese education. When I have Chinese students plagiarize papers and I call them out on it, they're completely confused and unaware that they've done anything wrong. It's my job to *teach* them about our academic misconduct rules *before* I punish them for misdeeds that they're committing through ignorance.
