&gt;As for politics, it feels like any right-wing viewpoint gets immediately attacked and/or ridiculed by the media,

I think that might be a matter of perspective tbh. I get frustrated when some right wing points are even given air (I.E Obama was born in Kenya, climate change isn't real, the Muller investigation is a conspiracy). Some talking points are so ridiculous and ignorant that a lot of left-wingers can't help but react to it strongly. it sound likes you're seeing a lot of the reactions and not the inciting incidents. 

&gt;Personally, I consider myself leftists on a lot of issues, those are 2 where I'm somewhat right-wing, but apparently that already makes me a "Nazi" according to a lot of influential left-wingers...

That probably isn't fair but, you have to understand that we literally have a white supremacist as president and that we have actual self identifying Nazis in congress. The parallels between what we are seeing in the US and what happened in 1930s Germany is terrifying. That's not just left wingers saying that ether.
