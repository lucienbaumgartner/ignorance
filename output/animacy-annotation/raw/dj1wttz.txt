Honestly ...

I'm not as salty about the fact that you can't one shot higher level targets. Think of it this way, logically. If they're higher level than you, they're more experienced. If they're more experienced, it's entirely plausible for them to be able to anticipate and react to a hidden blade assassination attempt, and prevent it from happening. Just because you're attacking out of stealth doesn't mean your target will always be completely unaware and unable to respond - with quick enough response, it is possible to avoid being killed by a sneak attack. 

You can actually see it in the first target they try to assassinate ... in the 2-3 seconds it takes for Bayek to bring his hidden blade up to the targets head, the target is ready to block the attack with their arm. I'd say thats entirely fair and realistic.
