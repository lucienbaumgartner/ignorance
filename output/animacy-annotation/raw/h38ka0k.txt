This is the ultimate reward for any Chinese-Americans who do science in the United States of America.

&gt;activists, legal scholars, and national security experts have argued that it rests on shaky foundations, is limited in its efficacy, and **fuels wide-scale racial profiling that has profoundly damaged the US scientific community.**

It's only shocking if you're naive and unaware of the history of the United States of America and how it treats minorities. In America, Chinese-American lives don't matter.

&gt;“It’s just shocking,” says Yasheng Huang, a business school professor at MIT, who brought together a group of academics, known as the Asian American Scholar Forum, to discuss these issues after his colleague Gang Chen, the head of MIT’s mechanical engineering department, was arrested for grant fraud under the China Initiative. “**The standard is incredibly low to put a guy in jail and charge him with serious crimes, destroying his life and destroying his career.”**

In American, it's pretty much a crime to be a Chinese-American scientist.

&gt;In an analysis of DOJ press releases covering 79 cases brought as a result of the initiative, the civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice found that **48% of them resulted in no actual charges of economic espionage,** but rather charges like wire fraud, tax issues, or other infractions that amount to disclosure mistakes on administrative forms

This is the real aim of this program. To blackmail Chinese-Americans into spying against China.

&gt;**Sadiku also tried to persuade him to become a spy for the US government,** using his Beijing University work as a cover.

This is how "freedom" and "human rights" works in America. 

&gt;Observers say the details of the case echo those of others brought as part of the China Initiative: **a spy probe on an ethnically Chinese researcher is opened with little evidence, and the charges are later changed when no sign of economic espionage can be found**

Basically, the FBI is just making up cases to fill up their quota requirements.

&gt;According to German, the former FBI agent, this is due to the pressure “on FBI agents across the country, every FBI field office, [and] every US Attorney’s office to develop cases to fit the framing, because they have to prove statistical accomplishments.” 

American freedom - how sweet it tastes.

&gt;He is still under house arrest ... He has been jobless since his US work visa expired, but he has also not been granted leave from house arrest so he can return to Canada to renew it.
