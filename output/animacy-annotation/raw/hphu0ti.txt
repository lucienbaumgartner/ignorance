It's a response I use \*not just on reddit\* but anywhere I encounter a persistent troll like you. From your first comment, you've been petty, ignorant, and confrontational. Just look at what you've said. Every word is meaningless rhetorical gymnastics pretending to be some deep observation. 

Lies begin when you think you have figured out who you're talking to, but really, you have no clue.
