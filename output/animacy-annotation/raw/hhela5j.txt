I am so sorry. It’s such an awful and hard thing to go through. My TFMR was also my first pregnancy, it’s such a shock going from so happy and unaware of the bad possibilities to that. 

This is a great place for support, and if you have Facebook there’s also a secret group on there that you can request to join through the Ending a Wanted Pregnancy website. I found a lot of help there. 

There will be good and bad days ahead. The time waiting for the procedure was really tough for me, then the time leading up to the due date. We made a point of going out of town on a little vacation during that time, it helped a bit. 

Take care and be kind to yourself.
