Dogs do cause a mess. Have you seen a dog lift a leg to the bottom shelf in the cereal isle? I have. Have you seen a dog run under and get caught in someone else’s cart? These stupid owners are so unaware and nonchalant about their “cute”, yet completely untrained dogs that it’s frustrating for everyone. Employees of the stores are literally eye rolling, shit talking and TRAILING these dogs/owners to be on top of the “unknown urine” left behind.
