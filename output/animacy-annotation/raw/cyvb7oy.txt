First post but been lurking for months here. I have been symphatetic to the SDF and the Kurdish cause in Rojava. I was wondering if you guys have any counterarguments why support for them should not be there? Perhaps i am unaware and ignorant of historic tensions and events in the area? I would love to hear arguments and insights from islamic, fsa or government supporters
