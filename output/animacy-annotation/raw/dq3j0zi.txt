Interns: Compensation, Roles and Responsibilities

Having Interns have the responsibility of a full time salary employee while only getting 10-15/hr for long periods of time (6-12 months) doing a job that pays 45-60k entry level)

Having Interns work 30-40+ hr weeks during college semesters 

Not including bonuses or any pay raise for Interns extended throughout a school year (not summer Interns) 

Setting performance standards that are nearly impossible to meet so that when the time comes to hire someone full time they have as many excuses as possible not to do so, enabling better margins for managers etc who had good production or revenue  with a low head count (due to intern help). Easy for them to go and hire another intern to do the same all over again. 

At the end of the day Interns are young and unaware and are used by large corporations to increase revenue for middle managers and executives. 

The opportunities are GREAT (don't get me wrong) but often time Interns are given too much responsibility with no compensation or guaranteed position. One mistake can be used to not hire someone.  

Sadly this is still the best way to get experience in the USA and people are so used to it!
