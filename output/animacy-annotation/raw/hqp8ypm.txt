No, this is not where 'WE' are at.  There will always be ignorant and uninformed individuals in any group.  They do not speak for all of us and we do not have to behave as if the entire group is a problem.  The fact that you just randomly assign your political views to address your bias is the symptom of the real problem here.

Sooner or later, people in this country are going to have to take a stand against the endless virtue signaling and pearl clutching. Most Canadians are decent people that go out of their way to be gracious and welcoming to all races and demographic groups.  Trying to stir up divisions through a false narrative is not helpful.
