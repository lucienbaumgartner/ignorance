I'm ashamed to say I'm way too scared to actually let them know how I feel. Friend 2 would legitimately drop me, I think. I've known her half my life. I suppose my hatred wasn't as bad when we became friends because I was unaware and generally unexposed to the atrocities of dogs. As we've gotten older, I've become intolerant and she's only embraced the whole pet parent thing. I actually think it would kill her to know I don't like her dog and that I think it was a mistake for her to ReScUe it.
