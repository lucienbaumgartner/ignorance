Thanks for sharing this. It's important to show what people feel about such losses. A lot of people become so depressed and ignorant that they don't realize that WE actually care about them. We cannot bring them any recipe for a complete healing, but we're there and do what we can do.

I'm sorry for your loss, I just wish that you'd let go all the negative emotions, whether it'd be hatred, disappointment, questioning what else you could've done, if that's the case.
