honestly i went on a date where i said i donâ€™t drink alcohol and he still bought alcohol and asked me why i didnâ€™t drink any and tried to encourage me to drink it. i shouldâ€™ve left right then and there but i was stupid and 24 and got scared of what would happen if i left. i stayed on this stupid one hour date and im glad nothing happened. he insisted on taking the bus with me as it was on the way to his place and i told him he could walk the two blocks ðŸ™ƒ he still went on the bus and tried to hug me when he left and i was like lol no. never spoke to him again. reported him on the dating app. but people are literally pushy and unaware and cross boundaries.
