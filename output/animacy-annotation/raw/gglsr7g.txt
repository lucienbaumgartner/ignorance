Back when I first saw the movie, I was pretty young and unaware of that word being a racial slur. I just accepted the javelin explanation as making sense. I mean, if you have no other context, the idea that a javelin thrower would be nicknamed "spearchucker" doesn't seem weird at all. It was probably like a decade and a half later that I first read something about his nickname being racist. Was genuinely confused at first, because wherever it was didn't actually explain it, just stated it as if it was a known fact. Which I guess it was, but not to me at that point.

I still don't think I've ever actually heard anyone use it as an insult. Not sure whether I'm incredibly sheltered, or it just fell out of common usage before my time (born in '85).
