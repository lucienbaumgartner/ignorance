&gt; Hillary's campaign wants "unaware" and "compliant" citizens

&gt;“And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”
​
&gt; The Clinton campaign is literally conspiring to keep the population unaware of what is going on, and they admitted it in this email. Very scary ‘1984’ level thinking (group-think). If Hillary is the right choice for president and the truth is on her side, they should encourage their supporters to be aware and do research on both candidates.

&gt; Watch this video about it.

Even when they do talk about Seth Rich all the way down in point #55, they only discuss the possibility that he is the leaker. They aren't claiming it with certainty. You're seriously going to let that small detail prevent you from considering the rest of this information?
