The problem is not how long it takes to get there. You know why there are delays? Because Charles announced them irresponsibly THAT'S WHY THERE ARE DELAYS. 4 TIMES in one year span. Don't you even realize how irresponsible and ignorant that is? You can't just shoot up dates like it's your plan to watch movies. If you announced a release that you HAVE to make sure it is at least possible, not shoot up dates 2 months prior and missed them 4 times. That's ridiculous.
