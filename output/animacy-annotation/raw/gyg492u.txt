See, this is the problem, time and time again we see these instances and time and time again we’re told not the worry because it’s a tiny minority, it’s starting to wear a bit thin and I think Scotland is seeing it for the gargantuan understatement that it really is. It is dismissive and ignorant of a very serious issue within rangers fc, and needs to be addressed. Decent Scots can’t be called bigots for pointing out the very real issue with rangers fc and their fan base. Rangers fans upset about this have to either stop supporting the club or address it constructively, not get mad at people pointing it out.
