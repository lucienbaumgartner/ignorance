The level of delusion some liberals have is incredible. They are so narcissistic and ignorant that they're now completely disconnected from reality. For, example, this week I've been called a "far-right russian spy pretending to be an american leftist on the internet so that Trump can win" because I said I dislike both Trump and Biden and that the workers don't have a major party in America.
