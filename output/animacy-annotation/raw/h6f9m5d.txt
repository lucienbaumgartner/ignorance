As a big dude who owns 3 small dogs if a big dog is being too aggresive and unaware of their size and I ask the owner to call it off so I can take my dog away. I will absolutely pick up my dog if the owner doesn't help. And I'll stiff arm a big dog if it tries to attack my dog when I pick up and will defend my dogs life. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

All it takes is one bite from a bigger dog to kill my littlest dog. If it bites me instead then so be it. 

Generally if the dogs in the park (or dogs entering the park while I'm in there) are 3x the size of my dog I'll just leave.
