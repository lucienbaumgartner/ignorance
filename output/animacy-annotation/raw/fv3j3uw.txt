The International Space Station will be destroyed in a freak accident. As the world enters recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic, governments around the world pull funding from their space programs, effectively ending space exploration for humanity for the next generation. Craft and other technologies are at first mothballed, later to be sold off at auctions. As the world continues from recession into depression, those still encouraging space travel and exploration are derided as out-of-touch elitist obsessives. Astronomy, cosmology, and astrophysics are removed from most school curriculums, while those in the Bible-Belt begin introducing Flat-Earth studies as a new "unbiased" approach. Years from now, when an extinction-event level asteroid is about to collide with the Earth, humanity is left wholly unaware and unprepared.
