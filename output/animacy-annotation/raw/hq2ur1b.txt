Historically speaking there has always been a sense of us and them across every culture and continent.  Hell, it’s probably rooted in ape behavior.  The Sumerians had disdain for the ignorant and wild Semitic peoples just like the Chinese had disdain for the pastoral mongols, Malays, Cambodians, etc.  The Aztec empire fell to Cortes because he was able to raise an army of locals because of Aztec barbarity towards tribal peoples.

The Irish and Italians were absolutely considered less English in the Anglo empire and less American in English dominated America.  Because they were.  It wasn’t about whiteness.

What’s “sticking in my craw” is how you’re conflating ethnic bigotry with racism.  It’s not.  But that doesn’t make it any less horrible.
