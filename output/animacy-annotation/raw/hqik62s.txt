See this is a problem. Saying an entire racail group's opinion doesn't matter is racist and harmful. 

Was the friend a rude and disrespectful? Yes. Did OP have every right to call her out? Yes. Does anyone have the right to say someone's opinion is worthless due to race or culture? No.

Conversely, if a white persons opinion is worthless in regards to minority cultures, then wouldn't a minority person's opinion be worthless on regards to white cultures?

The friend was ignorant and closed minded, there is no question. Her opinion was simply an opinion and to be taken with a grain of salt. But not worthless as the worth of it is showing off the closed mindless of the friend.

Every culture deserves respect, every race as well.
