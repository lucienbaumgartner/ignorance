I'm 23 and very close with my father, while him and my mum were together he had an affair with a lady I used to go visit with him (I was unaware and too young to care at that point) anyway he told me not long ago that he was going to leave me, my mum and my sister to be with this other lady but he never did he ended up staying... Anyway, I was speaking with him the other day and was talking about men that keep kids they may have had a secret. I asked him 'you don't have any I don't know about do you?' he replied 'no, don't think so love! Maybe one' I asked him why he never did anything about that because if it was me in his position I'd wanna know if the kid was mine. He said the kid was brought up to think whoever he calls dad right now to be his actual dad so he never got involved with getting a DNA test.
