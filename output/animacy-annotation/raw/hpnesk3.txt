To the United States neolibs and neocons, anything short of executing minorities in the street is "left-wing." Any company that performatively argues in favor of basic human rights is communist, regardless of the reality that they oppress ethnic, sexual and gender minorities the same as everyone else. If everyone is making $8.00 an hour, they don't have the time or energy to examine the reality that we're all fucked. But at least they have "inclusive" commercials and employee manuals.

Que the rainbow-drone meme. I may get downvoted for this, but these people are largely victims in the U.S. Our country is the leading example of brainwashing and ideocracy. I'm from Oklahoma, one of the most fascist states in the country. But a state with incredible labor history. If you ask them about their economic beliefs, they're notoriously "left-leaning." Ask them about social issues, they're notoriously conservative and hateful. That's because of red scare nonsense and the oppressive boot of capitalism training them to hate minorities and immigrants instead of their corporate overlords. Though they all have the opportunity to learn otherwise, they are nonetheless trapped in a cultural morass. They are targeted in order to create an ignorant and blameful populace.

I hate it, and I hate their ideas. But I can't help but pity them. Maybe I'm soft-hearted, but it's actually super sad that most of these states are denied basic education and are supplemented instead with horseshit propaganda.
