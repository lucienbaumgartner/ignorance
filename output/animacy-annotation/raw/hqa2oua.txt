It's more than a few.  It's the majority.  What research have you done besides Fox news and " I know a guy that's a cop"

Cops are agents of the state to protect the elite.  They started as slave patrols to catch runaway slaves and private security for rich capitalists businesses.  They are union busting agents of the state.  What you have is an ignorant and uninformed idea of what you think with no real world relevance other than "I feel this way because media and society told me too, so that's how it is".
