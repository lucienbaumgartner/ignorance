Not to the same degree though. Dominant teams/sportspeople attracts the glory supporters, who are usually both ignorant and toxic, because they have no idea what they're talking about, and attach their ego to someone else's accomplishments.

Lewis fans are on the same level as Fergie era Man U fans, or Brady era Patriots fans. Not universally, obviously, but in general they had/have by far the most irritating supporters.
