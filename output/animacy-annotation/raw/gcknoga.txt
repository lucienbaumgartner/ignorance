I don't have enough information to evaluate that. Some people are just kind of socially awkward and unaware of how they are being insensitive, other people just have no filter, while some people actively try to damage their partner's sense of self esteem so that they will push themselves to please harder and seek approval. I think the third attitude would be a good reason to walk away, but I have no way of evaluating why he said that, and ultimately the question of whether or not something is concerning enough to justify walking away is something only you can decide. 

The biggest thing that's striking me is that he seems 1. pretty vanilla in what he wants you to do, and 2. very inexperienced about what the norms and code of conduct is within the community. It's fine if he's inexperienced, but if so it means that you \*both\* need to be doing a lot of research and reading before you jump into this. BDSM is not a hall pass to have a controlling or abusive relationship, and there are practices in place that keep it from becoming one. Starting a D/s dynamic without those safeguards is common but a really bad idea, especially when you're new.
