Tbh, I think it's really dumb and ignorant that so many people blame the situation in shelters on breeders and people who choose to get their puppies from them. It's really obvious that a person who wants a specific breed isn't interested in getting a mix breed from a shelter. It's either a pure breed or nothing for various, valid reasons. Puppy mills and animal abusers are the issue.
