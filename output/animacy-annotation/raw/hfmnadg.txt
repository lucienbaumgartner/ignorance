Yes, but [at the Dabuert hearing](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-kyle-rittenhouse-self-defense-hearing-20211005-3zfdczqfu5fvhl3vqbluzeqhma-story.html) to discuss the use of experts to evaluate the use of force standards, he seemed a bit unreasonable and unaware of his ACTUAL role in a court:

&gt;\[Judge\] Schroeder has signaled he could limit \[defense use of force expert\] Black’s testimony, most likely barring him from explaining Wisconsin’s self-defense law to the jury. The judge is expected to announce his decision later this month.
  

  
“When it comes to use of force, I am the expert,” Schroeder said at a previous hearing. “I’m the only one who is going to be defining what is reasonable under the law, what constitutes self-defense. I’m not going to have competition in the courtroom.”

In most cases, the judge's role is to determine what is admissible under the law, to highlight the text of the applicable law, and to manage the presentation of the case to the jury. Not to tell them, "Nope, that wasn't reasonable, you must convict." The judge  may be able to say, "Here's the law and the standard established by the law, it's up to you to determine, based on what you've seen and heard both in eyewitness testimony and the videos presented and consider the opinions of the experts each side has presented as to whether the actions were reasonable." But I would think you're looking at reversible error to a) limit the ability of the defense to present its arguments and expert testimony or to b) tell the jury, no the actions weren't reasonable and you can't treat them as such and therefore must convict the defendant.
