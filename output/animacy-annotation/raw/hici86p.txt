all real, I’m no saint though and I wouldn’t dare hold my wife and I up as textbook examples of raising a transgender teen.  We struggle but we do it behind the scenes and always try to inspire in her a confidence that she can do this.  It makes me sad to hear of some parents who reject their sons and daughters over an outdated and frankly ill informed view of gender.  I freely admit we were definitely ill informed and ignorant of the consequences.  Although we cast doubt over her initial coming out it was based on a false stereotype of kids wanting to be princesses when they were 3 whereas our child was into camping, building stuff and had pretty much always played with boys through their prepubescent years.  When she came out at 12.5 we sought counsel from a child psychologist who warned us against affirmation at such a young age.  We of course regret this now but at the time it made more sense to tell her to think on it for a while longer.  Anyway the comments here give us great solace and I’m overwhelmed with the advice and good will people have taken the time to write us.  My hope is that someone in your lives is doing the same for you. Take care
