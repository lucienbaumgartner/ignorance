I'm in the opposite boat sometimes as a scientist. "Business" guys at meet ups want to tell me everything wrong with my product and science when they have no idea what they're talking about. And I smile and nod and gently and politely try to answer their questions no matter the hostility. So I react fairly positively even though they are often so wrong and ignorant of basic laws of nature.

This is more common for the junior start-up bros and I leave the meeting disheartened because they sound like a clown, while I really wanted to hear about operating a business. But they just want to try and show off to their partners and others how smart they are and its sort of embarrassing (for them, not for me as I will just move on).

Luckily real VCs and seasoned start-up people ask pointed science questions and move on to the business questions as those are what really matter for a startup. They realize an expert scientist is an expert and the business expert is the expert in business.
