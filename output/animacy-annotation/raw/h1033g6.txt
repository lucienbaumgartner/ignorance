That wouldn't surprise me in the least that she was told that. I have a suspicious feeling that quite a few TI's who find themselves being gaslit and screwed with by close family and friends are in a similar situation with regard to said family members and loved ones probably being tricked and lied to either by legit LEO's who rely upon unwitting family members and friends of their targets being unaware and ignorant of the law enough to go along with it, or just plain scamming and hustling them to the point where perhaps even fake credentials are being utilized, along with the usual amount of B.S where professional scam artistry is concerned. 

Fake office headers, phone numbers where a pro sounding "secretary" or underling even answers and takes messages which are then followed through upon are easy enough to pull off and probably really sell the whole thing quite a bit. Especially with everything else added together with it for full effect. Its the little things like that and the attention to detail that those who take the time and effort to put into it that separates the pros from the weekend warrior, neighborhood watch enthusiasts who just discovered the effectiveness of noise campaigns on the neighborhood meth heads...
