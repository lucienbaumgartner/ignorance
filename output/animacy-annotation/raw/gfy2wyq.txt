The British character Michael Scott is based on, David Brent, is not a good or redeemable person and is never portrayed as such. But that kind of deeply pessimistic comedy doesn't really fly with American audiences, so when they adapted it for NBC they transformed him into a guy who may be awkward and unaware of social norms (David Brent) but ultimately has a heart of gold and genuinely cares for his friends and coworkers (*not* David Brent). But very often in the show the former still overwhelms the latter and makes Michael a very unappealing person.
