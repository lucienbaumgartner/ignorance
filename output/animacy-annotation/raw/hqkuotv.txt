Did you even watch one national football match? I really really doubt it. 

Implying that national football/soccer is inferior shows nothing but how ignorant and biased you are. 

Riyad Mehrez, and in one of the interviews he had about one goal he stroke at the last minute against Nigeria in the AfCON 2019 semi finals was something along the lines of:  
"The happiness of that goal equals 1000 cups with France or in Europe.... If not for the stadium, I would have continued to run in celebration until I reach Algeria". 

Shut up, you are just dumb and ignorant. And you really do not value soccer the way it should. 

We love it in all its forms, even if we were only watching kids playing with a faux ball made of milk bags (which is something I assume you are not familiar with, but meh.)
