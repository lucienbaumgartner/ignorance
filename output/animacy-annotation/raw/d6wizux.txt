never claimed to know you and clearly wouldn't want to.  not to mention you're making outlandish assumptions about what i believe.  you backing your beliefs was essentially, "i dont buy it, because its not possible", when the evidence strongly goes in the other direction, essentially cognitive dissonance. So I'm sorry but id have to theorize you've done little to no research and are just unaware and close minded in general as you just attack and mock me for believing in non-popular viewpoints based off plenty of research.  not surprising though.
