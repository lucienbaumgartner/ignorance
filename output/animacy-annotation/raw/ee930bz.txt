This doesn’t really make sense because it’s more of a cultural issue rather than it being more of a convenience to be ignorant when it comes to not speaking more than just English. A French person isn’t different from an American, you’re acting as if France is dependant on needing to know German or English, they aren’t. It’s like saying Mexico should know English because you guys are their neighbours or vice versa. Many French people can go their whole lives without needing to know anything English related, same with Germany, same with Spain, Italy etc. Fair enough for the smaller countries such as Norway or Switzerland, because their country is heavily dependant on other languages from anything to entertainment purposes or simply just eating different types of food and knowing what you’re eating. It comes down to better education and more of an incentive for people to learn different languages, nobody is saying Americans should be multi linguistic but it’s a bit pathetic and ignorant that so many Americans struggle to even speak basic Spanish when a significant percentage of their country speak Spanish as their native tongue.

&gt;&gt; Doesn't make it better when the entire world goes to the trouble of learning the language you speak anyway.

Thanks Britain.
