And my point is that pretty much none of what you used was British slang, just things that you heard and assumed were true, and you quite simply admit that you hold the rather desultory and obtusely condescending attitude of calling a nations lingual characteristics as cute, "funny" and "cartoonish", how insulting, which just goes to show *that you are indeed, very much culturally ignorant* and rather blatantly and unpleasantly at that, and it seems I failed to grasp the intention behind your earlier point because I didn't think it could possibly be that stupid

You were actually trying to say that I'm not allowed to criticise your culturally ignorant bad joke *about my culture* because I don't know enough about *your culture*? What an absurd and utterly idiotic idea. 

And perhaps my offhanded remark of assuming you were an American was my overstep, though not too unnatural an assumption as the largest demographic of this site and tumblr users are American and it's not a secret that it's this online demographic in particular that are notorious for including (not to say, being composed of) people who are rather unaware and culturally ignorant. But I guess I'll apologise, it seems your obtuseness and cultural ignorance doesn't outwardly have anything to do with the stereotypes of your nationality.
