&gt;How juvenile that her birthday will be forever marred by a bad event that happened when she was 23

How insensitive and ignorant of you to imply that having very normal, human feelings is "juvenile". 

You're the odd one out here. Maybe you aren't an emotional person in any sense and wouldn't feel that a birthday breakup is harsh, but that's actually a very uncommon reaction. It's not normal to be cold, unaffected and unemotional so stop acting like it is. 

&gt;You are obsessed with rules, with no consideration for the context

and 

&gt;he made the best one that he could. NONE of the options were good, but you all are crucifying him as if you would have chosen differently.

um...

&gt;The rest of you are ready to mount the noose based on the worst of what you can imagine, not anything else

You look like the one who is obsessed with this whole thing.
