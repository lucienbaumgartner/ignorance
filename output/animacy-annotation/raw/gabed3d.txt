Just wanted to chime in quick as I was unprepared and unaware of penis numbness as a possibility. My doctor assured me the feeling would come back but I still worried and couldn't find a ton online about it. Mine took 6 weeks to come back but they also had to put a ton of traction on my leg due to my hip being tight. To be completely straight and maybe too honest, I was numb all the way including penis, sack, taint and b-hole. Only thing that had feeling in the area was cheeks lmao. I only say this because I spent the full 6 weeks worrying and it was completely unnecessary to worry.
