As everybody else has said Unpopular shouldn't mean completely unfounded and ignorant. that comment cited 

1) his lack of goals (This season he has the most goal contributions (26) Most assists,  2nd most big chances created (15) and the 4th highest amount of goals

2)  him not showing up in big games which is again completely ignorant as he lead Belgium to the semi-finals of the world cup, putting in an incredible performance against France (the only Belgian player to do so in my opinion as players like De Bruyne and Lukaku were silent), and he has an insane record against top 6 clubs in the Prem perennially being the best player for chelsea in those games (minus the Manchester City game from this season)
