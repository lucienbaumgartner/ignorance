I don't care what it "comes off as." 

Making fun of someone who makes choices that make them into a shitty person and not making fun of someone for the way they were born is not virtue signalling. That isn't really something to argue. 

Even if a neckbeard is austistic, there's a very definitive line between making fun of their autism and making fun of them being an asshole. 


This photo suggests that the person is autistic and unaware that the fun he is having is solely for the amusement and mockery of the person taking the photo. That's the other difference. That's directly taking advantage of his autism for a laugh. 

I can't believe you people are so vehemently arguing against that idea as if it has anything to do with "moral superiority." Its not that tough of a concept. 


Making fun of someone's choices, especially when they lead to that person being a shitbag != Making fun of who someone is as a person, and how they are born into the world.
