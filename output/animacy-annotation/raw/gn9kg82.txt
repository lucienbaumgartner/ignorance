If people use words or phrases that society has deemed not acceptable. Then it's unacceptable. This idea that " well it's ok for them but not for you " Is idiotic and ignorant. That applies to everything at every level. So don't give me that BS. And this mirrored by the mass majority of society.

The situation is solvable, didn't say it was easy or going to be perfect. But it can be improved and drastically. 
Being able to disappear online has nothing to do with, stopping or at the very least reducing the text, which is has to be posted according to the rules/filters in placed by the platforms. That is controlable.

The point of this whole debate, is that the platforms choose not to control it, when it can be controlled. The same way it is controlled on other platforms, I've come across quite a few games and websites, which do not allow curse words, and varients of them, control which images can be uploaded, and allow users to block inappropriate text and images.
No it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

But the truth is, I wouldn't block any of it anyway. Because if you allow those sorry fucks, to say there crazy shit. You can call them out on it, possibly out them to there jobs, friends, and fuck thier lives up. Just like it's happened to so many other racist and garbage individuals like them.

But the platforms should, make it possible to remove that shit from reaching you if you choose.
But if your the type of individual that when things get hard you just throw up your hands and say " Oh'well guess this is my life now " then I hope it works for you. Because that isn't me.
