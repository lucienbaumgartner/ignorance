The best is when they step in front of you to force you to stop when you’re pulling a pallet to ask a question. I have a lot of back problems and trying to stop so you don’t run someone or yourself over quickly really hurts it. Or the people that are so brain dead and unaware of their surroundings they don’t even see you coming. Or they do and they’re just jerks. People are just rude and entitled. I just try and manifest a shitty rest of the day to them.
