Iâ€™ve read both the book chapter and the research paper he cites and completely misrepresents. 

Yes, his inference about human hierarchies is based on lobster hierarchies. Appealing to lobster hierarchies as support for human hierarchies in any sense at all is not only a non-sequitur but it is also clearly the naturalistic fallacy. If you think heâ€™s not implying that human hierarchies are legitimate when heâ€™s talking about the serotinergic system of lobsters and then saying we have a serotinergic system.. I have some bridges Iâ€™d like to sell to you. 

Hierarchies have not been avoided in any societyâ€¦ uh yeah and? Are you implying an ought from an is? Thatâ€™s also completely untrue, maybe you should pick up some basic anthropology and history textbooks, think about what you mean by hierarchies and think about how our social constructs modulate those. 

You finding opposition to your ignorant and backwards ideas on Reddit is not evidence for your slippery slope not being a fallacy ffs ðŸ˜‚
