&gt;With the creative loophole accounting they do I bet that they get something out of this, like their "donation" of program administration costs all the way from corporate legal to the front end worker spending their time soliciting a donation.

This, children, is otherwise known as the "well I don't understand accounting but it has to be nefarious" response. The fact that you say "accounting loopholes" for something as simple as a charity collection drive is so incredibly sad and ignorant that every single accountant that has or will read your response will laugh at you, btw. 

&gt;The big corporations don't pay taxes anyway. At the very least they can claim the philanthropy for public relations points.

Lol, wrong so wrong.
