Damn OP—that’s really an ugly and absolutely sordid thing of her to do. Utterly toxic of her to body shame you like that and how weird is it for her to send you screenshots about her and her friend discussing dick size. Think about that. She’s of a class of unaware and hypocritical toxic women that probably think it’s okay to body shame men but not the other way around. 
Anyway, sorry to hear that she hurt you like that. You’re a good size and with the right woman, your feelings and love for you will come first. Hope that helps OP
