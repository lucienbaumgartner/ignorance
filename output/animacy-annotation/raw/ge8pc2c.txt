Yeah I don’t even like using edibles for my RA. I don’t care what people say about different strains, ALL weed makes me extremely paranoid and unaware of my surroundings. 
A similar thing happened to me last year when I had a wish-you-were-dead level complex migraine. My husband thought an edible gummy would cure it and help me sleep. 

It did not. I started thinking the headache was an aneurism and freaking out because I thought I was dying. FF 30 minutes and I can’t talk, I’m blowing raspberries instead of saying words, my legs and arms are shaking uncontrollably, completely unable to communicate as my body is seizing.

Mom comes in —in the middle of the night (when it happened) 911, emts, ambulance ride... I couldn’t physically open my mouth to speak. Got airlifted to the next fucking state. Which was my first time flying. After I got to the hospital, I began to be able to move and speak and the tremors stopped. They gave me an ungodly strong cocktail of pain med juice, had to get a 4 hour Uber drive with me (31 at the time) blacked out in my grown sister’s lap. She took photos for posterity.
