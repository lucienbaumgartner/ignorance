Do you have a relevant point to make on gun control or how our government (past and present cabinets) are destroying our country with greed and polarizing laws and agendas? Or is the only argument you can make about my age? Which in and of itself is utterly false and ignorant of you to think that people (probably your age or older) have differing opinions and views than you?
