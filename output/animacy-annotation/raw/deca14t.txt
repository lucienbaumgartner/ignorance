What? Im sorry but that's just not true at all,and terrible advice. I pretty much exclusively use iron sight bolt actions In all game modes and usually finish top 3 in kills and top 5 in points. It's just practice. Sure, at first it can be frustrating but like any other class or weapon, you can perfect it with practice. The infantry/ iron sighted variants can be used aggressively playing the objective and counter sniping. While scoped variants are pretty much limited to counter sniping and long range shooting. Iron sighted bolt actions can be straight up deadly when someone is accurate and has practiced enough, just like any other class. I play against plenty of other ppl who are very good with iron sighted rifles too. Playing operations with a Gewehr m 95 infantry rifle is like target practice. There so many people in the game running out in the open and unaware that it is just a shooting gallery.
