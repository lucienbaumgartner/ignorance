Yeah, I have my own tales of familial insanity which would fit the sub, but the strong whiff of "it's all the evil wimmins fault" along with their self unaware and unexamined rationale for why they allow gendered slurs have put me off the sub for its crab bucket misogyny in the service of entertainment and ultimately counterproductive "support". It's no better than the IRL experiences in navigating these issues, like you said.
