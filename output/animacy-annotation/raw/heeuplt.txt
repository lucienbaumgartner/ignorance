Therapist here. This doesn't sound like schizophrenia. Usally with hallucinations/delusions in schizophrenia, the person is usally unaware and oblivious to what is happening to them and live out the made up scenario. OP is aware. Maybe you are thinking od.Disociative Identity Disorder? 

OP. First ruling out all organic stuff is the first step. Sometimes anxiety can cause paranoia and the brain can code this preoccupation as a physical thing. 

OP, you can consult your public health unit and see if there is any help available
