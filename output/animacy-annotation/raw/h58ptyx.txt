There are two possibilities here. First, he is just so blithely inconsiderate and unaware of your need to also be able to use the fridge/freezer. Unlikely, since you’ve spoken to him about it more than once. Secondly, he’s deliberately being an asshole, likely as part of some petty manipulation. 

You’ve said yourself in a previous post about this guy that he is an alcoholic. Addicts are manipulators. You can’t fix an addict. The best thing to do is leave.
