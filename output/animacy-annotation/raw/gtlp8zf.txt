&gt;Its a rather interesting philosophy though it seems like there is no such thing as forgery if you don't recognize the original as property to begin with. 

No because **the original is a physical thing modified by a specific person**, and a forgery is a copy of an original intended to fool people into believing it originated from that person.

Copying though, in itself is not necessarily forgery if it is not passed off as having been created by that person. And a person may make several copies of their own work but no one would say they are forging their own work.

&gt;I personally feel like there are too many logical loose ends this far down the path.

There are actually more problems in copyrights and patents, and not to mention the difficulty of enforcing them in a modern age where copying things is extremely easy and hard to track.

One problem for example, two people were developing Calculus independent and unaware of each other, such things are possible because ideas and information are not physically bound and exist in their own landscape. So then you end up with problems of granting one of them rights and denying those rights to the other or anyone else who comes after them and rediscovers them on their own.
