I have very bad reactions to bug bites since I had Lymes disease. I don't know if my system overreacted because of the mites but from what I have read one of the main symptoms is more intense itching at night.  I think everyone's body may vary in the reaction and symptoms. 
I did not have any rash on hands or feet or any visible tunnels, I did find the tunnels afterwards.  I would consider treating if you can, if it is scabies it will only get worse trying to contain it.  
I don't know if a doctor's diagnosis was done for you but where I am they are unaware and reluctant to treat this parasite properly. I had the same problem with Lymes disease here in Canada even though I tested positive, saved the tick was very ill with fever and pain I was told by an infectious disease doctor there is no Lymes in Canada it may be in my head..
  Months went by with no treatment and I ended up with a central line put in and nurse home care for many years. If only they treated me right away.  Can you get a hold of any treatments?
