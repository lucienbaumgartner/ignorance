Yes, YouTubes. The ultimate source for scientific info. Where any high school dropout can lie about perspective, physics, etc., And more high school dropouts gobble it up and then tell their kids not listen to their teachers. And then those kids flunk school too. Everyone stays stupid and ignorant. THAT is what "The Authority" wants.
