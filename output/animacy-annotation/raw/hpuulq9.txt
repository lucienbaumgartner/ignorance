Kids... You need to remember that old people aren't what you think they are. They aren't all slow, dumb, and ignorant of the world around them. 

No, old people are the ones that outlived the rest. They are the *survivors*. They have 60+ years of pent up anger and frustration of the world around them, but no longer are held back by the fear of death.

You don't fight someone who has no fear of death. You will lose.
