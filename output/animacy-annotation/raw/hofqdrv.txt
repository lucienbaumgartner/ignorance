This is pathetic. Being diabetic is unfortunate, but it's not abnormal. Neither is having mental health problems. You sound really entitled. You're not the only one with problems. And also, no one told you to be a drug addict; unless someone forced you into it, please don't victimize yourself here. I'm sorry to hear about your family; I really am. But you're not the only one who has family issues. Many people get abused by their families. They may get raped/molested/assaulted by members of their own families. They may get starved, abandoned, neglected, caged, tortured, harassed, or maybe killed by their own families. Are these things normal? YES. Should they be? Definitely not. 

So before you go off and think that you're the only person with problems, wake up and realize you're not. You're really, *really* not. I genuinely pray that you heal from all your past trauma and that you heal, but you're definitely not better than anyone if you sit here and sound quite entitled and ignorant of what you're saying. You want to know how to not sound or look racist and when people are telling you to do so and so, you're ignoring them and instead trying to justify your actions. That's a double negative, you know. World doesn't work that way.
