You’re saying your spouse’s behavior is making you unhappy. You have the power to change that. I was once like you too. Resentful, angry and unaware of the actual power I had/have.

And yes, I’m completely against the “duty happiness” and just suck it up and deal with it mentality that many LLs and LL apologists try to push in marriage.

I’m just concerned that this line of thinking leads to us HLs hurting ourselves more than we need to.
