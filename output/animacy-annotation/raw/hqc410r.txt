People are dumb, ignorant and useless. All people. The sooner one acknowledges that and takes that as a rule - less unfortunate surprises will happen.  


Everyone thinks they're entitled, they're smarter than the other person, they know everything and that 'the rules/laws apply to thee, but not to me'

How many times do we have to hear about dogs unleashed? riding bikes on sidewalks? Squatting at coffee shop tables with a laptop? not picking up your pet's crap outside? no turn signal... yada yada yada the list goes on and on.

People are dumb, ignorant and useless.
