You're lucky. I'm just barely 6'1", my recruiter made me get down to 192 (I was 210 at the time), since he wanted me 10 lbs under the 6'0" limit of 202. After MEPS I was stupid and unaware that I was going to be weighed again so I gained a ton of weight (back to 210, figured I'd just lose it the month before shipping), recruiter yelled at me, back down to 195.

Luckily, losing weight is pretty easy for me. Still a pain, though.
