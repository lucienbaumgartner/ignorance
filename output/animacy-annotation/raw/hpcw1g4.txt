I don't understand them either and OP is a sack of shit, but saying that Greece owes anything to Germany is just ignorant and completely opposite from the truth. Greece is in this terrible state for the last 13 years exactly because of Germany. Like, are we just going to ignore that Germany started this all by nationalizing Greece's debt to save the banks?
