I felt the same way initially too, but all of the annoying and moronic stuff she does and says just starts to pile up after a while, and you realize how absolutely self-unaware and insecure she really is. Which is fine, of course— there’s nothing wrong with being insecure, but the way she doubles down on dumb shit and refuses to acknowledge any other way of thinking just makes it extra irritating. She’s incredibly sheltered and privileged (definitely more so than many other fundies we snark on here) and doesn’t seem to have the mental capacity to understand her hypocrisy and ignorance.
