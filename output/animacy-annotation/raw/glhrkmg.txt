Looks like we're around the same age.  But maybe there was, maybe there is something experts completely missed, but when I see 'Autism' today and the traits of it, it still seems far far notable today.  I mean if you were born in the 2000s, the very thing you have I think would have been worse today.  I know some people who would appear to be on the spectrum. But their kids are actually full-blown or near it.  As in there is a real issue with trying to speak, that no amount of 'therapy' would help.  

I personally think the approval and rise of GMO in the food system starting in the mid-late 90s must have had some impact to make this more noticeable or something.  Or maybe the pesticides changed, since autism is largely seen as some neurological disorder.  

Maybe because kids are wayy too isolated then when we were kids.  I mean going out at 4 unsupervised and talking to other kids might force some kind of reaction to overcome or mitigate the neurological issues, whereas, kids are way more sheltered and thus hindered.  

The same connected reason why allergies have increased alot. Nobody is going to tell me peanut allergies was the national threat it is today back then.  

So apparently, in the US, Autism rate has increased 20x since 1980.  Either we are defining alot of different things under the sun the same thing today, or medical experts, speech therapists back then were that isolated and ignorant that they really didn't clue in that it was one main issue vs many other ones that no longer exist today because it was autism all along.

There is evidence I'm reading environmental factors affect it.  Maybe globalization (Post China in the WTO around 2001) has increased pollution.  More urban density and development.
