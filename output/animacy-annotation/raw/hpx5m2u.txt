Ironic how you call me ignorant and pathetic. I'm can't be wrong, it's an opinion... Obviously I'm disagreeing with the law. That's the whole point of what I said. I'm not ignorant or pathetic for having an opinion or for not caring if people downvote me over it lmao. How dumb can you be. Who would ever intentionally want to be ignorant anyways. Don't act like you know anything about me man, you're just another hypocrite wannabe intellectual.
