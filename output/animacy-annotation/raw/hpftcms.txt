If you're curious why you're getting downvoted, my guess would be your crappy attitude about cheerleaders. 

Guess what?  I was a "head cheerleader" (called a captain, by the way).  I was also a National Merit Scholar, got a full ride scholarship to college based on my ACT/SAT scores, and cheerleading didn't impede any of that.  

I see what you're trying to do here, with your cheerleading/poor writing jab, and it just makes you look ignorant and judgemental.
