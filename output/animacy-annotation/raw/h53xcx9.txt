But how also belief in *something*, even if that something is our own perception that there is nothing to “believe” in is necessary part of human existence. 

the fact that we all are just thrown into this world so vulnerable and unaware, that even as babies (re: attachment theory) our belief system is formed. We are so afraid and helpless as babies,  we inherently have to develop faith in our primary caregivers to keep our needs met and cared for. And when they don’t, it has lasting impacts on how we interact with the world as adults.

We think we forget those early years but our bodies remember. 

I have a feeling anyone with fixed fundamentalist beliefs and the ones who are always looking for answers/ideologies to identify as, are people who do not have secure attachment styles. People who couldn’t have faith in their primary caregiver so they had to find in elsewhere.
