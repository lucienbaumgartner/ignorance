BLM isn't about saying that "only black lives matter", it's about reminding people that black lives matter **as well**.

The reason it keeps coming up is because events keep demonstrating that a lot of people don't seem to think that black lives matter.

When people who say "all lives matter" get pissy whenever they're reminded that that includes black lives, it really does betray the fact that they don't give a shit about struggles that black people face or are too lazy to actually read up on it. 

At best, people who respond to BLM by saying 'All lives matter!' are apathetic and ignorant of racial injustices faced by black people, at worst, they're using it as a dog whistle to racists to show they couldn't give a shit if black people are treated badly.
