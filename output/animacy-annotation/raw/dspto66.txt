Yes sir. You sound brilliant absolutely brilliant. I give up. You are right. Your intelligence is blinding me.  I’ve also been told that bitcoin is a stupid and shitty investment since it was 180$.  Do you know how stupid I feel these years later looking at my portfolio?  Take a guess.  I’m also invested in many other things which act as better “currencies” than bitcoin but thank you for your concern. 

What I’d urge you to do is to look at the replies here. A lot of people who have been conned into believing many lies. People who watch main stream media news. People who went to public government indoctrination camps. People who’s minds are basically a bowl of angry sloppy mush.  These people are so brainwashed by their masters - so utterly unaware and stupid - that they are easily manipulated by endless governmental propaganda put out by agencies such as NASA which paints pantheistic fantasies for Godless (and sadly “Christian”) masses to fall prey to. 

Remember I was born into the same world you were. I was taught the same things. Luckily I have found some very valuable truths. I thank my creator for this. You on the other hand haven’t figured out much in life as demonstrated by your comment. You believe and do as you’re told. You’re a good little minion I’m sure!  But I know to question everything as presented by TPTB in this world.
