well, i wouldn't call someone a racist piece of shit for not supporting BLM, but i would think that they are uninformed and ignorant about racial issues

i dont think that people deserve to have their humanity written off for having ignorant beliefs, but i definitely will think less of people who say casually ignorant and rude things about LGBT people, BLM, etc. so, maybe it does offend me? i don't know, lol
