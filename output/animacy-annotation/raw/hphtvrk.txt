Not everything is just "psyops."

Anti vaxxers predate such nonsense.

Some people are stupid and cruel, and care nothing for others. It isn't just being "hoodwinked," which some of you think wipes away their responsibility to society to not be ignorant and evil. Guess what?


Some people are cunts, regardless of being properly educated on a topic or not. Most of these people posted here have more than enough access to scientific information in mere seconds, both for laypeople or scientists, and they CHOOSE to ignore it. Even the most manipulated people still feel curiosity, whether morbid and through fear, or just to know, what their "enemies" say, yet these freaks won't even do that.


Some people are assholes. Stop pretending the media is the only thing to blame. It's not.
