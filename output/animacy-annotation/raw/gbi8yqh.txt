I’m sorry that your mother and your family are going through this too. 

I should have written this above, but in my case my mom did not prepare or appoint anyone the power of attorney. 

Also unfortunately, my mom has been sedated and intubated for a while and it doesn’t seem like she will be out of that for a very long time. The one time I was allowed to see her, she was awake but completely unaware and under a lot of drugs. With that, I am in the dark about what she would want or any other wishes she may have about this situation. 

I am thankful to have my brother who is 19. He and I have been working through this together, and we’ve been able to be there for each other emotionally. But with me being the oldest, all of the legal and financial responsibilities still fall heavily on me more so than him. 

Thank you for your advice, I know that I am very lucky to at least have someone, and am really not alone.
