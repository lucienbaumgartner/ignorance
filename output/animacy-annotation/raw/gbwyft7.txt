I saw in the news that CIA is worried that Trump might start leaking top secret government intel in his anger about the election results. Trump apparently has leaked info before and might do it again now for either money or  favors from foreign countries. Still there apparently is the silver lining that Trump is so stupid and ignorant that when he was told top secret stuff he either did not understand it or did not care. I am really baffled that there are so many millions of people who throw their trust to this man without any thought. I am really happy that Biden won.
