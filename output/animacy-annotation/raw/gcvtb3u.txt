Eh, I think it's unfair to compare Bush to Trump.

Maybe it's the fact that Trump is so obviously vile, corrupt and ignorant that everyone else just pales in comparison.

Yes, Bush was the one who was "in charge" but I don't think he was pulling all the strings. He seemed to be more just going with the flow, while Cheney and his ilk pushed their agenda and everyone else just feigned ignorance.

And say what you will about Bush, but I don't he was malicious the way Trump is.
