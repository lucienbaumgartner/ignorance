Many homosexuals have struggled with social pressure and internalized conflict their entire lives, they probably have a disproportionate grasp on the nuances of morality, far more than the black and white that is Chris-iantity (sic). 

Transitioning individuals have a direct personal interest in educating themselves extensively in sexual biology and even neurology, psychology and sociology, so probably disproportionately experienced in the matter as well.

There is no "baby killing", this shorthand is infuriating misleading on the biological nuances of embryo growth. If you cum sperm into a toilet you aren't "flushing a trillion lives away", or if you ovulate and pass an egg you aren't "abandoning a child to death". Treating pre-development biological systems as fully fledged citizens is absurd. 

Socialism is literally built on deep, realistic understandings of the nuances of capitalist economy and what an evolution of that economy might look like in the future. Do you think monarchs didn't see democracy and capitalism as absurd chaotic messes that would never work in practice? Do you think tribal societies didn't struggle to adapt to changing social structures that encompassed larger populations? The fact of the matter is we live in a globalised society, connected by technologies and culture. We have machines and processes of automation and production that people 100 years ago couldn't fathom. Naturally our economic model should be updated, and while we're at it we should probably address the last vestiges of royalism and aristocracy that have infected our modern socio-economics.

I know this is just belligerent right wing propaganda but the assumptions are so outdated and ignorant that it hurts to look at.
