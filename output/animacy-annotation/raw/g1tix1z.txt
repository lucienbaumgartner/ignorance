I cry when i realise that despite being a highly gifted person i am also completely socially unaware and odd and i tend to mess up every friendship or relatonshiop i have/had despite not knowing what or when or how i went wrong and that makes me stop caring about my one thing that i have(academic intelligence) which leads to either stagnation or decline in my academics to the point where i dont even get any thrill anymore from anything but i still have to perform well enough to adhere to peer pressure from the people around me who expect me to perform well and so im put into a cycle of forcing myself into studying and working hard despite being in an absolute shit mood and the whaling pressure just mounts up over time and i  suddenly completely breakdown and the worst part if no one cares if/when i breakdown they just make fun of me for doing so because they think my life is so easy and f**k why did you have to go there now im going to cry
