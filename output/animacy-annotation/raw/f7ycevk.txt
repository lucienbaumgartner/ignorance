&gt;Whenever a feeling springs up in me, I say something about it. Sometimes it offends people.

Is at odds with

&gt;if something I do or say offends them, they should let me know so I can do something about it.


You are standing near me, you say "white guys are assholes" because you just had a feeling.

I say "yo bro, I'm white, it's offensive to generalize like that"

You say "Thank you for letting me know you were offended, I will amend my ways" (*because you know, you do something about it*)

Next week, you are standing near me and you have the same feeling... what do you do?

I guess the point I am making here is you're either not being honest with us or yourself or you're socially unaware and awkward.
