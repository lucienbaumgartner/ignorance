Its not an advantage at all. To players with good ping, high ping players seem unaware and very slow to react. From the perspective of a high ping player, the game is moving normally, or they rubber band around. But basically they are not seeing the real events that are happening. To a low ping player, playing against a high ping player is like having a slow time cheat on.
