Ignorant, and arrogant!  To be fair there has been a log invested in corrupting entertainment, sports, news, and education to dumb people down and obscure the truth.  So yes they could walk into a local coin shop and walk out with $1,800 today!  Well maybe tomorrow since many may be closed today being a weekend and a holiday weekend at that.  But what they don't realize is that they would be giving away something that has value for paper debt notes.  Not a good trade, and a wise investment.  Going into an "index" fund of equities shows how successful the financial industry has been in making people financially stupid.  


So there is free will, so if someone is given a chance to know the real from the fake, and they choose the fake, then there is that karma thing that they have to live with.
