I understand what she is trying to say…you’re a woman who is in to “masculinity” and women liking men = straight. But she is being very ignorant and gatekeep-y not just towards you as a bi woman with certain leanings, but the masculine women as well. Let’s reevaluate what she said to you:

Your friend telling you that you are “basically straight” for liking masculine women is like saying that masculine women are “basically men” because they aren’t…aesthetically gendernormative?

Which we all know is literally not true and as I said, not just gatekeeping bisexuality but also in a way gatekeeping the definition of a woman and that a woman has to be aesthetically a certain [feminine] way to “count” as a woman. I know I’m reading way too much in to this but that’s pretty fucked up.

You do you boo. I (23F) have only been with one person in my entire life and thats my boyfriend of 9 years. Never been with a woman and probably never will be. I am demisexual and have eyes for no one but my guy so it took me a while of analyzing my attractions and having impostor syndrome about it to realize that I *am* bi. But I am attracted to women and non-binary people and if I were not in a monogamous relationship with the love of my life then I know that I would love those people emotionally and sexually. I am bisexual. I don’t need to date every gender to know that about myself. You don’t need to be attracted to feminine women to be a bisexual woman.
