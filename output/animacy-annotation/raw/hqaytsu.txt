If you think white people say it than you are more ignorant and prone to manipulation that you realize.

Yes. Facts. I have never heard white people say it.

I don’t think I’m “fighting racism”. Not by a long shot. I just understand that it’s hurtful to people and you shouldn’t say it.

You claim it doesn’t hurt you. Fine but it hurts others. Black people clearly have self esteem issues and are dealing with a lot of self inflicted psychological trauma.

Yes I am not treating black people as a pet project like self proclaimed “allies” but as normal humans in a difficult situation. Yes putdowns hurt no matter what you look like.

And yes, I will say my opinion whenever I want and you will do nothing about it. So take that.

Have a happy new year!
