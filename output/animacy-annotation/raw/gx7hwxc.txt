I can kind of understand why your friends say to just stop with this guy, because though I hate that way of dealing with others, you can kind of see how it's deserved here. I've had friends like this before but not to that extent. If he's really flat out said those things to you and makes you feel terrible 90% of the time, you really aren't getting anything out of this friendship are you. Not that friendships are something to be cravenly exploited for what they get you, but they should be sources of comfort and support. I'm a bit older than you and I found that around 30 was when a lot of my friendships ended, mostly because I guess the fun party times of my 20's had possibly masked the fact that some of my friends were not so nice or supportive and as needs evolved over time it became more and more stressful for me to maintain those relationships. The upside here is it just seems to be just one friend of many that's the problem, one which you rarely see in person anyway. 
Have you considered not engaging with him anymore and waiting until he directly asks what's up before replying with an honest response for why you don't bother to engage with him anymore? It would of course be pretty awkward and stressful and he could react badly but equally he could just be incredibly insensitive and unaware of his rudeness?
