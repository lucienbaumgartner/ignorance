This is in fact an original thought. 80% of transgenders have been shown to have some level of narcissistic personality disorder in studies, and on top of that I have only met two individuals of the group I truly believe to be what they claim to be. The first was a gender fluid bro who I didn’t learn was gender fluid until told to call them by different pronouns *by another person*, because they, like the adult they were, didn’t give a shit what I called them, and another lady who I haven’t interacted with enough to make a judgement call, and I follow the belief of innocent until proven guilty. The other people I know is one girl who claims to be a guy who is a narcissistic habitual liar, who tried polygamy three different times and cries about what her mom said about her when she was 10 at the age of 19, and one of my middle school friends who claimed to be bisexual and now is firmly straight because he was convinced that he was bisexual by (surprise surprise) a sexual predator who took advantage of his rocky home life.

I also have this opinion because I was diagnosed with several mental issues (high functioning autism, depression, the usual shit for a guy in middle school) and was quite consistently told I was just a ‘closeted gay’ or ‘closeted trans’ because I inherited my mothers hips and was a quiet kid who disliked sports. The fact that your only response you could think up was to claim my opinion was unfounded just reinforces my negative beliefs about your political grouping, and deepens both my pity that you’re so ignorant and naive, on top of my genuine anger that you’re taking part in the mass enabling of several peoples unhealthy life habits for the simple reason of ‘they said so’
