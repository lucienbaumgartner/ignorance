So you’re defending him either lying or being so stupid and ignorant of law that he didn’t find out later that when he became our ruler that he wouldn’t be an absolute dictator. They guy only got into school because of AA, and it shows since he either has no ethics or had no basic understanding of law. Either way is bad. 

Stop defending someone that either lied or didn’t do basic research before making promises.
