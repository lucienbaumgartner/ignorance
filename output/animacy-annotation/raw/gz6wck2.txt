yes an AR 10. I was just going to get a bolt action 308 for hunting specifically. I havent been able to find any 5 round magazines for my rifle, but im also very new and unaware of the correct terms and specifics to search for so I may just be searching for the wrong terms.

I have heard that bolt action rifles are, overall, a bit more precise. And another rifle is never a bad thing I suppose haha
