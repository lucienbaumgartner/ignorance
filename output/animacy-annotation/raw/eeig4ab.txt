That's not 100% true, but sure.  The point is, you can't associate human behavior with Trump/conservatism like that.  Just because a bigot might lean towards the right doesn't mean that a conservative is necessarily a bigot.  Way too many people think in that way because of articles like this.  It's illogical and ignorant.  That was the point of my original comment.  Satisfied?
