I don't need to lay out an entirely new system to point out that, while our current one is the best developed so far, it doesn't mean that it isn't without flaws or can't be improved upon. To suggest otherwise is really only counterproductive and ignorant of reality. Capitalism is *not* perfect, and is subject to corruption and decay. 

Besides which, pointing out Capitalisms flaws or advocating for a new system isn't really my point. I am not criticizing Capitalism, but the suggestion of Communism as a viable alternative. 

I don't think proponents of reform are entirely wrong in criticizing elements of Capitalism, nor do I think their opinions invalid. I strongly disagree however, with the promotion of Communism or any other outdated system that's been proven inferior to Capitalism.

What I am suggesting is that, instead of throwing away our very good albeit flawed system away and just rolling the dice on some preexisting idea(especially one that's had such disatrous results as Communism), *serious* thought should be put into new ideas that take modern developments into consideration.
