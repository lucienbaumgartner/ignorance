USA. I'm Communist on ground level, democratic-socialist government level. Kind of a hippie. And USMC veteran. 

Our military still needs to be good.

Throughout history we can see a pattern. 

Strong nation gets uppity. 

Weak nation gets genocided by strong nation. 

I dont think for one second our military needs to have more bases around the world than there are countries. Our military shouldn't be doing what it's doing in other countries. Its imperialism and it's disgusting. 

But

If we are to let our military fall behind Russia or China it's fair to say we will be invaded genocided or become Russian/Chinese citizens. 

Saying otherwise is in my opinion is ignorant and detrimental to our survival.
