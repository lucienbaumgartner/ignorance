I do have some that would require A LOT of detail but it was mostly just the constant reference or involvement of religion in whether it's in the classroom or on the football field. The thing that really grinded my gears was just how fluidly they all worked it into everything and were so ignorant and unaware that they have no idea how they could be doing anything wrong. I'm actually an asshole for "causing a scene". It doesn't offend me when someone says they believe in God, (haha my spellcheck just capitalized God,never noticed that) but saying you DONT believe "offends" a religious person a great deal.
