I think they are legitimately trying to, but when you have that amount of people all saying different things and wanting something different it can definitely become hard to find what is actually going to improve the overall experience of the game versus what is useless and ignorant that a lot of the casual players want. Donâ€™t get me wrong I think a casual player has every right to have just as good a time as the player that lives on the game, but finding a balance so that both parties are happy is going to be damn near impossible.
