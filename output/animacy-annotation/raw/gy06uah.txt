People who didn’t experience life before social media (who were born in 2000s+), seem to be extremely naive and unaware of how robotic they sound. I don’t know if this is due to the internet being so prevalent in their lifetime and maybe they haven’t discovered their sense of self, but they’re really all the same and I keep finding that there’s nothing unique about them individually. It’s almost as if they want to all be the same.
