My top 3 right now are Tommy, Kellee, and Jason. 

Tommy is getting the textbook winner edit. Could be what it appears to be, could be a red herring.

I really liked that Kellee was shown considering the implications of another tribemate going to IotI, which I felt was missing when Vince went after Elizabeth did. If I recall correctly, she also got a pretty positive review from Rob on her way out (unlike Elizabeth or Noura who I felt were both portrayed as too impulsive there). 

I just love the Jason-Noura dichotomy. Noura is bonkers, unaware, and impulsive, whereas Jason seems to have rebounded well from his early mistakes and is more of the calm and cautious one. I’m interested in if that dynamic means anything in the long run.

Aside from maybe Elizabeth, I’m not feeling Lairo at all.
