When I saw Paul, I thought I was going to like him. Interesting look. This guy might be a player. No. I was dead wrong immediately. Probably the most disappointing player off the bat. He was annoying, unaware, and aggressive. After the fall of his buddies, he became more tolerable and he started to play the game better. Blending in and getting into the majority. Then for some reason he went back to being annoying. This whole catchphrase is fuckin moronic. Fuck this dude.
