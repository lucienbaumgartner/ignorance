wizards are too arrogant and ignorant of muggle tech to think of something like that. Only Arthur seems to respect how many ways we muggles have come up with to get around not having magic. but he doesn't understand how a bus stop works.

Wizards are aware of guns. but their description of it in Prisoner of Azkaban (remember the prime minister is told that Sirius has a gun, a kind of muggle wand...) makes me think that very few might know what it is. and of the few that do, given Arthur's ignorance, I doubt they are really aware of its power. It's probably Arthur who advised the minister to say that Sirius had a gun.
