I’ve been to Korea and have a lot of family there, and my mother is a Korean immigrant. According to her, it’s actually somewhat expected to give up your seat for certain people- namely the elderly but also for pregnant people. Obviously some people decide to be rude and not give up their seats, but it’s quite common, especially when compared to the west.

She thinks it’s rather rude and ignorant that westerners don’t give up their seats and honestly I have to agree with her on that. If pregnant woman feels that she needs to sit down because of her pregnancy than the tag system is actually a great idea. It’s all personal choice on her end. Different culture.

Edit: grammar
