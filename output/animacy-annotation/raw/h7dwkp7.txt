She sounds absolutely amazing. More often than not, in my experience, huge doggos are the nicest and/or most gentle ones. They're just big and unaware of their size. I wish I was able to have a large dog but I don't have the space for it or the physique for it... on the off chance it choose to not behave. My current dog is 30lbs and I think that's perfect because I can still carry her if she starts barking. It's the small ones with the attitude ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
