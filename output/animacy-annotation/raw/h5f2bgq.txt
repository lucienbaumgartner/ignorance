&gt;that systems can be racist in effect without being explicitly racist

This requires you to believe in unconscious bias (as a mistake or error cannot be labelled as racist since racism requires purpose behind it, an act of discrimination) which is an anti-scientific unfalsifiable theory. I cannot believe in something like that and do not believe that people are racist and unaware of it. It sets up a kafkatrap in which we get the absurdities of things like, my protestation of my not being racist means it's white fragility and I'm therefore racist. 

It takes us down a very dark path. I accept there are racists in the world, but unless you can prove it objectively then I'm going to assume they're a good a person and not racist whether intentionally or otherwise.

&gt;In terms of malevolence vs incompetence I'm not really sure thst matters.

I think it's very important. It's one of the first things we learn as a child, that the child who broke the cookie jar because they were stealing is cookie is worse than the child who accidentally broke the cookie jar while fetching something from the shelf for their mum. 

We've incorporated this concept into our law. Manslaughter is a lesser crime than murder. While the outcome may not change, it remains an important ethical delineator in moral judgement.

&gt;Cheers for the chat though, it's nice to have the argument put so straightforwardly.

Yes, thank you. I have enjoyed the chat too.
