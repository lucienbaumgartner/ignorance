Lenin and the Bolsheviks were the first successful Marxist experiment. I firmly disagree with this claim:

&gt;Lenin conned the masses so he could gain power

The masses were the ones who succeeded in the revolution. Lenin’s job was to educate and organize among the working class in order to destroy the Tsarist Russian state. It worked. And you know what? The masses didn’t care if they were being organized by “libertarian socialists”, they cared about ending the oppression of the Tsar’s rule by any means necessary. To say:

&gt;State and Revolution was a lie

is utterly foolish and ignorant of history.
