Because she's only saying this because Sunak is a Tory if he were Labour she'd be praising him. This is the same Labour party that has been found guilty of anti semitism,has called bame Tory MP's a "token n*****".

Fact is Sunaks parents worked hard to be successful and he became successful on his own merits which apparently is evil. The hate and jealousy is evident because she arrogantly assumes that the ethnic minoritiy vote belongs to only the Labour party and woe betide anybody from a ethnic minoritiy who dares have the temerity to better their lives and decided not to vote Labour.

Your whole argument that a person of colour can't be racist is utterly stupid and ignorant of reality.
