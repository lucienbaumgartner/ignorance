There's no mortgage on the property and the vendor isn't in a chain, after 'inheriting' it from an relative (transferred while alive we think) they had the property tenanted until early this year so they plead ignorance over a lot of things. Obviously it's the buyers obligation to check so this vendor is leaning on that heavily. My solicitor has basically said that it's up to me if I want to gamble on it, that getting it sorted with LR and RICS land surveyors and solicitors can be very expensive and cause rifts with neighbours, which I'd already guessed.

I didn't know about title insurance, I'll ask about it on Monday, thanks!!

I have just spoken to the neighbours and left them my email address, they seemed lovely and unaware of any discrepancy but we had kind of blindsided them so just left my details.
