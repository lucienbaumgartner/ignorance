Personally - in my opinion he was a 19th century journalist who came to his conclusions after observing social/power and financial dynamics, that profit can only be made by exploitation of labour.

I think what guys like Marx were missing was the other end of that equation. Living standards for the poor have gone up in "Capitalist" (a term I despise in its one dimensional simplicity) societies, not down. The labour theory of value doesn't take into account the synergy of production- the economy isn't a fixed pie. It is an ever expanding one under the right circumstances and arrangements. The rich are not rich at the expense of the poor *most* of the time.

The philosophy that Engels, Marx, Luise and Karl Kautsky, Luxemburg, and co. Developed is fundamentally ignorant, and poorly contrived. It views all social and economic arrangements in western society as being based off of a power struggle - with a vaguely defined oppressed class and a vaguely defined ruling class. I think it is just extraordinarily two dimensional, and ignorant of what we can observe in other sciences. 

Still,.from.epistemological point of view, I find Marxism interesting in that it was a social and political movement that did gain significant support in the early 20th century. That is a very interesting societal backlash in very poor, and authoritarian, regions of the world. I think Marxism appealed to them because if you're a farmer living subsistence - and the guy you pay rent to does fuck all and lives like a literal King - Marxism can be appealing. But it has no real appeal in advanced and specialized economies of the West.
