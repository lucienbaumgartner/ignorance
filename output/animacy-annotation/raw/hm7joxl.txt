Capitalism just means a market oriented economy, in opposition to a planned centralized economy. There are different styles of capitalism, like the extremes of little to no gov and regulation in Somalia or the large welfare state in Scandinavia. 

Someone can hold a fundamentalist religious position or be against my rights, they are entitled to their opinion, but that doesn’t make it right, it’s still factually incorrect as an opinion. Is also obviously wrong to resort to violence.

A lot of people here are very young and ignorant of what capitalism is versus socialism etc. They see capitalism as = what countries like the US has in terms of income inequality.
