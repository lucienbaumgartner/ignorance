And if anything can you at least be able to recognise what you said is racist and is rude and disrespectful? If I say “all Americans are fat and obese” that’s clearly rude and racist. Yes Americans might have a very large percentage of obese people. But it’s clearly foolish and ignorant of me to say all Americans are obese. The exact same thing can be applied here. Yes a lot of Koreans may have the same last name, ie Park. But it’s rude to say “all Koreans have the same 3 names, I will never read Korean books” because it’s clearly untrue and ignorant. Even if you do choose to say this, what kind of response are you looking for? At best, people will ignore your comment and it will leave a bad taste in their mouths. At worst, people will think you are racist because it is, in fact racist. You gain nothing by saying this. You just piss people off. Even if you don’t change your views, maybe take a moment to consider how your comments are inflammatory and rude and maybe refrain from saying these things both in real life and on the internet.
