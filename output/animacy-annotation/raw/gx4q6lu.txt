LOL no way.

History has shown us time and again the CCP treats its citizens as tools and has little regards for the life of the citizens, they've time and again put into practices where they sacrifice the life of a few for the prosperity of the party. If you think Japan having more Chinese visitors will mean the CCP won't attack Japan, not only are you awfully naive and ignorant of what the CCP is capable of, you don't even know how the Chinese people think of themselves in the tourism trap (pro-tip: they are the costumers, and the costumers are always right). 

Remember this is a party that has starved to death 40M of its own population and had incited a movement where children were killing their own parents for the cult leader, and those same children whom had actually killed their parents are now the ruling members of the party. If they can sacrifice a few tens of thousand of their own to get control over Japan, they'll do it without hesitation.
