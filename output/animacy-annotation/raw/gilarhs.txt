If you are a man it's up to you to stand out and make her day.

Too bad if you are well-mannered and learned not to bother others. Of course you also shouldn't really bother others, just a bit so they are inclined to notice you. So it's your fault anyway, too anxious and boring or too inept and unaware of social cues.
