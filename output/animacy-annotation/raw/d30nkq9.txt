The entire Jewish population of Europe in 1933 was 9.5 million, whereas the German population was 67 million. [Germany was home to about 500,000 Jews as of 1933,](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005276) which was less than 1% of the German population. I'd say its safe to assume the Jews lived in concentrated areas, meaning that the majority of Germans wouldn't know any Jewish people. 

The Germans had some idea of what was happening, but for the most part, you wouldn't really notice if 1% of your area's population was sent away, and you probably wouldn't care to find out if you were busy with your every day life. 

By the time the Nazis started their genocide, the country was busy with war, drowning in propaganda, and even if they had some idea of the genocide taking place, they didn't know to what extent it was occurring. 

And the question is still "did the general population accept it?" Well, they had been taught to hate the Jews, to think they were destroying the country, etc. But if the Nazis had just come out and said "We are planning on brutally murdering Jewish children" the population surely wouldn't have accepted it. 

So, yes, the Germans did know something was going on to some extent, possibly even knowing that some sort scale of genocide was taking place, but to say that it was accepted by the Germans is really bending reality. Most were blissfully unaware, and many more probably didn't believe the stories that were being told.

By the time the genocide was occurring, speaking out against it would have been a death sentence, or at least an extended stay at Dachau.
