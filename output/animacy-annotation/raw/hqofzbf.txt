You were! You literally brough it up not two comments ago and acted like people shouldn't buy it so they could get cosmetics.


The game isn't free, the campaign still costs money, so to reiterate my previous point, expecting fans of the series to not buy the main game and only play the free multiplayer so they can get cat ears as if that's what their issue is, is ridiculous.


It makes you seem like either a wilfully ignorant and obtuse troll who's engaging in bad faith, or an idiot.
