I’d love for a psychologist to interview a litterer and understand their reasoning, I’ve never met anyone that does it but shit is everywhere so it’s gotta be a widespread problem. Like do they have psychopathic tendencies, or just angry at the world for their own shortcomings? Or just willfully dumb and unaware of the consequences of their actions.
