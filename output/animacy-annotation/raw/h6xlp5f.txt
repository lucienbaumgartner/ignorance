Well I need to do more research on this topic, it does seem like there is a resonable correlation between extensive internet porn usage and negative effects ([this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252364943_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Published_Research_on_the_Effects_of_Pornography) meta analysis I just read was rather intriging). I still object to your use of ad hominem, and your general attidtue of projecting yourself as "above" those who choose (perhaps it isn't as of an easy choice?) to use porn, as, paraphrasing from your own assertations, are both addicted and unaware of the effects of high speed internet pornography. 

Thanks for the nuanced dissucusion though, and not falling into ad hominem or other logical fallacies too much, I appreciate a good debate, and having my viewpoints challenged.
