Thanks sweetheart :)
The girls in the room (mostly lesbians lol) and the manager, a former SW and a lesbian, were like wtf. It was homophobic and ignorant of the real dynamics of SW but it became an ongoing joke during the night. I love my brothel :)
We especially a big laugh at the end of shift as we changed from lacy girly hooker costumes to civ gear...I was wearing a heavy metal tee, flannel shirt, other girls mens sports gear etc...we'd stripped off the makeup and false lashes straight men expect and we were like, hell yeah we're a bunch of dykes :p
