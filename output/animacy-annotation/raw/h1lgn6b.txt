I'm going to give this to you straight,

This is the biggest dumbass post we've had here in weeks.

It's so ridiculously tone-deaf and ignorant, that I'm only 50% certain that you're not just trolling us.

No. There is no place like that in Montana.

And I'm fairly certain that there's no place really like that in Texas either.

But there's definitely no place fitting that description here. Not unless you've got a time machine to take you back to the 1950's-70's.
