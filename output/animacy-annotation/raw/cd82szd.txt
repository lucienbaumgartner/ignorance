Not true. You are unskilled labor and the technical knowledge you have is a jumble of data. You are at best, in most cases, Consciously Incompetent and unaware that "you know nothing Jon Snow." The *cases/examples* where I have seen some level of paid-internship exist is:

1. Accounting Major working for a Big 4 firm that will inevitably receive a CPA/Masters Degree. The rate of pay is above the market rate (near $20/hr for a Junior College student). In this example, you can do grunt work in the back office sifting through paperwork and compiling merely information. 

2. Engineering will often pay above Market rates, as my cousins work for a major Northeaster Engineering firm and did so during college for an internship. They were paid double or triple min wage, because there was value to be had. 

In the cases I've seen and read about where no money was paid either:

- the student didn't look hard enough
- chose a crappy major or employer for the internship
- chose a position that has a steep learning curve and provided no value relative to their career destination

With that said, I would work for FREE and get a SIDE job to work with an industry's TOP/BEST professionals, academics and leaders. Wouldn't you? Granted, of all internships, that is probably a small %, but if you do find it, don't quibble over pay; realive the nonpayment is an investment in yourself, your future and time *savings.*

Financial Services is a GREAT example today of the problem due to licensing and industry structure. It is an inverted pyramid, with most of the population in public financial services being 55+ and the new students entering, at best, can only bring value by being personable and professional there are STEEP barriers to entry:

- Licenses that often take 1 year+ minimum to acquire.
- Education requirements to obtain necessary certifications.
- Knowledge, that if you did not gain it during college or reading personally, you will take a long time to obtain
- EXPERIENCE, which is the biggie here, because that's what people are paying for, advice (which can only be given with enough experience and exposure)
- TRAINING; the industry has largely cut back on training because even a young trainer person, unlike an accountant, provides very little VALUE to the firm. Technical knowledge, unless you are in i-banking or a similar role, still matters minimally. 

----------------------------------

I don't agree with non-payment, but all factors matter. If you are working for free at a supermarket to get into middle management, then that's dumb. But if you are working for min. wage at a great firm, that if you get your foot in the door your pay and benefits will be 2-4x normal average wages, then it makes sense. 

On the one hand our generation is seriously exploited, on the other we are a bunch of whiney, entitled brats that ONLY want the specific dream job they had in mind so that they can continue to live the rockstar lifestyle they dreamt about when they were first pitched college. Remember, much of the MAJOR movies about college being a fun time were seen in the 90's. Prior to that it was Animal House and maybe PCU, but MANY of the shows/movies of the late 80's and 90's pitched to our generation how GREAT hs would be then how amazing college would be and finally, how life would BE AFTER college.

College was heavily marketed and still is *as a college experience,* why else would you pay 30-70k/year (work very little during summer relative to outgoing expenses) and continue to attend.
