I agree this is an so problem. I mean she sounds so delightful and all /s, but he’s doing several things that will make you miserable forever. She’s awful for saying all those things about you. (I’m a fmil and I don’t understand wanting to go on a date with my son and so. I certainly can’t see me telling him I’m going and instructing him to make her not come). But he’s telling you all those things knowing they are hurtful. Many of them you’d be naive to if he never told you. It doesn’t help relations between the two of you. But mostly, he hasn’t cut the apron strings and won’t set healthy boundaries. He probably doesn’t know what that looks like with his mom who sounds narcissistic although she may just be lonely and unaware of how awful she’s become. I’m no doctor. 

But when I chose my husband d, I made three lists:  have to have, won’t tolerate, and don’t care either way. Your fmil is on the won’t tolerate for me. And yes just ticking off one of the won’t tolerate is enough for me to move on to another guy. Good ones are out there. It helps when their mother and mine live in another state. Sometimes good old fashioned distance handles much of that by simple logistics.
