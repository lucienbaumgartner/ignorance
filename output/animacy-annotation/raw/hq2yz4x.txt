I’m not mad. Just annoyed at people like you who think they can sum up everybody’s money situation in one post. 

You are clearly ignorant and privileged. This thought experiment has been disproven multiple times. There is no nuance here. 

Just more “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” bs. 

You should really read and study more before trolling.
