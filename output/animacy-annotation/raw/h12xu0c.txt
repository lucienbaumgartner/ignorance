Media on every level is fear based now. Being afraid and ignorant of others around them makes people comfortable. Ask anyone you know why they don’t like anything and they will invariably make comments not based on any fact because they are afraid to learn anything about anything they are unfamiliar with; it scares them. “Friends” and “followers” who in truth, do not exist; are far more important to teachers and experience givers. Hate is always based in fear and ignorance. That said, turn off Reddit and go meet a new, strange, and different person!
