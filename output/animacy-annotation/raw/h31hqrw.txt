I have complicated feelings about my father, even though any “objective” tallying of his crimes would obviously point to I should hate him and feel nothing for him. Feelings don’t work that way - and yeah, that can include people who you once were deeply in love with and thought you’d spend your life together with. Nobody is a BF for having emotions, and frankly it’s cruel and ignorant of you to suggest something is wrong with OP. She isn’t “clinging” to anything; she just finds it impossible to hate and not worry over this man and his well-being. It would be understandable if she did, but it’s also understandable that she doesn’t.
