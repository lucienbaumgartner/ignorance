I don’t know much about local politics, powers or whatever, but do you think he’s running for State Senate so he could pardon Josh or have Josh’s pardoned??? 
Someone mentioned he ran to taint the jury which I thought was a total possibility. 
Or maybe he really is this self unaware and arrogant enough to pull it off.
