Your argument is negated by the simple fact that Palestinians have sought to reclaim all of Israel long before the rockets, the wars with Gaza, or for that matter the rise of Hamas. For example, the Second Intifada (in which Palestinians blew themselves up in Tel Aviv coffee shops, buses, and clubs) almost singlehandedly ended an idyllic era in this conflict (\~1991-2000) which saw few Palestinian deaths and active negotiations for their statehood. Also, when Israel withdraw from Gaza (2005), rocket attacks from Hamas/PIJ followed almost immediately.

The casualties they experience no doubt contribute to their hatred, but it is political, ethnic, and religious at its root and would continue regardless. Thinking otherwise is naive and ignorant of history.
