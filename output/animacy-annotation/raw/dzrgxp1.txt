Pyukumuku seems like an odd choice, since it lacks offensive pressure completely. In singles it can wall stuff with unaware and toxic, but in VGC it could just be double\-targetted down at the very end after everything else was gone, and toxic is way less good because fini is everywhere. Also perish trap feels like it would eat pyuku alive. Super curious what the team looks like that you have it running in. What do you use it for?
