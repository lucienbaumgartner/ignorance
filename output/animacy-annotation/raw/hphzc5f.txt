Face it buddy, you know nothing of the workings of European politics, attitutes and society. It's just another example of ignorant and arrogant Americanism projecting their own biases and instead of reading, studying and learning you are more concerned with getting into arguments with people on the internet defending absolute asinine assertions.

And now, instead of picking up a book or even reading Wikipedia, you are going to come back with another little comment that betrays that you are probably a teenage or slightly older American kid.
