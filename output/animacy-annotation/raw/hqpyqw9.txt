I don’t get this! It happens to me all the time too. Even if I’m dressed NOTHING like the store uniform. 

It happened to me once in ikea and I was wearing my winter coat!! We all know how bright yellow those shirts are. And then the woman actually had the audacity to ask me what I was doing there if I didn’t work there. Like wtf?? 

Surprisingly I didn’t say anything. I didn’t even think she was worth my time or energy, I found her so ignorant and stupid. She was with a middle eastern guy though and I just looked at him like, really, this is who you’re building your life with??
