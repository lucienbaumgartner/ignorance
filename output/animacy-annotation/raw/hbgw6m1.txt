I cba to measure it often when flaccid, but when I measured last time in winter I was 5.5” flaccid and unaware of bulging (or at least my level of bulging) not being normal, so you can imagine why I stopped wearing sweatpants to work and avoid wearing them at the gym, but unfortunately it’s becoming a necessity. 

I was given the nickname “big balls” because you could apparently see my ball(s), nope that was just my flaccid rick being suffocated by clothes.

Depends on the time and place, can imagine some people get groped because after all if it looks like an erection you must be sexually attracted! (/s)
