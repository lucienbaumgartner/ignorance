a 2007 5series with 145k miles was my first BMW. It wasn't a mistake, because it made me fall in love with the car. It drove &amp; felt better still than most new cars. However, it was leaking oil drastically. I was unaware and unable to deal. The real issue was the oil leaked down on to the  water pump and took it out - causing the car to start overheating. So, just be mindful of that. Replace the leaking gaskets.
