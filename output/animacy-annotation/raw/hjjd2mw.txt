Another non-argument? 

You're strawmanning the positions of how many people now, instead of just one?

If you're directing any of these weird suggests at me-

I fought for these rights since 06 in the form of fighting for SOGIESC minority rights in medicine, including fight to end medically unecessary procedures on intersex kids and more. Also fought for the right for chronically and terminally ill and disabled people to choose physician-assisted suicide. We won most times and we didn't usually ask about anyone's other politics in the demonstrations and organizing action spaces, as we were momentarily united over action that was needed. Every debate has its place.

I'm afraid I'm seeing a bunch of neolibs and neocons referring to neoliberals as "leftists" these days and it's made a mess of all the partisan lines. There's only pro-authoritarian and anti-authoritarian where the rubber meets the road, now.

And I'm quite bothered by the fact that people who were politically unaware and quiet a few years ago are now politically unaware and loud as shit about the intersection of government policy, technology and medical ethics. They're the particularly dangerous ones, in my opinion, not those folks who turn out in numbers to protest mandatory dress codes.
