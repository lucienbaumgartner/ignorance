The issue is you just keep repeating that you disagree without ever substantively addressing any of the points.

I mean, you're certainly entitled to your opinion, but I was kind of hoping to engage more seriously with actual counterarguments.  It was clear you disagreed from the beginning.  Problem is, whenever you're pressed, you keep refusing to provide anything more than that one equivocation.

Not every opinion is equally valid, my man, and all you've done is repeatedly tell us what your opinion is, not why it's more or less valid than an opposing position.

This wouldn't be so bad if we were talking about what our favorite colors were, but in reality, we're talking about something for which there have been a myriad of strong arguments presented for one position.  To argue against these, you've just repeatedly stated that you disagree with them without ever even addressing them.

Idk what to call that other than unreasonable or dishonest.  If you've got suggestions, I'd love to hear what to call someone who flatly refuses to engage in any counterarguments.  Stubbornly unreasonable?  Is that better?

&gt; I understand what they are saying.

Literally nothing you've written suggests that, but okay, lol.  Maybe if you had at least addressed *one argument* that Sheth makes, I'd buy that, but confusing the premise and conclusion of an argument you said you "evaluated" just doesn't add up to the conclusion that you "understand what they are saying."  

If you've got something more substantive, I'd love to hear it, but barring that, the position you presented is so unsubstantiated and ignorant that it's hard to justify taking it as anything other than a bad joke that's gone on for far too long.

also inb4 you ask who Sheth is, lmfao
