How often does it happen and missionaries really don't savvy what the research is for or about?  Missionaries are mostly people absorbed in the "gospel" (meaning, the Mormon version of it) and are sold that it's the ONLY answer.  They don't understand any other alternative.  

It's disturbing to me that OP's BIL finds it "annoying" that this investigator is vetting Mormon claims.  These missionaries are so entitled and ignorant that their religion is bogus!  Heaven forbid someone defend the truth by calling the Mormon church on its bullshit.
