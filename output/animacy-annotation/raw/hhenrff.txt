&gt; I can be sure of that when I clearly see that the points are being made while providing no evidence whatsoever 

A lack of evidence does not render something false.

&gt; ....or when the arguments are hinging on an improper understanding of mathematics, physics, engineering etc.

Alternatively, *you* could be misunderstanding something.

You seem to not have very strict epistemology, in part due to a lack of understanding.

&gt; And I addressed the irony of my arguments being baseless a bit later as well.

Sure, and then followed it up with more opinions stated in the form of facts.


&gt;&gt; Are you under the impression that a theory is only useful if it is testable?

&gt; For discovering physical laws and gaining knowledge about the universe, yes.

Can you find some authoritative citation that supports this belief?


&gt;&gt; a) Can you show your calculations?

&gt; Sure! What would you like me to calculate?

"...because untested theories are not much different than religion."

What attribute(s) did you examine in your comparison calculation?  (Let me guess: you didn't actually do one, yet you somehow know the correct answer?)

&gt; Can you show your calculations?

I can (and do) imagine many untested theories, without believing they are true.  

You also imagine untested theories, but seem to not be able to resist believing they are true.  


&gt;&gt; But nowadays **philosophy is not a tool that you would use to discover truths about the universe** because we have a better tool for that specific purpose - science.

&gt;&gt; Science can do all that philosophy can, and more? If so, please post a citation.

&gt; No, that's not what I said. I said that science is a better tool for discovering how the universe works than philosophy. I never argued that science does everything that philosophy does, just better. I'm sure there are areas of philosophy that science doesn't cover and vice-versa.

You said: "philosophy is not a tool that you would use to discover truths about the universe".  Any truth is *about the universe* (or the contents of), is it not?


&gt;&gt; b) When using logic, is there anything else one should be mindful of?

&gt; Nitpicking.

Unskilled and unaware of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...science values experiment and proof above all whereas **philosophy pretty much exists in a vacuum and any proof is just more philosophy and fancy words**.

&gt;&gt; A citation for this as well please.

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy

Can you note which article contains this: "philosophy pretty much exists in a vacuum and **any proof is just more philosophy and fancy words**"


&gt;&gt; I suspect the root cause of your problem is the illusory nature of human consciousness (the sense of omniscience that accompanies it, for example).

&gt; And here I thought we could have a proper conversation, but no, just nitpicking my arguments for the sake of disagreeing instead of helping me understand your point. What a waste of time.

Demonstrating the accuracy of my claim.
