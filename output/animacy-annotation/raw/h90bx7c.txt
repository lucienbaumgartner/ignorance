&gt; one shotting PVE content 

*laughs in Lost Belts fights* lmao my dude if you don’t play FGO then don’t say anything about the game’s difficulty. Demeter (a story mode boss) could literally wipe out an entire whaled out meta party in 3 turns but could still be defeated by a full 1 star party. Saying powercreep ruined FGO’s pve is so ridiculous absurd and ignorant that it’s almost isn’t funny.

Powercreep isn’t the devil, it can be handled well if the devs put some effort into buffing old characters instead of gimping new characters. 

Also, Genshin already has something like that, Kazuha could literally wipe out an entire pack of mobs by himself in 1 skill, hell Sucrose could do that, a DPS like Xiao or Eula could take out a boss in 5 seconds with the correct supports. The only challenging content in Genshin is the Abyss, which Yomiya objectively sucks hard at because she’s single target instead of AOE.
