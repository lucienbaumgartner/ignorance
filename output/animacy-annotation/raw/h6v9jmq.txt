Nobody should be cold calling or following up with potential employers! That automatically gets you put on the "annoying and unaware of professional norms- do not interview" list at most functional workplaces. At that point you're selecting for places that value pushiness over competence, and unless you're in sales that's not gonna be a great environment.
