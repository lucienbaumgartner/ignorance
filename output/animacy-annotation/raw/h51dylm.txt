At the risk of going against the grain of most of the comments on this thread:

It /is/ important to try to be, if not an 'optimistic pessimist', at least a realist. What I mean by that is, yes, 100%, bringing a child into this world right now requires one to be selfish, vain and ignorant of how fucked things actually are.

But... you have to do your best to stay mentally and physically healthy. We don't have much time left before the US descends into widespread famine, martial law and general societal collapse, but it is important to try and find meaning in life, try and enjoy what still can be enjoyed responsibly.
