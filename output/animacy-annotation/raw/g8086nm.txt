Imagine being so young and ignorant that you somehow think pointing out that the US helped build modern Russia means I yearn for the cold war.

And if the US didn't want to have a cold war they probably shouldn't have [negotiated a separate peace with the nazis behind their wartime ally's backs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sunrise_(World_War_II\)) or maybe they shouldn't have made a secret plan to [invade the USSR with the help of nazi war criminals they saved from facing justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable) or maybe they [shouldn't have protected and funded fascists and used them as a reserve anti-communist force that also committed terrorism against anyone even slightly too far left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio) 

The USA has been fucking with Russia since their [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War), there is nothing ignorant about correctly pointing out many if not most of the US's foreign problems are a direct result of their own foreign policy coming back to bite them in the ass.
