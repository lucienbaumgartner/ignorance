&gt;Yeah, you may have time for this, I certainly don’t. This debate has inflated to way too many topics for me to address, so I will have to pick and choose.

Yes, bodily rights can be "inflated" and complicated. The fact that you admitted "you don't have time for this" literally shows your refusal to be educated about the topic and why your PL belief, and the PL community as a whole is ignorant and wrong about the abortion topic. Your facile understanding of bodily rights is why you think an unwanted pregnancy does not apply to bodily rights; or at least, bodily rights can be suspended in favor of abortion restrictions.  


&gt;UN Declarations, etc., that every declaration of rights is a work in progress.

How so? When was the last time the UDHR been changed/updated? Has it *ever* been changed or updated? When has *any* Human Rights been changed or updated? Is Human Rights something that is *objective?* Or *subjective?* I'm pretty sure they're subjective. So if you want people to be and/or become PL, you need provide compelling enough reasons.  


&gt;That the UN as a body doesn’t accept a particular position is a fallacious appeal to authority.

Of course. Just as it would be a fallacious appeal to authority had I used the US's Constitution, or any other countries Constitution for that matter. The UDHR is a baseline for human rights, so might as well use the baseline as an example, right?  


&gt;To the extent that the UN as a body wishes to protect abortion rights, my argument is that they are wrong.

So by all means, explain and justify how they are wrong. PL'ers have been trying to do it for over 70 years now, and have continually failed to do so.  


&gt;I reject this statement. I do not believe that a pregnant person’s right to bodily integrity always supersedes the right to life of the fetus inside.

Then feel free to justify this position. It's a universally held belief that you are the sole owner of your body and that no one has rights to it. You'd have to make a pretty convincing argument as to why someone should lose their bodily rights over a fetus.  


&gt;You are simply stating your conclusion without supporting it. You are making a fundamental assumption, one that I and millions of other people disagree with.

This is an **extremely** disrespectful comment, as **ALL** of my responses to you, **ESPECIALLY my last one** (including all of the sources contained within*)*, have supported that position. In fact, one of my sources **specifically stated, and supported** that the rights of the pregnant person supersedes the fetuses rights**:** [https://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/international/volume22n1/documents/163-188.pdf](https://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/international/volume22n1/documents/163-188.pdf)

Your comment shows that you are not actually reading my comments, nor reading my sources; as I have extensively defended that position. In fact, a fetuses rights aren't even being superseded. A fetus doesn't have the right to be inside someone else. Woman do not share bodily rights with other people.
