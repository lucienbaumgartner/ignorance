What I see from some people who are 'interested in science' is the Christian reverence and will to submit to some force that is seemingly greater than them (possibly because I live in a Christian part of the world..?).

Many of them are actually harmed by the 'natural order of things' but they still revere the 'circle of life'. They are scared and ignorant of many things around them, but they still repeat, over and over, phrases such as 'the miracle of life' or 'we are space-dust'.

Arguably, we are 'made' to try and be happy, so many of these people are frightened by the indifference of the Universe and the coldness of our contemporary world, so they find some warmth in these abstract ideas; such that life has 'progressed, and humans are the pinnacle' so that is why we should 'protect &amp; nourish the nature that created us'. Unfortunately, that same nature has so many ways of hurting them.... so they've now found some escapism in the dream of space-colonization.
