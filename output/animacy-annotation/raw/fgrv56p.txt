You have trashed on almost every single person’s vent on this subreddit that they are lazy slackers. I’m 100% convinced you are one of those ASMs who hides in the office while playing on their phone, while convinced that making your CSA and SFLs reset the seasonal aisle is more important than helping your pharmacy staff fill patient’s life saving medications! (Making FE do stuff makes you look like YOU did something)

I wish my job as as easy as yours, or that I was so short sighted and ignorant that I’d think a pharmacy falling that far behind was because the techs/pharmacists  are” lazy”, instead of being incredibly and unsafely understaffed.  I’m sure not having Valentine’s Day candy up is equally as catastrophic to people’s lives. 

I’d hate to work for you, you’re gross.   Also, lmao if you think the pharmacy isn’t the reason you get a paycheck. You think front end makes the money?  Let’s be real, here.
