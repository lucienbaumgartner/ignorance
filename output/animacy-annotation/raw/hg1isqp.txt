His argument was both stupid and ignorant of the very basic meaning of being trans.  "Gender is a fact." Yeah dumbass, every transwoman will tell you it's a fact that they are a woman.  But this is the smooth brain take that how a person feels is just a choice that can easily be discarded and replaced like articles of clothing.  Fascist adjacent conservatives used to think this way about homosexuality but I think most rightwingers have wised up at least marginally on that issue, or at least need to pretend as such to save face.
