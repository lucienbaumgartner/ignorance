&gt;I do not live in the country....lol. I live downtown in the major city.

My bad, I had you mistaken for someone who claimed to live in the country and not having to wait 30 minutes for cops to arrive. 

&gt; Rush Limbaugh someone who's never held public office is responsible for the divide in the country lol. You're giving a crazy guy in the radio a little too much power. I have a pretty large group of conservative friends and none of us have ever listened to rush. something tells me it's not Rush Limbaugh that divided our country lol.

Yeah, Rush has had a major influence on political discourse. This isn't a controversial statement. Politicians looked to him for advice. Talk about someone being naive and ignorant of the world. 

&gt;I went to my first Turkey Shoot when I was 8. I know my way around a firearm. 

&gt;The people who are shot didn't have to be armed but somebody in the general area would probably be armed if it was allowed.

Sure worked out at the Wal-Mart in Texas. Where were the good guys with a gun then? Surely you would expect a Texas Wal-Mart to be full of gun-toting American "Patriots".

&gt;I presented you a situation where I had a firearm and you did not. For some reason you are avoiding continuing our little thought experiment where I take everything you own and you are completely helpless.

You haven't provided enough information for me to make a decision. Am I looking at a glock or rifle?
