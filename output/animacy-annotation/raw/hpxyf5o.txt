Except if she apologizes to Saitama and admits how arrogant and ignorant and blinded by power she was, and Saitama forgives her, then and only then, it would be ok.
But for now, she did absolutely ugly deeds that cannot be forgotten, like what if Saitama was a regular human would she cut his throat? It feels surreal that it feels out of character.
