I'm sorry I triggered you broðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

&gt; 100% irrelevant to anything.

Well it's not really irrelevant because I'm comparing the thought process of a human in contrast to a dog.

And yes I understand I'm anthropomorzing a dog...that's the point, I'm not deny that I am. I'm comparing it to my own thinking and the thinking of other people.

&gt;It's not a matter of psychology. It's a matter of anthropology. 

Psychology can be and is part of anthropology 



What's so misleading about saying humans dont eat their loved one? Majority of humans dont eat their loved ones thats a fact, in majority of countries and cultures eating your loved ones or your pets is not condoned. Theres a reason why people in America freak out about eating dogs but its not a big deal in China, similar reason why a lot of people dont eat beef in many indian cultures but it's fine everywhere else because cows are seen as pets. Yes there are big differences in all cultures from around the world but from a mathematical perspective its not misleading to say humans dont eat their loved ones. Cannibalism is taboo in nearly every culture to deny that is extremely misleading and ignorant of yourself.

And when I say we have evolved to not eat humans it's not from a context of that we gained an evolutionary advantage from not eating humans, but that the ones that did suffered and so humans today dont eat other. Being killed off by parasites and not being able to reproduce allowing other humans who dont part take in that activity to reproduce and pass down the characteristic and behaviour of not eating humans is still a form of evolution. However its not only just parasites and disease cannibalism leads to other problems within society which can lead to the collapse of the civilisation, these can be behavioural changes too its much more complex and does not just come down to brain parasites.
