Yep; almost as if bitching about safety precautions put in place while spouting horseshit about physical misconceptions is an inherently ignorant thing to do on an open platform where you can be proven so easily wrong by just looking shit up and thinking.

They have Asperger's according to their post history, so hopefully they can be around people with better values who don't think seatbelts are stupid like some moron from the 1970s. They (being the seatbelt-ignorant) were stupid and ignorant of risks then, and are doubly so now. I don't understand how pig-headed a stupid hick must be to think they know more about physics than those who design the safety precautions in cars for a living. It's just total arrogance.
