Some of the takes on here are so childish and ignorant that I can’t believe how some people can believe such things. Luka singlehandedly kept the Mavs alive against the Clippers until PG and Kawhi had enough. Yes, if Luka shoots 5/23 the Mavs are so fucked. 

Reddit is fucking shit. Y’all don’t have the right to shit on any other social media platform, including Twitter. There are way too many trolls and low IQ takes on this site.
