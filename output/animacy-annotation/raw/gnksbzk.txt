It's been 5 years for me and I still check her social media every once in a while. For months, I would not think of her and suddenly, without any warning, something insignificant triggers it and I start reminiscing. In these moments, I'm just blinded by anger. I need to know that she is not doing good in her life. I need to know that some higher forces in the universe exist and that they are punishing her somehow. I often think of her and how she's probably going about her life, unaware and oblivious to the pain she's caused, that years after I am still in pain and she probably hasn't given it a minute's thought in years. I am so angry in these moments. Checking her social media is a way of exorcising these thoughts. I know it's bad but I don't have any other coping mechanism.
