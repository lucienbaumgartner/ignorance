if she takes this as good advice and lets someone teach her properly 
about it, the outcome for her would be positive, it would help her in life, dont you agree?
so id say if the outcome is positive, then most likely he meant good with it.

and if we are to play the judge already, how about innocent until proven guilty? give the poor guy a break. he cant even defend himself here because he doesnt know this is happening.
and it doesnt sound thaaaat bad even from her side already.

she already admits that she is really bad at her makeup right now, and they know each other for a long time already... after 2 years, he doesnt seem exactly like the most pushy, persistent and superficial guy in the world, does he?
its about time she learns this with 20 years anyway, come on. he is not all wrong?

they should just help each other and be a good team together.
maybe he just wasnt sensitive and careful enough and unaware that hes walking on very thin ice when starting this topic with a woman... ;)
