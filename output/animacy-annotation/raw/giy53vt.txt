&gt;No one expects Mayoral candidates (or most political candidates) to be living like peasants. American politics, unfortunately, tend to favor the rich to have the means to run. The expectation, however, is that they're not dumb enough to say things out loud during a campaign interview that will make them sound like they're ignorant and unaware of their constituents' problems, which is what people are criticizing this quote to sound like.

The expectation also is that an NYC Mayor should be, y'know, an NYC resident, not a [New Paltz resident](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/01/08/as-covid-19-surged-mayoral-hopeful-andrew-yang-took-up-part-time-residence-outside-nyc-1353859).

And going to the issue of being "in touch", there are ways to do that even if you're super-rich. No one's saying a billionaire ought to rent a basement apartment with 3 random roommates in order to run for Mayor, but [Bloomberg, for instance, made a point of riding the subway to work](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html).
