I wanted to really not see Billie's side, but I do. Katie could have just said "I'm sorry. I was unaware and insensitive of your feelings in this situation. Please understand I didnt intentionally leave you out," but instead she just plays victim. This was cis-privledge. Not because the girls were being transphobic, but because they refused to sympathize with how Billie might have felt due to pervious experiences. Katie does get to pull the fat card all the time. Does this count as appropriation, because Katie isnt even fat?
