My boyfriend is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met and he just has his GED and struggles to read due to dyslexia. My son is another super intelligent person and is failing a ton of classes and ready to drop out. Another highly intelligent person I know has 2 masters degrees, 1 in biology and the other in chemistry, and is teaching while she works on her PhD. I am generally ignorant and stupid as hell and was on honor roll in HS, had a 4.0 in college and while no degree went for 4 years (I had issues and had to drop out). I can also write stupid bullshit super eloquently ðŸ¤£
