You don't seem to understand that qualifying pace != race pace. 

Also Max put in an absolutely mega lap on the limit prior to his mistake in sector 3. 

You say "Lewis is fast" as if the car isn't doing 95% of the work. The unfortunate reality is that engineering discrepancies between teams is vastly more impactful to the outcome of races than driver skill. I'm not saying Lewis isn't an elite driver. He absolutely is one of the best formula 1 drivers of all time. That said, the discussion going into this last race with the point total currently tied seems to have a lot of fans completely ignorant and unaware of the absolutely massive advantage Mercedes / Lewis have in the car itself. I went hard on you, because of your double purple sectors comment.
