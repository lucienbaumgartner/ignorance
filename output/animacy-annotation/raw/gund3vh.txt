Dude you have been brainwashed to take a trio of awkward situations and assign a label to them that victimizes women and antagonizes you.

By all means ask for verbal consent in every single instance but don't kid yourself that women are stupid and unaware of the context of situations that you're in. The worst instance of any of these is the first one where the girl said 'no' several times and it took you forty minutes of laying in the dark to realize she wasn't into it.

Were you *assaulting* her? Nah. Get off your high horse.
