That's completely divorcing each group from their appropriate context and history to make them comparable or equal.

Black Americans discuss black pride because they are generally unable due to tie their heritage or culture to a specific nation or ancestry *as a direct consequence of chattel slavery.* Even after slavery ended, American culture has minimized, dismissed or demonized  Black American culture as being anything from low brow and uncouth to inherently criminal. BLM stating the obvious that black lives matter is in response to a systemic issue where black lives are consistently devalued. Standing up and saying, black lives matter *too* shouldn't be controversial, but it is. BLM is a counter reaction to the dismissal of Black Americans being othered by mainstream American culture and society.

White American culture almost completely lacks any similar context. It's disingenuous because white Americans didn't have a systematic erasure of their culture or identity as a result of coming to America to the point where the only thing left to point to is a continent and poorly preserved anthropological data. No one is saying that you *can't* be a proud Irish American or Greek American, and there has been very vocal discussion of how various white European ethnic groups or nationalities were marginalized by American culture for years. Furthermore, crediting American success as a product of "European culture," a nonsensical and nonexistent thing at least, is intellectually dishonest in its treatment of how America was established, how it developed, and how it came to be so influential (oftentimes overestimated as such).

Honestly, it just comes across as being selfish and ignorant that when whiteness isn't being centered or is turned off from being the default that racists like IE have to redirect the narrative to their whiteness, that isn't disparaged just by mentioning that other people's lived experiences as a result of being not white.
