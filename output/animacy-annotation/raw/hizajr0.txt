Yet this plan wouldn't work because there isn't really fuck with proof material, many homeless people are severely mentally ill, many homeless people will bring in drugs and make it a very dangerous environment, etc. The real root of the issue is the mental illness and drugs, both of which we don't really know how to solve. Especially the drugs since that also hampers work ability and increases probability of people stealing.

Obviously not all homeless people are like this, but some 80%~ of the long term homeless are, maybe more with drug use because that's just the mental illness stat. The issue is the broad strokes plans are all entirely unrealistic and ignorant of the reasons this happens in the first place. Like it or not there's no excuse for long term homelessness in the US. If it's happening to someone then "here's house" won't solve anything
