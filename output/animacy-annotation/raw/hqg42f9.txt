&gt; so are they making money fleecing the flock or not?

Please don't change the subject. It just makes you look like you're evading.

&gt;Staying in alpha and selling jpegs brings in the money. 

In nine years they have brought in a little more than half of Fallout 4's sales from its opening day alone. Do you understand anything about which number is bigger than the other...? Even something comparable to the average Quantic Dream release would beat their best 30-month period. 

Your argument will never be anything but ignorant and stupid. You could at least be somewhat ashamed to have to double down on it.
