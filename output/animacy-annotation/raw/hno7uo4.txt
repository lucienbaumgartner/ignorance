Not true at all and if that’s how you perceived what she said maybe you’re ignorant. Sorry not trying to be argumentative but if a black person says “I just wanna be a good role model and make it to top 3 so I can show black kids they can make it too” as “I should win cuz I’m black” you have a narrow mind and need to reevaluate. Again not trying to argue but you sound very privileged and unaware of the world by what you’re saying rn
