**"Present data suggest that apparent hypothalamic hypothyroidism occurs perhaps as an adaptation to prolonged starvation"**

The specific number of calories are relative to each individual. 

&gt; as a smaller person, you legitimately don’t need as many calories.

It's not an opinion. You know that right? Just because you feel like you only need 900 calories, doesn't mean that's true. This is an eating disorder. 1200 is the minimum needed for an elderly short thin sedentary woman in coma for her vital organs to keep running. What makes you think 1200 is enough for a healthy active woman?

&gt;I am a smaller person (TDEE ~1500) and need to lose about 25 pounds to get back to where my body felt best and I felt confident in it.

At 5'3 110lbs (which I am assuming is close to your goal weight), your TDEE is just shy of 1500 calories *sedentary*. This means your body needs 1500 calories if you were to lay in bed all day. 1200 is malnutrition. Eating 1200 calories to create a "300 calorie deficit" is incorrect thinking, it's incorrect perspective, and it's incorrect behavior. You should be eating between 1500-1600 calories AND exercise. Go on two 30 minute walks per day. Hit 10k steps. Then the 25lbs will come off effortlessly. You won't be losing 1lb per week, *but you're not supposed to*. That's the point. You don't have that kind of wiggle room to cut food so little.

**A 4'8 85lb sedentary female has a TDEE of 1210 calories**. You are not 4'8, you are not 85lbs. You are 5'3 and the TDEE if you weighed 110lbs would be 1500 calories. That is nowhere close to 1200 calories. How do you not understand this very basic math?


&gt;I would say thought that it really isn’t that hard to get all the nutrients that you need into that amount of calories

LOL, have you even seen some of the full day of eating posts? Just run them into cronometer. **None of them even meet 1/2 the MINIMUM daily vitamin/mineral requirements**. None. Most of them are filled with pre-packaged junk that is void of any substantial nutrition. 

It's actually astonishing how eating disorders make people so unaware and completely delusional. It's your life kid. If you want to fuck up your metabolism go right ahead.
