To think that everyone can live their best life under laissez-faire capitalism, youd have to be pretty ignorant of the reality of working people. You cant live your best life as you see fit when your homeless or living paycheck to paycheck. To be a libertarian, you need to be wealthy and ignorant of the lives of others, or wealthy and accept that your politics benefit you more than they would most people because "Fuck you i got mine"
