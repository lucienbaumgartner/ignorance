I suppose due to PMO you were unmindful and unaware of your surroundings (foggy headedness) I find when I'm off PMO that I'm just way more aware of things going on around me. 

You should look up some writing classes, you really got to learn how to tie the meaning of the story (PMO being bad) to what happened and why it happened. I think a lot of people are confused because it is very poorly written

WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY and HOW. is something they taught me in writing class and it works really well.
