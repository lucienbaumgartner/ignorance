This makes zero sense. Take off your tinfoil hat. “We” don’t know all the things you claim “we” know. Logic does not say as there are fewer players, MM should run faster. Fewer players means it’s harder to make teams. 

Ask yourself this, what incentive does Wargaming have to intentionally create lopsided matchups? There’s none. If anything, they’d want more competitive matchups. 

As another commenter pointed out algorithms ≠ AI. Your inability to recognize this and wrongly try to make the association suggests you have no idea what you’re talking about. Read up on “unskilled and unaware of it”. 

I haven’t noticed any change in the frequency of lopsided wins. If they are, then it’s a sign the game has become “brittle” where a small advantage gained by one team leads to total destruction of the other team. This indicates that players are getting better. If you’re seeing more than your fair share of lopsided losses then the problem is more than likely found by looking in a mirror. 

Bottom line: stop blaming MM for your poor play.
