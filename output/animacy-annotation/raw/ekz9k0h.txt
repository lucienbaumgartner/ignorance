&gt;I am unaware and possible ignorant here, i suppose. I am under the understanding that it is an incentives package on future tax revenue. 


You are ignorant. Please look at my other posts.  I cite the .gov publications that have this info.

&gt;not if we get nothing and they go somewhere else, which is a possibility. 

This exact fear is what large companies preyy

&gt;its pretty clear, you just refuse to respond, but to dumb it down even more...would you rather have 6$ or 10$ more tomorrow than you have today. If you choose 10$ there is a chance you get nothing...if you choose 6$ its guaranteed. you are choosing 10$ with a chance at nothing.

If we were guaranteed to get the $6, your argument holds. We aren't. Amazon didn't say "give us x, or we walk" .  So, you gave the choice of maybe getting 10 vs. maybe getting 6.
