Comparing the traditional snipping off of a little extra skin on the penis (on infants who are blissfully unaware and indifferent) which doesn't affect the pleasure or functionality of sex, to the forced removal of the clitoris off of girls of various ages, permanently preventing them from ever feeling genital pleasure ... why do you even bother posting,  making that stupid ass comparison
