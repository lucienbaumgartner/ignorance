Lol he plays centre mid for us far more often than he does defensive midfield, because he's tactically unaware and positionally poor, but with such extensive youtube experience you would know this, right? I'm sorry if I insulted your fancy, but to bring up a comment from months ago to try and justify your complete try hard post here is beyond funny.

Have you ever even been to see a football, sorry soccer, match?
