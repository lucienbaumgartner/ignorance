If we're talking Harry Potter, I'd say Snape. 

Bullied as a kid, the love of his life runs off with one of the guys who bullied him, then gets herself killed. Those he tries to protect are completely unaware and ungrateful, he is distrusted by both sides, and he ends up getting killed because of a complete misunderstanding.
