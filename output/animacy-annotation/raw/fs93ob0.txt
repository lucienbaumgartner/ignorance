I just don’t get how people are so ignorant

Like put every other thing about this case aside for a moment and just think about what he said. “If you can talk, you can breathe.”

Has this man never heard of exhaling? Does he speak while inhaling like Jack Black? Has he never read The Crucible? Has he never heard about people in giant mobs that suffocate from the pressure of everyone pushing on them?

Like the statement, at its most fundamental level, is so clueless and ignorant that I’m shocked this man isn’t ashamed for his own stupidity, but he’s probably just too stupid to feel shame.
