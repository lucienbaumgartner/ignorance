A lot of the wellness community is really about the rejection of "mainstream" science and science-based medicine. Just like the Q community rejects science and academia as  corrupt institutions used by elites to somehow oppress good people.  There is a lot of crossover appeal for these types, the belief that there is a conspiracy of Illuminati and whatever to keep people oppressed and ignorant of flat earth and satanic child slavery echoes the "Big-Pharma and mainstream medicine to keep people sick" belief.
