Heinlein's mysogyny is so beyond the pale that I could hardly believe it was real and not a terrible satire when I tried to read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. He writes a caricature of gender that's so childish, unaware, and blatantly foolish that it almost makes me pity him... but not as much as I pity all the poor women who had to interact with him during his life.
