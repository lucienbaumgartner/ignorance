No me neither, shame we haven't got a real stand-out youth player we could promote at cb for next season. Hoever arrived with a big reputation but is still only 17. Van Den Berg is the same story, so they both need a lot more time to be bedded in.

And I'm not sure Nathaniel Phillips will ever be that player. Don't want to write the lad off at 22, but for me he really struggled the other night against Everton, seemed positionally unaware and unsure in his tackles, either standing off too much or racing in at the wrong time. Might have been nerves but when you consider Gomez is the same age (can't believe that lad is 22)
