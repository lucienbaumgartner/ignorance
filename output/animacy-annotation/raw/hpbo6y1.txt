This is EXACTLY how I honestly left the movie, and the only thing I’ll call myself dumb over is that yes, I should have been aware that Feige and Co. obviously had been planning this for a while and my assumptions that they had been making “mistakes” were ignorant and ridiculous. That being said, present were all the emotions I felt for him watching this movie were all there, having felt super sad. But am I supposed to say I’m not happy? “I hope you’re happy he’s with no family and friends now.” That’s what’ll make for such a great next trilogy, and that’s what made this movie so amazing. That’s what we’re supposed to be seeing and feeling as viewers, and problems and tragedies are the core of good films, and narrative stories in general. Sure, a plucky light hearted movie full of action and adventure can work for a one off sort of thing, but yeah, I will shamelessly say that this is what this character NEEDED.
