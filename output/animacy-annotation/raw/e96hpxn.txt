But the Democrats aren't actually against the Republicans.

They need them. They need to stand next to a slightly more overtly shitty party to frame themselves as the good guy and keep the system running after the Republicans get their turn at power and make a huge power grab. 

They worry about Trump because he's so privileged and ignorant that he's going to break the balance. Why do you think Michelle Obama is rehabilitating that old war criminal George W. They miss the good old days
