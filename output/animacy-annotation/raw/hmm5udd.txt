&gt;People who find German stuff from WW1 and WW2 more interesting than American stuff from WW1 and WW2 I’ll never understand. Their equipment, tactics, leadership, etc. was worse almost across the board. And they lost. I can understand the war trophy thing but that’s not why people get into it.

Lol, none of this is true. WW1 Germany developed small unit tactics, decentralized command structures, defense in depth tactics, the first inklings of special forces tactics and training, the first widely fielded man portable automatic weapons (smgs, pdws, and lmgs), the first to widely field helmets (with the stahlhelm design still in use today), the leaders in development of aircraft technology and tactics, the leaders in development of submarine technology and tactics, and I could go on.

WW1 America was literally using Spanish American War tactics once they entered the conflict. They had to borrow equipment from the French and copy equipment from the British. Their main infantry rifle was a copy of the German Mauser - Springfield even had to pay royalties to Mauser. They never developed anything technologically significant that was used in the war and most of their cool designs were developed after the conflict was largely decided and were never widely fielded.

You have a case for WW2, but I don't think you really have any idea what you are talking about with regards to WW1 as Germany outclassed America in basically every single metric and area of expertise, especially when taking into account the lack of raw materials the Germans had compared to America. Look at the casualty numbers of the Americans in relation to the British or French after they entered the war. To say the Americans had superior tactics and equipment to anyone else in the conflict is false and ignorant of history.

Really, the fact that you lump Imperial Germany in with the Nazis shows your knowledge about pre-Weimar Germany - it's non-existent.
