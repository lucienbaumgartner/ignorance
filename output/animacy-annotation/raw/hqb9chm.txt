My biggest annoyance was all of Madeline's obnoxious behavior. I know they're trying to make a contrast between Americans vs French but there is no way a woman at the pinnacle of an important company would behave that way - slurping the empty starbucks, trampling over clients, etc. They made her seem like a buffoon and she is actually Sylvie's equivalent. I believe the desk scene, that's a power move, but they made her out to be ignorant and crass, not the clearly competent business woman she would have to be.
