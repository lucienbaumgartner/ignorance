Well, that's as unfair as the blanket AWALT statement from TRP. I don't think incels or TRP only want hot 16 yo virgins. It's not that simple. TRP viewpoint is extreme but not without reason. It's too easy to look at TRP and say they're just a bunch of losers who can't get laid. That's too simplistic and dismissive. You have to understand why TRP was created and the catalysts. There are bad women in the world, just as there are bad men. There are very attractive women who gamed the guys and take advantage of their affections. The poor smucks finally wised up and challenged these women at their own game. The unfortunate thing is they will now loop in and fuck with the women who has done nothing to them and the cycle goes on. 

An average guy can really be easily strung along by a pretty face, while the pretty face act completely unaware and innocent. But she knows exactly what she is doing. There are consequences to this type of action, and TRP is really just a response to that. 

On the other hand of the spectrum, you have guys who think women owe them sex, which is equally absurd. 

Bottom line is, don't let the bad apples of both sexes ruin the good of the union. Men and women for centuries depended, loved and cared for each other. Be kind to each other and you will see less of TRP or man haters overall
