I didn’t choose to get vaccinated out of respect for medical professionals. I chose to because I felt it was best for me. And if people chose to remain unvaccinated because they felt it was the best choice for them, then so be it. 

It has absolutely fucking nothing to do with disrespect or a lack of concern for the medical community. So to throw out gross generalizations about unvaccinated like that is both ignorant and tasteless.

I don’t know why I even wasted my time responding though. You’re beyond rational conversation, which is why you come in here and just throw out insults.
