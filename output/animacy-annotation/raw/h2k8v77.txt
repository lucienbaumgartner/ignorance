I think something people forget when they debate "culture" is that inherently culture is never static. A culture does not exist in one single instance of time, it is always changing and moving with the times. It is the only way for a culture to survive. Silko's novel "Ceremony" is about this very topic. It is a sad fact that if you stay rooted in the past, refusing to embrace hybridity between your culture and another, your culture is doomed to die out. The dreamcatchers are an example of this very thing. Dreamcatchers were turned into commercialized products by various tribes (homogenizing their own separate cultures) and are seen by some as inappropriate, but some do not. The point is that pointing fingers at members of DC is inherently unproductive and ignorant of the larger discussion going on inside of those communities.
