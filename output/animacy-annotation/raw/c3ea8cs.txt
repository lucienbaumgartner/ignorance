Similar shenanigans: after sacrament adjourned, cousin and I snuck up to podium and started speaking into the microphone, in deep, serious authoritarian voices (like a GA). We were about 10 yrs old and unaware that our solemn "talk" to the empty chapel was being piped in to the relief society room and both foyers for all to hear. Got busted!
