I still feel bad about this. I was probably like 11, still really insensitive and unaware of other people’s feelings. When my dad was scolding me about being on the computer for too long or something, I yelled “at least I’m not unemployed!” to him. He had been let go from his job not too long ago before that. It must’ve been heartbreaking for him to hear. Luckily our relationship was not destroyed after that and we get along, but man was I a real b*****.
