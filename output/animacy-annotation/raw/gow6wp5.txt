"If he had not shut down the PREDICT program, this would not have happened."  I disagree.  Trump was so completely incompetent and ignorant that he would never have done what was necessary to combat the spread before it arrived because he believed such actions were a threat to the economy and the stock market which would hurt his reelection chances.  No matter what happened, with Trump in charge the spread was inevitable.
