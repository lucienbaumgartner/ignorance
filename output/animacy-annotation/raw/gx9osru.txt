If Texas passes the senate verion of the bill it will be better to not have a LTC.  
Because if you are charged with certain crimes then your LTC gets suspended, and if its suspended then you cant carry.  
But if didnt have a LTC you would have to get convicted before you couldnt carry.  


Public intoxication is one charge you could get which in Texas they dont have to prove you are intoxicated or give you a field sobriety test, or do blood work. The officer doesnt even need to see you drink and their is no min blood alcohol level needed for public intoxication. Just for DUIs.  


There is some more autism with the senates version. I think they were just incredibly incompetent and ignorant of the law.
