So if OP took off her shirt in front of her friend, friend has full right to grab her boobs? I mean, she was happy to change clothes in front of her friend so one could only assume she was okay with being touched too right? 

/S

I've literally watched porn with my friend before and no one masturbated. There is a difference between saying "in happy to show you how it works" vs "please experience it in its full glory in whatever way you wish." 

Yes there could have been a misunderstanding of what OP was offering but I would never say they're partially "to blame" or "at fault" because they let their friend see what VR porn looks like. In my opinion it would have been much more acceptable to say "oh wow *takes off VR* that was really hot. Maybe I can borrow this sometime to get the full experience *wink wink*" but to just go ahead and touch yourself? That seems like something a child might do. Being naive and unaware that such behaviors are typically private or consented to.
