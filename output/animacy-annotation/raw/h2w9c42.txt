If it was, welfare wouldn't exist...and I wouldn't be getting paid 40 hours a week to work with people on welfare.  That's the problem with Libertarians.  Y'all think everything is so simple and refuse to acknowledge the nuance and complexity of society.  I'll befriend a Libertarian over a Republican any day of the week, but in terms of maturity, y'all are on the same level.  Libertarians with being too simplistic and ignorant of how shit actually works, and Republicans for being whiny, self-righteous bigots.
