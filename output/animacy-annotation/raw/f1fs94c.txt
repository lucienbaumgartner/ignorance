This pole is giving me cancer. The fact that anyone thinks inventory space is a "slippery slope" is just cringe. It's not like anyone asked for them to be cash shop exclusive. Still put them as drops in the game, but theres absolutely no downside about letting people buy them. Its a minor convenience at most and helps gamigo keep the game running/growing. The people who are all up in arms about this topic are just scared little wow players who quit this game 5 years ago. They have 0 experience with the REAL p2w that killed the game so they make themselves as vocal as possible about anything in the cash shop that isnt a costume. News flash, games can get by on cosmetics, but if you really want it to thrive you've gotta accept that paying for convenience would add a huge amount of income to this game. Inventory in the cash shop would make this game thrive with the amount of returning players this server is going to see. Imagine being THIS brain dead and ignorant that you would rather play this game in maintenance mode than to see it prosper. And if paying for inventory is a problem for you, then just grind it in game. This poll is actually so pathetic.
