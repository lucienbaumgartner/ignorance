I keep coming to this conclusion also. 

Reason I ask is because someone recently showed me the song "No Room for N*****"....

I wasn't aware of this songs existence and immediately checked out the lyrics.

At surface level it CERTAINLY seems like the most racist song you could possibly imagine, but really the lyrics are so blatantly stupid and ignorant that it seems overwhelmingly sarcastic to me, almost as if its intentionally meant to sound ignorant and stupid for the sake of some extreme form of sarcastic art.

I'm not saying I agree with this usage or practice of art, but then again I try to just let art be art and try to find SOME sort of productive value out of it.
