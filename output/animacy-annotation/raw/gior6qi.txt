&gt;Because I understand history and the way things work?

No, because you split a hair that it was unnecessary to split, to pull a subject off topic because it makes you feel bad and you can't deal with it.

Not only that but you're flat out wrong. The jim crow era didn't start until after reconstruction so it wasn't "the entire time after the Civil War."

So not only are you so fragile and ignorant that you have to veer off into inane non-topical arguments to defend yourself emotionally, but the inane non-topical arguments that you make are bullshit also
