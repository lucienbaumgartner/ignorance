And in places such as Spokane, and 3/4ths of the US that aren't huge cities like LA, Seattle, NYC if things open back up and people are educated on precautions such as handwashing, trying to social distant, wearing a mask, then sure more people may end up getting it, but our hospitals have the capacity to deal with the severe patients. Overpopulated cities that don't have that hospital capacity should probably open more slowly.

My main point is that the intent of the lockdown was to flatten the curve, not to continue lockdown until eradication. If that goal has changed then the governor needs to state that this lockdown will last at least another year. The curve has been flattened, the stats now show the danger is nowhere near as high as it was once thought to be. Our covid rates are about as low as they will ever be, and unless the intent of the lockdown has changed without the public's knowledge it is time to reopen. Due to the media's portrayal of this people are overly afraid and unaware that they are still more likely to die from every other leading cause of death that exists than they are to die from coronavirus. (Cancer, Alzheimer's, Obesity, stroke, diabetes, respiratory issues, heart disease, and in 2020 even suicide are more likely to kill you than coronavirus is).

They knew from the start that flattening the curve would be a temporary lockdown, followed by reopening and having an uptick in the curve, but not as steep as without a lockdown, there was always going to be a 2nd wave, now we're just delaying the inevitable and calling people who want to reopen 'Idiots'...
