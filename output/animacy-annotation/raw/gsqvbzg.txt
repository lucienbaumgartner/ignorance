There were so many parts I had trouble choosing between but chose this one. Arisa had many unlucky signs this chapter and her and Daiki need to hang out long enough to make their fake romance convincing. It is so convincing her real girlfriend Kasumi runs away crying after she catches Arisa talk about making Daiki white day chocolate but Kasumi feels better at the chapter's end. They are at a university's environmental party so there are lots of exhibits with cute animals. Eito is Daiki's true boyfriend 

&gt;I cross my arms glaring at him. “Totally chill? You know this how? Don’t just decide stuff like that for me idiot.”

&gt;He gets up and shrugs. “But Arisa-pyon, I really like you and am so into you. But you never say you like me or anything. I-I am embarrassing. It makes me wonder if you’re okay with me.”

&gt;Is he for real? It’s too embarrassing! “That I li… that’s too embarrassing!” My heel meets his chest as I inner crescent kick knocking him down. Now everyone’s staring at us.

&gt;“I’m bad with lovey dovey lines you idiot! But I will say this much, listen up!”

&gt;“A-Arisa-pyon.”

&gt;I continue, “I-I’m not just okay with you, I think you’re amazing!”

&gt;His eyes water looking up as I try helping him and he asks, “For real?”

&gt;“So don’t cry. We’re surrounded by all these cute animals and helping the environment.”

&gt;Eito firmly tells him, “You have obligations Daiki. You told me she wouldn’t mind us hanging out together. Your family asked you to get a girlfriend to avoid them losing face. You shouldn’t be selfish and ignorant that way Daiki.”

&gt;Everyone’s staring at us then Eito lightly half smiles pushing his glasses by the bridge of his nose. “Of course as your social media manager…someone’s calling your zoom.”
