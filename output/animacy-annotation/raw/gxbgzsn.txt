This reminded me when I sat in on my kids primary lesson once and the teacher, exactly as you said, prompted the kids to react with disgust when showed a picture of a kid with blue colored hair. I was shocked at the blatant lesson in judging and at the time so naive and ignorant that I thought it was just the teacher.
