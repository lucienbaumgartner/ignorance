Millitary members can be pretty damn smart and skilled for what they do, but yeah it depends on what field you get into from the millitary. The idiot part comes with the recruiting when you are young and ignorant of what is at hand, kind of like giving young students large loans for college without them really grasping how much of a huge debt it would be in the future.
