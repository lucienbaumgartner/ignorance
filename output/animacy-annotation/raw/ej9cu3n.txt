I would gladly give up a large portion of my intellect, to be normal. I think part of the struggle comes from the higher awareness. My mind just never gives me a break, I have people that I went to school with that were not intelligent at all, yet their ability to socially connect has given the opportunity to thrive. So yes its pointless to have the potential, but you are never given the chance to prove it because it all falls apart on the first interaction.

I'd rather be dumb and ignorant... that seems to equate to a happier life.
