That's not a hook. More importantly, don't ever, ever, call yourself oppressed. Seriously, that's incredibly most self-absorbed, unaware and insensitive to people facing much more serious struggles. You were not and are not being oppressed. Don't suggest your oppressed or otherwise facing undue challenges, especially in the context you provided, or you'll seriously be damaging your application.
