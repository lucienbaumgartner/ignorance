Same, the first few episodes with her and crystal were super uncomfortable. I think (not that it makes it ok) that she is unaware and oblivious that statements like “I don’t see color” only further disparage a community’s shared experience and makes it about herself, rather than being hateful. I have a feeling that will come up at the reunion and she’ll be more receptive to the criticism than, say, Kim Z. 🙄
