There's so much to love about this episode (and season) so far.

I love it how after Mac came out in a very respectful way now he's out and proud and it's leading to hilarious scenes. It's still typical Always Sunny humor but the way they got to it doesn't make it homophobic. It's the best of both worlds really.

I love it how they didn't turn the whole gang into anti-vaxxers but their behavior is perfectly fitting with their characters. Most got the vaccine, even though they're still pretty ignorant and irresponsible. And their (lack of) reaction to Dennis 1) not getting vaccinated, 2) getting sick, 3) putting others at risk without anyone from the gang showing the least bit of concern... Again, typical Always Sunny humor without the need to make them obnoxiously antivax for easy laughs. Best of both worlds again.

I love it how after Mac getting a wholesome coming out episode, now Charlie got a wholesome encounter with his dad. And in both cases, Frank was around to make it hilarious without ruining the wholesomeness (so far.) I know that some viewers don't want anything like this in Always Sunny but I feel that after all those years, it's fine to include some feel good moments. I think that both Mac and Charlie's have been handled well, and I hope that if they do something similar with the other characters, it would be done in a similar fashion. 

And to top it off, while all of this is developing, Dennis went full psycho :D
