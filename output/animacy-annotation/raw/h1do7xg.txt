oh wow, jeez. and here I'm just being blissfully unaware and ignorant of all this (before I asked the question anyway). I knew our government is bad (from the news and r/ph memes ofc) but not this bad. Kawawa pala talaga tayo sa mga fossils na elite. I don't know either if tatangkilikin ko ito (leaning towards no, idk yet if I can afford to). Pero "renew" means that the license for the first 3 years is "for free" right? or talagang right after, say, maipasa ang board exam ay hihingan ka na agad ng 45 CPD pts? Is that how it works? Appreciate the response btw.
