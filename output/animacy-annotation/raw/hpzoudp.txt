You haven’t been able to refute one thing I’ve said this entire conversation other than to say “you’re a racist because I said so” and then wax poetic upon that foundation. You can be a mouthpiece for racism until your dying day and I won’t be able to convince you that attacking people for taking issue with racist rhetoric is not going to turn you into the progressive warrior you obviously crave to be. Good luck with life, I’m sure you’ll lay your head down tonight with the ignorant and blissful idea that you’ve won another fight, that racism has been put at bay for another day, because you argued that calling rap ghetto was not racist on the internet, and that everyone else is the *true* racist, while your moderate liberal [i.e. broadly very conservative and unhelpful] rhetoric will somehow win us the day and create a culture that will be accepting, despite the fact that it stands for nothing more than playing devil’s advocate and assuming the best of white ideals. Great job fighting for the status quo, the white majority, and attacking anyone that dares to challenge it.
