I agree it's not just US, there's ignorant and knowledgeable people in every country.

And I think you have a point with GDP, but culturally I don't think anyone outside of the US differentiates between any of the states culturally except maybe Hawaii. But with countries, there's a lot of distinctive cultural history behind every one.
