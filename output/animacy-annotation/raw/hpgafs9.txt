Am I missing something here? I don’t see anything about the headline in this screenshot.

What I do see is an American acknowledging their own ignorance, the rampant nationalism they’re encouraged to embrace and never question, and the failure of its education system to provide insight to the outside world and instead focus almost solely on America. 

Isn’t the whole point of this sub to mock people who aren’t able to see this stuff? To mock the people who make ignorant and nationalistic comments this person is speaking out against?
