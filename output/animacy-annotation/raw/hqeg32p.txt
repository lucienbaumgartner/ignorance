Why are so many people so pretentious and ignorant and rude in the US? You are in a different country. You don't visit someone else's home and tell them what's what. You are polite and grateful for whatever hospitality is extended to you and you keep your damn bitching to yourself. Where are your manners? You are a visitor in someone else's home! Don't be rude! You don't have to stay... You don't like it, go the fuck home... I'm sure nobody's going to be heartbroken about you leaving.
