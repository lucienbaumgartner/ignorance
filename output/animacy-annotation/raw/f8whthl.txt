I’m not really trying to have a real argument, because what he said is so unfathomably stupid and ignorant that I felt like making a hyperbolic statement that isn’t too far off the truth. That truth being that half of his supporters are on meth/opioids/alcohol 24/7 and half LITERALLY think god has chosen Trump. Maybe 5% can be shaved off for the competent selfish businessmen who don’t want to pay higher taxes. Sociopathic people can be smart too I’ll give you that.
