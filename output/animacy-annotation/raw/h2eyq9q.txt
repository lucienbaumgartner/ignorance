Look man, all this bullshit you're saying might have worked in February 2020 but it's been 16 months now. 

It's a bad flu for the minority and the sniffles for the majority. The people who are dying are already unhealthy and unaware of how to keep their immune systems healthy. And they're mostly very old.

Nobody is "coddling" me. Out in the real world, I live my life how I wish and nobody else's health is my problem. Never has been. 

It's ironic because the people who believe this virus is anything more than what it actually is are the ones being coddled. It's actually the reason the governments gave us for lockdowns. The people at risk should have been protected, but instead we destroyed peoples livlihoods and mental health. Everyone became sick until proven healthy. 

You want to wear a mask that has no bearing on whether you catch a virus or not, just so you feel better. You want to be injected with an inadequately tested experimental vaccine that has had nonstop controversy since it began rolling out. You want to lockdown society and continue spreading fear over "variants" with no evidence of them being more deadly.

You are being coddled. You reek of weakness.
