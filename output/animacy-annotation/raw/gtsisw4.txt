I hate that stereotype of the young, rebellious atheist teenager. I do agree with the first half of your comment, that most people become atheists due to fallacious logic and reasoning. But that example of rebelling against one's religious upbringing is such deceitful rubbish!

Some kids get kicked out of their homes and in some countries (i.e. Pakistan) maybe even killed for leaving their faith. These teenagers who lose their faith in the Creator, while misinformed and ignorant of the overwhelming evidence for theism/deism, are sincere in their atheism. The risks almost always outweighs the benefits.
