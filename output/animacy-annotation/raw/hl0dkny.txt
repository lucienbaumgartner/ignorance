Once again calling a child names. Very cool and mature.

I’m just gonna say it- If you don’t think teenagers are wildly misguided and unaware of the realities of love, relationships and politics then I don’t know where the fuck you’ve been.

Again, we can tell her why it’s wrong without harassing her, yeah?
