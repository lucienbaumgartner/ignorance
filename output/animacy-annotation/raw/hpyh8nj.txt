Read well, i never said their old hip hop concept was their true selves, i'm just saying that yeah, as  paradoxical as it can sound, when they were forcing that tough and badass image, they seemed more fresh. 
It was kinda obvious that it was only their stage image, first because it is a common knowledge in kpop and music in general that singers have stage characters, nobody thought their real personality matched their stage one, and second in every other public content (like BTS BOMBS) they kept no secret their breaking down of that facade. Moreover they didn't even keep it up for that long.
I'm not saying they should go back to HYYH or whatever, it would be ignorant and naive to pressure artists into a regression to their past selves, what i'm saying is just that as for what they are now, their music makes me cringe, and that HYYH is their best work, literally no hate intended.
