Just read the part where CNN viewers were outraged that a conservative woukd be CNN editor.  We don't know what went behind closed doors to demote her.  However, you stated that she is a political editor to show how centrist and fair CNN is.  That was a double lie.  She is not a political editor she is an analyst.  CNN's viewera are so partisan and ignorant that the were outraged that a single conservative voice would be an editor on CNN.  Therefore, I have refuted both claims that she is an editor and that CNN and its viewers are centrist.  Your partisan and egotistical ignorant blinders just won't let you admit when you are proven wrong.
