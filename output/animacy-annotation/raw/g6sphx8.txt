From my understanding Joel never tortured and murdered people for self gratification, nor did he relish the idea of taking lives. Dude was a survivor who did what he needed to protect himself and his loved ones. And please don't try to bring up David's men as some sort of checkmate, it doesn't work. 

Unfortunately I can't defend much of Ellies actions in this game, however she was wronged from the jump.  The WLF certainly deserved worse then what they got, however Ellie clearly was taking a toll mentally from the violence she indulged in. Also Abby did start this revenge cycle by murdering Joel right before her very eyes, then thinking it was self righteous to then let her live with that memory "We let you both live...and you wasted it!"

Abby doesn't repent for her crimes, or ever apologize to those she's wronged. She says she has "guilt" and helped those kids to "lighten the load" but then contradicts herself by going back on the revenge cycle when she visits the theater. She also doesn't care about the livelihood of her friends, as seen by: Her dragging all of her gang into her suicidal Justice for Jerry mission, knowingly leaving her friends alone and unaware of danger after bumping into Tommy, betraying her group and murdering countless WLF in defense of the new scar friend she made(I wonder how many of those WLF fought by her side and saved her in combat?), and then further endangering Lev by dragging him into revenge round 2 at the theater.

I think we can safely say that Abby is a much worse person then Joel and Ellie.
