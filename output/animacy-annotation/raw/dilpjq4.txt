HAHAHA.. giving off awkward vibes, story of my life and many others here.

Tips? Unless you are an exception, it is simply doable to mostly (99%) get rid of this assuming you spend time and effort over a longer period of time. Simple as that. 

The way i see it, you are basically starting at zero. Unaware and clueless. Now you have to learn yourself these habits. Suppose it takes a few years. Once you have the habit, you do it all day and you never have to spend a single instance of thought about it ever again.. it is just a habit. 

It is complicated, but you can finetune it very well over a longer time span. I can't really get specific, it's something you have to figure out. Treat it as a difficult game, very difficult to learn, will take years, but once you learned it, you play it effortlessly.
