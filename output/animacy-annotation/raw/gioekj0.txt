&gt;But things changed

They didn't. 

Black people being self reliant and building our own wealth is still severely punished by white America. A more recent example is the MOVE bombings.

If you think that Black people achieving economic equality with whites would do anything other than enrage white America you are naive and ignorant of history.

White people on both the left and right deny and downplay the existence of racism because discussing it makes them uncomfortable. It's truly a horseshoe issue. 

[The data goes against the far left's 'racism is a class issue' narrative.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/21/17139300/economic-mobility-study-race-black-white-women-men-incarceration-income-chetty-hendren-jones-porter)
