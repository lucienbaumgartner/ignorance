A black kid walked into a school a couple months ago, shot up a bunch of people, and walked out of jail the next day I believe. So knock that shit off. Every single situation has completely different circumstances. Maybe 80 years ago you were spot on, but to pretend that nothings changed since is just ignorant. And dumb. And factually incorrect. To broadly say black people get more time than white people and thatâ€™s that is ignorant and dangerous. Having a prior record or not is maybe the single most important thing to what kind of time you get. Ray Lewis murdered someone and walked. Michael Jackson raped kids and walked. Oj Simpson killed 2 people and walked. We need to keep going?
