Sorry but there was a massive issue with GOT in that there were only 2 prevalent characters of color. This was not the viewers fault. 

The fact he’s trying to say peoples dislike of the finale is racially motivated is detrimental to times when this is correct. 

If he really was the crusader he’s trying to make himself out to be right now why the fuck didn’t he speak to the director about getting literally any other main characters in of color? 

His statement is ignorant and deflective.
