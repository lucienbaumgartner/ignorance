Respectfully, it is. I'm in my early 30s and I've told 18-23 year olds that I wouldn't date them, but I'd "teach" them how to do sexual things. I just cannot imagine actively dating them. And even though I've said that, I couldn't go through with it because that little light in their eyes were too bright and unaware of what it means to be in a relationship. They haven't experienced life yet, they wouldn't know what to do in many different situations and I just don't like the idea of mothering someone that's suppose to be my partner.
