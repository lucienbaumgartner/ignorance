I do apologize I don’t mean to be quite so harsh - it’s personal for me because my nephew’s dad is a conspiracy theorist who didn’t get vaccinated, got covid, passed it to my nephew who’s too young to get vaccinated, and resulted in him getting hospitalized from covid. This personal experience and many other stories I’ve heard like it make it very hard for me to sympathize with people who don’t get vaccinated. I have friends whose lives have been functionally ruined by covid because they’re immunocompromised. I am tired of seeing the general mental health of nurses that I am friends and family with deteriorate due to the strain of dealing with the waves of primarily unvaccinated people that are clogging up our medical resources. I firmly believe if a large portion of the vaccine holdouts stopped being holdouts it wouldn’t be as bad for them. To be very blunt: I’m my mind there are far many lives being ruined because, frankly, ignorant and selfish people won’t get the vaccine. 

I completely agree with you on the point that we will never have 100% compliance. That’s an accurate assessment. But it feels defeatist to me to use that as a justification. 

Again, I do see your point and I respect that those are your views and you’ve been vaccinated yourself. Your views now are what my were early in the life cycle of the vaccine. I’m too jaded now and sick and tired of having people burry their heads in the sand to attempt to prove a point.
