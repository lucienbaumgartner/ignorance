I grew up in very rural northern New England in the 90s and my family never locked their doors. In fact, I don't think the doorknob on my childhood home even had a lock attached. My grandmother once had a drunk man walk into her house confused and unaware of where he was and convinced that she was his mother and she just escorted him out and let him keep walking along the dirt road and she laughed it off. I believe to this day that my father still does not lock his doors, and as someone who now lives in an area where I had literal groceries stolen out of my car while running errands, I am completely terrified of the fact that he doesn't. Some people never change and some people want so desperately to believe that they live in communities where bad things just don't happen because they "know" everyone and their mother. It's unfortunate.
