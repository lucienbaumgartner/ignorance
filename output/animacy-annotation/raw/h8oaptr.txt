During the roll out of the vaccine it was proven that black neighborhoods got shit on and couldn't get it without driving much further.

Don't be ignorant.

You can say that now but people get less trusting when shit is literally obvious the country is racist.

Also still further than me. I just go a mile and can hit 2 pharmacies and a VA. Extra 4 miles and a hospital.

Stop being stupid and ignorant of what goes on in this fucking country.
