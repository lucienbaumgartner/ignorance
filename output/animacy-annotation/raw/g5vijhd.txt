Thanks! If you are interested going "down the rabbit hole" for a quick look around:

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* ***conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.*** *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly*. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "\*

WTF ??? (when do you or I talk like this?)

And Podesta was no small fish, as had Clinton won in 2016, he would have been *Chief of Staff to the President of the United States*. So, it is pretty interesting to hear their casual shop-talk/water cooler discussions, when they don't think anyone is listening.

And this video expands on the missing "civics" aspect, that the  government saw fit to drop in 1970.

And here is where the "unawareness" pays off:

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

Cheers!
