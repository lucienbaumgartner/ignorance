People being more open/free to communicate about sex and what they like is awesome. More consumption is all around bad. Had to leave my ex due to his porn addiction, among other things. Also the number of men who think they can just imitate porn in the bedroom is embarrassingly high. It is not okay to choke or slap without asking first. It is downright uncomfortable and unsexy to jackhammer away with little foreplay. Guys who pull moves from porn instead of personalizing the experience and eliciting what women want will forever be seen as ignorant and inexperienced to me
