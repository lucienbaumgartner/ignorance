What I don't understand is why healthcare and higher education is looked at as a RIGHT. It is a PRIVILEGE. A right is something like life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, not guaranteed free shit.  I have worked hard my entire life to get good grades in school, pay attention in said school to use what I've learned, get a job in a field that pays very well and provide HEALTHCARE AND (eventual) HIGHER EDUCATION for my children without asking for a handout. I did it. Me. Not the government, not the tax payer, ME. And now Bernie Fucking Sanders and the leftist basement dwelling troglodytes with useless degrees want to TAKE my good decisions and my EARNED income and GIVE it to a dumbass who made poor life choices? I don't think so. Fuck that shit. I don't understand where the pride in a job well done has gone in this country, but it's FUCKING EMBARRASSING. I understand helping the less fortunate. That is a separate issue. I don't understand helping the willfully lazy and ignorant. That is something I cannot and will not ever abide.
