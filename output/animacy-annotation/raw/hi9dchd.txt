You keep bringing up pro-gamers and skill. I already said, it doesn't make me play worse. I play this game casually, I don't care about my KDR. I just find it uncomfortable, and many other peopel find it too. It's very arrogant and ignorant of you to tell others how they should feel about game mechanics, just because you have pro-gamer friends. You also assume that every human's muscle memory works identically, which isn't true.
