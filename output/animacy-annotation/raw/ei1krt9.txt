NAH. It's hard to know why the other student was angry,  but maybe its because up until now,  you've had the luxury of being blissfully unaware of gender issues. You've been brought up with many biases, which makes the lives of people with less privilege harder. Now you're complaining that you don't want to hear about how you're unaware and biased. I could see how this would make someone else angry if they've experienced those biases themselves,  or had friends who have. 

You don't have to actively hate trans or nb people to cause them harm. Maybe you're brushing off the student's words because you know you have no ill intent, and you think that absolves you.  It does not. Take the class and maybe you'll understand why the student was angry.
