Categorizing the entirety of humanity as a singular thing is foolish and ignorant of the reality of how a small amount of people have disproportional power over the trajectory of the entire human population.  It is this small group of people I have a negative outlook on, and that isn't going to be changing any time before their inevitable and unending march to irreparably destroying the potential for this planet to sustain complex life for short term profit is done.
