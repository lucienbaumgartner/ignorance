WSET 2 spirit candidate here. Ignore /u/CMGPetro - their advice is not only the least helpful, it's actually distracting (i.e. their advice is tantamount to your asking for red wine recommendations, and them offering white wine recommendations). Worse yet, their recommendations are largely peated Scotches, which are about as far away as you can get from a sweet corn bourbon. That, and their suggestion bourbon is somehow "basic" is laughably ignorant and closed minded (and I say that as a Scotch and bourbon drinker).

Based on his favourites your Man likes bourbon. That being the case, it makes the most sense to pick a special "wouldn't normally buy this for myself" bourbon.

Eagle Rare is from the same distillery as Buffalo Trace, but it's distilled separately, 8s from their premium stock, and is at a minimum aged 12 years (doesn't say that on the bottle). It's fricking delicious, will be reminiscent of his favourite, and is in your $60 window.

Stepping outside of that, you're in luck since the Limited Spirit Release took place in November, and there's still remnants of that at any BCL. This is whiskey/whisky you won't be able to buy ever again. Makers made a special Kentucky Derby expression that's well rated and in your strike zone; there's also a new whisky from Hudson that was introduced in the LSR that's pretty new that he likely won't have had before and won't disappoint.

...but for the love of God, don't buy the man anything /u/CMGPetro suggested.
