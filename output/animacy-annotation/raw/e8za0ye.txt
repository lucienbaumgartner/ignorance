&gt;It's not meant to be belittling, just think of it from an outside perspective. Imagine a wiccan telling you how dancing naked in the forest allows them to communicate with the spirits and how the goddess has spoken directly to them on multiple occasions. 

You: So you claim to commune with spirits?

Wiccab: Yep. Dancing in the forest. Good times.. 

You: And these are powerful, unseen beings, and you know them and speak to them?

Wiccan: Sure, and sometimes they speak to us.

You: Make them guess how much change I have in my pocket. 

Wiccan: That's not how it works, no.

You: Ok, tell your spirit guide or whatever to tell you other Wiccan friend's spirits this 4-digit code and then text it to me from his phone. 

Wiccan: You can't see how rude and ignorant that is? 

You: Nope. Last night I was at a party and met this guy who said he was Hawaiian, so I asked him to prove it and he got all mad because I told him to pull a pineapple out of his hat.

Wiccan: Bye.
