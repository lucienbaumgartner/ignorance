You should go into ammo manufacturing. I look forward to paying a max of 25cpr for 9mm during the next panic. 

Ammo manufacturers can already increase capacity by running second and third shifts and operating 24/7. There’s a reason no one can meet the current demand, if it was easy to fix then the market would have sorted it.

My whole point here is that the “Why can’t they just…” posts are short sighted and ignorant of all the challenges and costs involved. And people insisting that manufacturers spend a fortune on risky investments so they can benefit from lower prices are fools. Even if they could, which they can’t, they wouldn’t. They can’t because they control a tiny portion of a massive supply chain and bolstering a single link is unlikely to have any impact whatsoever on the situation as a whole.
