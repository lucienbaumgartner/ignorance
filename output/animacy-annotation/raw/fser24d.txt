I'm in the US. Grew up in an urban area.

You're already doing one of the most important things you can, leading by example. 

Kids learn a lot of things by watching their parents. 

My parents were, for lack of a better term, unaware and unintentionally racist. They lived through the civil rights movement and race riots. In an attempt to keep them safe, their parents instilled a sense of fear and lack of acceptance in them. They in turn did the same with their children. 

It wasn't until I got out into the "real" world that I was able to start seeing how narrow minded and limiting this was. Even more so when I started to travel in my 20's. 

So with my kids, I strive to instill acceptance, understanding and forgiveness by always stopping to think if my words or actions will will help them learn to think for themselves or reinforce stereotypes  that, like me, will take years to shed.

I don't want their experiences to be tempered by my past, I want them to be theirs to learn and grow with.

That's my input for what it's worth.
