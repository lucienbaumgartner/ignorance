The idea that you can become alienated with this sort of realization is funny.  The suffering stems from grabbing at things and ideas like they’re truly there and exist independently. There isn’t really any separation between you, society, the sun, your thoughts, others, others’ thoughts etc, it is all the same process of dependent transformation, anything depends on everything else to be anything and thus is everything.  Everyone you’ve ever loved is in your cup of tea, in you and me. 

So I’d say the suffering is a result of this habitual belief you exist independently, that it’s even possible to be alienated.  I mean it, like even among the most unaware and ignorant beings there’s still this commonality or sameness, and sure it can be difficult to watch, like watching kids do some really dumb shit.  You get what I’m saying?  The insanity of society is the widespread acceptance of the idea of separation as completely real instead of just a persistent delusion.   That idea propagates competition, greed, hatred, delusion, comparison, loneliness, etc.  So if you feel alienated, *you* might be the insane one.  Just for your consideration, because i used to think the same way but I was wrong and suffered needlessly because of it.
