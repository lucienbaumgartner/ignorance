My take is that how you consistently carry yourself and behave isn't a shtick its who you are. That being said I always was a fan of the show before they added Shaq. He legitimately makes so many moments in the show awkward and that to me just isn't entertaining when everybody else is uncomfortable. Adding to him clearly not being somebody who watches games or follows the league seriously, in my eyes he doesn't bring anything to the table. Not to say I don't want levity and humor, but I don't think Shaq really brings those. I think you can have hot takes and be spicy without being obnoxious and ignorant of the NBA.
