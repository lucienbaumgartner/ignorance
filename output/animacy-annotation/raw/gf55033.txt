ESH. I know how awful group projects can be, especially as someone who went back to school older. Everyone has their own responsibilities and excuses.  And she sounds like an absolute entitled jerk, expecting you guys to carry her through.  

However,  instead of snickering and gossiping behind her back,  someone should have had the courage to speak to her about her behavior.  it's totally believable that maybe she did feel overwhelmed and unaware of how she was acting.  Even if not, you all did nothing productive to confront her and instead blew up in her face -- to her, potentially out of nowhere. Whether her intentions were bad or not,  its still not the right way to communicate with someone.
