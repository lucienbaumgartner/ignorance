My post history is very transparent about my long career in gamedev.

Also, I call bullshit. You're not just lying about being a CTO or even a business owner, but even if you weren't that has absolutely nothing to do with the fact you're extremely unaware and ignorant about how the rest of the world works.

It also would prove you to be unintelligent. Someone who thinks their own personal anecdote is the exact experience of all other people and all other corporations is embarrassingly stupid. Just because there are some hard working CEO's doesn't mean nepotism and privilege don't play an enormous part.
