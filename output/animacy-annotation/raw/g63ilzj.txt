Awww, you poor, silly thing. Literally all of them do. Animal protein is necessary for proper brain development. Right there. Over and over. Your literacy issues wonâ€™t change that. I think my favorite part, though, is that you, with that big olâ€™ brain oâ€™ yours, forgot to delete the erroneous comment at the beginning in every single one of â€˜em before pasting your inability to comprehend for all to see. ðŸ˜‚ God, I love how often yâ€™all shoot yourselves in the feet here. Youâ€™re that perfect mix of pompous, self-righteous, and ignorant that makes it so *easy*.
