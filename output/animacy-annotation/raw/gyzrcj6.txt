So, im a main evie since 2016, the amount of bullshit you just said makes no fucking sence. Meta evie yes is the wormhole ( with sustain and range on blink, filler to get cooldown reduction or speed on the soar or give 2 ammo after ice block or 1 after soar, lots of fillers), snowglobe and over the mone are most likely terrible choises if you play at higher ranks (if you play at low rank i cant believe you are a good evie player). The only time i think other legendary is better than wormhole is SnowGlobe with dive comps ( the best one would be ruckus and maeve but if your dps are hitscan is good to change maeve to evie brcause of her blast) and there snow globe is good because you use the ult as a skill and give the offtank more free time to punish theyr flanks or dps.
Evie heath no need to be buffed (uou are right about this), but her card needs a buff yes, 30 health per level os the weakest in the game and aperantly you dont know this but the card is buged so you get 29 health insteed or 30 and sometimes the card dont even activate, this card is important as a filler because of strix or kinessa 1 shooting her on headshoot without forcing you to buy haven. 
About evie shoots no nerfed needed on the dmg and neither a buff, yet seeing her with 0.8 or 0.7 (like drogoz) would be interesting but its better to stay the way it is, the projectile cant be even slower so other way evie will become that she was before (super slow shoots where making the aerial playstile impossible to accomplish, and since you seem to pray for "good players" or skilled players this all i have to say). Her dps is low being 850, androxus lex moji skye buck vatu vora maeve, all other flanks hae a higher dps then evie, no need ro toutch this. 
About the iceblock a little dmg was good to be back (yes back) evie used to be able to not only teleport inside the iceblock (once she reaches the teleport the ice block was instantly over, avoiding once again the "camping") but she also dealed dmg after the iceblocks explodes being later removed (this feature was in paladins strike just to have an idea) so adding this back trough a legendary was interesting.

Now about the Sha Lin part, i thnk you probably got hitted by something called " Counters" evie is viable pick obly if the match is good for her (at high rank once again), the meta as been horrible for her this last 2 years, first lian and cassie on meta (got nerfrd) then the super strong offtanks (got nerfrd) thethen viktor and vivian rising (got nerfed) then shalin (nerfed, and one of the best evie counters in game because of the criplle and burst melting more then halfh evie health) then bk (nerfed and bugged like other AOE characters that you probably dont even knoe about) then now tiberius vora androxus dredge khan furia dmg grover criplle all in the meta to counter evie. 
So sha lin play styke did not change a single bit, only he his finnaly a strong character and finaly can punish an evie, not theyr fault you try stupid things (like saying evie decks should not be focused on self healing).
 In conclusion you tried to look smart and a very good "evie player listen to me" and ended up looking very stupid and unaware of the things about her, and you tryed to "ashame" the AoC member for no reason. (Everytime i say HighRank im talking about Master and Grandmaster, and the good ones not the boosted ones)
