First, in a free speech nation I dont feel that any words should be banned or disallowed. 

Social acceptance or rejection will ultimately kill it. 

Without extreme intervention, that word (-er or -a) is already dying from vocabulary in all but the most uneducated and ignorant (of any race). 

I personally haven't heard either form of the word in in-person communication in quite awhile. And I live in the deep south. It's just not something people really say much anymore, even around here.
