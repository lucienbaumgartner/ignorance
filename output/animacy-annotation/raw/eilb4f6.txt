Jokes are not endorsement


PewDiePie has been very clear about him not actually being a racist or anything like that. People are *not* radicalised by jokes like that, period. As a society, we need to be able to trust the judgement of the people more than that of children. Not everyone is a baby that's so impressionable and ignorant that they will believe everything that's said to them and not consider the context or intent of what's said.


That said, I'm absolutely for the mods' decision here. If I lived in Christchurch, I definitely wouldn't wanna go on Reddit just to see memes about a local tragedy.
