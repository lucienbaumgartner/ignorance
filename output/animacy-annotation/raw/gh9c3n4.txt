Hot damn, you’re so delusional and unaware that you portrayed the dumbass in a comic strip perfectly! But rather than think introspectively, and realize that perhaps you were wrong and should gain a little common sense to understand reality from fiction, the lesson the comic drives home, you get mad at a fucking comic strip! Your argument isn’t even valid as it stands, you made up a straw man to lend validity to the fact that you fell for a fucking obvious fake headline without a second thought. That doesn’t require a dissertation as a response, the only response you should expect would come from people letting you know how fucking dumb that is, so dumb that your “argument” is the butt of a fucking comic’s joke.
