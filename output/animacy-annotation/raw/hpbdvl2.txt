Alright, if you want to want to hold that willfully ignorant and unfounded perspective on the characters - you can continue to do so. 

That is 100% purely your own subjective opinion to say that “These are acceptable version of Batman and Superman and that’s it.” How do you even qualify “acceptable” in this context? Acceptable how? I have pointed out how several ways in which they are a fundamental alteration of these characters into new characters unique to Snyder’s movies that do not represent the historical and cultural impact and iconic representation of the characters, nor are they in keeping with the source material.
