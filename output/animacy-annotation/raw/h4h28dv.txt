I disagree. Arguments in favor of masking and vaxxing to protect *others* are finding a lot of deaf ears, but even the most selfish, small-minded and ignorant of us tend to jump aboard when there is a clear and immediate personal benefit for one's self.

You'll notice that the loudest voices decrying state and federal aid programs as socialism tend to sing a different tune when it is their own home, well-being or constituency being threatened.
