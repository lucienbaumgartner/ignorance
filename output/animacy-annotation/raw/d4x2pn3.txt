I'm quite aware, jackass. She showed normal curiosity about her sister's body (do the research), and masturbated next to her sleeping sister. She didn't touch her sister; her sister was unaware and unharmed. 
  
Would I let my child do something like what she did? No, I'd correct the situation once I became aware of it, talk to my child about it being inappropriate and potentially causing a rift and great discomfort if her sister woke up during ... but I wouldn't treat her like a criminal. There's no evidence of harmful intent, and teenagers do dumb shit.
  
Got any substantive responses, or are you just going to call me names again, ya big baby.
