You missed the point again, while there absolutely are sweet Pit Bulls (I’ve met a few), that does not negate the fact that they have a much higher propensity for aggression than other breeds. These traits do not just breed out overnight nor even after several generations; blood sports were outlawed not all that long ago in relation to when this breed was developed. To have a completely reformed breed would require the same time frame that these traits were bred in, so we still have quite a ways to go. It is for that reason this dog must never be pawned off on novice owners and especially those with other animals and/or kids. If advocates want to save this breed, you need to be completely honest about their nature and push for restrictions that will prevent people from owning them who are inexperienced and unaware of their unpredictable nature. Tell the truth, no more puff piece editorials about them being “nanny dogs”, which they never were
