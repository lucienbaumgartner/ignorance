It happens a lot, across all genres.

Favourite authors often turn out to be deeply flawed human beings, for whatever reason. Didn't stop me enjoying Ender's Game or *most* of the Robert Heinlein books. Won't stop me enjoying Harry Potter - although I believe JKR is ignorant and arrogant and I hope at some stage she asks herself why people are upset. Because like anyone, she can learn and grow as a person. It's up to her whether she does.

I believe as humans none of us is perfect. So if I waited until someone perfect wrote a book or made a movie I'd be waiting a long time. That said, the movie/entertainment industry seems to have much more than its fair share of horrible people.
