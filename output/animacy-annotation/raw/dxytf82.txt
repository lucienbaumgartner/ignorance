Even if we can’t prove it, it’s kind of logical that consciousness could be recreated after death. I think it could be possible to experience consciousness as a cycle from birth to death and death to birth. Although each conscious experience would be completely different and completely unaware and unconnected of past lives. Each life feels like it’s its own. Our lives are completely random. 

I just think it’s crazy that of the whole entire universe over a incomprehensible amount of time that I just happened to be here at this time. If it is random then why not other conscious experiences in the before birth and after death?
