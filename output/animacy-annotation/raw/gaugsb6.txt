I'm diagnosed both. The ADHD was more or less silent or had ambiguous symptoms, but didn't become an issue until I had to take on adult responsibilities and I simply couldn't keep up nor focus (i was doing poorly in classes as an adult). Turns out I had a lot of symptoms growing up that went undetected because I found ways to work around them or avoid them, or because I was "smart enough", so the irresponsibility was dismissed. The thing is that ADHD and schizotypal both affect how you focus, and how you perceive and interact with others, and your response to stress.

The unique identifiers of each for me are that ADHD makes me too jittery and unaware of the task at hand. I have this weird overall overdrive anxiety thing. It all goes away with Adderall. Schizotypal affects what I believe and the words I use. It makes me obsessed with hidden meanings and connections. If I'm stressed I will get actual paranoia (beyond ADHD anxiety). Adderall does not help any of that when I'm stressed and sometimes it makes the paranoia worse (because I can focus on magical thinking even deeper). An antipsychotic I use for nausea actually helps me in this situation.
