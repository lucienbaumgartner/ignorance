I could see an argument for "There should be a regulation in place where actors have to ask the armorer to show them the gun in front of them to prove it is safe". Basically combining the 'person handling the gun should be the one to check' and 'the armorer should be the only one checking the gun' 

But yeah, all the people saying "he should have checked it himself!" is overly simplistic and ignorant of all the safety precautions that are supposed to be in place
