I saw him at SVCC in 2018. It was weird as there was a 25th anniversary panel on the schedule  but I couldn’t think of who was going to be a part of it. At the time Vernon Wells was supposed to be a guest but he ended up canceling. So it was actually just supposed to be Neo Edmunds he didn’t want to do the panel by himself so he ended up asking Scott Zillner (who was assistant to the prop master on MMPR) and one other guy to join him as Scott was there with the PMC/Robot Toy Fest booth. The next year they got Austin St John Karan Ashley Johnny Young Bosch and David Fielding and you know what I ended up enjoying Neo’s panel a lot more as they talked about a lot of BTS stuff. The ones with the ranger actors ended up being too short and they ended up spending a good amount of the panel dumping 2017 movie and  under the impression it was universally despised by the fandom and ignorant that there are actually a lot of fans that enjoyed it. 

But yeah sometimes the crew members can be more fun to listen to.
