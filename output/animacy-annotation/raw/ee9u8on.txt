I might possibly be autistic, I’m going to get a diagnosis next month. For me, I always thought how it was fucking horrible and ignorant that a lot of people think autism and Down syndrome are the same thing. There’s nothing wrong with Down syndrome I just think it’s disgusting how ignorant some people are.

Last year my young adult little sister was watching an A&amp;E show about young people with Down syndrome. She’s was like “oh hey mom, those people have autism right?” And as someone who might have autism I was so fucking insulted. I still am thinking about it.
