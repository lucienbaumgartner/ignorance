I’ve yet to see an HOA’s CC&amp;Rs that doesn’t require  an owner to obtain written approval/ permission from either the Board of Directors or an Architecture Committee (if one exists) prior to any remodeling/ modifications to a unit. 

It is also common for a condo with carpeting originally existing in upper units to include some limitations or restrictions regarding changing carpeting to hard flooring without approval from the HOA. Noise complaints are one of the most common reasons for lawsuits involving the HOA - something that they want to avoid at all costs. These rules are meant to protect the HOA more than they meant to protect the owners honestly.

It sounds like the situation you are in is the result of someone violating the rules possibly by taking advantage of the unit changing owners and the unit above knowing that would include some amount of time where the unit would be unoccupied to some extent which they saw as an opportunity to install hard flooring (knowingly in violation) but banking on the fact that nobody would be there to complain or would be new and unaware that the flooring was a recent change.
