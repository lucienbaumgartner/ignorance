&gt;I may abhor some of their views, but I also know they would go and have gone to the ends of the earth for friends and family.  

Not all, but most bad people will do that. Plenty of people returned from their jobs at the death camps, torture chambers, secret police, etc. with a gift for their kids and a gentle hug for their spouse. Treating a small handpicked group well is not evidence of good moral character.

If they're nice to anyone, that puts them above the most bestial monsters among humankind, but that's hardly a defense, right?

&gt;Do they say stupid shit?  Yup, but given their level of education and ability or lack there of to understand the world I get it.  Not all of us are capable of grasping the concepts we are expected to, and are for lack of a better term simple minded and unaware of it.

Honestly, as a special education teacher, inability is not a very good explanation for why people believe incorrect things. People with IQs in the 70's can't evaluate relative merits of different opinions very well on their own, but once people start getting into the 80's, which is below average, it's reasonable to expect people to understand moderate complexity arguments and their relative strengths, perhaps with light assistance.

Most people get things wrong because they don't give a shit. They're not intellectually curious, and they don't mind hurting innocent people if they're wrong.
