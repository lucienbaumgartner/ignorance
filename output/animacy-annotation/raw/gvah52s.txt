Is that a quote from Markle herself? It sounds like something she’d say, and it encapsulates how she viewed her “role” as perhaps the *prettiest* princess, even if she didn’t get the prettiest prince. You can just see those little gears moving in that little Markle brain: She’s the forlorn, beautiful girl who’s so innocent and unaware of her beauty. That other princess is a money-grubbing social climber who is intent on stealing not only her rival’s voice, but the entire kingdom! &lt;*gasp*&gt;   Never fear, though, our natural beauty also has the brains to vanquish the evil other-princess, regain her voice, and use her role to shine a light on politically-correct, politically advantageous issues, while funding her own freebies by marching designer goods to her adoring ~~f~~stans who can barely afford this innovative taxation plan, but darn it, our heroines **deserves** it! 


The End.
