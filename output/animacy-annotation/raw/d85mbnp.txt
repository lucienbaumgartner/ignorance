Voldemort hid from him.  Avoided Dumbledore at all costs out of fear.  Dumbledore hunted him for years but never got close.  

On top of that he suspected the horcruxes for a long time.  He knew killing voldemort would only delay him, horcruxes had to be found first.  And capturing him alive would have been near impossible.  It was better to hunt horcruxes while he was active and unaware that someone had found out his secret.

For example in their book 5 duel Dumbledore flat out toyed with him and only tried to kill time until the ministry arrived to see voldemort in the flesh.   This was also the only time they ever fought one on one if I remember right.
