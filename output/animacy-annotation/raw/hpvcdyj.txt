I’m also concerned on the “I don’t want to hear politics I just want my entertainment!!!” That is really ignorant and harmful. 

I’m also questioning on their attack on CLOY, because most of them were like “Ya’ll don’t like our Right Wing Queen but ya’ll love CLOY”. Right wingers hated CLOY because it smears the image of NK being an evil  country when it actually has normal village Korean people, the actual victims of the Kim Jong Un regime. Right wingers hated that after CLOY more young Koreans wanted to seek the NK people and understand what their citizen is like away from Kim Jong Un’s regime. 

Toxic ignorant I fans don’t understand that its the message of the drama that is in question. Creative changes always happened, but some changes sends different message to it’s history and that is harmful.
