I tried it when I first switched to btrfs. The first thing I did is to unplug a drive live to see what it would do. It did nothing.  Then I saw on their FAQ: "Currently, there is no support for monitoring of drives or pools in Rockstor. So the web-ui is simply unaware and incapable of notifying potential problems or failures.".  I finally built a normal Linux server with custom monitoring script. I personally think the first thing an distribution like Rockstor should do is manage and monitor the storage pool, before adding an apps system and other facy things.
