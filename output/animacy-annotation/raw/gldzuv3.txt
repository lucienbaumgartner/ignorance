a.      To clarify, Lexi stated many times (even to me) that she wanted to be cremated and to have her ashes spread in the ocean.
7)     Lexi was so beautiful. She had “stalkers” all over and in every town, she lived in. She was very naïve to it because she was so sweet and unaware of her energy. In Houston, she had two people (that I heard of) who followed her and would leave items at her door. She also had people who would heckle her in and out of her apartment. They moved to a gated community to provide more safety for her. At one point, even in their gated community condo they had a situation with men following her and harassing her at the pool and they had to involve security. A police report was filed.

I would like to add that I am a trained victims’ advocate for victims of domestic abuse and I have been for years.  By actually being around Tom and Lexi, and spending time with them, I never saw signs of abuse or even a controlling side of Tom. Of course, I could have missed it – it is never cut and dry. However, there are usually some signs – even quiet ones – that are present and I never picked up any of those.  It is also uncommon for a spouse to go from no abuse to choking their partner out. It is interesting to me that that is the one detail she would tell her friends and not mention anything else. That is also not typical for an abusive situation…

I am happy to answer questions that do not hinder the case. Please direct them to Brittany per: "-QB".
