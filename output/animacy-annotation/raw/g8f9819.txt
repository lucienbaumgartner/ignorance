You refute yourself by claiming Trump is a follower of Reaganomics. You should go listen to Reagan like you act like others should and try to have even a hint of self awareness. Reagan called for migrants freely moving across the border with Mexico, free trade, opening international relations, and subsidizing foreign defense to increase American influence abroad. Trump believes in the opposite of these things.  The only economic position they actually share is bribing farmers to vote conservative, they both passed outsized stimulus to farmers while decrying big government. This comment is so painstakingly stupid and unaware of what’s going on in the world it hurts. Reagan campaigned on foreign policy and an American led international order, Trump turned inward.

[Yeah this man and Trump sound so similar](https://youtu.be/VUXXw6xr4gI)...you’re the one who said to look at him speak so here you go
