if you thought i was implying its too expensive your brain isnt working right lmao.

im saying people making millions of dollars should probably be expected to not be brain-dead fucking stupid, and ignorant of literal facts because they can just buy their echo chambers now

i am genuinely stunned you literally thought i was insinuating the shot was costly, just because i mentioned millionaires.
