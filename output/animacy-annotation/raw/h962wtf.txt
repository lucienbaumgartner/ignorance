To remind you yet again:

&gt;يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِن جَآءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌۢ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوٓا۟ أَن تُصِيبُوا۟ قَوْمًۢا بِجَهَـٰلَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا۟ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَـٰدِمِينَ

&gt;"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful." (49:6)

There is a journalist by the name of Yvonne Ridley who had been captive by the Taliban but that alone resulted in her converting to Islam. I suppose, if all the propaganda and certain narratives were to be true, why is she then alive and why is she still Muslim despite she is no longer by the hands of the Taliban? (See: https://youtu.be/nFqtZd0y_0g) I'm obviously being rhetorical here.

Helping and supporting Muslims irregardless of the circumstances is from the Prophet teachings as referenced. Hence, you are the one being foolish and ignorant of Islam.
