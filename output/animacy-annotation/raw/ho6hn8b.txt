Physically your elf has the body of a 23 year old. They may have a bit more physical maturing to do or they might be physically mature, and could remain that way physically for a few centuries. Mentally, psychologically, and culturally your elf is basically going to be considered probably around 16 years old until they reach 100 years oldâ€”technically mature and aware, but woefully underdeveloped and unaware of their ignorance due to lack of experience and perspective.
