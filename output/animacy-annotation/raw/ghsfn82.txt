NTA You are amazing for raising your niece!

Both sister and BIL are awful for not seriously looking at her inability to care for their baby;  she should’ve had an IUD put in or her tubes tied or removed after realizing that she can’t properly raise her child.

I’m astounded that the BIL is happy that she’s pregnant again.

Yes, they should pay you as a nanny.  Please try to stay in your niece’s life if at all possible, though, because you shouldn’t feel guilty if something happens and they were keeping her from you.

Don’t let them make you question yourself.  After much self reflection in my mid-30’s, I had an IUD put in and chose never to have children, due to my having severe bipolar depression at times.  The next step is having my tubes removed so that I don’t even have that 2% chance of becoming pregnant.

Your sister and BIL are horrible.  The fact that they are so selfish and ignorant that they don’t care that they’re not even raising their own child, and now are bringing another child into it so soon, is just flabbergasting.  This has nothing to do with mental illness because the BIL doesn’t care that his wife isn’t taking care of their baby, and he isn’t either.

It also sounds like the BIL doesn’t care that your sister becomes violent and uses her bipolar as an excuse for it.  How will that bode for the child later on?  My mother was abusive at times when she was manic or depressed;  I sought help so that I’m not.  Your sister could get help, too, but apparently chooses not to. (I consciously chose to no longer throw things and lash out when I was in my 20’s, so it doesn’t take therapy to make changes.)

Be there for your niece.  Make sure that CPS stays on top of things if you don’t have access to the child/ren.  Keep being the good person that you are.
