sooo... you agree with Destiny here? That The United States was not founded as a broadly 'European' country, and what it means to be an American has changed over time, thus declaring any one group of immigrants as fundamentally non American is short sighted and ignorant of the past? because the debate is really about how Hispanic immigrants get unfairly blamed for crime due to a false perception that they are criminals, much like how the Irish or Italians were blamed, even though statistically Hispanic immigrants commit less crime than white citizens. The proposed reason for that discrepancy of perception is a racist bias against Hispanics. The same way as racists blamed the Irish.

Jon tron didn't even handle the concept that Italians and Irish faced insanely racist attacks comparing them to the worst 'black' stereotypes in this country, yet were able to integrate to the point of being accepted as full blown pure blooded 'white' Americans today. He didn't even see the point being made, that he is aligned with the same racist thinking of a hundred years ago but for a different group. so he very clumsily tried to disprove that original racism didn't exist? I don't even know, it was embarrassing.

If you actually watched it, I think you might see how clumsy and bad he was. It was like he never has confronted this kind of parallel thinking before and he panicked.
