If I get covid today as someone between 25-35 the odds of me needing to go to the hospital are lower then the odds of a sever reaction from the vaccine (not that the reaction is what I'm concerned about.) However if I had covid today as someone who is unvaccinated I would show symptoms and would self quarantine, but if I was vaccinated the symptoms could be so mild that I didn't know I was caring covid so I wouldn't know to quarantine. The vaccine only reduces the symptoms but it doesn't stop people from spreading it, and (at least in my opinion.) is more likely to cause people who have covid to be symptom free, and unaware that they should be in quarantine. ["those in the study carried as much virus in their noses as unvaccinated people do."](https://whyy.org/articles/what-is-breakthrough-covid-infection-how-can-i-avoid-it/) From the CDC.

If you can find a peer-reviewed study that shows the vaccine PREVENTS covid by more then 50% instead of just reducing the symptoms in the spirt of the 7th tenet I'll go get vaccinated tomorrow, and share the card to show I actually did it, but if all you have are links to show it makes the symptoms less severe I would rather have the full symptoms so I know to stay home to protect people like you who are immunocompromised. 

I'm not against the vaccine because I think it's some conspiracy by big farma. I'm against the vaccine because it was a rush job that wasn't subjected to the same level of review as the small pox vaccine, and I prefer the rights of the individual over the rights of the state.
