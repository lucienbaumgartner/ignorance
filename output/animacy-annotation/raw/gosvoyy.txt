I'm starting to believe that maybe we should bring back the *"levels"* of MGTOW. I don't recall why they fell out of use. It was a good idea from the start since it is obvious that MGTOW is like a spectrum, some are Monks on one end and at the other end we have the Red Pilled who are barely waking up. 

Nevertheless from the beginning MGTOW was always touted as *"That Movement of men who are swearing off women and forsaking relationships with them."*

Take [this article](http://wagner.edu/newsroom/files/2015/11/151115-Sunday-Times-UK-Meet-the-men-giving-up-on-women-Miles-Groth-quoted.pdf) from 2015 for example. Or [The Sexodus](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2014/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out-of-society/) article from the year before that. Then there is the infamous [Barbarossa video](https://youtu.be/dyenSX4XSZA) from way back in 2010 where he speaks of MGTOW in all but name. 

MGTOW actually has multiple origins, the one you are talking about is the origin of the moniker but it is not the origin of the spirit nor the movement itself. MGTOW existed before it had a name, when the label came out and gained some popularity it gathered momentum when pre-MGTOW Monks and offshoot MRAs all started to converge under this new term. In that respect, MGTOW originated in a similar manner as many springs converging to form a great river that has now started to overflow and flood other areas. 

I have also heard the phenomena called other odd names. "MGTOW" was the one that stuck and became the most popular because it served as a point of convergence among such a wide and disparate range of men who were all *"moving away"* from women and especially traditional *and* liberal values. It is a great middle finger to both the Left and the Right.

Perhaps we should bring back the levels to end this argument. And I say there should only be 4 Stages as thus:

Level 1. **Red Pilled and Aware**. When a man is aware of Female Nature but is still ignorant and unaware of Gynocentrism making him naive enough to believe in Blue Pilled principles of dating and relationships. This mas still believes in dating, relationships, and that Unicorns are rare but they exist. This is the stage where men enter the bargaining phase and believe that if they can just change a law. change an attitude, or change something about themselves then things will go back to the good old days not realize that there were never any good old days, it was all part of the delusion they are starting to wake up from.

Level 2. **Red Pilled and Weary**. Is knowledgeable enough about Female Nature and is aware enough about Gynocentrism that he reject all long-term/personal relationships with women. No dating, no co-habitation, no marriage. Is still interested in sex and flings and is willing to take those risks under the knowledge that they are indeed risks and is still willing to gamble on their hefty price. Men in this stage are still in the bargaining phase while slowly entering into the depression phase.

Level 3. **Red Pilled and Pissed.** This is the Red Pill rage phase where a man is more fully awake, aware, weary, and knowledgeable about the facts and the reality of both Gynocentrism and Female Nature. This man rejects all relationships with women: Dating, Flings, Casual Sex, friendships etc. He may or may not still retain the use of prostitutes though due to the finality of such a transactional act. This is the stage where a man is most vulnerable to snap back and tumble down the steps back into the Blue Pilled mentality or snap in the other direction and do something stupid. 

Level 4. **Red Pilled and Disciplined**. This is when men have come to terms with reality itself and have moved foreword with their lives, set new priorities for themselves, and have now completely rejected all females. Men at this stage are indifferent to women, feel no solidarity and no sympathy for them and have disciplined themselves to such a degree as to keep all of their interactions with females strictly to business. If a female does not benefit or advance any of his goals in any possible way she will not take up any of his attention - he will not give her the time of day. Men at this stage are ambitiously focused on their own quality of life, have discovered how to build meaning in their life and pursue their own best interests accordingly. Men at this stage know and understand peace and how to get it. This is the stage where a man is truly free. This is the stage where Monks and Veteran MGTOW are at.
