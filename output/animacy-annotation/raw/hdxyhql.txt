Yup, i did all but some family and I don't see them that often.  
I like my uncle, he's a total trump cultist but he's just so unbelievably fucking stupid and ignorant that i really get the feeling that his love of trump isn't what instantly drew the right to him, the racism. He is just so dumb he believes whatever fox news tells him to believe.   


I had some younger friends and just no excuses for them. I grew up in a majority mexican immigrant community. Trumps just breathtaking mask off racism directed at them just made supporting him totally transcend politics. These were people who heard that racism and were like "YES!! THATS MY GUY!". I cut them out of my life like a gangrenous limb.
