Mandating a vaccine for children to protect the elderly (the "vaccine" doesn't prevent infection or transmission....), against a virus that is virtually no threat to them, is completely backwards, irrational and ignorant of actual data.

 I think a lot of people just get off telling others what to do. And they love covid. It gives their boring pathetic lives some semblance of meaning or excitement.
