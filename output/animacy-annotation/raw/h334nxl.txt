I’m sorry this happened to you OP. I’m very concerned about my health as well. See my narc mom set me up with a narc husband but of course I was naive and unaware of narcissism. Really thought all my experiences were just “normal”. 

Oddly enough, it was different with a SO. He was far more overt than my mother who is covert. And he just couldn’t stop gaslighting me. That I broke into hives, and I’d never experienced that before, and then I got eczema all over my body, and it was painful. It was nothing like a rash, it just was dry and burned and was itchy all the time. I was just in this state where my body was almost like pushing the stress outwardly. 

After I left my narc the exes em a disappeared, not entirely tho, when I get stressed I do get flare ups. I just feel it’s more manageable now, and as a previous poster mentioned watching out for your triggers is a big part of the mental recovery. I have to admit that I’m really bad at talking myself off a ledge when I do run into triggers. Maybe that’s something a therapist (when I can afford one) would be able to help me with. Like coping mechanisms. I know seizures are totally different and obviously my situation and yours is totally different. But yeah, fuck them to hell. I often feel unwell internally, and I’m pretty sure I occasionally experience irregular heart beats, but I don’t know what to do when those occur.
