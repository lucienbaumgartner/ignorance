My point was a sarcastic response to your assertion that the NAP and libertarianism are new ideas, coming after the end of African slavery in the US. How did you miss all of that being the main point, and how is it a strawman to literally quote you and sarcastically imply you are completely wrong and ignorant of history?

The human species has specific character flaws which create predictable cycles. Greed and the vulnerability to corruption from power, combined with sloth, apathy, and collectivism for example. We have a spectrum of personalities, from people you just want to live and let live, to the extreme end of progress-seeking at all costs. Because of this, any attempts to apply a particular ideology, rule, or social structure to all fails into a loop:

Bondage -&gt; Spiritual Faith  

Spiritual Faith -&gt; Great Courage  

Courage -&gt; Liberty  

Liberty -&gt; Abundance  

Abundance -&gt; Complacency  

Complacency -&gt; Apathy  

Apathy -&gt; Dependence  

Dependence -&gt; Bondage

It's a kingpill paradox
