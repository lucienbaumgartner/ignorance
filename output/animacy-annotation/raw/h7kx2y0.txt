Concrete is also one of the worst construction materials in terms of climate change. A serious fuck ton of carbon goes into the atmosphere just to make the mix. I love concrete and is has been indispensable to humans for a very long time, but it’s coming time for a better alternative. 
Also wood can flex in a quake, brick and concrete don’t really like doing that too much. 

You can absolutely screw things into concrete but the process is a little longer and requires different tools. It also creates a hazardous dust. Silica is the new asbestos, my lungs have felt that first hand. 

Wood may burn but fire blocking in new construction has also changed a lot over the years. We don’t just ballon frame everything with huge open channels for fire to rip through. Each floor is now blocked off in the walls so fire takes much longer to spread. 

OP is emotional and ignorant of almost all things construction. Wood is a fantastic building material and the use of engineered beams, joists, and sometime even studs have only made it better and stronger.
