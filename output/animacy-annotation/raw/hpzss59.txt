I'd love for that kind of activity to be standard in schools and after school activities.

It wasn't just blindness. Some people had to hop on one leg. Some people had noise cancelling headphones. Some people weren't allowed to use their arms. It really opened everyone's eyes about physical disabilities as a whole.
I know we shouldn't have to be put in people's shoes to empathise with them. But children can be ignorant and selfish at times, and this kind of exercise really helped me develop empathy at an age where I was still learning about the world
