I'm sorry but you need to prioritize your children over your wife's dream and her 1st world problem melodrama. It sounds to me that she is a bit delusional and unaware of the reality of your guy's financial responsibilities. Sure she might be in need of emotional support but that does not mean her happiness is your responsibility, nor does it mean that building a whole house will necessarily make her happy if she can't be happy with what she already has. If she really is "just looking for emotional support" then you can give that in many other ways, but her implying that the ONLY way you can provide emotional support is by giving her her dream is plain manipulative, sorry. 
 If she wants to build a whole new house, how did she plan to contribute? Or was she expecting you to pay for the whole thing and for you to build the whole thing? I understand she only makes 10-14 K a year, and nothing is wrong with that if she's mostly a stay at home mom...but the financial stability falls onto you, you already pay for the bills and the wellbeing of the entire family as it is. She needs to understand that there's only so much one person can do making 100k a year, and making a house simply because her friend did and she thinks it sounds great is not a good enough reason to risk financial instability for you or your children, who I'm guessing you're planning to send to college. Paying off the bills and saving for three kids is already enough pressure as it is and she doesn't have to experience that. I find it wild how she is expecting you to pay for the majority of her expensive dream.
Sorry if this came off as judgemental but I really feel strongly that your wife is being somewhat self centered, delusional and ungrateful for the family unit and home that she already has. Her happiness is her own responsibility and not all dreams have to come true to be happy in life, especially if you guys are fortunate to have a home already. Many families don't even make 100k in a year..
