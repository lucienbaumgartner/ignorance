This has been obvious for sometime now.

To me, it seems more like some people just want it to fail in hopes to teach Game Companies some sort of "lesson".  Problem is, it's all fake action. It's just pitchforking. 

The same people will most likely eventually turn their attention to another upcoming game, and pre-order it. Then complain at the first sight/experience of problems, asking for their money back.

Seen this all before. As long as you continue to pre-order... Then it is what it is. No one forced you to pre-order. It's a choice. Sure you don't have to be happy. And have the right to voice your unhappiness. But consumers also have to look at themselves in the mirror. Make change/teach a lesson before games launch. Until they get the picture that, you don't trust them enough to hand over money beforehand. Impacting their wallet out the gate speaks volumes. It means they need to have their act together from the jump. 

Giving them your money beforehand, then being upset and wanting them to fail afterwards comes off as petty and ignorant. That doesn't teach anyone a lesson because it's the same practice over and over. You have to break the cycle for your point to get across.
