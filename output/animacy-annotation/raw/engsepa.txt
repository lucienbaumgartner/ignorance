Anytime I think about a strict adult from my youth who was rigid, stubborn, and ignorant that person is always a conservative Bible thumper. They were always the person who got enraged when you challenged their authority. And screamed at kids for being kids and clutched their pearls over everything. I never encountered a very liberal adult in my youth who made me feel like they were an authoritarian prick. Which really begs the question where do modern conservatives even get the idea that liberals are authoritarian. What experience of theirs informs this idea? 

It honestly seems like every time they say something like this it is based entirely on the fact that they aren't allowed to be racist.
