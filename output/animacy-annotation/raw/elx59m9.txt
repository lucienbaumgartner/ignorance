Stories like this absolutely baffles me and makes me furious, too.   


Like others, I agree that before one is stripped of their benefits after a shoddy "fitness to work" assessment by an equally unaware and incapable assessor, let alone DWP decision maker, benefits should only be stopped once a job has been lined up for said person and that they are able to keep down the job for some time.   


Stripping one of benefits on the basis that they can work and expecting them to find a job is ludicrous.   


Employers expect you to be in perfect health both physically and mentally, work like an automaton, have no days off for any reason and have years of experience and a PHD to boot.   


Any whiff that you may be slightly/any trouble at all and you're guaranteed that the job will go to a more abled body, for want of a better term.   


The amount of stress and grief that this causes to individuals with disabilities cannot be put into words and is often untold/unreported but the number of deaths, suicides, deteriorating mental health etc. tells us all we need to know.   


This is all in a vain attempt to save a small, insignificant amount of money from those who need it most, which not only costs far more in the long term (private tribunals, lost cases by DWP, constantly being taken to court etc.) but as aforesaid, takes a devastating toll on those who need it most.   


The sooner this government goes, the better and I hope the Conservatives implode once and for all.
