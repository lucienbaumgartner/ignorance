Texas and Florida for about a month all around both states. California and Nevada for about 3 weeks and New York City for a week. The massive amount of poverty and homelessness sort of made me think it’s a bit of a dump. Anyway I’m glad we both agree that there is no such thing as American culture. The sub cultures were mostly imported by guess who, Europeans! So calling them “American” is a bit of a stretch. Also your right I do have an elitist looking down on view off Americans. Tends to happen when your country gets bombed by them and the average American is so stupid and ignorant that they can’t remember it happening. I’ll be honest your country is good at one thing, getting involved in conflicts that don’t concern them and then “”withdrawing”” and letting your puppet governments get ganked after the military industrial complex has made it profit and an adequate number of young stupid teenagers have been killed fighting for muh democracy.
