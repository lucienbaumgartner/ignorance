Yeah good thing you didnt read that comment it was pretty stupid and ignorant of him to say such things. I believe more people are starting to understand it's a big problem and rather then hiding it because of the bad stigma they address it because it's more of a mental problem. The first time I went to an AA meeting for alcohol I heard stories about coke and heroin addicts and I thought I didnt belong there and even compared myself to them thinking I was better because my problem wasnt that bad. 2 years later my drinking problem got worse and eventually started doing alot of coke to the point I was broke, lost my job, and almost homeless. I took a chance to reflect and I realized the first time I was at the AA I should of listen to thier stories to understand how serious the problem is, not to judge and make comparisons. After going to jail and having to do rehab for a whole year I understood I was also ignorant at some point. That's why I felt it was necessary to explain and show a different perspective. I notice many people take it like a joke by saying "oh yeah I prefer Pepsi" but I'm sure if they knew someone close to them with the same problem they wouldn't think it's funny.
