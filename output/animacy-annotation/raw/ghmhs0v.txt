My wife had a good looking friend like that. She even lived with us twice. People that didn’t know her would talk about how lucky I was or if I was going to try to get a 3 way or other immature bullshit but I actively hated her for her immaturity, being a bad roommate, doing nothing to improve her situation and getting out of our house etc. these situations are a major reason why my wife isn’t friends with her anymore. You can’t be that selfish and unaware of your surroundings. It’s just taking advantage of people who tried to help you.
