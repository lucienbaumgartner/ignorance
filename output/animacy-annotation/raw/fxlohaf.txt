I have to laugh every time I hear someone talk about undocumented immigrants. "They should have come here legally." Anyone going through the process knows how laughable and ignorant that statement is. Most of them have no path here legally, and those that do go through the process get royally screwed. Canada is taking the right approach to this. Watch their economy grow and thrive as our circles the drain.
