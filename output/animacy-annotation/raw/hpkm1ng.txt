There is no reason for a Republican to vote for Bidenâ€™s agenda. You need to stop saying stuff like this. It is an ignorant and irrational statement.  

Also, if you think it is only Manchin and Sinema, I have a bridge to nowhere to sell you. There are many corporate dem senators from blue states hiding behind them.
