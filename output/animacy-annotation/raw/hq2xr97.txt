1. Without taxes the government can't do it's job of defending our lives and freedoms, therefore it makes sense to enforce a tax system

2. I don't agree with jury duty so that's a non-starter

3. Not obeying the law results in social chaos, therefore it makes sense to have a pllice force and justice system

4. Without a military a country can't defense itself and will inevitably be taken over by another one, therefore it makes sense to have a draft in the event that voluntary enlistment drops to severe enough levels

But voting isn't like these things. If some people don't vote, the country won't collapse. It might get really bad, but those non-voters will have to live with whatever outcome they helped create by not voting. That should be incentive enough to vote.

You wanna know something that happened in America last year? [A trans Satanist anarchist was elected as a county sheriff]. That's because the people living there were not paying attention to politics, didn't care about what was going on, they just walked into the voting booth and picked the name with the R next to it. *And we don't have mandatory voting here.* These were people who were ignorant and apathetic and *still chose to vote*. Imagine how many more people there are like that but we don't know because they have the decency to stay away from the polls.
