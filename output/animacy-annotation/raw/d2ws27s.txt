"Can be" is really important here, if they were hanging around the computers department I would hope they'd know about mechanical keyboards and PSUs, but in my store we keep those in the gaming department, which I only know because I was seasonal in gaming. There isn't much training about your specific department's products besides vendor specific training, you're basically just expected to know about what's in your department. It's likely they were just unaware and lazy, but some of us really do try to help our customers.
