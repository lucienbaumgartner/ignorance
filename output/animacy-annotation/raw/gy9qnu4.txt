Israel *claims* it was a building Hamas was using to gather intelligence.  I believe their statement was something to the effect of “towers and tall buildings can be used by Hamas militant forces for intelligence gathering an observation, thus making it a legal military target”.  Not the actually quote, but I remember it basically being a way for them to justify bombing any tower or building they see fit really.

I think you should look at the numbers.  Hamas launches salvos of like dozens rockets at a time, but only a couple actually hit their targets due to the defense system.  Whereas Israel air strikes don’t have a reason to miss.  That’s why there are hundreds of Palestinian casualties and only 8 Israeli civilians and 1 Israeli soldier dead.

Israel is getting slapped and they’re responding with an assault rifle.  It’s just all a bit disproportionate and ignorant of collateral damage
