Well assuming R + L = J, if Lyanna wasn’t kidnapped, there’s no way she was ignorant of what was happening in Westeros. Meaning she willfully allowed the lie that she was kidnapped spark a war that killed thousands of people. And prior to that, she chose to run off with a married man, causing her father and brother’s deaths, all to escape her own responsibilities and not marry Robert. And any point she could have revealed herself and told people she was alive, healthy, and just thought Robert sucked ass. 

This is true even if R + L =/= J, as long Rhaegar didn’t actually kidnap her. In all scenarios where Lyanna loved him and left willingly, she’s an irresponsible girl who ran away from her problems to help a man commit adultery because of “prophecy” and allowed a lie to cause a war rather than tell the truth.

The only way Lyanna isn’t a selfish POS is if Rhaegar was an even bigger POS and kept her completely isolated and unaware of the death and destruction their eloping caused.
