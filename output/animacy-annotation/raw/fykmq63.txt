Couple of halved Pete's in the old slow cooker with some sloppy Joe mix, sloppy hoppies, good eats. 

I commend you OP, and unfortunately you're right about the same people who decry hunters and those who raise and butcher their meat humanely are too spoiled and ignorant that their drive thru fast food and summer BBQ ribs from the big box grocer have far less moral efficacy, almost none really, than the sustained systems of conservationist hunting and free range home herds.

Sounds like y'all are living the dream there in Idaho.
