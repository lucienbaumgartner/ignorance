&gt;same as some autistic men (aspies) are attractive to women, because they are unaware and nonreactive to shit tests and passive aggressive behavior

I'm glad you mentioned that. I have observed this multiple times myself and in the past, and it was something I never understood.  But now, knowing what I know, it makes sense.  I remember a dude in high school that was tall, skinny and very average face but he had to be on the spectrum.  He had a very stoic, stiff demeanor with almost no charm or sociability. He even had a weird way of shifting his eyes that was very android like lol.  But  he was very quick with comebacks and delivered them in a dry and emotionless way. He did it in a way that made him come across as an arrogant dick who gave no shits.  But it was really just his particular Aspie cocktail that his brain formed.  Needless to say he had a quite a few girls trying to get with him. And he didn't understand when women would flirt with him.  He would practically shoo them away because it made him uncomfortable.  But the key was that he was so stiff that his discomfort wasn't visible. We were all bewildered as it made no sense since he was always just "that guy in class". But he wasn't even aware that he was getting those panties wet with his robotic social skills. His height also helped for sure.
