I am not “thrilled” that the murderers went to jail. A kid was killed and his loved ones have to deal with that loss forever. This isn’t happy, it shows that even an ounce of justice requires so much work.

The levity of pretending to be a dog and talking about this is disrespectful and ignorant of racist, genocidal history of the US.
