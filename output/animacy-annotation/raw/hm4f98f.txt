I just hate how people can be so careless and cavalier with others expensive possessions period. 

Years ago I bought a brand new SRT-4. It had less than 100 miles on it. My GF, now wife, took it for a spin and stopped at the local grocery store. She wanted it get out check the car out figure out some of the features (haha fooled her neons didn't have features). She parked way out in no man's land away from everyone when this older man in a slightly lifted truck parked next to her opened his door and it gently bumped our car door. No damage but boy did she ever read him the riot act. What the hell is he doing in a vehicle like that if he can't even open the door without hitting another car. WTF did he park next to her when the lot was empty. If he didn't move his truck and apologize she'd make sure he needed a new hip....etc etc etc. 

She was mad. All of that Filipino rage pouring out. I like to think she made an impact on his poor parking and driving decisions. She said he didn't see!mTo be doing it on purpose just totally unaware and aloof.  He was very apologetic and just took it from her and let her get it out of her system.  He said she was right and he'd pay for damages if there were any. There weren't so they each went their way.
