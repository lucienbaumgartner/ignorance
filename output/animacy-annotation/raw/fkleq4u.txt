No, what I am saying is that the vast majority of people suffer from conditions like clinical depression, social anxiety, autism, physical disabilities and deformities, and some from all of the above.  The bullshit advice about hygiene, jobs, social events, and such are not going to help those people because they have much bigger issues that you, if you will have the humility to admit it, don't have an answer for.

Most of the people here live with these conditions for most of, if not their entire, lives and they haven't been able to figure out a way out.  Medical professionals who have spent their careers researching these issues haven't found fixes for them either.  And yet you and the other normies here think they can be solved by just going to more social events and taking a shower?  Do you see how arrogant and ignorant that sounds?  How ignorant and arrogant YOU sound?

I've noticed that plenty of people who offer this advice get incredibly defensive and rude when they are educated about the actual issues that people here face and rather than humbling themselves and listening, prefer to be insulting and just generally acting like a complete dick.  I'd ask which path you are going to take, but if the past is any indication, pretty sure you are going to double down and go with option #2, proving that neither you, nor any of the people who come here, had any intention of offering help in good faith and just came here to hurt people.
