If that’s how you feel. From what I’ve seen you say, you sound naive and unaware of what’s actually happening. Now do I think we’re going to get Dame, Zion or Luka? No, we probably aren’t, and I don’t think we should. But the fact is that all 3 players are rumored to be unhappy in their situations and could demand a trade. New York is one of the biggest markets in the NBA and has one of the largest cap room this off season, the Knicks are one of the most likely to make a big move like one of these. You’d know that if you listened to more than just one podcast or expanded to nba rumors rather than just Knicks rumors. BTW, I can argue civilly, but you wanted to come at me like an ass hole and what goes around comes around.
