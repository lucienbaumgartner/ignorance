I’m a Pisces sun scorpio moon so I feel like I get scorpios more than the average person. When people think of fixed water they think deep ocean or decaying swamp but liquid water is not fixed, liquid water still takes the shape of its container. Scorpio is ice. Solid ice. Are you gonna make an ice sculpture or go ice skating with the Scorpio? cause they like that. Or are you going to break through the ice and drown or be careless and unaware of your surroundings and get killed by an icicle? My point is that ice is fragile and breakable and dangerous but only if you’re careless so stay off the ice when it’s to thin watch out for the falling icicles, simple really.
