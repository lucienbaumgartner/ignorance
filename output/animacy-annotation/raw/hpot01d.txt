You’re delusional if you think that you’re not affected by these things.

You don’t need to pay attention to ads to have your consciousness manipulated by them. It is subliminal. Unless you walk around with your eyes closed and  your fingers in your ears, you’re being manipulated. That’s a fact.

Not using social media does not make these problems go away. You’re the one living in your own bubble.

Guess what, even if you don’t pay attention to something the problem is still there. You can choose to be ignorant to all of the problems in our society, and pretend that the world will be okay, but that’s not how it works.

I never equated Trump with Hitler, I said AKIN TO, and if you don’t agree with that statement then you simply don’t understand populist politics. I suggest you read up on it because populism is all politics is nowadays.

To pretend that an assault on Washington DC is nothing more than “a couple of hundred dickheads” and not serious, systemic issues that threaten national and international stability is fucking ignorant and insulting.
