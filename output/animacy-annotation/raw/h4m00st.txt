&gt;Kate questioned why OP wasn't motivated by her, to want to give more,

I.....I......ðŸ˜³ I just can't get over how selfish and ignorant that question is. I would NEVER ask my husband why he wasn't motivated by me because someone else gave their wife a better ring/car/gift. How fucking crass and greedy a question like that sounds. ðŸ˜’
