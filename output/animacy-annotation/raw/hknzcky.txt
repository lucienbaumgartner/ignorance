Can't argue with how Abrahamic religion helped unite people into developing civilization and general civilized societies. That's how strong it can be to bring people together, seeing as how it can be psychologically manipulated into making people commit acts of great altruism or great evil by having them think and believe it's done in the name of a god or other being that will be pleased by their actions.

Yeah, Islam is pretty damn awful too, more openly and obviously so given how they're more strict with how they treat their followers, laws and women.

I am largely ignorant and unaware of the full picture of religion. What else do you know and what are the most valuable things you've learned and studied throughout religious history, culture and tradition?
