Reading comprehension is the crux of the problem. I don't see how your lack of it is an insult. If you told me I'm a bad speller, you'd be stating a fact, same as me calling out your poor reading comprehension is just stating a fact. If it's less insulting to you, I can spare your feelings and maybe try to find a more agreeable synonym. Do you have a recommendation that will spare your ego a little more than saying you have bad reading comprehension?

I realize you're not going to make me cease, because you can't. Plus your responses are actually so terrible and often so naive and ignorant that it's almost fascinating to see your flailing and attempts to construct falsities.
