When my daughter was that small, I would tend to agree. Something about them being that small and unaware that makes it seem wrong. Cheeks, oh yes. Lips, naaah. She's 2 1/2 now and when she wants to give daddy a kiss, you'd best believe I'm puckering up. Nothing better in the world than a hug, a kiss and the words "I love you daddy".
