Please excuse the second reply however I want to make a slightly different point.

Most people are uneducated and unaware of how far back the court rulings go that it's set up our current system. 

it's the same way that most people are unaware that something like social security is actually considered a tax and not a right or a benefit

you'd be amazed at the number of people who refuse to believe me when I tell them they have absolutely no right to their social security money.

in the end this was how the supreme Court ruled on Obamacare when they said it was okay because they ruled that it was simply a tax in the government has the right to impose taxes. however the corollary based on older decisions means that you would have no right to any of that money or the care that you think it's supposed to buy

it is actually possible to educate people and have them be more informed about what's going on. you have to remember our education system isn't designed to educate people it's designed to socialize people and produce compliant obedient workers

I believe that being obsessed with change rather than angry about peripheral things is the only way to find solutions and create actual change
