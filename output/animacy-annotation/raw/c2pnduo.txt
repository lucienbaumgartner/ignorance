Very interesting, thanks for doing the AMA. I have a few questions:

1. You mentioned that you will eat spoons while out at DQ with friends... Do they notice? What are their reactions to this, or the reactions of people who notice for the first time?

2. You said you will sometimes eat erasers if you're "not paying attention" and that you will eat DQ spoons without even realizing. So, is this condition typically manifested when you are pre-occupied and unaware that you are doing it, or are you sometimes genuinely hungry or craving the items?
