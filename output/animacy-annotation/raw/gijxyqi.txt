I was unaware and curious so I did some searching. Snopes has [a decent etymology](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/handicaprice/) if anyone else wants to read about it. Apparently before horse racing it referred to a lottery game called "hand-in-cap." Either way, it was a word that was being used for hundreds of years before it was associated with the disabled.
