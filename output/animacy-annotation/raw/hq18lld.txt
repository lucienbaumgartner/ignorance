I would really wish people would be less judgmental and more understanding of other people’s life circumstances. I have to travel internationally for work and the majority of the people I see on the airplane are in the same situation, obviously I would prefer to not be traveling around, avoiding the lines, the tests, the health risk, etc. But I cannot, because I have responsbilities toward my employees and my clients  and I wouldn‘t be doing anyone any favours by just closing down the business and sending 100s of people to unemployment.   


Reading people like yourself basically wishing travelers death is really so ignorant and evil, that I just wish you all the best in life, because with that attitude you certainly need all the help you can get.
