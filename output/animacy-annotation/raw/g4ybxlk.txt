Is it fair that disabled people who can't work can't have their basic needs and shelter met because some lazy abled people would rather do a different job than they are currently doing? Is it fair that automation is going to replace most people's jobs in a few decades and there literally won't be enough work for everyone to work 40 hours a week? Why are we trying to work more than we have to? Is it fair that you're more likely to live in poverty if you're disabled? Is it fair that just because a small % of the population is lazy and wants to apparently, just mooch of the government, even though technically spending money is actually contributing to the fucking economy but forget that for a minute, is it fair that my community is literally starving to death, literally unable to afford shelter during Covid-19, just because SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ABUSE A BASIC INCOME PROGRAM? 

EVEN THOUGH STUDIES PROVE THAT ISN'T WHAT FUCKING HAPPENS? 

IS IT FAIR THAT DISABLED PEOPLE DIE JUST BECAUSE ABLED PEOPLE ARE SO PRIVILEGED AND IGNORANT THAT THEY BELIEVE ALL PEOPLE CAN MAGICALLY OVERCOME DISABILITIES THAT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BASIC FUNCTIONS OF LIVING, LIKE EATING, SLEEPING AND USING THE TOILET, SO WE SHOULD ALSO MAGICALLY BE ABLE TO WORK, ON TOP OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER BASIC NEEDS, SHELTER AND NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES?

IS IT FAIR THAT THERE ARE A TON OF HOMELESS PEOPLE UNABLE TO WEAR MASKS AROUND, USING WHAT LITTLE MONEY THEY HAVE TO FEED THEMSELVES WHILE LIVING ON THE STREET ALL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS TOO SELFISH TO REDESTRIBUTE WEALTH APPROPRIATELY AND IN A WAY THAT HELPS EVERY SINGLE FUCKING CANADIAN IN THE DAMN COUNTRY BY PREVENTING COVID-19 FROM SPREADING?

IS IT FAIR I CAN'T AFFORD MY MEDICATION, BASIC NEEDS OR SHELTER AND COULD DIE ANY FUCKING DAY BECAUSE PRIVILEGED PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP THEIR DAMN MONEY INSTEAD OF HELPING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND MAKING EVERYONE'S MONEY WORTH MORE BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WORKS BETTER WHEN MONEY DOES NOT STOP MOVING?

IS IT FAIR I KNOW 12 YEAR OLDS WHO PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR DISABLED MOTHER CAN'T AFFORD FOOD, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ADHERE TO THEIR ON HUMAN RIGHTS CODE?

IS IT FAIR THAT NATIVE PEOPLE ARE SHOT WHEN ANSWERING THEIR DOOR DURING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS?

IS IT FAIR THAT POLICE SCARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH TO JUMP OFF A BALCONY BECAUSE THEY AREN'T SENSITIVE TO THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES MINORITIES HAVE WITH POLICE AND SO THEY ASSUME THAT ANXIOUS BEHAVIOR DUE TO FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE IS A THREAT TO THEM, WHDN IN REALITY PEOPLE ARE JUST AFRAID FOR THEIR LIFE AND SHOULD BE BECAUSE THE POLICE ARE MORE LIKELY TO KILL PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAN TO ACTUALLY DEESCALATE THE SITUATION AND SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE, LIKE THEY'RE FUCKING SUPPOSED TO.

IS IT FAIR THAT I AM IN PAIN EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY BECAUSE AN ADULT MAN RAPRD ME AT AGE 5 WITH AN ADULT MALE PENIS IN MY VAGINA AND MY ANUS, SO NOW I HAVE SEVERE PTSD AND CHRONIC PAIN, I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MY BASIC NEEDS BECAUSE OF THIS, I CAN'T AFFORD MY MEDICAL EXPENSES, I CAN'T AFFORD FOOD AND I CAN'T AFFORD SHELTER, IS THAT FUCKING FAIR?

WHERE IN THE FUCKING WORLD IS ANYTHING FAIR UNLESS WE MAKE IT SO? VALUE YOURSELF ENOUGH TO BELIEVE YOU DESERVE BASIC NEEDS AND SHELTER FOR FUCKS SAKE OR ONE DAY, YOU VERY WELL MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS FOR THEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PROTECT YOUR OWN RIGHTS BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT PREJUDICE WOULD STOP AT DISABLED PEOPLE.

IS IT FAIR THAT RIGHT NOW IF WE MAKE HALF OF THE POVERTY LINE WE LOSE DISABILITY BENEFITS?

IS IT FAIR WE CAN'T TRANSITION FROM DISABILITY BENEFITS INTO THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE THE CUT OFF IS SO LOW, WE LITERALLY CAN'T WORK OR WE CAN'T AFFORD THE SHITTY QUALITY OF LIFE WE HAVE NOW?

IS IT FAIR THAT WE CAN'T LIVE WITH PARTNERS OR WE LOSE OUR SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND FORCE SAID PARTNER, EVEN IF WE'RE NOT COMMON LAW, TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT SAID DISABLED PERSON?

IS IT FAIR THAT IF THE DISABLED PERSON IS ON THE LEASE AND ROOMMATES PAY PART OF THE RENT BUT ARE NOT ON THE LEASE THAT THEIR RENT PAYMENT COUNTS AS ROOMER INCOME FOR THE DISABLED PERSON WND REDUCES THEIR INCOME BY 60 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR, THEREFORE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR DISABLED PEOLE TO STAY ON A LEASE WITHOUT RISKING THEIR SOCIAL ASSISTANCE THEREFORE FORCING THEM INTO AN UNFAIR POWER DYNAMIC WITH WHOEVER HOLDS THE LEASE?

IS IT FAIR THE SAME THING HAPPENS IF A DISABLED PERSON OWNS THE HOME?

IS IT FAIR THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT RENT ISN'T COVERED BY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY WON'T ALLOW A ROOMMATE SITUATION UNLESS SAID DISABLED PERSON IS IN THE VULNERABLE POSITION?

IS IT FAIR PEOPLE WITH CANCER HAVE TO WORK TO MAINTAIN BENEFITS THAT COVER THEIR MEDS, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE LITERALLY DYING, BECAUSE DISABILITY DOESN'T CONSIDER THEM DISABLED ENOUGH, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE WORKING THEMSELVES TO DEATH TO AFFORD MEDS THAT PROLONG THEIR LIFE SO THEY CAN KEEP KILLING THEMSELVES AT A JOB THAR KEEPS THEM ALIVE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO BARELY SURVIVE BECAUSE GOD'S FORBID SOMEONE DYING OF CANCER BE ALLOWED TO STOP WORKING AND ENJOY THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF THEIR LIFE?

IS IT FUCKING FAIR THAT THE MORTALITY RATE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE IS SO HIGH NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS BUT BECAUSE OF OUR ECONOMIC STATUS?

IS IT FAIR THAT WE DIDN'T GET ANY BENEFITS DURING COVID-19 UNLESS WE WERE ABLED ENOUGH TO WORK? YES EVEN THE DISABLED $600 REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PENSION FROM WORKING OR WORKING ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR DTC, WHICH NO SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AMOUNT HITS SO WE LITERALLY CAN'T USE IT UNLESS WE ARE ABLED ENOUGH TO WORK?

IS IT FAIR THERE AREN'T ACCESSIBILITY AVAILABLE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE TO COMPLETE SCHOOL BECAUSE THE WORK FORCE IS LITERALLY MADE FOR ABLED PEOPLE?

IS IT FAIR MOST PEOPLE ON DISABILITY SUPPORTS CAN'T AFFORD MENSTRUAL SUPPLIES?

IS IT FAIR?

NONE OF IT IS FUCKING FAIR AND IT WILL JUST GET WORSE IF WE DON'T TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO MEET BASIC NEEDS, SHELTER AND NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR EVERY SINGLE CANADIAN, THE ONLY REASON WE DON'T BECAUSE SOME ABLED PEOPLE **MIGHT** NOT TRY TO WORK.  SO PLEASE TELL ME AGAIN HOW MARGINALIZED PEOPLE SHOULD PAY FOR PRIVILEGED PEOPLE'S GREED AND HOW FUCKING FAIR THAT IS.
