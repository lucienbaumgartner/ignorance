Every "kids show/movie" has adult themes and jokes in it for the poor parents of the bastards watching it.

Don't believe me? Watch earlier seasons of Spongebob, or any other cartoon. To say they are "for kids only" is intellectually dishonest and ignorant of how animation is a form of media and entertainment consumable for almost all age groups.
