&gt;how can you explain people who didn't vaccinate are doing fine while people who fully vaccinate are dying ?

Quite easy to explain.  You're making it up.

&gt;if the vaccine is so great why people are dying from covid than ?

Because most of the people dying didn't get it.  Also, no one said the vaccine is 100%.  You can still get it and die.  Just like you can wear your seatbelt, get airbags, get cars with anti-locking brakes, brand new tires, crumple zones, then still die in a car accident.  Shit happens but rarely.

&gt;When they released the vaccine they say it's for people who have weak immune system now they injecting everybody including babies,how many children died from covid after getting the shot ?

Yes, they said that people more likely to die go first.  Why is that such a puzzle for you.  Also, how many children died from covid getting the shot?  No one knows.  Share a source if you have it.

&gt;Too many questions that no one can answer including lab doctors who made the vaccine

They have answered these.  You're just choosing to ignore the answers.

&gt;People simply said "release something that is 100% and i will take it and stop treating people like rat labs"

Nothing is ever 100% and if someone tells you that it is, run, because they're lying and trying to deceive you.  If you need something to be 100% that won't kill you, water can kill you, as well as food.  So can driving (especially in Tunisia) and that includes just going outside as you can get cancer from the sun.  You can also die by not going outside and by not eating and by not drinking water.  You're uneducated and willfully ignorant and I get it, it's easier for someone to change the facts to fit their personal reality than to look at something that changes their stance but you're wrong.  You're wrong and you need to re-evalute your stance.
