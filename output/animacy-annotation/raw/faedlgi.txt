Like insecure, self-absorbed, unaware and unempathic cackling hyenas. That's how I see them. Bullies.

It helps when you stop giving a shit about everyone. And I mean that as in, their opinions. I see how fragile their egos are, they can joke all they want. It amuses me now. Respect yourself, love yourself. Your tribe exists even if we are spread out it seems.ðŸ‘Š
