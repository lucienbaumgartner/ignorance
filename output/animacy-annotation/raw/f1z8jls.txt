I've said it elsewhere and I'll keep saying it until something changes.

We all know the real problem is that the "board" of directors and owner of our club have absolutely no clue what premier league football is in 2019, and what is required to be successful in it. If they did they wouldn't of hired Bruce in the first place, but they're lazy, arrogant, and ignorant. 

That said, the utter incompetence and disinterest of the clubs off-field management doesn't completely excuse the the on-field performance. Whilst I'm not going to get on the back of players too much, as being directed by the statistically and objectively worst head coach in the league must be a miserable experience, as a team their lack of effort yesterday was embarrassing. 

Lets put things into perspective with our head coach. Steve Bruce was a pretty below average manger in his absolute prime, and he is way way way past that stage of his career now. He's been left behind by the sport and every single one of the players know this, so how on earth anyone could expect him to motivate them into anything other than a mediocre performance where we scrape result here and there?

The players don't have a clue what the game plan is beyond the first 15 minutes of a game, or the first time something goes wrong (whichever comes first). That is unarguably Bruce's role as the head coach, the buck absolutely stops with him. Everyone going around and saying, "don't blame Bruce, blame Ashley" need to pull their fucking head out their arse. As bad as Ashley is, and as bad as his direction of the club has been, you cannot side step the shit show we're seeing each week and refuse to hold the dinosaur Bruce accountable for simply not doing his job well enough.
