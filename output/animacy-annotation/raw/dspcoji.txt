I wished that he had of explained his condition to people earlier than the Oprah interview. But at the same time I can understand why he wouldn't want to tell the whole world about his personal life and his private medical record. A skin disorder like vitiligo can make a person so self conscious about their appearance, especially a person like Michael who is already a sensitive person and is also always under media scrutiny. 

It's so odd to me how people are unaware and ignorant that a skin disorder like vitiligo even exists. I know a few people who thought he bleached his skin, which is just ridiculous. Vitiligo is a surprisingly common skin condition, I've even seen several people out and about who have it, hell, my local barista has it.
