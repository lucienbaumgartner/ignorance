She wants to rub oils on him.

to treat his testicular cancer.

Where was she planning on rubbing the oils?

Your MIL is a very dangerous and stupid woman. Testicular cancer is one of the cancers that is fully treatable when caught and treated appropriately, if your bf puts it off to try MIL's snake oil he's going to end up past the point of easy treatment and could end up losing both his testicles or worse. Can you get your bf to talk to a testicular cancer support group before MIL achieves her goal of killing her son?

Personally I would say screw the relationship between you and her and call her out by telling her that the advice she is giving her son is dangerous, stupid and ignorant, that she needs to actually be a parent and support her son while he goes through this and listen to the people who actually know what they're talking about and who are doing what is best for your bf and not what makes them feel good about themselves.
