Orange man unfortunately isn't dumb (he wouldn't have been so wealthy and wouldn't have it made to presidency).

He's actually quite smart, just extremely selfish and ignorant, that combination makes him toxic and say stupid things, but he simply isn't dumb.

He's a 'self-made man', one of the living legends of 'the American dream'. America makes their people believe in 'the American dream', since he is one of those, he 'must be the best capable person for running the country', because in American culture he simply is the maximum one can be.
