Your quiz asked questions related to how people think about and act around people with "mental disorders". Although I get that it's meant mostly for people who are mostly unaware and indifferent towards mental health, grouping hundreds of mental disorders made it tough to answer these questions. For example, people with depression or autism aren't anymore dangerous than any other person, but people suffering from schizophrenia can definitely be dangerous. Maybe add an option of "depends on the illness"?
