I understand that- I was a social worker there. I’ve literally given narcan to kids in middle and elementary school who were using opiates- naive to what they were actually doing.  Just because a group of people are unaware and uninformed doesn’t mean they deserve to die because of it.  No one wants to be an addict- and I guarantee none of the people there purposely set out to become one.  If given the proper care, information and resources, I’m sure that  in time that it will be completely different there.
