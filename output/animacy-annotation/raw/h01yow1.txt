I hope you have this same kind of energy when Koil mocks individuals who attempt to point out the frustrations of other crims, or Andrews who, even as far back as 2.0, acts like he is always completely shocked and unaware that people are complaining.

2.0 you had cops who would shoot gas tanks because they were scuffed and blew up quickly. Same for tires. They continued to do it, even after agreeing not to. Same for hot drops in locations crims couldn't get to, and places their weapons couldn't reach.

Fast forward to 3.0 and you have things that cops are agreeing to not do, and still continuing to do.

And then you have people like you who wonder why crims are venting publicly about being ignored constantly and things never changing?
