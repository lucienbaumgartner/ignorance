Pure whataboutism. This entire post has nothing to do with Trump. But YOU decided that Trump was relevant. I’m still waiting for you to explain what Trump has to do with what Biden said on stage and Boebert calling him an idiot for him saying it. 

You need help, just let Trump go man, you can’t blame him forever for everything, you are going to have to face reality that saying “but Trump” makes you look ignorant and sad.
