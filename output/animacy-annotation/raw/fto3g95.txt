&gt;Hopefully more young women will wake up to how ingrained misogyny is 

That sounds like a victim complex. Why not empower women instead of teaching them that they are perpetual victims? Instead of teaching them to fear men why don't you teach women to defend themselves? teaching girls to fear their own shadow will not make them safe, it will make them paranoid and stunt their initiative and result in them being even more timid and victimized by actual predators who specialize in honing in on vulnerable behavior. 

I taught my younger sisters how to hold their own against men twice their size and I encourage them to be aggressive in their own defense. I feel better as a Man when I know I do not have to be a perpetual protector and that I can count on the women of my family to be able to hold their own. I taught them vigilance and resilience as I would teach any man and as I also taught my younger brothers. I have also shown them how not to care about what people think but to take the thoughts and feelings of others *under consideration* nonetheless, otherwise they'd be socially unaware and inept.
