Tuberville also did not know what the 3 branches of the US government are.  The voters of Alabama voted in a senator who is uneducated and ignorant of how government works.  Tuberville will probably have to hire a taxpayer funded aide to guide him to his capital office - when he decides to actually go into the office.  Football coach does not mean qualified senator.
