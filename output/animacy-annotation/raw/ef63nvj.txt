Yeah we don't know it's misogyny. There is a very limited number of jokes that are ok for an impartial presenter to make about a guest on their political show, on the BBC, to the audience before the show, off air and while the butt of the joke is unaware and unable to respond though. Most jokes even if they are not sexist and racist would not be suitable in that situation.
