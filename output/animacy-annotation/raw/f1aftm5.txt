Well, addiction to an anti-anxiety med prescribed when your wife has terminal cancer with extreme physical withdrawals that you weren't aware of seems a bit different than deciding to cope with a situation with heroin, which is known to be dangerous, highly addictive and have awful physical withdrawals. Obviously, some people are unaware and uneducated about these effects which is not what I'm talking about.  A lot of OP's statements are this or that, black or white. If you "clean your room" (and why not, who gives a fuck if people clean their room if they think it helps them), than you don't care about societal issues and don't think there's any systemic problems, which is just not the case with the majority of people.  Why not both, think you can take control and improve your life in some ways while also being aware of problems at a larger scale?
