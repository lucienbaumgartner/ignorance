Okay so, I may be freaking ignorant here, and I may be giving the friend the benefit of doubt but I’ve also asked friends to teach me how to play something on an instrument. Like, I consider you a friend, you play an instrument, I would love to learn how to play something, can you teach me? What’s wrong with that? The hour session? It takes time to learn an instrument. The wife’s undying jealousy? I don’t understand why OP has to put so much effort and thought on how to treat this friend because his wife is jealous. Like if this was a guy, would she bat an eye on how he acted at all? But the fact that it’s a woman, OP has to treat her differently FOR his wife. 

I know I’m going to get grilled for this, and possibly I’m just too immature or ignorant or lack compassion for the wife to understand at the moment. But I feel like OP wasn’t in the wrong at all. Why does he have to stop treating her like how he would treat any friend because his wife is jealous. I never understood that. Like is there no trust? 

It would be a completely different story if she came onto him. And OP was just oblivious to it while the wife wasn’t. But to me, from what I read, it just sounds like a girl new to town who met this cool couple and wants to be friends.  But I guess I’m ignorant and naive.
