The Global Slavery Index (2018) estimated that roughly 40.3 million individuals are currently caught in modern slavery, with 71% of those being female, and 1 in 4 being children.

When I hear people even comedically worry about humans being enslaved by robots, I can't help but want to punch them in the face. To theoretically talk about total enslavement without even thinking about the fact that your comfort is due, somewhere along the line, to someone's real suffering in forced, unpaid work from which they can't escape is proof of how fucking ignorant people are to the service and economies. 

Robots have already taken over us, in that the internet, phones, social media, gaming, has made us so numb and ignorant that we allow ourselves to continue to take part in a system where we allow the most vulnerable humans to be treated like robots.
