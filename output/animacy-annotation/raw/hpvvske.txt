No, I actually love history. 

My plan has always been to transfer from community college tbh. Ideally, I would have loved to have to gone to the bigger SUNY school, but I knew realistically that I'd end up in the community college. Which, like I said, was fine until I realized that my teachers seemed horrible. My history professor really came off as very ignorant and uneducated imo. He said things that seemed Islamaphobic and racist, and I remember once he said something about how there are no problems in Canada or whatever. Which upset me because my family is First Nations and the issues with the residential schools and everything. And just seems to me that if you're going to teach history, you should just be informed about the current events that are likely to become history???? 

I didn't really lose patience with my English professor until she spent an entire class teaching us about the love languages, and she kept saying really.......Not inappropriate but just like Christian things that make me uncomfortable because I'm a Pagan and had very traumatic experiences in church growing up. She told us we were a blessing and she would be praying for us, and it was just like super awkward because her religion liked seeped into the lessons. 

And I couldn't transfer out of either of the classes and I was like really worried if the information I was learning was accurate, and having tension headaches almost every day. 

But I don't have a problem with community colleges. Just that community college because it seems like they don't screen their faculty very well imo.
