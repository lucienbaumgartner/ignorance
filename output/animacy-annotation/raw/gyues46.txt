&gt;Lol one group is endlessly attempting terrorist attacks with the explicit mantra that they will not end until they kill all the jews.

Exactly, one group. Not all of Palestine. 

&gt;The other group responds with force that absolutely does have some collateral damage, but is always in response to armed attacks from the genocidal group. You're being so disingenuous if you're calling the jews the genocidal ones. 

&gt;**That is literally delusional and ignorant of reality.**


Ohhhh it certainly is. 

They're indiscriminately bombing civilians, it's a war crime you're attempting to justify.  I'm sorry, 60+ kids isn't a bug it's a featur. 

And you're also ignoring the other facts on the ground, like Palestinians being pulled out of their homes beaten(if they're lucky) and imprisoned in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
