Sorry but if it really has to do with Leave and Remain positions then the numbers don't make any sense. Sure, Labour could go full on remain, but at this moment their policy is custom's union, single market, and referendum on the final outcome. If it truly is because they're not full on remain then it doesn't make sense that Johnson is polling higher than Corbyn, given Johnson's agenda is very clearly to go for no-deal. Anything Corbyn is offering - which would never be a no-deal Brexit - should place him higher than Johnson. 

These numbers don't make sense if they're due to the Brexit situation. It's either that or people in Scotland are just wildly unaware and uneducated in what Labour's position actually is.
