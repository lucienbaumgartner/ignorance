It's up to you. You can add as much extra information as you like to the form and I've included over 100 pages before. You could put that you have possible autism and then list your symptoms and how it affects your life. It's a point based system and you get no points for a diagnosis but you do get points if you need someone to remind you to eat and drink several times a day, most days or you need someone with you when you leave the house, most days, as you can become distressed which can result in you becoming lost and confused and unaware of dangers around you such as moving vehicles. A friend or family member that provides support or care to you can back you up as can your GP. You need to really word the answers carefully including what can happen and examples of what has happened if you don't have appropriate support or care.
