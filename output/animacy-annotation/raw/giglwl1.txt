I think, I prefer a compromise solution: "Women/Men and other people who (Insert relevant thing)". Therby transgender people/ non-binary people of the respective AGAB (and intersex people with the respective feature) are still included without being misgendered, while it is still plainly understandable enough for peiople with poor anatomical knowledge (like, half the women in the UK don't know what the cervix is [https://www.jostrust.org.uk/node/666780#\_ftn1](https://www.jostrust.org.uk/node/666780#_ftn1) meaning the "people with a cervix should go to cervical screening"-type language will just leave them utterly confused and unaware that they are supposed to be adressed)
