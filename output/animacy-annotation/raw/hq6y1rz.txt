&gt; Personally I would take it as a red flag and a "fuck you" if a company wants to treat any tiny amount of a raise as a big deal that you'll only get every couple years after begging for one. Extremely ignorant and short sighted in this field right now too

This, doubly so considering how the last year has been in tech. Most people are leaving their jobs for massive raises in the last year. My company preemptively went out and gave extra raises to people who had been in their position for a long time without a raise

It's insane to me that companies are that short sighted they're saying no to COL raises. They're going to be paying 30% more to a new developer because they didn't want to give OP 3%
