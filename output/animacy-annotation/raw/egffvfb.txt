You may well be right. I am not familiar with that particular area of the country, but in my travels there are two types of anti-Kap people: (i) those who are just so sheltered and ignorant that they buy the line that he is "disrespecting our troops" and (ii) those who know full well what his protest is about but who cynically use it to further divide and advance their racist and xenophobic mindset. 

I don't know which group this guy belongs to, but both are offensive to me, and I shed no tears for his loss. The irony of his customers blackballing him is simply too rich for me to not enjoy this story....
