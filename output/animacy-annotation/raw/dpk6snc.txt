He seriously said a bit of a hyperbole, and he's still correct. I have about 1k hours in the game now, and while I am rated top 1k in FPP, the games are leagues harder. A lot of my friends and I all joke that TPP is the "fun mode" where doing shit like running around with just an uzi is not only doable, but actually quite viable due to how bad people are. I have had plenty of times in TPP where someone literally walks up behind me and I'm unaware and full auto sprays me, but is so bad that they recoil off and and spray into the sky at which point I turn around and blast them. In FPP I would say the bottom 10% of players make up the skill base of the mid 75% of TPP.  
  
Just look at this thread. Many of the people commenting why they say they like TPP is "I suck ass at the actual mechanics of the game so I use TPP to get a leg up." While they get the leg up, I'm sure they flub some easy kills sometimes and get beaten down by someone who won't make the mistake back at them.
