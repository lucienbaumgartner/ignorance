Bad faith.

You're responding to a comment you think I made with pre-supposed arguments. Nowhere does he equate the systems. Like I *already* said, it's an anecdote that adds literary flavour. It only serves to outline how the serotonergic system is ancient and how evolution builds on existing infrastructure. 

Saying 'hurr durr no ought from is' isn't even what Hume was saying when he presented it formally. Your moral choices aren't defined by existing objective reality, but must take it into account. Otherwise you're just a blind idealist. 

&gt; You finding opposition to your ignorant and backwards ideas on Reddit is not evidence for your slippery slope not being a fallacy ffs ðŸ˜‚

That is actually funny, because I was talking about you. Now I begin to see why as you've invited me to kill myself in another comment.
