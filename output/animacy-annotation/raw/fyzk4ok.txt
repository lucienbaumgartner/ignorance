Why would you want to incentivize people to play Comp over other game modes? Do you not see how stupid and ignorant that is?

 "I only like to play this game mode so fuck everyone else!",

"Fuck warming up, I don't want to take that extra 20% XP hit, sorry my aim is shit, I'm not warmed up, lololol",

 "I just got the game, I need to unlock all these agents, so I guess Comp is the way to go if I want them faster, fuck learning how to play"
