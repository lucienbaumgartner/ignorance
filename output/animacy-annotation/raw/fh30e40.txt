&gt; I have a hard time believing a 37 year old gay man running for President world alienate young voters, but putting they aside.

What an awful stereotype of young voters. We don't vote based off of bullshit; we actually care about issues. There's a reason that Pete polls like crap with young voters, while Bernie is #1 by a wide margin. We don't care if Pete is young or gay - we care that his policies are crap. 

Like I don't think you understand just how patronizing and ignorant that sentiment is.
