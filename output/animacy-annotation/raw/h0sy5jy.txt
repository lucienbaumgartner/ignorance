This isn't annoying about introverts but it's annoying because I'm an introvert. I can't deal with the energy sappers. There are some people who are just so extroverted and unaware of their behavior that they suck the energy out of me. Sometimes they call and text non-stop to hangout after we've just hung out and just the thought of it extends my recharged time.
