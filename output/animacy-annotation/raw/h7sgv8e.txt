&gt;The reason there's no agencies or departments listed is because it's a sanitized version, meaning all state or federal agencies have been scrubbed.

No, that is total BS. Testing 9mm/45 isn't super secret squirrel stuff. There is no government letterhead, command chain, organization/funding bodies, or scientists listed. There are no appropriate classification or distribution markings, dates/doc version control markings, or anything else.

Even scrubbed documents have that, and scrubbed docs only remove the specific sensitive parts.

That is a lazily written word doc by a guy who has never read a real government white paper or study before and written for people who are both gullible and ignorant of the real deal.
