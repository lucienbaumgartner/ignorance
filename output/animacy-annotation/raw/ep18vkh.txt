Imagine being so short-sighteded and ignorant that you desire to ally with the evil power who is actually causing your suffering in order to gain control over you.  

Get a clue.  If chavez and maduro were pocketing all that money they wouldn't have been using it to help develop friendly nations like they were.  

Or you can just keep blaming everything on maduro like a stupid child who is easily manipulated.  You just make the pro-US Venezuelan opposition even more ignorant and ridiculous.
