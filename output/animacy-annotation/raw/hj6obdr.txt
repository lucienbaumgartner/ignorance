Glaceon isn't that great for OU, but you can still have fun with it

&amp;#x200B;

    Ninetales-Alola @ Icy Rock
Ability: Snow Warning
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid Nature
- Aurora Veil
- Freeze-Dry
- Encore
- Pain Split

Ninetales has the classic hail setter set. The only thing that really matters here is Aurora Veil and Encore. Encore is pretty good if the first Pok√©mon you send out has it.

    Glaceon @ Heavy-Duty Boots
Ability: Snow Cloak
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
Calm Nature
- Wish
- Protect
- Heal Bell
- Freeze-Dry

Glaceon will be used as a cleric. However, keep in mind that the only reason to use this instead of Vaporeon or Umbreon is its ability- however, Umbreon does get the move Foul Play, which may be better, and Vaporeon has Flip Turn.

    Arctozolt @ Heavy-Duty Boots
Ability: Slush Rush
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
Naive Nature
- Substitute
- Bolt Beak
- Icicle Crash
- Low Kick

Classic slush rush set- nothing really to say about it other than you can change Heavy-Duty Boots for Life Orb.

    Toxapex @ Rocky Helmet
Ability: Regenerator
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
Bold Nature
- Scald/Knock Off
- Recover
- Haze
- Toxic Spikes

You can use Pyukumuku instead as it can Soak Toxic, and it has Unaware and Memento. However, Toxic Spikes can be used for Zapdos-Galar.

    Tapu Lele @ Choice Specs
Ability: Psychic Surge
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Psyshock
- Moonblast
- Focus Blast
- Psychic

Lele hits hard. Counters many tanks.

    Zapdos-Galar @ Weakness Policy  
Ability: Defiant  
EVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Bulk Up  
- Agility  
- Brave Bird  
- Thunderous Kick

Defog punish weakness policy, bulk up, and agility. This guy can sweep.
