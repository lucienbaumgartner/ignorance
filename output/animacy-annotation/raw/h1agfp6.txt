My sister was in her final stages of colon cancer and the days prior to her death, she was extremely delirious and unaware of her surroundings. Until one day, she became conscious and aware. My fiancé (now husband) and I decided to hold a quick ceremony at her hospital so she was able to watch me get married as my MOH and to sign as my witness. One of the most emotional days I’ve ever had. Not long after, she unfortunately passed. That small moment of clarity was just enough time to say our goodbyes.
