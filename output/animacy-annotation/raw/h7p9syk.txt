Right, and that's why I say progressives tend to be a bit naive and ignorant of actual democratic levers. "Defund the police" was pretty immediately a terrible slogan that communicated more misinformation than it did actual policy. Progressives tend to correctly identify that reform is necessary but still be completely wrong about how do actually do that. Policing does need to be fixed! Defunding police is not the thing to lead with in that conversation, however. Moderates get that, and that's why they keep winning elections.

That's the thing: Sanders wouldn't do any better. Because just having an idea and yelling about it a lot doesn't make policy happen. Policy happens when you get folks to vote on your side with you. So the fact that Sanders introduced a gay marriage bill going back decades is nice...but it was Biden who actually pushed on Obama to press that button at the right time and gay marriage was legalized during their term because of Biden's actions, not Sanders'. Sanders would likely get far less done because he would show no interest in working with people who are opposed to him and no inclination to compromise. And while the progressives have a point that too much compromise is a bad thing...none at all is worse.
