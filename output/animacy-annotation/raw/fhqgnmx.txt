i have a mentally ill parent too so i feel you. caroline definitely takes it to another level. instead of using her billion (privileged) therapy sessions to reflect, i think sheâ€™s just paying for someone to listen to her babble on and on with no intention of actually changing for the better. how dense, unaware, and empty can she be?
