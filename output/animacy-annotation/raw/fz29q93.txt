Have you ever lived in a rural area? Because it is still absolutely the case today. I saw plenty of these people at my own high school less than a decade ago. And they associated it with drinking beer, being a redneck, country music, fishing, etc. They are stupid and ignorant. That doesn't mean they are all racist.
