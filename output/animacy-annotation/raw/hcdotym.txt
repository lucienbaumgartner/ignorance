I can't stand it when people say 'I miss the old Taylor.' I love her earlier music, I am very nostalgic for when I listened to it as a teen, but her earlier albums are so indicative of the kind of kid she was: in many ways naïve, ignorant and unaware of the world. Her love songs are so conservative, and represent a world view she just doesn't hold anymore. I can't imagine wishing someone who has learned, matured and grown so much in the last few years to be an adult woman with confidence and certainty about her politics and sexuality, would go back to being the naïve and innocent teen girl she has worked so hard to leave behind. 

On that though, this is also why I get tired when people say 'unpopular opinion, All Too Well isn't as good as xyz.' I personally think it can't really be compared. Both her and her writing skills have grown leaps and bounds since the writing of ATW, so of course so so many of her newer songs, especially on Folklore and Evermore, are lyrically, musically and technically better. But ATW was a phenomenal, raw and vulnerable song for someone of her age and experience, and I think it's unfair to compare them.

That's just my two cents ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1065)
