I agree with this statement too. It gives room for situations where the other person can be partly to blame if they know there's a cheating situation but leaves room for no blame in situations where the other person has no idea there's a cheating situation.

Honestly, I was the other woman at one time. I had no idea he was seeing someone else. He was clearly a practised liar and went to great lengths to keep me and her separated and unaware of each other. When it all came out, I got most of the blame for being the other woman. It hurt a lot because I was already heartbroken at the end of the relationship, had been blindsided and lied to, etc and then I suddenly had a label as a home wrecker too. Those were dark days and I can't say I'm 100% over that entire situation a decade later.

Edit: also if you're friends with someone in a situation like this, speak up. It was upsetting to know mutual friends knew I was unaware of being the other woman and they said nothing to me. I felt just as betrayed by them because they were covering up his cheating and let me get hurt in the process. With friends like that, who needs enemies?
