This is some monkey paw advice. Me learning more about Islam and the terrible things Mohammed did were what made me leave Islam. From the slaughter of the Banu Qurayza or the nonsensical flying in the sky on a magic donkey, splitting in the moon in half. Had I continued to be less religious and ignorant of Islam, I might have still been a Muslim today.
