Our health service is kept afloat by foreign doctors and nurses and all you have to do is attack Pakistani people.  

I live and work in a very diverse area in Manchester with many people from all backgrounds. These problems are present in certain immigrant communities but every ethnicity has problems and issues. White working class Brits do very poorly at school and are tend to be insular and ignorant. That doesn’t mean these are bad people. 2nd generation immigrants are far more likely to identify with British culture than their parents culture. 

Stop bashing Muslims. They are good people. I have many Muslim friends and I value them highly (I’m a white English man)
