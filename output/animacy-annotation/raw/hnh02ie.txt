No sorry for misunderstanding, she married into the family and fully accepted lol they've been together for like 10 yrs. I meant their DIL is middle eastern and they are still unaware and ignorant. Actually, her being Middle Eastern complicates it b/c she is more accepting of this nonesense, her and her husband said this is learning oppurtunity and my BF was too harsh with her. 

But this still is a massive red flag.
