**NTA. While I disagree with others here that cultural appropriation in general is "not a thing" or an unimportant issue, you didn't appropriate anyone else's culture, you were celebrating your own heritage. And you are CERTAINLY not responsible for legitimising your classmate's profound ignorance.**

The fact that she is so unspeakably dimwitted is not your problem. Her argument rests on the idea that if she is unfamiliar with a culture or tradition it basically doesn't exist, and given that you literally explained to her that this is part of YOUR ethnic tradition and heritage (which honestly, is an explanation you didn't owe her - again, you are not required to educate the ignorant in order for them to "approve" of you), her insistence that you were appropriating something simply because it's the only culture SHE is familiar with that has that tradition . . . well, that's not a thing. Her ignorance is not justification to negate and erase your heritage. 

She owes you a massive apology, and frankly, she owes it to herself to humble herself and be ashamed that she is so shockingly ignorant and performative in her "anti-racism".  No matter what, you are NTA here.
