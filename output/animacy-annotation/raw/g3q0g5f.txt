I disagree with hateful speech in all contexts. It adds no value to a debate and only makes people appear uninformed and ignorant. That applys to both sides of an arguement. 

Politics should not be a shouting match, it should be a mature debate. If that isn't the case then we need to work towards that- by being better. 

You seem to be suggesting that is ok to be rude and disrespectful because other people are.... Again be better. I'm not saying this because I disagree with your political opinion, I just don't think the hateful approach will ever achieve anything....

An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.
