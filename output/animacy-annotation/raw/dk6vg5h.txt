Ok so since I literally have nothing better to do I've been translating this chapter with google translate. Turns out Korean is fairly easy to translate, unlike some languages (looking at you, japanese).

After the phonecall, Kate tells Kiyoshi that Mari is leaving Japan today. Kiyoshi asks if Chiyo knows and Kate replies that it doesn't seem to be the case. At this point Kate wants to leave but a nonresponsive Meiko is in the way. Kiyoshi doesn't know what to do, it seems he wants to stop Mari from leaving but he's also worried about missing the party. Kate fed up with Meiko not moving, slaps her, they bicker a bit and Meiko tells Kiyoshi that he should go to the party to make sure Chiyo is happy and unaware that Mari is leaving as that is "The will of Mari". Kiyoshi remembers Mari saying she will not interfere with him and Chiyo and thinks that that is why Mari is leaving (Kiyoshi is cute but dumb). He vows to honor Mari's "sacrifice" by making sure Chiyo is happy. After he leaves Meiko and Kate run out while bickering. It's not really clear what either of them are planning but it doesn't look like they'll be teaming up anytime soon.

Offcourse this could all be completely wrong. We'll know more on sunday or monday I suppose?
