Just more "pro-life" Nonsense without references to God. 

"shows up to save preborn children and their mothers from the tragedy of abortion."

Imagine being so patronising and ignorant, that you think Pregnant people need to be "saved" by having their human rights, bodies, and genitals violated and abused. 

"We see abortion not as a culture war issue or as a religious issue but as a human rights issue" 

Wow, cognitive dissonance at its finest. *Don't abuse human rights, except human rights of pregnant people*. These people aren't very bright, if they are incapable of seeing these glaring contradictions. 

 "They have been taught that we hate women"

I think advocating for bodies and genitals to be violated and abused is a good example of hatred towards AFAB people, yes. If they don't want to be perceived this way, they need to adjust their beliefs to something that doesn't cause harm to marginalised people.

It's the same old advocation of violence and abuse towards AFAB people, just without bringing God or Jesus into the mix. Being secular or irreligious certainly isn't a compelling reason to violate rights and abuse bodies, no matter what sort of mental gymnastics they contort themselves into. Ignoring their hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, denying reality, and advocating for harm shouldn't be tolerated.
