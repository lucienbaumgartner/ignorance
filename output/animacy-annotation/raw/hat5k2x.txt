This was probably the most feasible advice I saw on multiple websites…

“To keep cats away from gardens, flower beds, or specific areas of property, scatter fragrant items that don’t appeal to a cat’s sense of smell, like fresh orange or lemon peels, organic citrus-scented sprays, coffee grounds, vinegar, pipe tobacco, or oil of lavender, lemongrass, citronella, or eucalyptus.”

Most sources said to spray or place these items along the perimeter of your yard or along fences if you have them. 

Another solution I saw, which is obviously not as aesthetically pleasing and may be more cumbersome and I imagine could even end up deterring some birds is to put chicken wire around the area that the birds tend to congregate and eat in. It’d need to be a big enough area to give them some comfort with landing and taking off in flight quickly though. 

I think the scented deterrents sound like the best bet, or, if that cat belongs to someone and isn’t a stray, it could be worth it to talk to the owner in a kind way. Of course, some crappy pet owners will get ultra-defensive and double down…but I think that most people are just a bit naive and unaware of just how much damage outdoor cats have been doing to local bird populations. If they truly love animals, maybe finding that out would change how they let their cat roam around?

Btw, appreciate you OP for caring about your backyard birds and looking out for them. We need more people like you in this world.
