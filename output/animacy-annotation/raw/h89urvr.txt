Exercise is good. Running in general is bad (except sprinting).

Why do you think the current olympics are the first ones that have censored all the distance runners collapsing, shitting themselves, getting carried out by ambulance etc? It's another step in making people more delusional and ignorant of the dangers of the sport they are watching. There is ample evidence that distance running is unhealthy, and stresses your body more than provide any benefit.
