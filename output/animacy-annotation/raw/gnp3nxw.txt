I'm so glad there's a safe place where we can talk about things like this and have support, I feel terrible for his girlfriend, I hope she's able to get help and that he'll try to understand more of what's going on. I think people are really uninformed and ignorant of mental health, but I'm hoping that will be less of the norm in the future. I'm going to make sure my daughter is informed because I wasn't until I was an adult.
