Liberal tears. That's all you want, not caring liberals keep the world moving forward and not degenerating into a bunch of salute hurling shit flinging nationalists. 

Maybe you got your liberal tears because we're sort of laughing at how astoundingly unaware and idiotic you look.  

Like...you people are the guy at the party who shit his pants and thinks the reason nobody wants to stand near him is because they're afraid of his masculinity. When...I mean, nobody wants to smell your stink and deal with you.
