The amount of people here who a) have no idea of tenant rights and b) somehow think a LL with 50+ properties is totally fine to be hugely unprofessional and ignorant of their own obligations is staggering. 

I get life happens and we sometimes drop our standards, but while the tenancy is active this is OPs home and the LL must adhere to strict rules about the proper forms of notice and access rights for them or any of their tradespeople. It's not complicated or hard to do. If she can manage to arrange decorators she can give OP the courtesy of arranging a proper time for it to happen first. 

To me it just sounds like she's half ass-ing the notice to draw out being paid rent before having to 'officially' serve notice. Which would be fine if she had an open conversation with OP and you know, maybe didn't send tradesmen etc. around with no warning. But the notice period doesn't start until you get the correct S21 notice. This applies whether or not you're on a rolling contract or an AST.

It doesn't matter if you don't like OPs 'tone' this is just basic legal facts and landlord responsibilities.
