There are traditions to pay non-whites much less (half, or one third) than what white earns (for doing the same job) in many countries.

Your example about marijuana should be applicable and mine doesn't? If you're black, and you work abroad, nobody cares about glass ceilings. They will be frank that they only want a white person for the job.

And I live in Indonesia, which is a neighbour of Singapore, and Indonesia have death penalty for drug possession. Including marijuana. However, they are not for MEDICAL MARIJUANA. Hospitals here use morphine and other narcotics to ease pain, too. Medical use for narcotics isn't forbidden, though you might need a formal permit from the local hospital to do so.

Singapore is pretty much a first-world country. Do you really think that their lawmakers are so stupid and unaware that narcotics are used in medical field? It's very strange, because everybody in here knows that medical use is the only one that's allowed.
