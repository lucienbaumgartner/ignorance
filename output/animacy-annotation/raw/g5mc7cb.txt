Unfortunately it just takes time. I would suggest taking lessons with a teacher to get some one on one instruction. Navigating these areas are fairly hard to do, and a teacher can give you real time feedback to help you out. Since I'm online and unaware of what style goal you are trying to achieve it is difficult to give good feedback. The best advise I can give is to try doing scales or excercises on an "e" vowel ( /i/ in IPA) or "oo" (/u/ in IPA). There is some vowel modification to keep in mind but without a teacher it can be difficult to tell if you are doing to early or late in your range, or if the vowel is sounding like the appropriate vowel.
