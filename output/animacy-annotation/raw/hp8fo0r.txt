This is also a problem with Zhonglis quest. He nearly murders everybody in the city out of his own selfishness. sets up a deal with Signora. Lets Osail get free (And whos summoning almost certainly killed a bunch of dock workers and fisherman). Yea hes says he would "step in" if things got out of hand but if he was even a second or two late half the city would be dead. He never answered for any of this. His dam test was deeply selfish and ignorant of the deaths of his own people. And in his quest nothing is brought up, we say nothing, and instead his quest are mostly boring until the last 15% or so of the quest.
