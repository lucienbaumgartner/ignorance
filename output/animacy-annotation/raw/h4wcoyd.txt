YTA - Is this a joke? Are you seriously asking if you're missing something?

Not only are you seriously feeling entitled enough to create your own space, you seem blissfully privileged and unaware that what what you're doing is illegal.

It's sickening that you don't even care if you may be blocking a hypothetical fire hydrant bc your errand was "quick" and you would leave before access is needed.  Anything could cause you a delay, and if there was a hydrant you were blocking, you are again, breaking the law and hindering emergency personnel by being selfish. Yeah. You're most definitely an ah, not the guy who called you out.
