Lololol lap dances make you the most money so if she doesn’t plan on making money as a stripper she can do that. Also having a sugar daddy is an actual relationship, everything you do in your relationship will be requested in the sugar daddy/baby dynamic. Soo basically are you ok with polyamory? No, then that might explain why you feel some type of way. Does your gf think those options are avenues of easy money?? Bc she should do her research otherwise she’s just extremely naive and ignorant of the sex work industry.
