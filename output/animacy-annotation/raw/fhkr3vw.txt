Guess I am just not on the up and up when it comes to mac technology. I just got an Iphone and I had no idea that was a feature. /me shrugs. I never have encountered it "in the wild" or from friends or acquaintances. So that it probably why it seemed fishy as hell.  Rewatching it he does say "ping you the address" but I just took it for British slang for text. I mean half the population uses droid so it is understandable people wouldn't get that (unless it is a droid thing too and my 35 year old ass is just disconnected from techy youth which is totally possible).   


But "plain wrong and ignorant"? That sounds a bit extreme to me. After I posted this I read a lot about the complaints people have about the show and it seems I am not alone or even possibly wrong about my concerns. I will gladly admit to being ignorant of this being "a thing" though. Cheers and enjoy it. I think I am going to stick to checking out the comic.
