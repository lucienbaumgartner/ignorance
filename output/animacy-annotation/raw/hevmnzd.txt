Then explain exotic ornaments that totally change the look of an exotic. That alone destroys that argument.

The only time you really need to know at a glance is in PvP. Literally just disable ornaments on exotics in PvP. Thatâ€™s what all other games with transmog already do.
But even then, you get a screen at the start of the match that shows you what they wear. Just add a slot that shows you their exotic.

Literally every argument against exotic transmog is naive and ignorant of how all of those issues have already been solved before.
