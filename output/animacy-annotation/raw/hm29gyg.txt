Just got back from 6 day trip. You are absolutely correct. I have never wanted to leave the parks so much in my life. Even when crowds were low at the beginning of my trip, people were inconsiderate and unaware of their surroundings. Looking back, my COVID-19 trip last December was such a better time.
