Your entire logic is unreliable. Your just sittin there saying someone else will solve this or adapt. Like wtf we aren't finches. We adapt through tech and technology cost resources, resources cost manpower and money and it's not like the world already does a good job managing that kind of stuff now. Once enough ice melts enough ancient greenhouse gases will be released back into the atmosphere and it'll cause a snowball effect making the earth warm up even more which would then be beyond our help with our current tech. You have this aloof thinking that comes off arrogant and ignorant that the human race can literally beat all mother nature can throw at em if we prep for it like batman but we dont have that kind of time frame most scientists warn. Most life on earth has died off due to their part of the world drastically changing why would that not apply to us? We haven't terraformed or left earth so we're just as vulnerable as everything else that has lived and died on here.
