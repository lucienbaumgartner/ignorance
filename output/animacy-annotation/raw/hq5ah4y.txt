I totally get where you’re coming from. People can suck especially women—they can be ridiculously mean with an inflated self esteem, I know this because my own friends are like this but I think anyone who doesn’t care about how they effect another person is either really ignorant and stupid, or they have some deep seated issue that effected them during childhood. Like one of my friends, she is such a bitch to guys to the point where it’s made me uncomfortable and felt sorry for the guys— because she’s literally humiliated them in front of everyone but what no one knows about her is during high school, she got kidnapped by like 5 girls and they jumped her but also repeatedly smashed in her face because the whole reason why they even kidnapped her was because some dude liked her and this other girl was not having it so they literally kept punching her face. This was a huge deal and cops were called and everything and for a while, until she graduated high school, she wasn’t even allowed to go in some parts of the city. But once she went to college, scenes change, people and crowds change, she changed. By the time she graduated college, she turned into a bitch. None of my bfs liked her, every guy thought she was a bitch. But because she has money and she is gorgeous,  she goes around treating people like shit. But I know it’s cuz she’s suffering from that trauma and how her ego was destroyed for her entire highschool life, she’s sorta taking revenge on the world but of course she will never admit it… but anyway, I think I went off on tangent. 

Have you tried talking to a therapist? 
Sorry I’m not much help. But just wanted to let you know  that it sucks you went through what you did. The world sucks … but I think everyone got issues -we’re all just reacting to it the way we know how I guess…
