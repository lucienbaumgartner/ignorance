&gt;Non democratic states obviously have security concerns, but as I believe state power should be used for the people, not just to protect the ruling elite, I feel that democratic states with referendums on joining military alliances have more legitimacy to make those choices. It is the people, not the state, that really have a right to be protected.

Ok but do you understand how this exact line of thinking is why non-democratic states see what democracies doing as aggression? Right or wrong aside (and those in the end of the day are subjective ideas)... any state will feel threatened and would actively reject any other state that undermines its legitimacy.  


&gt; On your second point they're not encroaching on Russia's border. Encroachment implies intrusion into someone else's territory. NATO has never crossed Russia's border, it has not "encroached" on any Russian territor

Historically areas around Russia were under considerable Russian influence, and of course most recently outright part of the Russian Empire/ USSR / Warsaw Pact. Now you may (rightfully) question legitimacy of such Russian claims... but to claim this isn't encroachment because technically its not part of Russia proper is very naive and ignorant of the actual reality and history of those areas.  


Compare this to something like Monroe Doctrine, which while technically isn't a thing anymore, has been a fundamental part of US foreign policy and world view since early 19th century and until today. Is Cuba part of US? Is Mexico? And yet do you think US would tolerate any sort of Chinese or Russian (or anyone else) encroachment into those?
