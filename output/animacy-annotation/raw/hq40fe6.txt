He's so completely unaware and ungrateful. If he had provided the same level of attention to his relationship with her as he does to his and Robyn's she would have never had an issue with "the big picture". She had an issue with his "big picture" because their marriage has been falling apart for years and she wanted to focus attention on the actual problem but he completely deflected and ignored it since that would mean Kody acknowledging he failed as a husband to meet his wife's needs. Also if anyone has "shown up" for the family it's Christine who raised pretty much all of his children while he got to show up and take credit a few times a week!!
