MGSV spoilers:

[I think it was similar to his "doublethink" in MGSV. In MGSV he was both aware and unaware that Venom was not Big Boss.](/spoiler)

In MGS4, I think he both believed that he was Liquid and knew that it was a ruse to fool the patriots. He had to do this so he could be convincing, yet still pull the strings. By the end of MGS4, Ocelot had replaced Liquid's arm with a prosthetic. The events of MGS4 were all Ocelot, not Liquid.

What I think is up for debate is whether Liquid ever possessed Ocelot, or if he died and remained dead at the end of MGS1. I think it has the groundwork for both, but I lean towards Liquid died and never possessed Ocelot. I say there is groundwork for the alternative, since Ocelot's father was a powerful medium and its feasible in the MGS universe that Liquid spirit could have channeled itself through Ocelot.

Either way, the Ocelot during the events of MGS4 are entirely Ocelot.
