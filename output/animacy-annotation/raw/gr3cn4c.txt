That's my original point. Almost all comments in this thread are acting as though the findings of this investigation absolve Dennis of any wrongdoing. The best of them are assuming Milsap misremembered, the worst of them are saying he is "stirring up drama". 

It's disheartening to get down voted for stating that we have no idea what happened and shouldn't make any assumptions based on the findings of this investigation. There wasn't anything to really "investigate". 

I've been a "not all Jazz fans are prejudice" guy for a long while, but it gets harder to defend that stance as time goes on. I don't think our whole fanebase is racist, but I can't keep denying that they a lot are ignorant and unaware of their bias on issues like this.
