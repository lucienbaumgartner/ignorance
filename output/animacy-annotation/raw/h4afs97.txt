Ugh I know his type so well. I dated a Ronald on and off for a year during a naive time in my life lol i was too young and unaware of how insane guys can be. 

He would do exactly this every time I started to distance myself from him and eventually I realized he would never stop. He wrote me a long ass message like this when I left him, came to my house and told me to "try and convince him not to leave" because apparently I would be sorry lol then he followed me one night to the supermarket and waited in his car and just watched me. Im glad tiffany isnt anywhere near this guy. Cant imagine sharing a kid with him.
