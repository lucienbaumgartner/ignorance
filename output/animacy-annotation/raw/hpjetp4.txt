That goes for everyone, not just the willfully ignorant and selfish. But the willfully ignorant and selfish are getting first dibs, while everyone else is being told there is no room at the Inn. Getting rerouted to hospital after hospital in an ambulance that is hoping to find a bed for their patient, is harmful to everyone. This is doing harm. No where in the Hippocratic Oath does it say that doctors are supposed to tolerate being attacked by willfully, ignorant family members of willfully ignorant  patients. They aren't supposed to be attacked at all. It's actually against the law to assault anyone. And most of the ones being attacked at hospitals, aren't even the doctors, it's the nurses.
