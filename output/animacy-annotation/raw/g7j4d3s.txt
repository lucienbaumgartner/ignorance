You hit the nail right on the head; I cried like a baby after watching the episode. I can relate to Hippolyta as a young black woman living in a country that is not my own. I work in a white male-dominated industry in one of the top 3 racist cities in the country, and I am challenged at every turn by my white subordinates. Although they are not qualified or experienced. I seriously doubt that they could even handle a fraction of my responsibilities.    


That said, why was Ruby (as a yt woman) was so mean to the young black employee. I, too, have experienced this type of "I'm-trying-to-help-you-be-extraordinary" bullying from yt women. All they are doing is questioning our right to occupy specific spaces. Notice how she kept trying to figure out how she got the job and her education level?  I do feel that Ruby was just jealous and unaware of what the young lady was facing. (like white women do) The manager hired her because he was a predator, and she was pretty. He was just waiting for his chance to strike knowing that he had power over her at work.  
IMO Tamara deserves an episode from her perspective to further explore the plantation dynamics of corporate America. It's not all that different; black women work twice as hard, often picking up the slack from their white counterparts. They are Paid less and policied unjustly by both white men and women regardless if they are above, below, or on the same level rank wise. 

  
To top it all off, HR is just the icing on the cake. They don't even listen when if complaint. At that point, we are the problem because we "should just be happy to be here."
