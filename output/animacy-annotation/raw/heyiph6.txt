Detach from any kind of blame or blame thoughts (guilt, judging, labeling, shame, regret, etc.) and u will find only love bc thats what we all are, u cannot love yourself, u already do, but the mind makes u think otherwise and distracts u.

Practice forgiveness on all levels and people, yourself the most, forgive everything and everyone for anything. (Without letting people taking advantage of you or condoning bad dees, only understanding them and know they are innocent and ignorant of their attachments)
