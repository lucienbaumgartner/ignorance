Brains, not heads, and the size of brain structures and their connectivity strengths are known to influence various measures of behavior. If you'd like I can find a million other articles looking at brain differences if you don't believe this simple one: https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOANATJ/TOANATJ-2-37.pdf 

Pretending that results that back up mountains of solid data on human brain differences by gender is comparable to a deeply unscientific practice in antiquity is ignorant, and bad faith arguing. If you want to say that all of neuroscience is bullshit please feel free to say that, but I don't think you'd like to look quite that stupid.
