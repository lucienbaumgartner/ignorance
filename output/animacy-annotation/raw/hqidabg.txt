I feel you. There's so many snobby, elitist #âˆš(&amp;$ in the guitar world. It's really sad. You'd think there would be more open-mindedness and compassion amongst creative people.
 I have Tourette's syndrome, which is motor tics, a lot in my face and pressing my face with my hand, tensing my neck, etc.
 I went to GC to return a back-bowed/broken truss rod guitar I got from them online. While I'm in there playing some other guitars, the 3 employees are standing around openly talking about me, calling me a tweaker and saying things like "I'm gonna wash it first" after I touched it, and laughing.
 Oh, I'm also non binary transgender, so... "Tranny tweaker here!" 
 It's sickening. I know there's ignorant and immature people and I know that's how children learn about things that are different, but that's $#!+ you save for your break, or at least until I've left the store.
 23 years and I'm still not a good player, but I make good music. It's my medicine. I will never let judgemental people stop me from being True to myself and doing what I Love.
Stay up!
