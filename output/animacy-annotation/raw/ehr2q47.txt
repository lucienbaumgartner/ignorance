Please take your MLM scheme elsewhere.  

Preying on physically and mentally sick people by using shady marketing tactics is abhorrent.  Naming a product "10XPURE" so people think the oil is somehow better and worth $130 for a 500mg tincture is insane, even if it is an open market.  You aren't selling makeup, you're selling a product that is relied upon by people like my mother that don't have many options left --- it's obscene.  That shit is shameful as fuck.

Don't take advantage of the sick and ignorant.  That would be a much better draw for people.
