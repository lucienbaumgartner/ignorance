Besides being a hardcore Trumper mostly for tax cuts, he's an engineer so he's usually not so wacky and ignorant of things.

Like "how the vaccine works" would be something I'd usually expect him to research and know. 

But yeah he sometimes talks like Trump in these big overarching sentences that don't have much meaning like "well the Chinese control all that" or "the media is the ones doing it" or "clintons people were responsible".
