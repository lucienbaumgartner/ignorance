This is exactly what it’s designed to do. I’m no pred either so I’ll give you the rundown... or I’ll try to at least. 

It just does it in reverse. The better you get the more you get punished for camping. 

At plat or gold level... your most APESHIT super massive aggro round where you squad wiped once and managed 8 at 2000 damage and finished 8th squad.... *is a boring and low scoring game for a pred.* 

Us camping is a pred *asleep* at the controls. 

The pace of fighting is insane at higher levels. Watch whole games, unedited. There is chaos followed by camping and rotating then chaos and bam the round is done. 

Lower tier players should have shut the fuck up and enjoyed the lower ttk, but instead most of the players in my rank or lower are so unattached and unaware of the game meta that they bitched because the ttk changes were very vocally complained about by nearly all master level and low level preds. Because it would separate them from the true gods of the game... the top 100 preds. 

I personally loved the low ttk. It made gold lobbies waaaay better because it was so easy to punish campers. Mistakes made was a direct path to death. Camping is a mistake in this game. Better players immediately moved up and the average joes all got to play against one another, until we got better. 

I’d love to see apex revert to the low ttk.
