You can rightlfully say the rot started while he was around but the club has had time to fix it, they haven't. Wenger performances to me prove that he was working around the nonsense that is our administration's incompetence. Majority of the fan base we would be more competitive once he left but this hasn't been the case at all and people need to be reminded how short sited and ignorant of our situation they were.
