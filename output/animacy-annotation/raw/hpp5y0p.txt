Yes. That is exactly my point. People claiming Trump was some sort of savior is absolutely retarded. He was just a continuation of the status quo.

Also, He literally campaigned on eliminating the national debt, but he only made it grow. Imagine getting schooled on American Politics by a fucking Canadian lol.
