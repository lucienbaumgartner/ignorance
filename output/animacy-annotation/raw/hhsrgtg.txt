"The Republican Party is bad, worse than CCP" JESUS H CHRIST. You have to be so sheltered and unaware of the outside world to hold that view.

The privledge you have to be so uninformed of the CCPs governace and then compare a dictatorship to a poltical party within america , im lost for words at your stupidity. Read some history books by authours not from the Us to get a grasp on actual world history and not just the american revolution. Id wager you've never read a book , just tweets about how its racist to vote trump.
