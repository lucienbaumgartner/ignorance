Well, this is better than "people who 'fear' GMOs are stupid and ignorant of science".

But "what GMO actually is" is *not* "look we made a groovy thing that will be super helpful", it's "look we made something unconstrained by any real ethical code and no safety regulations whatsoever, tinkering with biological systems we fundamentally don't understand, but we're sure for the most specious of reasons there won't be any unintended consequences, so it's totes okay for us to release it into the wild and sell it for human consumption!"  And that's *before* corporate-designed active evil like Monsanto's sterile crop seed.
