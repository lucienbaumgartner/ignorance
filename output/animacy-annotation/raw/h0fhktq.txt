For a guy his age, I am pretty surprised that he has such a misogynistic, antiquated and old-fashioned, and downright disgusting outlook on sex and sexuality. 

I am a 40F, and my partner is a 40M. Almost every single time we have sex, I literally lose track of how many times I orgasm. And it is because he will not even start sex before I have had *multiple* orgasms. And then, I have to actually tell him that I cannot cum anymore because I'm SPENT from orgasms....and ONLY THEN, will he allow himself to cum. Granted, there are times when I just want to get fucked, and I don't care about cumming, and I tell him so. But the vast majority of the time, he will stop at nothing to make sure that it's pleasurable for me, and I get my cookies, too.

Additionally, I find it unacceptable that he tells you that he is too tired because of work to ensure your pleasure, but yet has absolutely no issue, and all the bloody energy in the world to make sure that he gets fucked and his own rocks off. 

Then, when you tell him that he doesn't make you orgasm, and that he shouldn't only focus on his pleasure only, he tells you something that is so ridiculous, asinine and ignorant that I don't know if I should laugh my ass off at him, or cry in frustration. Not only is what he is telling you ridiculous, asinine and ignorant....it is flagrantly wrong. 

This BOY is not only lazy, ignorant and uneducated, but he is telling you that he doesn't care about your pleasure. He is telling you that sex is for HIS PLEASURE ONLY, and that you don't matter. 

You're young. He is your first sexual partner. You have only been together for a few months, so there is nothing invested. DO NOT invest any more of yourself in this boy. In fact, don't invest yourself in anybody who doesn't show that they are 100% invested in you. Guys who talk and think like this guy aren't worth the oxygen they breathe.
