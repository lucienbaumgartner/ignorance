&gt;I spent 5 years in university studying **Spanish as my major and linguistics as my minor** (native English speaker) and I know it's already been brought up but **Mursel is definitely high functioning autistic.**

These areas of expertise do not overlap in a way that affords you the authority to offer a diagnosis for someone you have not treated.

&gt;Mursel has the same expressions as Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Come on Anna don't play stupid.

And this is so ridiculous and ignorant that I don't even know where I'd begin.

By all means, share your informed and educated opinions with us. We love to hear them! But when it comes to making definitive statements about the private medical information of people you are only acquainted with through a TV screen, leave that to the professionals. The ignorance demonstrated negates any expertise you might actually hold, and that's a shame because this sub loooovvvvvessss discussing linguistics.
