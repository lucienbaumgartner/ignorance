You’re abandoning him by not sitting in a waiting room for hours, away from your son, while he is unconscious and unaware that the world even exists. NTA - he’s being deeply unreasonable in requiring that not one, but two people sit in a hospital waiting room during his surgery. It would be a kindness for one of you to be with him til they take him to prep, and to plan to be there around when he’s expected to come out of recovery and to his room. But no one needs to be there while the surgery takes place, so long as his emergency contact remains available by phone. And you certainly do not have to leave your infant with someone you don’t want to leave him with because of the unreasonable demands. Simply let the family member know they aren’t needed, or when they may actually be needed.
