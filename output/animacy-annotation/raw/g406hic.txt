I hate myself. The change I want to see is annihilation. I want the gutter curb in the streets to clot with blood. I want to see this country cleansed of the weak and ignorant.  
That is the change I want to see. I won't kick it off because despite how much money I make, nothing matters to me. I am weak, ignorant, and filled with nothing but contempt, anger, and self-loathing anymore. I will be the first to die should anything arise anyway. In the meantime I'm going to sit here and drink until society collapses or my liver collapses. I'm not worth the time and as far as I'm concerned nobody around me is worth the time. We are all filth. That is all.  
Edit: And before any of you fake asses jump on here with a condescending "you okay, man?" Stow it. You're not real with that pompous "concerned Redditor" bullshit act. You're just scum playing at civility.
