It's a layered and complicated issue tbh. I love  Zendaya (I'm not trying to come for black twitters favourite) but when I heard the praise she was getting for being the second black woman to win an Emmy and how that would open more doors for women of colour I was like really :/ are people that naive and unaware that mixed race women have been in Hollywood for decades.

 Its one thing to cast a mixed race person and have them playing a black person, its another thing to have a black person with palatable features and a highly symmetrical facial profile but dark skin actresses playing nuanced characters remains a rarity to this day and I don't think the Zendayas of our world are going to be the ones to change
