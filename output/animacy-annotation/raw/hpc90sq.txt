I (27 Female) and my husband (29 Male) have been married for almost five years now. Even when we were dating, we always agreed to spend every other holiday with each others’ families so that we can spend the holidays together but spend equal amounts of time with both our families. If we spend Thanksgiving with my family, we would be with his family for Christmas. And then next year, we’d make sure we were with his family for Thanksgiving and my family for Christmas. We both get along with each others’ families, my family loves him and his family loves me. However, it’s been quite a while since I’ve been able to see my family. 

When my husband and I got married, we moved to a neighborhood where all of his family was, and my family is almost 3 hours away. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, my family was super huge on staying home and social distancing, so I didn’t see them for that entire year because they understandably felt uncomfortable. This is especially because I have elderly grandparents and a cousin who is immunocompromised. My husband’s family was in our town and didn’t care much about the ongoing pandemic, so we saw them as much as we used to since they were comfortable visiting us. When 2021 came around and the vaccine began being distributed, my family jumped on the opportunity and everyone got their vaccine including me. When having the conversation with my husband about getting vaccinated, he was completely ignorant and rude to me. He believes all the BS statistics he sees on Facebook and listened to the conspiracy theories about microchips and magnets and whatnot that the rest of his anti-vax family were ranting on about. The argument ended with me in tears, but I realized that nothing would change his mind, so I stopped pestering him about it. When I told my family this, they told me they were uncomfortable with seeing us since he could be infected and possibly get my immunocompromised cousin sick or get my brother’s kids sick due to them being too young to get the vaccine. I’ve had many conversations about this with my mother begging her to let us visit, and she agreed to let us come over this Christmas. 

Even though my husband and I have been fine throughout this whole pandemic, he suddenly caught COVID last week from one of his friends and gave it to me as well, though I am symptomless and he is near hospitalization. Now my family understandably doesn’t want me or him coming over for Christmas. I told my husband that if he wasn’t ignorant and just got the vaccine that this whole situation could have been avoided and I could’ve seen my family for the first time in two years. He apologized and said he’d get his vaccine when he could, but that I’m the asshole for saying that we’ll be with my family for every holiday next year and not with his. It’s not like he doesn’t see his family outside of holidays, because his parents visit us frequently, only live minutes away, and eat lunch with us every Saturday. Am I the asshole?
