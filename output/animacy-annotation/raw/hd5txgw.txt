I get the feeling you've never met anyone with bipolar. She could have gone on and off him for that reason, I've seen people with bipolar completely switch on the fly like that and become aggressive/ nasty to people they actually like. It is possible and it can affect their social interactions. I'm trying to say, OP isn't necessarily wrong on that front.

To be clear though, I'm not excusing it by saying that.

Secondly, alcohol does make some people genuinely blackout drunk and unaware of what they are doing. Again, that's no reason to excuse the behaviour, they chose to drink, but no one chooses to be bipolar.
