Are you trying to make a point? If so, you're failing. Closing ballot boxes in urban areas doesn't even afford you the opportunity to play stupid for plausible deniability, sorry. I'm not playing this dumb game with you. You either know better and are contorting the truth, or are so aloof and ignorant that your opinion isn't worth listening to.
