The fact that you don't see how disrespectful this is really says everything. You write about Chinese people like they're ignorant and unaware of the modern world. You even make it sound like they think white people are gods and they see their shoes as miraculous?! The fuck do you think Chinese farmers wear on their feet? 

Regardless of what you intended, what you wrote is ignorant trash. Consider being silent in the future.
