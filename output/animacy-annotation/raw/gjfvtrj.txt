Right. I’m confused. Isn’t this about hermaphroditic children and their parents choosing the gender at birth? 

There have been cases with children having a gender chosen, and feeling like they were the other gender. Maybe I’m naive and unaware of more issues than this. Forgive my lack of understanding of more scenarios.
