&gt;But now that latino is in, theyre very happy simply calling themselves latino.

omg why can't US americans might there own fucking gringo business and leave the rest of the world alone. You guys are not "woke" you guys are just loud and ignorant. That sentence along is a dead giveaway that you don't know what you are taking about. Latino is only in IN the US **NOW** but Spanish artists have been pandering to Latin Americans since the 60s. **THE SIXTIES!** This is nothing new, this is nothing special, this is not about you, they are not trying to take advantage of any wave bc this is not about the US this is about Latin America, take your head out of your own ass for once only for once, they are not trying to enter the US market they are trying to enter the Latin American one.

&gt;For agessss spaniards found it insulting if they got called latinos. 

Lmao that's not the case at all, Latino was created by french people as a term to refer to anyone who spoke a Latin based language, it's literally a European term invented by Europeans to refer to other European countries (Spain, France, Italy, Romania, Portugal) these countries were literally the first latinos what you just said 

&gt;Making sure it was known they were European

Clearly shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Spaniards have all the right in the world to call themselves Latinos the term was invented FOR THEM. Now, what they CANNOT do is call themselves latinoamericans but I have never ever ever seem them do that, I bet my fucking ass that there weren't offended bc someone called them Latino they were insulted bc someone called them latinoamericanos and you can't tell the difference between the two terms, and I would also be offended if I were them, it's pretty insulting to put someone's country in a completely different continent, if you insinuated Venezuela was in Europe my Venezuelan as will also feel insulted it's rude as hell to put someone's country in the wrong continent it showcases that you think their country and feelings are completely irrelevant.

Latinoamerica was not called latinoamerica untill the French gave it that name in 1800s as a way of trying to justify their (failed) invasion of Mexico. Latin America is literally called that bc it's the land of the American continent that spoke Latin based languages at the time. It's a term the Europeans gave us bc the Europeans INVENTED it. It's THEIR term.

Now that definition of the term: Latino as someone who speaks a Latin based language is on the decline bc that definition would include half of Africa, Latin America, the French speaking part of Canada, Spain, Portugal, Romania, France and Italy and there is not much of a cultural connection between all of those parts of the world. But you can still see people from these European countries call themselves that, you would never see them calling themselves latinamericans bc they are not that but Latino? Yeah, you can see them do that, it's not their fault the US decided to short latinoamerican as Latino and created this whole confusion. The only moments I use Latino instead of Latinoamericano it's when you can clearly see from the context that I'm referring to the shorter version of Latinoamericano, precisely bc Latino and Latinoamericano are not the same thing.

I have never seen a European person call themselves latinoamerican or pretend to be one but I have seem them call themselves latino plenty of times, (specially French and Romanian people) they are not saying they are Latinoamericanos, they are just trying to tell you what type of language they speak. It's not their fault that you are illiterate. I swear to god US Latinos have a bizarre obsession with Europeans, actual Latin Americans get along with Europeans better than with US Latinos sometimes.
