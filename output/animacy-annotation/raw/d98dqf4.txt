Do you really want to hang out with those plebs?

"Oh noes these level 3 dregs have been terrorizing us for hundreds of years! Thank god the level one undead guys show up all the time with a broke ass 400 year old gun and slaughter them en masse before they even get any special abilities or we'd all be dead by now!"

I'd wager they don't even know about the real threats they face from outer space on a daily basis. They've just been living in their zombie apocalypse safe haven their entire lives. Probably living under some pseudo fascist government and slave away making guns and tribute offerings to the tower, miserable and unaware that the fruits of their labor actually do protect them. 

Let's see in Destiny 5 a slave uprising where we have to kill them as they try to overtake the tower (they're afraid of dregs... this will only be a 5 min intro mission), only to have no one left to make guns. The game is then a sim factory job making guns for the real guardians. You have to pay 100 silver per mission to actually go out and fight if you don't want to spend all your playtime holding square next to an assembly line to turn weapon parts into fusion rifles with shoot to loot because fuck the guardians.
