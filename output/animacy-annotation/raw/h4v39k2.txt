&gt;Your hostility only signals severe bias.

What hostility? you confuse objective facts with hostility because you are clearly part of a cult.

&gt;The document was allegedly leaked,

Sure, and it was found later that it had SEGOB metadata on it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;that doesn't imply that they have to know where it was made or who made it.

So they just decided to take a piece of paper allegedly given to SEGOB (again why SEGOB) at face value despite the fact that they couldnt track it to any individual or couldnt confirm its legitimacy in any possible way?

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know how that would make it better, that means the president is so stupid and ignorant that its willing to believe anything as long as it suits his agenda and everyone around him is so equally stupid or lacks the balls to maybe think "well this is a serious allegation, maybe we should look a little into it instead of going public and saying its true".

&amp;#x200B;

Its that or the president is simply following fascism 101 and starts inventing conspiracy theories and pooling all his enemies together and claiming they are the problem of the nation, and yet claims "i simply heard it somewhere" when people point out the obvious slander.

&amp;#x200B;

Their cultists will repeat it like the sheep they are and the less informed would fall into the Big Lie fallacy and believe it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which secretariat digitalized the document is irrelevant and informs nothing about where it was made or who made it.

No, its not irrelevant, if government had indeed received a serious allegation the original document would be in the hands of security organization, like FGR or CISEN who would be looking at the legitimacy of such a leak before anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your reduction to absurdum twisted the argument so much that it made itself useless. No side has proven anything about where the document was made or who made it, nor has claimed anything absurd about where it could have been made or who could have made it.

Nope, im merely illustrating the problem of asking someone to prove a negative, which is impossible. That pretty much illustrates my point, AMLO isnt simply a politician with supporters, he is a cult leader with cultists.

The fact that you are so willing to debase your intellectual honesty to defend such a ridiculous fabrication and claim proves it. Basically anything that AMLO says is the absolute truth because he is the cult leader.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't think your final rebuttal made complete sense... I'm not entirely sure what you tried to say there.

Of course basic scientific logic doesnt makes sense, if it did you wouldnt be an AMLO cultist wouldnt you?

&amp;#x200B;

You cant prove a negative and claim it as evidence, for example if i said i had a threesome with Shakira and Eva Mendes and said that since you cant prove i didnt had a threesome then you must take it as a fact, you wouldnt believe me wouldnt you?
