This is the most honest and realistic interpretation of events. I realize that I'm privileged, if not burdened, with almost 2 decades working in healthcare and medicine, but still have to humanize even the most ignorant and harmful of my patients and their support circle.

This is not as common in American healthcare as I would like. 

That mom with a toddler in the NICU for mumps deserves empathy, not villainization. Something somewhere along the way CONVINCED her that vaccines were more dangerous than the diseases, or severity of those diseases. And, the fundamental breakdown is in the way we treat one another... As less-than-human or less than US.

WE are the US.

While I can know, with every fiber of me being and bit of peer-reviewed interpretations of raw data, that you are absolutely incorrect, it does our nation a disservice to stop there. I want to know how you came to this conclusion so I can learn how to make the right approach in helping you make a decision that will prevent more death or illness in the future.
