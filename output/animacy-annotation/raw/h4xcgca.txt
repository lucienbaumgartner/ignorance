It's another one of those subtle, brilliant moments that display Data is more than he (possibly) thinks he is. In addition to the emotions he regularly feels while being completely ignorant of the fact that he's having them, he's also clearly capable of deceit as evidenced here - though it was debatably for a good cause.

 I believe the real question is whether or not he has been lying all along about his capabilities - is he aware that people would be utterly terrified of him if they knew he was capable of deceit, murder, and impulsiveness due to emotion? It could be self preservation that drives him to keep those aspects of his progression a secret, or he simply could be naive and ignorant of them. Regardless, I'm definitely not implying that Data is a bad person - I think even if he is aware of it all he's genuinely good at heart, but it's possible he's aware and simply wants to keep up the status quo for his own sake as well as his friends'.
