Corporatism is fascism. Fascism is capitalist at its peak. 

Ron Paul is absolutely a social darwinist. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he isn't just stupid and unaware that his changes would be catastrophic on low income people. His reforms would make it possible for "Wage slavery" to come back like it did in the Gilded Age, where the markets were 100% free and deregulated. 

Capitalism is survival of the fittest by its very nature. Do you really deny this?
