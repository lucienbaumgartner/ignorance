Sooooo I DO believe America is the greatest country on earth to live. BUT. BUT BUT BUT this place fuckin sucks too!!! Like really bad! I think there are a lot of corrupt things going down up in the government and lobbyists are fucked and I also believe our judicial system is superior than others but goddamn it we fuck that up to. Taking money or no what’s even worse is the relationships and taking deals or quid pro quo. 

I also hate my country for a lot of reasons. People can be quite shit and stupid and ignorant of you get to certain states or places of the country. The trump groupies are getting way out of hand. And guns in general are getting out of hand. God damn I hate thinking about all of it. I’ve told myself a million times I’m moving somewhere else but then you get to researching and yeaaaa I think I’m gonna stay put for awhile.
