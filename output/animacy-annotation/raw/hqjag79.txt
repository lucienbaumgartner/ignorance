I’m going to chime in here, with no bias, and say you are being very close minded and biased.

It would be very wise to take a moment to stop and actually listen to what so many people are trying to tell you. 

But you’re human, so my guess is you’ll stubbornly dig your head in the sand.

This Israeli Palestine conflict is so bad because so many people involved are being so ignorant and short sighted. The way you are arguing with people in this thread is a good example as to why progress isn’t being made.
