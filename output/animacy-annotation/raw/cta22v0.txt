Because naive sjw's think that enforcing immigration policy is racist, unless it's being enforced against people with white skin, like Canadians. They are uneducated and unaware that every nation on Earth has immigration control, and that the immigration policy in Mexico is much harsher toward immigrants than the U.S. system, they actually do deport non-citizens. Sjw's are usually privileged naive white college kids who have no real-world basis for the strong opinions they parrot to each other. They are not living in the working class communities effected by illegal immigration.
