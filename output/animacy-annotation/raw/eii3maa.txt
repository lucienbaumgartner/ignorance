If your players aren't okay with this, free "stealth kills" maybe shouldn't be a part of your game.

IMO often when players ask to do something like this they've not thought about what it actually entails. Here's the process they'd go through for a stealth kill:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Approach and draw your weapon silently enough that your enemy doesn't notice you right behind them.
2. Make a strike that is powerful and precise enough to kill instantly, is silent enough not to alert others and quick enough that they don't have a chance to make a noise.
3. Simultaneously prevent them from shouting/collapsing to the floor with  crash and dropping their weapons, which would also create enough noise to alert anyone near enough to hear a shout.

The assassin rule is often misread as being any attack before the enemy acts, but in fact they only auto crit  if they get a surprise round, which represents the enemy being totally unaware and unprepared. This surprise mechanic is there precisely to cover things like ambushes and stealth kills. It's a full round of advantage attacks with no chance for the guards to respond. First round after that you roll initiative, which represents how quickly the guards react to the surprise attack. If your players roll better on initiative they get a second chance to take them out before they have a chance to alert their comrades. If any guards are alive on their turn then your party haven't been quick and quiet enough to take them out before they can raise the alarm.
