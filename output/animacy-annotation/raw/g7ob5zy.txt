But to look down from 20 feet and not have that little voice making you shudder...it's just kind of an inborn neurological thing, which I'd argue most kids DO have much moreso than this guy; most kids would know instinctually not to try that. I'm not saying this guy was stupid or deserved it or anything, just that he seems to have had a worse-than-normal risk-o-meter  at that age. I knew a few kids like that. My buddy would try to craziest stunts while waterskiing and he was always surprised when they end badly lol. Some kids are just exceptionally reckless and unaware of their limits.
