we can pick since release day, or 2nd week of its release, or just this past week alone, any metric you choose will have valorant higher than the games you listed

you are literally hanging your hat on one moment of a day where it was lower than those games.  That is your entire argument LOL

and again, even if eventually it does go lower average than those other games, most of us who play WONT CARE because it's a good game and fun to play.

Calling it dead 3 weeks in because it doesnt have a franchised league or CSGO majors yet is so insanely stupid and ignorant that I dont even know why I'm wasting my time.  Mods need to delete any thread you make as well as the other guy.  Even your thread title is ignorant as fuck as there have been many tournaments to watch already.
