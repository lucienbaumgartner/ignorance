You know, in "Come as You Are", Dr. Nagoski makes an excellent point about the value of expanding our relationship lingo and terminology. 

What's "vanilla" to you may be "hard core" to others. This is very important, OP. It's important to be clear and specific; specially if your BF is as unaware and clueless as you describe him.
