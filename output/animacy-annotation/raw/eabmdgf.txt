I agree. The word itself isn't offensive but coming from most people, in my experience, it's followed up by some generalization or comment that sounds really ignorant or could be seen as offensive. It actually goes pretty deep in some cases. For example: I use the word Iroquois to describe myself, but most people wouldn't know that some really deep-rooted natives found the word Iroquois to be derogatory because it was invented by, "the white man." They prefer to be called Haudenosaunee. But, I know that so few people would be aware of that, that I don't even bring awareness to it because it just seems overly picky at that point. But, some people make statements that are so broad and ignorant that I can't help but to feel some type of way.
