NAH Definitely you should not have had to wait and leaving your wife behind is completely reasonable that you left however I think your wife may have a problem. If there is a chronic problem with timeliness it could indicate ADHD, which if it is does not make her the AH either she just may need some help with medication and some behavioral therapy. Adhd makes it difficult to focus, easily distracted and unaware of time. She was probably crying because she felt terrible about it and embarrassed and does not understand why she behaves that way. Honestly get this looked into, it would likely make life better for both you and your wife.
