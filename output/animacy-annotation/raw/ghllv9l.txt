You have taken two separate responses from different statements and tried to draw a parallel between them. Do you know how petty and ignorant that is?

My initial comment is about how I believe democracy is made a joke of when persons are made to feel belittled or shamed for their decision more so than politicians or media skewing information to suit their needs - or misinformation as it would commonly be called.

My second is in response to a person saying that people were lied to and were not informed. Of course they were informed. Information about it was rife and people can draw their own conclusions from what they read or hear. If you want to blindly believe what you're told without fact checking for yourself that's on you. Whether people are fed lies or truths they are fed information. Whether they believe they are informed or not is their judgement.

So I stand by what I said.

As for your opinion about my comment being dumb, imagine having your beliefs mocked openly. That's called discrimination. If we live in a society where people think it's okay to openly and blatantly discriminate against a person based on what they have voted (based on the society they wish to live in democratically) then yeah, that's far worse than a media outlet or politician spitting skewed fact.
