Not trying to justify racism, but does stopping a taxi on a street even work any more? Everybody uses apps and such, a taxi you see on a street is probably on its way to pick up someone.   
Also, "neeger" was historically a totally neutral and polite term for a dark-skinned person. Some people refuse to understand why they can't use it any more, they see it as an American problem and "no American will dictate me how to speak Estonian". Chances are, these people are also ignorant and racist, but it's not the whole story, there is trauma of oppression on both ends.
