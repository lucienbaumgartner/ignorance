Those who are 'vaccinated' preach about reduced symptoms, but it's a double-edged sword.

Great for 'personal protection' but absolutely devastating for poor old grandma or your immunocompromised cousin!! 

Unvaccinated will be symptomatic and self-isolate. 

Vaccinated will travel all over, unaware and untested, spreading covid around without ever knowing it until grandma is on the ventilator.  

It's like a really terrible global joke at this point. 

It's not even about connecting the dots anymore.

There is a red apple on display for all to see......but just because the system has been calling it a green apple for so long and ostracizing, ridiculing, banning and censoring anyone who says its red.......NPCs are now convinced they are looking at a green apple. 

Reason stands out in an unreasonable world.
