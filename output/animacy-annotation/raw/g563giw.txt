I would love to know where you live. It sounds like a Utopia. I think your viewpoint comes from a place of naivety. I'm guessing you're young and unaware of the world and its realities.  


&gt;You canâ€™t be discriminated for about anything at all.

Black people are discriminated against, black people are killed by racists or racist cops. A brown person may apply for a job and get rejected because he has a foreign looking name. Chinese people are currently facing discrimination due to Covid-19 originating in China. They have been verbally abused and physically attacked. That statement is not true in any sense.
