The way these people get *so triggered*, **so easily**, over a literal law of thermodynamics—a constraint of the physical reality we live in—never ceases to be amazing to me.

Human rights are things which **can only be taken away or denied to you**. Human rights **cannot be things which depend on someone else being there to serve you for free...**

It’s so braindead simple. A literal 5 year old could probably grasp this concept. Yet they still parrot their shitty buzzphrase line left and right, as if they’ve never seen it debunked before (I’d be willing to bet the vast majority have). 

The Left/Dems always claim to be pro-science and pro-facts, but when I see shit like this, I *know* they just pick and choose, and generally, their followers not **nearly** as smart as they (so desperately) try to make us believe.

Idk how they are able to dupe/brainwash so many ppl into thinking it’s okay to be this dumb and ignorant of reality. Prioritizing their tribe and its image, over factual reality.
