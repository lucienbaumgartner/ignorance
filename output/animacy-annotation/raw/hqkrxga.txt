&gt; You're really defensive over absolutely nothing, the subject hadnt changed at all and is still on the woman purposefully not testing so they can still go to work. That was the subject.

The subject was about the conditions which lead to them having to make that decision.

&gt;Your constant condescending questions are also laughable, why would I answer something for which you already have 2 canned responses to regardless of what I say.

How on earth are they condescending? It's fine if you're young. It's fine if you're privileged and ignorant of the reality of it, so long as you're willing to learn about how people experience it.

And if you're not going to answer, I think the answer is pretty obvious. And at that point no it's not fine. It's fine to say no to those questions, it's not fine to say no but know that you're right anyway, and disregard the experience of literally well over a hundred million Americans.

&gt;And yes, people did say its okay for the woman in question to do such a thing by pinning all the blame on "the system".

Where did they say that?
