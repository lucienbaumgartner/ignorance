I was going to make that comparison, as well. I think it's right on point. Some people take it too far into actually offensive/racist territory, but most people are just unaware and insensitive of the day. It happens every year, and I just file it into my "you're kind of an idiot" bank. I can imagine that it's even worse as a Hispanic as the actual racism against the Irish ended a long time ago.
