&gt;However, being overweight is something that can usually be overcome if somebody really wants to do so.

This sentance is what I really have a problem with.  If someone really wants to?  So are you telling me overweight people really just don't want to lose weight and get in shape?

Do you even have a comprehension of how serious a lifestyle change that takes?  How much dedication, discipline, hard work, restraint it is?  And how much you need a supporting community?  People who encourage you and support your choice, not fat shame you or discourage you or enable your poor lifestyle choices?

Do you have any comprehension of the mental health aspects that can cause obesity?  Do you understand that people may need therapy to support this change, and can get set back and relapse at any time?

That line "if they really want to" is so fucking dismissive and ignorant.  OF FUCKING COURSE THEY WANT TO.  Saying they don't want to is just fucking disrespectul to them.  So get that line out of your vocabulary and start to recognize that the situation they are in is complex and nuanced and doesn't have any simple solutions.
