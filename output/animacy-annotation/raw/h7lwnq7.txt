As a little girl (about 5-7 years old) I was heavily into the WWE. Mostly because my older brother was (he was about 8-11) and I wanted to do everything he did. I actually found myself playing “wrestling” with him quite often where we would pick a WWE wrestler and pretend to be them...I don’t know if many of you remember but there were 2 guys that usually came out in a team called “DX” and they would cross their arms over their junk and yell “suck it!”. As a little girl I was very naive and unaware of what this meant...so for a while everywhere I went I was in character mad ready to yell “DX! Suck it!” As I crossed my arms over my crotch...my mom finally had to have a talk with me when I went to the grocery store with her and walked up to random grocery aisles and announced “DX! Suck it!”
