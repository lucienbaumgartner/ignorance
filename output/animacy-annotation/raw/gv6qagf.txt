holy shit do you want some caviar to go with that nonsensical arrogance?  I'm talking about political views in America.  My personal views and your personal views are irrelevant when it comes to passing legislation if the voters in both parties and the people they elect don't agree as well.  I'm not really sure why you are attacking me personally when I'm talking about taking an honest analysis of the overall electorate.  I'm not sure what stereotype you imagined in your head so you could argue with that instead of actually talking about what I said.  I own guns too.  I have also lived in other countries where the idea of getting shot is basically impossible.  You probably agree with me on most things but you decided to ignore everything I said so you could argue with me pretending I am something you created.  I was making a point that there are small areas that can be targeted federally that could probably pass even if hard.  It won't fix nearly anything but it is a start. It involves political intelligence and maneuvering but I used to hang out at gun stores run by republicans and they didn't want dipshits owning guns either.  A truly savvy politician might be able to get something and a savvy democrat could use guns to get votes they would otherwise lose.  Relax.  Just because you want to argue with me doesn't mean I don't know shit and am naive and unaware of history.

What are you even asking for...it just seems like you are complaining at everybody and going "nothing is possible, fuck it"
