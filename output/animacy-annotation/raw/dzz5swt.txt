i know the point of this post is for content, and its great.  but can we please acknowledge that neither instances are uses of blackface?  a character in a show or movie using blackface is not the same thing as using blackface.

EDIT:  using blackface in a film/show means to portray a black character.  there is no black character in its always sunny in philadelphia who is portrayed by a white actor wearing blackface.  there's just mac, a white character played by a white actor.  mac uses blackface in the gang's lethal weapons films.  this is just mac being unaware and offensive, just as he is in general in the show, just as all five main characters are in general in the show.
