You know that the "people" that you refer to doesn't only include people in Western Society. Compared to the broader population of the entire planet, I would beg to differ.

The fact that a male has a penis, and a female has a vagina, is one differentiating factor, other than their chromosomes and other genetic contributing factors. It's not a difficult concept to grasp. What has happened, in a sense, is a theoretical ideology that has managed to permeate itself into some part of the social fabric of Western society, not the broader human civilization. With the advent of social media/technology, this ideology has made itself seem more popular than it really is. Your comment on "people's understanding" comes off as strikingly insular and ignorant of the rest of human society. However, this argument is weak because gender/sex should not be predicated on what a society simply believes, it should be based on scientific, biological fact. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it will still be a pig.

It also seems that you imply to make this a moral issue, which, if opposed to, would deem me to be a violator of. The problem I have with this is that your opposition to me would not be of good faith because you would inherently presuppose that I'm evil, or lesser moral standing, therefor my opinions should be rendered invalid and ignored.

If "people's understanding" of the existence of Jews shifted and society believed us to be the the vermin of society, would that necessarily then be true, based on your logic?
