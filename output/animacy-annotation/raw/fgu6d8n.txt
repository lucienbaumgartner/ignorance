I wouldn't say apathy. In general, Elvish culture tends to be fairly Buddhist in its real-world roots: enlightenment, a cosmic connection between all elves, pursuit of a rapturous afterlife as a result of reaching said enlightenment, a detachment from material pursuits, an emphasis on bonding with nature and your surroundings, etc. Except in D&amp;D there's objective proof that this afterlife exists and all young elves get to experience it (maybe that's forgotten realms only though?).

So elves only do anything if they find a deeper meaning in it. They cook in a zen-like pursuit of the perfect flavor. Or to better bond with their fellows. Or because they find a simple, empty pleasure in the act. Whatever the reason, it's both deeply personal and a layer beyond simple pragmatism.

So yeah, a human might learn Fireball by age 25 while an elf takes 200. It's because the elf wanted to learn the nature of the magic, to become that element of destruction, to reflect on how the Weave bends with the spell, and how they themselves are transformed by the casting. It's a spiritual experience. The human just learns the tried-and-true method of getting it to happen and moves on. The elf would argue that the human is being reckless and ignorant, that they toy at magic and put their very souls at risk with their hasty pursuit of power. The human doesn't care - humans are all about results-oriented philosophies. But it's everything to the elf, if they ever want to see paradise again.
