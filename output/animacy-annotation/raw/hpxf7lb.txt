Both right wing media *and politicians*, of course. Add some Foreign interference etc 

&gt;Brexit will be a Titanic success

- Boris Johnson

Unfortunately, you have to address how our population became so Ignorant and Delusional (fixed+false beliefs) and I sensed a lot of Paranoia (intense+irrational fear) against the EU

"Get Brexit Done"

"Global Britain"  

"No downsides, only considerable upsides"  

"We'll sort adult social care" 
 
"World-beating test and trace"  

"Operation Moonshot"  

"Technological, frictionless customs border solutions"  

Nazi-level slogan + propaganda campaigns which weren't critically analysed

&gt;It's easier to fool someone, than to convince them that they have been fooled

- Mark Twain 

Emotional arguments + Leave lies + promises + Fear + hatred (above) are far more powerful than logical arguments for a proposition, such as Remain

The Tapestry was shit stained long ago and Remain didn't stand a chance imo

......

Socrates' "Ship of Fools" is at the heart of the problem here 

You can show how sensible and well thought out all your plans are, but if the other guy has a flashy slogan representing unachievable goals saying 

"just trust me it'll work and you'll love it" 

the uninformed and newspaper-led electorate will usually choose him over you

It's a popularity contest, not an exercise in logic or reasoning 

As we saw, no one even reads a manifesto (outside of ukpol)
