If this is how you go about solving problems, then I seriously feel sorry for you. So you want to cure centuries of racism, yet here you are spitting a racist insult every two words. Bravo, you’re really making a difference.

The white population is a race, yes? A population that apparently is so privileged and ignorant that it’s OKAY to essentially bully and eviscerate in arguments online? By being incredibly toxic, you hope to achieve what?

I know it’s completely pointless arguing with someone such as you, a person who wishes to end racism yet believes that it’s impossible to be racist towards white people. Makes no sense but I guess I have no choice other than to report you to the moderators for being racist.
