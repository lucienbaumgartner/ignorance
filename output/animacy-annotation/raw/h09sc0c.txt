Saw someone link this and think it's important for everyone to read. Taylor Swift is not dumb and unaware of this man. This is really gross, disappointing. She really should discuss her reason for choosing him to work with. She's helping this man make more money for her own selfish reasons.

This is just a really awful thing she's done and I hope the people that care about TS above all else hold her accountable the same way you'd hold anyone else. If you're okay with working for a man like this or don't see a problem then there's nothing anyone can say to show you otherwise.
