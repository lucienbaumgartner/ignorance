&gt;&gt;!In addition to this, Isherwell also lied to Dr. Mindy regarding his death, claiming that he would die alone when in reality he enjoyed one last supper with his near and dear after having done everything within his power to stop the disaster.&lt;

Is he actually lying for sure or did he just genuinely read that from his algorithm and his algorithm was wrong? Similarly, while the post-credit scene shows his prediction for the president's death was insanely accurate, when he first told her during the launch I assumed it was a nod to the fact that the algorithm is nonsense. You could read the post-credit scene as not actually part of what actually happened but just a joke or riff on what happened to the rich deserters. 

Either way, I think it's not necessarily conclusive based on the details and as far as the movie treats it, he isn't shown to obviously know humanity's fate at any point. Considering his character is a mockery of that tech billionaire archetype with several references to how unaware and often stupid they are, I'm going to say he didn't know.
