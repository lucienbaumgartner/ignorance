Ugh, this happens all the time. While I'd rather not give away my exact age, I'm not a kid or anything, but I find a lot of them are smarter than they let on. The worst are the squeaky ones on online games and stuff. They're so quick witted, and ignorant, that it's hard to really 'win' any sort of argument with them. Not that I make a habit out of arguing with kids! Just that it's a common occurrence.
