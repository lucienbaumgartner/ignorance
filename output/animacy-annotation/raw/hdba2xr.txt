Ive been saying this from beginning of the misinformation. We cant beat them so join them. There are plenty of real corruption stories and ways to use "fake news" to get actual facts out there. I mean seriously there should be a movement to put out the real info. Sadly there's plenty of real corruption and govt overreach. Thats why these fools are getting conned. For decades govt hasnt listened to the people. So that anger festered. Then con men like trump used this emotion to tell them what they wanted to hear. Once you connect emotion to political views and identity you got em hooked. It comes from a real place but ppl are so un educated and ignorant of how system works and facts they fall for oldest con artist trick in the book. "Tell them what they want to hear."- con artist's playbook im not saying to do this its just what trump did
