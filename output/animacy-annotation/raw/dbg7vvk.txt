Except:
1. He's not in government power and hasn't been in years.
2. He was never really involved in any kind of policy making.
3. And most importantly, **he was saying the complete opposite of how it reads.**


For instance, let me demonstrate. If I were to say to you, "We have been happy to sit and watch while ISIS bombs more and more people." Am I actually saying that you and I have enjoyed watching that? No, I'm lamenting our inaction.


When asked about the email, he stated that was doing exactly that: lamenting the degradation of education and the resulting idiocy. As he later reworded for clarity:

&gt;“And as I’ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking…”


There are established conventions in the English language that very easily lend themselves to conspiracies, but I highly doubt the Chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts is in on some grand brainwashing scheme.
