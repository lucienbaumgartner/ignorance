Thank you for posting this. My sex drive is super low, almost nonexistent. Every partner I’ve had has been the complete opposite. They also didn’t understand boundaries or mutual respect and understanding. Mistakes were made. A LOT. I’ve come to the point where, if someone is sexually incompatible with me, I won’t even think twice about saying no to dating them. It took me a pathetically long time to have enough self-respect to actually feel ok saying no and sticking to that. I know a lot of people would think this is obvious, but holy shit it is not. To actually know I’m not insane for wanting to wait for sex to happen naturally and not put a fucking timeline on it was very infuriating yet relieving. I refuse to bend to other people just so they can satisfy themselves. I will not date someone who is that disrespectful and unaware of themselves. More people should know this. And put it into practice. 

I’m glad people like you exist. :)
