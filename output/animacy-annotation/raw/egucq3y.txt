And that's how a no-knock is justified. Do you just think the police are going to sit by as you possibly destroy evidence because you don't want to let them in, or someone else does while you read a warrant if they have it there.

Your process leaves the police with two options for someone they believe to be violent and armed, let the person arm themselves and do whatever they want inside, or quick notice and entry to catch them unaware and unarmed.

Also what's stopping thieves from just forging a warrant, I doubt you know the exact details of every aspect of one so you wouldn't know if it was a true warrant or not.
