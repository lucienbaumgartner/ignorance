Have you seen his IG live that spark the controversy? I guess not. It was the most embarrassing thing I've seen that came out from a celebrity for a long time.

He could've just defended his wife without dragging that he uses racial slurs to his friends. It was dumb and ignorant of him. The ignorance was unreal. He only said his sorry after everything went downhill which we all know his agent/s forced him to release his sorry statement. But it's too late.
