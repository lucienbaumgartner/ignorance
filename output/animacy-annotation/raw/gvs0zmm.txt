Honestly yeah it sounds like rape. If you moved his hand off of your leg twice you were showing that you were uninterested in being touched and he kinda took advantage of you especially if you were drunk and unaware of what was going on. Even if he stopped after you told him to he didn't get consent to do what he did which makes it rape. I'm really sorry this happened to you.
