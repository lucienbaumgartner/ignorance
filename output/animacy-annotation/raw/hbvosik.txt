&gt;Amaterasu instantly ingnites on Cerberus

However it didn't on the raikage unless sasuke intentionally made it miss or be slower which he wouldn't do 

&gt;How is his dragon 5th gate Lee speed?

As it was Faster than Gaara's sand which Lee had to go 5th gate with no weights on 

&gt;5th gate Lee speed is still nothing compared to what the Raikage used to dodge the Amaterasu

Yes, however this plus the Distance that Deidara would have would have would make it possible for Deidara to dodge it 

&gt;He was almost blitzed

So he wasn't blitzed 

&gt;Itachi’s body flicker &gt;&gt;&gt; Hebi Sasuke’s body flicker 

Funny how someone Is faster than another when distractions are being used this is just Sasuke being disoratied not him being blitzed remember this is also sasuke bloodlusted so he probably isn't thinking straight or fighting like he normally would.

&gt;5 kage summit Sasuke slam dunks on Kakashi , what do you mean

He was practically blind and unaware of his full capabilities whereas Kakashi has Kamui and years of experience aswell as no end of techniques to stand a chance atleast 

&gt;Gets negged by Susanoo.

Just no Deidara one shots the Sussano as Madara's Perfect Sussano was able to rival Tailed beasts and Madara's Sussano is much stronger than Itachi's and Deidara one shot the 3 tails with his weakest bomb
