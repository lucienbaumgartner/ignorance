You can absolutely make fun of anyone respectfully but you can't do it in the same way for everyone and ignoring that civility means you're a dick. You can always take jokes too far and when you do you notice how no one laughs and you've killed the mood entirely with your insincerity

Punching down is a real thing. You can still make fun of groups respectfully, but hearing the same homophobic and transphobic jokes people have been saying since the 80s isn't comedy anymore, it's disrespectful and ignorant. That doesn't mean you can't make gay or trans jokes, it's about how you say them and what you mean by them

Laugh with people, not at them
