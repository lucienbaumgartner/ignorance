&gt; If 50%+1 of the population felt that killing you would benefit them, would you argue against them? 

No. I’d fight.

&gt;If so, what argument would you use to convince them to spare you?

I wouldn’t argue. I’d fight.

 &gt;Would killing two people so that they are now 50%-1 be a legitimate and moral course of action?

Do I have the backing of the 48%? 

&gt; So it is not your personal view that Christians are "insane radicals" or "crazy"? 

Those are labels used by Europeans governments and people of the time. They threatened the groups leaders and men folk with death.

&gt;Those are usually not descriptors used for people a person likes. 

I don’t see why you can’t like somone even though one aspect of the person is abhorrent. 

&gt;You sure are trying hard to avoid answering any questions in a straightforward or honest way. Are you afraid of what you might find?

I’m being very forward. You’re trying very hard to put words in my mouth, so the appearance of good faith conversation isn’t clear. 

&gt; As for the hypothetical: it's an opportunity to eliminate someone who disagrees with you on how society will be structured, which is certainly valuable if you want the rule to be what 50%+1 says goes. Also you'd get to steal his stuff. Him being unaware and unable to defend himself gives you power over him. Essentially, you are put in a position where you have means, motive, and opportunity.

&gt; So, since you decide not to act on it, why not? I can say that you shouldn't kill him because exercising your power in that way would violate his natural rights. You'd be taking his life, damaging/taking his property, and those things are wrong. But you have said you don't believe in natural rights, so why not?

Because most people wouldn’t want the winsome attitude of an individual to be the final authority. I would want other to treat me as they want to be treated. This is pretty common concept universally recognized across religions and belief structures.
