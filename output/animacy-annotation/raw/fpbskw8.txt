it will totally come in time - people have very limited energy right now, and forming new friendships is pretty low on the priority list 

..... I'm super upset to hear that for you, that is so unfortunate and ignorant that she said that.. ugh that's awful.. if anyone is socially inept here, it's those assholes!!!!

Keep in mind, soon your kid is going to be awesome at making his own friends at school, and all his little friends are going to be so excited to come to his birthday :)  It's tough at this age bc they are socially dependent on you, big time, but over the next year he's going to make all these connections and will no way be punished, even if you were less welcome by the parents! These kids won't care!
