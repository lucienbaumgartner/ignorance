Well, that's fascinating to me as someone who did the opposite and went from wet to dry, lol.
As an undergrad and then as a masters student, choosing my Molecular Biology majors, I always kinda looked down upon Bioinformatics as not valid enough choice for someone who wanted hardcore science since in my mind experiment equaled science but that was incredibly immature and ignorant of me, I discovered the real Bioinformatics when I couldn't do my own Genomics/transcriptomics data analysis and felt incredibly incompetent. I then tried to pursue both but my focus was greatly divided and I couldn't do either well until I decided to transition into dry. I don't know for sure but I think the future of biology is gonna be pretty dry, lol.
