How many different versions of this same sad story? Thousands? It is amazing these aren’t the viral content taking over FB or whatever it’s called. Different folks, same memes, life styles and blissful trust in prayer. You know they have to be losing a lot of their peer groups,FB friends and church members. There are a lot more of these examples than all the folks supposedly developing post vac symptoms. How ignorant and clueless can they be?
