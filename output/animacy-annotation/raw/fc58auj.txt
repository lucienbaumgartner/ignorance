So by saying the creator makes a story how they want you decide that I'm saying they are being pigeonholed and should be gender inclusive because the gender plays a role? How pigheaded and ignorant that sounds. I said the creator creates the story they tell and shouldn't have to change it to appease anyone. It's their story, not ours. Don't go trying to tell them to change it because you don't like it. That's suppressing freedom of expression and creativity, idiot. Also, the message, is that the dude has a sister you can play, at least for the pictured game.
