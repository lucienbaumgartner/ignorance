Your refusal to acknowledge context and deride anyone who disagrees with you as an ableist is equal parts arrogant and ignorant  

That word can apply to ideas, inanimate objects, state and corporate policies, programming, and a host of things absolutely unrelated to and mutually exclusive from those with a mental handicap. To say using a generic word in common parlance is ableist when referring to a nonliving entity is disingenuous at best. 

I would never speak down upon someone with a intellectual disability, but I also wont alter my use of language in reference to completely unrelated things and issues 

If you dont like it, form a hierarchical group and force me with violence, or get the hell over yourself
