We give Americans a bit of a hard time for being so inwardly focused and unaware of the rest of the world, but reading that article is kinda sad and makes it more understandable. It’s not that they’re all ignorant to the world, many want to travel but can’t afford it or are not given adequate paid vacation time.

My American wife only got 2 weeks paid vacation time per year which didn’t roll over if not used, could only be used at certain times, and was generally frowned upon by colleagues if used. She said she was one of the lucky ones to get two weeks too! Hard to blame people in those circumstances
