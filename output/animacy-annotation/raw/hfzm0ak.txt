It's crazy to me that some people even in 2021 still act sooo surprised and unaware that people eat differently than they do. Like how close minded and uneducated is that to think the entire world eats just like you...strange! Some people never learn about differences within their culture and lives let alone outside of it. I use the opportunity to educate people about it...I'm just glad I'm not so limited in my experiences.
