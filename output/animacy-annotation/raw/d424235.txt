My first instinct while reading this was that it must have been a joke, but then I got to the part about him being alone and unaware that anyone was listening/watching him, and it kind of made my heart drop. That's so fucking creepy. 

I'm really not sure what advice to give you here. Being blunt and all, I think I would've confronted him right there in sort of a 'what the fuck?' kind of way, but I don't blame you at all for needing to go gather your thoughts.

I hope somebody else has something more helpful to contribute. I'm very curious about people's take on this one.
