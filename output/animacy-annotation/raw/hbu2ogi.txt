It kinda depends but it doesn’t look too rosy to be honest. Like in all things the streamers will lead the way, so if they’re not encouraged to play by the rules, Joe blogs isn’t going too. But it also has a lot to do with wow. The Development team behind well has become stale and ignorant of their shortcomings but this could be the wake up call to get them firing on all pistons again and if they can do it then it will be good for both games. If not I fear they are both fucked.
