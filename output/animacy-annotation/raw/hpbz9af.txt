Werent you the one that said you should have the right to kill these people? 

All I did was take your point to its logical conclusion. 

Im happy you have friends that wouldnt say that to you. Thats great. 

Pushing for the right to murder thieves is pretty hateful in its own right. Especially when you consider your whole country is a result of pillaging the world. I mean so are most other countries but America exceptionalism is is fun to pick apart because of how ignorant and generally uneducated americans are of their own country's story. 

Raping the Philippines, central and south america, oceana, the middle east, mexico, attempting and failing to take canada. 

Your whole existence is based on theft, demonizing and pushing for death of thieves is advocating for your own execution. Im applauding it and qgreeing with you. Why are you mad?
