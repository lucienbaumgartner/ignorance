Have you seen videos of COVID wards in hospitals? This isn't killing just large people with pre-existing conditions. On top of killing people, this virus is new and we don't know what the totality of the long term effects are. We are seeing permanently damaged kidneys, lungs and hearts in people who were otherwise healthy before. If you want to care for lives, houses, whatever, you'd encourage your government to shut down and literally make people wear masks and stay home as often as possible for a month straight if not longer. Use disbursement of OUR funds form the government to keep us afloat. The lockdowns here in the US were a joke because people like you advocated people running around outside without masks and dumb shit like that. You're a fucking joke who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about. Look at literally every other advanced nation on this planet and look at their numbers, inflate them to match out population and you'll see that American's are so selfish and ignorant that they have fucked this up. Y'all need some damn parents to make your dumbasses stay in the fucking corner because you can't even think shit through without proclaiming "I can't breathe!" while literally people were murdered because they couldn't breathe because they state sanctioned oppression on their necks. You're a weak ass bitch that is dumb as hell. End of rant.
