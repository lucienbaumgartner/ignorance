\[...\]Dom Pedro II (2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891), nicknamed "the Magnanimous",\[1\] was the second and last monarch of the Empire of Brazil, reigning for over 58 years

Pedro II inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, but he turned Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth, and form of government—a functional representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in the Platine War, the Uruguayan War, and the Paraguayan War, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture, and the sciences, and he won the respect and admiration of people such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women's rights.\[211\] On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook.\[212\] He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.\[213\] Because of his increasing "indifference towards the fate of the regime" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the "prime, perhaps sole, responsibility" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.\[214\]\[215\] 

By June 1887, the Emperor's health had considerably worsened and his personal doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment.\[221\] While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed.\[222\] While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil.\[223\] With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, "Great people! Great people!"\[224\] Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888.\[225\]\[226\] The "whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration."\[227\] With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the monarchy seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.\[228\]
  

  
\[231\] The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.\[232\] Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces.\[233\] The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.\[234\]\[235\]  
Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy.\[236\]\[237\] They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889.\[238\] The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion.\[239\]\[240\] Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that "\[r\]arely has a revolution been so minor."\[241\] During the ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome.\[242\] He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward.\[243\] When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: "If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then."\[244\] He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.\[245\]

Although he managed to remain calm and composed during the events of November 14th through 16th, D. Pedro II surely felt a deep sadness because of the exile from his homeland.\[64\] Pedro II wrote a heartfelt message of farewell to the Brazilian people that expressed no ill-will toward the new government. He wrote: “Absenting myself, then, I, with all the members of my family, will cherish for Brazil the deepest, most yearning remembrance, while praying earnestly for its greatness and prosperity”\[65\].

.\[68\] Towards the new regime, “his attitude \[…\] was kindly but patronizing and, in many respects, paternal”\[69\]. In later years, Pedro II remarked on his hope for a republican government in Brazil: “I should have desired \[…\] that the civilization of Brazil had made possible the immediate admission of the republican system, which, to me, is the most perfect possible in human affairs…I wanted only to contribute towards a social state in which the republic could be ‘planted,’ so to speak by me, and could bring forth fruit in proper season” \[70\].  In his diary, he similarly wrote that he would have been a republican, had he judged Brazil advanced enough for a republican government (“\[…\] ) \[71\]. D. Pedro feared that Brazil, if democratically governed, would fall to military dictatorship like other Latin American republics since the masses were uneducated and ignorant of democratic ideals.

\[72\] In regard to the new Constitution, Pedro found it lacking in protection of electoral rights and less fitted to the “temperament of the Latin race” than the Constitution under the Monarchy
  



  
The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end—he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises.

Pedro's last couple of years were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil.\[248\] He never supported a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire "to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort."\[249\] One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia.\[250\]\[251\] Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family.\[252\] His last words were "May God grant me these last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil".\[253\] While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: "It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland."\[254\]\[...\]
