It’s not about personally affecting me. It’s how it affects other human beings. I have a friend in Texas who has a huge chance of danger due to lack of access to abortion. I had a trans friend that want to go into the military and do to the bull pushed by trump was denied and still is entrapped in legal troubles with the government. Another friend got expelled from highschool due to being a peeping Tom by going into the bathroom they identified with. Sure none of those things personally harm me but they’ve harmed friends and family members. There are a couple that have also personally harmed me I just don’t feel like explaining everyone of them and remembering the exact bills. It’s not about how it has an effect on me and thinking that’s the only way to think is incredible selfish and ignorant of others lives where they can have a much tougher time doing certain things.
