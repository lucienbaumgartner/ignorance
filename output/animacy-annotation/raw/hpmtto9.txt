Yeah, that must be it. You obviously then completely avoid alcohol and refined sugar, since those are being used to manipulate and control- all while being documented and admitted to (but I’m sure you’ve looked all of that up). And definitely not the ever-encroaching police state. And not the crippling debt ubiquitous to American society. And surely not the archaic religious dogma spreading violence like wildfire. And it couldn’t be the gutted education designed to keep people ignorant and poor. It’s the free medicine that’s going to control us.
