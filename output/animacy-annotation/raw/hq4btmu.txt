Yeah no problem. If they aren’t willing to disclose this information, don’t give them your money! At least that’s my opinion. The diagnosis is a big thing cause of money, so it’s worth the time to take finding people willing to work with you. And although there’s probably more places than not that are some kind of ignorant and old fashioned, and i’m sure there are the couple that are not. And at the very least you can just avoid those bad ones without giving them thousands of dollars with these quick questions. Or even considering booking a session of therapy or something as a trail run at the place or with the assessor if they allow you to without a diagnosis. I’m currently doing that right now, feeling out their services and staff before I decide it’s a good idea.
