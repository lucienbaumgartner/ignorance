Holy shit, this is straight up ignorant and damaging 

&gt;depression is sin

No, even if I believed in "sin" there is ZERO chance that an illness is sin.... 

&gt;chronic pain is caused by the sin of your Ancestors 

No, chronic pain is caused by genetics. And if there was some omnipotent, loving, sky daddy he sure as shit wouldn't punish us with chronic pain because of our ancestors. 

&gt;various people are born with defects

Calling people "defective" is straight up insulting, disabled is one,  thing but defective is a super screwed up view to have of people. Defective products get returned or thrown away. We SHOULDNT do that with people.

&gt;even better if you suffered 50-60 years.

Who says these kinds of things? "Oh boy I'm sure glad I get to be depressed and in constant pain for 60 years, because God loves me" 

&gt;You can be healed if God wants to

If this is the true then one of the following must also be true

1) God doesn't WANT to heal the hurting, if that the case then why should anyone worship God? A God that can heal, but doesn't, isn't a worthy God.

2) God doesn't exist because the healing doesn't happen.



If your just another internet troll, go do it somewhere else. People come here seeking actually help, not this bs. And if you actually believe this then you need to go seek professional help and get medicated.
