Somewhat. There were periods of time when I hated it and other periods where it was actually pretty good. For some reason towards the end of most of my years in high school I remember being quite enjoyable (except the last). I guess since it takes me so long to adjust to and become comfortable with new things; there were some classes I took where I eventually got to be friendly enough with my classmates that it was actually fun sometimes to work with them. 

Elementary school I was so young and unaware of things that it's hard to say how I felt. From what I remember it was mix of okay and bad. 

I took two semesters of post-secondary (university/college) and those were bad and worse. The last one especially was misery and probably poisoned any notion of me ever stepping foot in a school ever again.
