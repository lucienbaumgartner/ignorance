After a rather long drought while recovering from an injury, I picked up *Wolf Hall* yesterday and dived straight in. The language is beautiful, the use of characters who are very familiar seen through a perspective which isn't the most common one, the depth of the emotion the protagonist feels when he loses his whole family to plague, yet survives...I'm not writing at the moment, and although I'm a very omnivorous reader and will just as happily read pulp sci-fi and thrillers as books that aspire to being high lit (and I've read highbrow books which are lumps of crap as well), the best books do have that luscious prose that keeps the reader hooked and unaware of the time and place that they're sitting in. (And this is not just the domain of litfic; a good thriller is written with pace and action in mind so that the reader is pulled through it seamlessly. There's a real knack to writing prose that fits the intention of the story rather than needlessly larding on words where they're not needed.)

That sort of thing is what prose can do that some other media can't. Knowing how prose works is one of the most important parts of writing prose fiction. If you're writing a thriller, you need to know how the words pull you through the story so you can create the right effect on the reader. If you're trying to experiment, having a wide range of reading experiences means you can choose the right tools for the job. The best writers have all had that instinct down to a T: even the books that are fashionable to hate did something right for their particular audience. Reading for a writer is basically figuring out how to develop the skills to write something that strikes a chord with readers -- because if you're not a part of your own audience, how will you know that you're actually reaching them effectively?
