Recruiters are the dumbest, most judgmental, biased and racist pieces of shit you will ever come across in your life. Hands down. It’s like they’ve combined being a trumper, far right looney and shady used car salesman all in one. 

You will never find another group of people more despicable than them. They are the most worthless and unnecessary profession in this world. It attracts only the most narcissistic and ignorant of people. 

What do you expect from them?
