Your skin doesn’t look that bad OP don’t say that, I think you just toke an unpleasant picture, we all went through this stage when we started retinoids.

It’s disrespectful and ignorant of him saying it’s triggering “trypophobia” on the cost of your skin and hurting your feelings, whoever has this kind of phobia can scroll, but you can’t scroll hurtful words.

Also I’m pretty sure everyone on this thread have had or posted a picture ofsimilar skin like you when they started, so ignore his “trypophobia” comment. :)
