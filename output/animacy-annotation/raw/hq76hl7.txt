I’m so so sorry for the poor scruples of my generation. I’m making an assumption here about your age, but even if I’m a bit off, it doesn’t change my stance. My generation, overall, is so pathetic and ignorant and I feel horrible for the children who have had to grow up in our care. Largely, we’re to blame for the state of our polarized politics and this “I can’t see passed my own selfish agenda long enough to even begin to consider the betterment of the community I’m in as a whole” attitude.. no, not attitude. More like lifestyle. I believe my generation makes up the bulk of the Q phenomenon. It’s so sad to see people I grew up with fall prey to that shite. We’re supposed to be adults coming into an age of wisdom and we’re just not. Hey.. don’t listen to your mom when she gets that way. What she has could be considered a mild mental illness. Nothing is written in stone. You can work to make this world and your life whatever you want it to be. Your mom should really be a bit ashamed of herself.
