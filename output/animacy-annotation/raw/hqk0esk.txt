It's bad tv to constantly remind someone of something just so you can look like you have the moral high ground. Any showrunners who think someone will change their mind on a real world issue because it was in their show are ignorant and narcissistic. And this these aren't science documentaries. No one's watching this to be informed about topics that have nothing to do with the show.
