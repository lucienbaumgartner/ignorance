Ok, I had a 20 something year old guy come in after he had ‘circumcised’ himself because his shitty girlfriend though it was weird he was intact. Homeboy had literally flayed the skin off his penis from the head to the balls. He seemed completely normal and unaware that what he had just done (with no anesthesia) was totally insane. He was like, ‘can’t you just sew the edges of the skin back together?’ I was like, ‘Dude, I’m an ER doctor, not a urologist, you’re getting admitted so the penis specialist can put what’s left of your dick back together again in the morning.’ After I had controlled the bleeding and wrapped it up he told me he was an EMT student. JFC. Guy had no insight that what he had done was COMPLETELY fucked up.
