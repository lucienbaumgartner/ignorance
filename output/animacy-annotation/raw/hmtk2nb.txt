&gt;I know people that would hugely benefit from many of Clinton's polices ideas who's biggest beef with Clinton was

Well clearly whatever they saw in her policies didn't override their perception of her. How is that their fault? Bernie Sanders doesn't get arguments that he's corrupt thrown his way. Neither do numerous other well known politicians. The ones that do, whether they're legitimately criminally corrupt or not is immaterial if their actions still play so very close to that being the case, it ceases to matter in the court of public opinion.

Did you ever ask this person what Clinton could offer to entice them to vote for her? I'm sure they'd have an answer and that's my point.

&gt;Many voters want incrementalism and worry about government initiating big changes.

And those voters are selfish and unaware of the tragedy of people less well off than them. They are conservatives that have largely co-opted the Democratic party because the Republican party became less enticing to them. They didn't change their policies, just their parties.

&gt;The democratic party is a big tent 

Maybe it shouldn't be.
