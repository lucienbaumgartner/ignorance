&gt;Thats from my personal experience from coworkers, family, and friends testing positive. I'm not a doctor and this is not medical advice. But from my limited experience, this shit ain't half as bad as they make it out to be....

You know how stupid and ignorant that sounds right? That 300,000 plus people have died in the United States with social distancing/measures in place and the number keeps climbing? I have lost a relative to Covid19. It isn't some joke.
