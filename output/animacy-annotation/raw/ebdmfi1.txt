It's truly a riveting series. We are technically on Season 2 Episode 10, Seasons 3 &amp; 4 have already been approved and are still in the writing phase. There is even wilder speculation that Seasons 5-8 are a true possibility. Best part, is all the networks and internet platforms are carrying it live which allows the viewer to have a sense of control much like determining the camera angles in which to watch it. This series has literally made billions of ad review to all the networks and internet platforms employing thousands of people that might not have otherwise been beneficiaries of such an extraordinary live performance series. The most impactful aspect of this whole series is the sheer volume of new viewers to a genre that never had any interest in politics before. This will lead to a positive result for the country as a whole because these new viewers will learn more about civics than they ever thought that they would want to know. Politicians in the future will no longer be content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. They will have to earn votes by persuading voters to see their viewpoint on subjects and policies that they support. It's a phenomenal series indeed.
