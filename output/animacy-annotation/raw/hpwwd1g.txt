Yeah, I just watched season one yesterday and I’m on Season 2.  That lady really was psychic!  She’s divorced and I bet she’s not “managing the family’s finances” and driving around in Bentleys and buying 16 year olds brand-new SUVs anymore.  She reminds me of a broke Kim K, sounds just like her and is as aloof and unaware of herself, back then.  As least Kim K grew up a little and found some new hobbies (law/criminal justice) because she’s not going to be beautiful via 🔪 forever.
