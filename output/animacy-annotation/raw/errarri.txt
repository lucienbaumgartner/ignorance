How did I insinuate it's a fact? I said it was my opinion and pro-life people usually don't agree. I specifically added the pro-life view to my statement, even though I do not agree.

&gt;I have the means to have an abortion and doing so harms absolutely no one except for myself and (to pro-lifers, I personally don't think the fetus is harmed) a being that is wholly unaware and incapable of feelings or thought.

What is up with this subreddit lately? I feel like a lot of our newer users are just talking at people instead of having actual discussions with them.
