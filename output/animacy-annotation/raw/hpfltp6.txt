In what way? Do you not realize that the wealth keep their money in life insurance policies because the interest rates are like 10x higher than banks, and the money is liquid with out being penalized for it.. you speak on my choices, but I’m sure you consume high fructose syrup and 1 million other chemicals that are in our food and everyday products.. if you drink one pop a day your giving your self brain damage. If you drink water from the tap depending on the process to clean the water your giving yourself brain damage. You can’t just assume what type of person I am and what I have going for me. So because I do the same drug that doctors and parents feel comfortable enough to give to kids, everyday mind you, I’m some how less qualified to talk about subjects I clearly know more about then 90% of the people who commented “that’s dumb” with out even realizing the amount they could have if they utilized other plans or even other retirement plans.. you commented that’s ignorant and dumb before you even looked into it.
