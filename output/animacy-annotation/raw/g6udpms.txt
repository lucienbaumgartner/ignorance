Despite your best attempts I will still vote for Biden. You really did your best to turn me off from ever wanting to work with a standard democrat. I have to unfortunately unite behind Biden solely because of the alternative, but after Nov 3 I look forward to washing my hands of assuming any goodwill between actual progressives and centrist democrats. The bourgeoisie is too comfortable and unaware of the world swirling around them. Asleep at the wheel and only concerned about one issue here or one issue there. I understand that getting the bigger picture is hard, so honestly I just need to accept that the insulated upper middle class is caught in their own bubble and that they canâ€™t be coaxed out of their slumber.
