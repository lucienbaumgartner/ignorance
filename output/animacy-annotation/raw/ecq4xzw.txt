Its a representation of a subsection of the community. Like the majority of players here are probably a bit more invested/dedicated and theres not much representation from casual players. Also its probably much more US focused.

 And as with all reddit it is *very* prone to becoming a bit of a hivemind or circlejerk.

Like the amount of times this sub has yelled that "game ded" in the past 6 years and then ive logged in to find my outfit perfectly happy and unaware that wrel shot a pidgeon or something. Of course  my outfit isnt a accurate representation of the community either, but then again no where is.
