Yeah, no. 

If you value Wichita’s progress, you’d elect to vote for people that want to see Wichita change. 

First and foremost the majority of your claims are factually incorrect. 

Second, you clearly don’t have ICT’s best interests at heart, if you did, you wouldn’t vote for Longwell or Wells. 

Third, I could give a fuck about your opinion on my ‘tact.’ Do you think that people that suffer at the expense of other’s success give a fuck about whether or not you approve of our ‘methods’? Cause I sure as fuck don’t. 

If you’re so self centered, arrogant, and ignorant, that you can’t observe how the current city administration is detrimental to Wichita, thank i could care less about earning your ignorant vote.
