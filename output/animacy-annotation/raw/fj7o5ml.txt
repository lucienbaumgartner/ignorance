It's lame and ignorant that anyone would do that for a good time. 

At the same time, if it wasn't a fish-bearing stream, it's really not a big deal. Natural land and mudslides will strip wider paths right down to bedrock and nature recovers just fine. If proper protections are put in place to prevent any other morons from driving their trucks up this creek, it will recover fast and within a few seasons all signs of this change will be gone.
