If you think that anatta excludes a literal interpretation of rebirth then you have done very little research into Buddhism. This is literally the most basic beginners question that westerners have on Buddhism. On /r/Buddhism we get probably between 1 to 10 questions a week that are "how does rebirth work without a self?". The Buddha describes this so extensively that it's clear that anyone who says these things has done no reasonable reading into the scriptures.

&gt; Sure life goes on but only in the mundane sense not for the particular self.

The mindstream carries on, as said by the Buddha, the final set of five skandhas in this life causes the first set in the next life.

Seriously, because this does piss me off, exactly how much Buddhist philosophy or scriptures have you read? You do NOT understand how much us Buddhists have to deal with these ignorant western reinterpretations of Buddhism that haven't even gotten past the MOST BASIC misinterpretations and confusions of a beginner. Asian and traditional voices are literally being silenced because of the forcing of these ignorant and baseless misunderstandings into Buddhist spaces.

It is extremely disrespectful and ignorant that you would go around asserting this stuff clearly without actually doing any actual research into the scriptures or the Buddha's teachings.
