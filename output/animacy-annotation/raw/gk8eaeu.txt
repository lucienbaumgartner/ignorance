I have many autoimmune disorders. I am high risk. That's the reason I need to go to see my doctors in the first place. Is your proposed solution really to have people who are at risk and need medical treatment go in a bunker and die because "they shouldn't be out in the first place"? How are people like me supposed to get treatment, medication, infusions, testing, etc. for chronic conditions? How incredibly absurd and ignorant of you. You're right that our differences probably won't be resolved on a post like this, because I'm definitely not changing my mind about how it's necessary to be a kind and thoughtful person during a pandemic. We live in a society. I wish you more understanding and compassion for all people moving forward -- genuinely.
