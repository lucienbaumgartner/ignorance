I get what you are saying but the way it reads is he is chiding people for associating him with the franchise in general.  His “I don’t f with them and they don’t f with me” comes off like such a chip on his shoulder and doesn’t even make sense. If he had said “don’t lump me in with people who wrongly took PPP loans” that would make sense. But stating he is offended to be associated with The Bachelor comes off as  highly entitled and unaware of “where he came from”, so to speak. I realize it’s semantics, but his word choice is why he lost the message with most people.
