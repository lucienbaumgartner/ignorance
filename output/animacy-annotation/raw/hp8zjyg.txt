It was a long time ago and I can't find it anymore. Simple logic, though. Why would a person film themselves doing things that de-value the meat? It has long been known that fear and pain cause the meat to taste 'off', and can even make the meat darker in color. That's why ranchers do everything they can to keep cattle calm and unaware of what is going to happen.
In one vegan film they show pigs knee deep in filth, with no food or water. They don't show the invading activists blocking the drains and locking out the farmers who wanted to fix the drains, clean, and feed the barn full of distressed animals.
Films are all about forced perspective and editing. For example is you use a drone to film a farm right after a flood or tornado (Dominion) of course it will have dirty animals and unfortunate deaths. I know farmers, and none of them have enough money to burn to destroy profit by mistreating the animals they raise. https://www.beefmagazine.com/animal-rights/dominion-documentary-smear-campaign-against-animal-ag
