Is it though?  Just because someone swerves and hits another vehicle does it mean they purposefully acted to hit the person's vehicle?  Could they have simply lost control of the wheel and accidentally swerved or have been completely inattentive and unaware that someone was there?

Lets say that while you're walking down the street you come upon a friendly dog with no owner in sight.  After trying unsuccessfully to find the owner you bring that dog to your home and welcome a new pet into your family.  If the owner of the dog discovers that you have the dog would you say that you are guilty of theft?
