Biden has already said reuniting the kids with their parents isn't going to happen overnight. This shit happened under Trump. Biden is working with what he has which isn't much considering how badly Trump handled it. Maybe if these assholes did the right thing in 2016, this wouldn't have happened in the first place.

These attacks are just so stupid and ignorant of how anything works. These people are living in a fantasy world. It would be great if we could reunite all these families in a day but that's not realistic unless they want us to release these kids and tell them they're on their own.
