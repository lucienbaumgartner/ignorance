Bullshit. Even if I don’t get a lot of mail I’m not so selfish and unaware that others don’t rely on it, and even still the one or two random pieces of important mail I get a month could show on any day and I wouldn’t want any less. If you had asked me three months, despite getting almost nothing from it, I would have said let’s make it 7 days a week. 

It’s a government service not a for profit business.
