1. I did not say that there was concrete evidence that Brian Laundrie was a narcissist, but my statement was only to suggest that narcissism and abusive behavior go hand in hand. I clearly understand the behavior more than you do, given that you said something that was blatantly false and ignorant of these sorts of disorders - that it was "next to impossible that (someone who commits suicide) is a narcissist".

2. Who said what, and believe what exactly? Do you have sources?
