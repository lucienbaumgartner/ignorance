We know these groups were created by and are still funded by wealthy, elitist politicians. We know those same politicians are plagued with scandal and have relations with people like ep and max, and yet we flock to them to stand up for a “just” cause because the majority of the population is ignorant.  I mean the true definition of ignorant, just completely unaware and uninterested in doing their research. Absolutely mind-boggling.
