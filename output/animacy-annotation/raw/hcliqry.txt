How about you go do some research on it, it does actually affect the enjoyment of sex for men without a foreskin significantly. There being so many nerve endings in the glans and the foreskin, it's there to protect it also keeping it moist. When it's removed the nerve endings go a lot more numb so you feel a lot less sensation in it. Also the fact is female genital mutilation is a far less wide spread issue than circumcision is which makes it a mainly, not only but mainly male issue.

Listen to yourself, you sound completely stupid and unaware of the actual facts here. You may ask how I know that it's far less enjoyable after and how I know that the glans goes numb after removal, I have a friend who had to get it surgically removed in his 20s unfortunately and from what he said and all my Jewish friends say, he and they all feel far less than guys with foreskin because they've gone numb. So don't come at me saying I should go do research, I have done. You just clearly haven't done any on circumcision band it shows...
