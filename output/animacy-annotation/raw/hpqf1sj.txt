YTA. You forgot to tell your mother. That’s your mistake. You asked him to cover your mistake by eating meat which goes against his values, and potentially could’ve made him sick because vegetarians who haven’t eaten meat in years can get sick from being unable to digest meat anymore. Now if you stay together, it’s gonna be even weirder next Christmas having to explain to your mother he’s vegetarian and you made him eat meat last year to save yourself embarrassment. Please let this be a troll because you’re a huge asshole and very selfish, ignorant and short sighted
