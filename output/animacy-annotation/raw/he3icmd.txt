Nahhh, I know some people who would run away. The bar is to call 911 and let them deal with it. He didn't have to take them away from the situation, keep them calm and unaware of their mom, and take control of everything like that. Even as he is rightfully freaking out he is still taking care of the kids.

F off, honestly. This is hard as shit to do, and you have no idea what you would have done in this horrible situation.
