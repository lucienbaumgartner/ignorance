I said literally said nothing about r*pe. YOU inserted that assumption all on your own. All I said was that if they were to pursue this relationship, there would be a power dynamic present which could set up a weird situation for her. Keyword at *could*. Really not sure why you’re THIS upset because I’m against older people being involved with teenagers in any romantic capacity. Or acknowledging that because of his status in the music industry, there is a total possibility that he could use her down the line. I didn’t say AA shouldn’t write this storyline, that they shouldn’t have added his character, or any demand that would ‘cancel’ the show. All me and the OP were saying was that it’s a bit weird. Especially with us not really knowing his age or anything about him. Since when was it a crime to be suspicious of newly introduced characters? Lol. I guess all the suspicion around Mo, Amina, Carrie etc would have you shaking in your boots as well. This is REDDIT. A literal app all about commenting, analyzing, sharing observations, discussing, and finding meaning  behind our entertainment. I would understand if I was being ignorant and discriminatory but you not liking me “thinking too deep about it” ISNT going to stop me from a damn thing. I commented under your post because you asserted that her being 18 takes away the possibility of an older person being predatory or having ill intentions toward her. I disagreed. That’s a more dangerous opinion than me discussing the dynamic between fictional characters because that logic excuses predatory behavior in REAL life. Maybe it’s *you* who needs to check your thinking.
