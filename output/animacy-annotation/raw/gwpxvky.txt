Yes thatâ€™s correct. Iâ€™m trying to be more spontaneous but after discussing with multiple people Iâ€™m realizing I probably shouldnâ€™t go. 

Yes thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying. My friends have spent time in America and have said they had WA as friends and itâ€™s so crazy because the way you described it, is how they described it ðŸ˜¬

We conversed on Friday and I brought up the Derek Chauvin case. He started telling me how someone he works with was saying ignorant things one day and he lost his cool. He then said he would never be friends with guys like that. And that most of his coworkers are just people he talks to only at work because theyâ€™re so closed minded and ignorant. That gave me hope. I didnâ€™t ask about his friends because of this convo. Do you think the odds are better? 

Where Iâ€™m at mentally I donâ€™t know if I can deal with anymore emotional dents lol. Maybe Iâ€™ll catch the next trip ðŸ˜…

THANK YOU SO MUCH!
