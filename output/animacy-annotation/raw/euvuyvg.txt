You should definitely talk to your family that you don’t think it’s fair that they’re unsupportive if you finally finding love, and that they’re pushing you away as a result. A political party is no one else’s business. They shouldn’t have been told. 
But regardless, now that they know, you must be honest and upfront about how that makes you feel. 
Fred is good to you, good for you. You see a life with him. Which is beautiful and I wish you all the success. Your friends and family are being close-minded and shockingly bigoted. Not all Republicans are radicalists and assholes. Just as not all Democratics burn American flags and throw bricks at shopkeepers. They’re viewing him in a very unfair light. 
Fred’s achievements and charity work are truly what reflect on the kind of man he is. If your friends and family continue to be close-minded and ignorant, that is their loss of you. You should not entertain their thoughts. After all, they’re not the one living beside him. You are.
