This is global free-market disinformation terrorism in full effect. One doesn't need a Manchurian candidate when one may simply use a money'd megaphone to spread direct and insinuated conspiracy. There will be droves of the wicked and ignorant that will gather around false prophets, looking for a scapegoat upon which to nail their problems. This is an act of terrorism, and to see the terrorist, follow the money that placed this idea in that man's head.
