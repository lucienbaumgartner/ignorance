Again. No socialists here you nonce. Honestly, you need to read up on the definitions of the words you use so that you look less of a nitwit in future. 

Yes, you are anti American and a detriment to the country. You think that anyone that denounced the anti American fascist dumbass that’s Donald is a communist. Big lolz. 

News flash. I’m not even that liberal. Pretty conservative in many ways. Fly aircraft for a living in the military and love America. 

But it’s the undereducated and ignorant that try and fail to defend the indefensible Donald like yourself who are the enemy of America. You lot are not only making america look like a bunch of halfwits. But genuinely bringing the country down. You lot are more of a threat to America going forward than the Chinese. 

Educate yourself
