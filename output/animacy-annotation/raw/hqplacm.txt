Banning or not it's up to R* policies and indeed they can do more than banning (as you suggested) to prevent players from being toxic (like disabling lassoes or dynamite sticks in certain events).

I don't want ppl to stop playing like bad characters. I just want them to stop being toxic players. That's why I said blowing a distant delivery wagon is fine if you don't repeatedly kill the fleeing player afterwards (for instance).

Also, defensive mode is far from perfect. Doesn't prevent  dicks from head-shooting unaware and unprepared hunters or fishers (typical PVE activity).

I don't want to control players, I want R* to do more to prevent toxicity.
