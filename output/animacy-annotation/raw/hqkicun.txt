&gt;You can still catch and transmit Covid even after being vaccinated. 

How many times must you morons be told this: yes you can catch and transmit it even while vaccinated, *but at significantly lower rates.*

It drops transmissibility substantially, and it drops hospitalizations *substantially* which means it's less likely that hospitals will become overrun, and people who need medical care can actually get it. 

Are you really this dumb and short sighted or are you just willfully ignorant and stubborn?
