Can't make that statement on a subreddit that's over 80% white males.  Their fragility couldn't handle the hate he has for a whole gender within that race. It's the same white fragility that can excuse his hate as "complex expression of grief", and not see how bigoted and ignorant that hate is.  But please, downvote NextChamp's comment even though reddit is the moral compass of the internet.
