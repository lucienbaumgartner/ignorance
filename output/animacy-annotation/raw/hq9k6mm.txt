you sound idiotic if you think you're somehow a know-it-all when it comes to who believes what. I'm saying it could have been posted unironically and somehow you think you know better than everyone else that it wasn't. get your head out of your ass.

and for the record, my cousin wasn't allowed to watch pokemon, digimon, Harry potter, or teletubbies, and he wasn't allowed to own troll dolls. all because his religious aunt was told they were satanic by their church. your naive mindset just makes you look ignorant and unjustly smug.
