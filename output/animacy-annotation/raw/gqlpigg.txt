well yeah, which is why i don’t demonize people who don’t respect it. 

If people refuse to acknowledge the pros of marijuana for medical reasons, that’s stupid and ignorant of them. But i do understand the dislike for wanting people to get high for high’s sake. Aside from those i know who use it for medical reasons, I barely know anyone who hasn’t abused weed and made it ruin them in some way.
