Generally the far right/ alt right/ neo nazi/ etc people have been moving towards either new age paganism, or super traditional churches like Orthodoxy or Latin rite Catholics etc. They perceive our church as more traditional (yes) and more western (which we aren't ).  Most of these people either don't ever go to a Orthodox church, or go to extremely isolated ones, as any amount of time around Orthodox Churches should expose you to a wide variety of cultures. In my church, we have people from at least three different continents who attend.

 Growing up in the church, I felt a cultural affinity and understanding with East African culture from Ethiopia and Eritrea, Middle Eastern culture from  Lebanon, Syria and the greater Mediterranean, and of course some slavic post communist countries also, like Macedonia and Serbia. The white suburban catholic school I went to for high school was much more afraid and unaware of hummus, injera, and such. Most of the racism you find from cradle Orthodox is distinctly different from American racism- a lot less anti- black and brown people, a lot more anti- Albanian and Turkey stuff (and for some people, like my friend whose grandparents died in the Armenian Genocide, it's not baseless). In short, come to a church service and ignore the angry racists on the internet. Hopefully God can heal them of their hate, and we can challenge them when they say these things.
