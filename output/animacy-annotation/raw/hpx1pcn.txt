Well if we’re being technical I’d be an “Uncle Tom” but for white people but semantics aside. Remember when I said “some percentage…” that was me implicitly saying that yes the media definitely has a bias against officers and that the nation as a whole is a wide vast area of land with various subcultures intermingling at all times and places. So again let me say this, if there was a better term for what I believe I’d willingly use it, but until someone comes up with a new one or if the term “Police Skeptic” or some variation becomes popular I’ll still say ACAB. Also to not be critical of police is simply ignorant and naïve.

Addendum: accidentally deleted and reposted my bad.
