Why can't we make our state better for our people, rather than telling them to "Gtfo if you don't like it here!"?

Indiana is objectively doing worse for its people than our neighbors. Vaccination rates, quality of life, and roads are 3 major indicators on how Hoosiers sit on the priority list in the Hoosier state.

Most of my life, this state has ran a budget surplus, and is one of the few states in the country to be able to say that, but what good does that excess money do when they won't even cut taxes for the workers, you know like Florida or Texas? Instead of shrinking the government even more, why not use that money to help your people.

Your take is ignorant and hateful, so I guess reflective of at least our government.
