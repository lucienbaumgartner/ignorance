Your niece may or may not be gay or bisexual. At age 12 she may simply be curious about the world around her and why people are the way they are. Lots of kids have crushes on same-sex adults that they admire, and it doesn't automatically mean they are gay. It's natural for young people to look up to good people in their lives like teachers, coaches, friends of their parents, etc., and feel affection for them. They may or may not be gay. This is irrelevant to the actual problem, which is that this poor girl is so poorly prepared for growing up and becoming a young adult.

If she's dating at age 12, actual dating and not just social hanging out, with the lack of good information and guidance at home, she is at real risk. Whether from pregnancy, STDs, exploitation or abuse, or emotional trauma, And her mother and grandfather would be in no position to help her with it since they are so ignorant and opinionated.

Thank heaven for good uncles and aunts who sometimes have to step up when a child's own cell donors are useless. Stay close with your niece, let her know she can talk to you whenever she has questions, and assure her you'll respect her privacy.
