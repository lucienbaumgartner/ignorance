Sir Conroy Gundisalvus

Half-Orc Fighter (Knight)

He is big, strong and chivalrous. He's equally unintelligent, clumsy and unaware of his surroundings. After several incidents, one of which burned down the roof of the Great Hall, his king sent him on a "quest" far away so he wouldn't cause any more trouble. He's a good guy, though, and he's quick to make friends.
