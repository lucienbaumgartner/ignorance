I'd say is brutal from a blind first playthrough perspective. Just like dark souls, not knowing what lies ahead and having next to zero handholding is most of the difficulty.

This is most present the first time we enter a Swap or  Plains, I think most people, like me, just strutted in, unprepared and unaware, and got obliterated before they knew what was happening.
