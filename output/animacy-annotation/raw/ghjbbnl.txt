Fwiw, I'm basically breaking a 10-year hiatus of not really wanting to bother with people or letting them get to know me, so it's more about being socially inept and unaware of how much of this is me, how much of this is COVID, and how much of this is just living in a fucked up commodity meat market that I took the 10-year hiatus to escape from and now can't relate to. Just seems like a shitty place to learn how to socialize in.
