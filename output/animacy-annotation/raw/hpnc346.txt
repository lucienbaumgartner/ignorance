I could respond to this in so many ways, but honestly all of them assume you've read all that I said and that's incorrect because you wouldn't have said what you said if you truly read what I said.

I guess I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say this. You do know that memes are the main way of cultural warfare nowadays right? Which means that it's partly pointing out a truth in the matter, which means there's a good chance that the reason you dont find this funny is because you don't like the truth in it. Like I dont even personally think this is valued good info to use in many arguments but I still find it funny because it gets across a funny point in a memey sense since the belief in "white people bad" is so historically ignorant and stupid and this meme is another good point against it.

3 last things. 1, your point about there being "no good right-wing comedians" is laughable for many fucken reason but particularly that we're comparing this to literal wall-of-text leftist memes and I literally don't know of any good left wing comedians that have ever existed. I guess I'll give you a small benefit on the comedy side of things since once i read that about there being "no good right-wing comedians" i actually laughed out loud so I guess you're pretty good yourself. 2, I guess all common-day memes and jokes are shit jokes since I gotta explain them all to my grandma or a person with the 'tism when they see one. And 3, Flair the fuck up or get the fuck out of here. For your convenience you're either lib-left or lib-left-orange.

If you want to respond to me again, at least read and think through what I said in my original comment since this wont be worth talking over if you won't even read it.
