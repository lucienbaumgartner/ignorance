I think this misunderstanding comes from the notion that the Buddha is not considered a God and not worshipped in this way.

These people think it's a philosophy. Obviously this is wrong because Buddhism is definitely a religion.

However if they believe its a philosophy, which in a sense it is it's hard for them to imagine it any other way

Also just good old fashion ignorance, which we are all ignorant about something.

It's being ignorant and adamant that gets people fired up.
