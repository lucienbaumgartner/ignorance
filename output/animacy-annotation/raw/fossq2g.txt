I have seen modern warfare. 

This is home turf for all of americans. And military bases must be maintained. I know where they have to be but they have no idea where or even who I am. 

A drone strike takes a man. And to kill hundreds means groups would need to be congregated. It will be small groups of a couple men making quick deliberate attacks on idle places that would be gone before they have a clue. 

Numbers are very effective, and the civilian populace they owns at least half the guns in the world have a pretty healthy leg up. 

Cowards will always say dont go into a fight that you cant win, but it's the government that would never want to walk into this fight... thats why they have to take our equalizing tools first. Theyre relying on making the next few generations so fearful and ignorant that they'll willfully turn them over. 

I think they attacked pushed the real agenda too fast, and especially with this pandemic people are finally seeing that its their own responsibility to protect themselves as the government clearly doesnt have your safety as a priority.
