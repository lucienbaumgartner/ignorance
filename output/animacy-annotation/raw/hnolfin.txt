Being one of the only people I know having really encountered a reptilian. I think this makes sense.  Like a game of Risk, perhaps. 

I'm not going to go into my story but... I agree.  We are like their little playthings.  Unaware and practically harmless to the entire universe. 

Fun to play with,  though...
