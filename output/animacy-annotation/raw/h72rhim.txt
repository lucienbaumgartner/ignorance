I remember binge reading UQ Holder with the bare essential knowledge of Negima and I can tell you for a fact that it’s not worth it.

The plot flip-flops constantly with power scaling so flawed, it makes something like GoH or DB look normal. The story continuously throws curveballs at you despite not knowing what the hell it’s trying to accomplish and by the time the author finally decides on a proper objective, the manga’s already 100+ in. Add on the fact that the pace goes at mach 20 and you’re guaranteed to be confused and unaware of anything that’s going on.

The characters are as cookie-cutter as they get for your typical battle shounen manga and while I wholly appreciate that the manga is nowhere near as terrible as its anime counterpart, it isn’t really worth talking about.

Negima was an exception with the idea that the genre makes a total U-turn and heads for something that had never been seen in other manga/anime of its time. This isn’t applicant to UQ Holder, though, as the author seems to really like the direction he was headed towards the end of Negima.

One plus is that if you like good fights with a somewhat loose hold of plot armor for the main cast, then this series delivers. All the characters are immortal (not a spoiler since that’s the whole gimmick of this sequel) so you’ll get a good fill of brutal/gory panels within most of the chapters.

6/10, okay if you shut your mind down while reading, but not worth if you actually wanna know what’s going on
