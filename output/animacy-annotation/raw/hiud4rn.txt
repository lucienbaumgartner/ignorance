&gt;First accept the pie and then eat bite by bite

Very nice analogy, I will bear that in mind. 

&gt;Whatever you have to hide due to hate and anger of parents that you would not otherwise hide don't worry about it.

It's not hate or anger that I have to deal with, sorry I did not make it clear in my post. It's the issue of them being shocked that I chose this path and I guess their initial reaction of being unable to accept it. I know my parents will definitely be happy in the long run that I've found something that truly gives me joy, peace and ease.

&gt;your attitude and behavior will start to change

I swear by Allah that my attitude and behaviour already changed drastically since I've heard the message, it has made me much less arrogant and ignorant of the things around me. 

&gt;Find good teachers and spend time on learning and practicing what you can

The teachers in the masjid (there is also a madrassa in the masjid as well) is very knowledgeable, I will definitely go to them and learn more.

&gt;So have patience and continue to learn

May Allah make it easy for me ameen. 

&gt;they aren't healthy and everyone has concern for their health

I am aware of that, it's just I cannot resist the temptation, I feel very guilty about it. 

&gt;do not rush anything, keep the correct intentions to worship your creator

I just fear that my death will come before I can fully embrace the 5 pillars of Islam.

&gt;Don't not even think about cutting the bonds of kinship!

I do not dare to, they've cared for me, fed me, sent me to an extremely good school and is willing to send me abroad for my studies.  I don't care how mad or unaccepting they are of me if I told them I embraced Islam, I still hold them dear to my heart. The thought of cutting bonds of kinship is simply unimaginable for me.  

&gt;so thank Allah you still have such a view on your actions.

I am very thankful for that Alhamdulillah

&gt;May Allah make the road easier for you sister, Amin

Ameen
