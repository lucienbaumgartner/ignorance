I mean, it's the traffickers themselves who are the main criminals in that case.

I'm... Not actually sure how you'd go about proving that he even knew she was being trafficked? Like sure he probably would know, but unless he wrote down somewhere "oh boy, these trafficked girls are so great" I'm not sure how you could prove he was complicit. He could just pretend to be ignorant and naive.

I certainly wouldn't want to be in charge of trying to prosecute that case. Unless, as I say, there was hard proof he was actively involved behind the scenes (I haven't followed the case closely enough to know, so maybe there is, in which case I retract my doubts).
