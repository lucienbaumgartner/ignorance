YTA.  What the F\*ck business is it of yours?  

WHY DO YOU CARE?!?

"Misleading"?  Misleading to who?  Who NEEDS to know his "true" relationship status?!  

Are you interested in this man, and that's why you're so concerned?  If so, you REALLY blew it.  He will never, ever give you the time of day now.  

People wear/don't wear engagement and wedding rings for all kinds of reasons.  There are people walking around every day with rings on their ring finger who are not married.  And happily married people walking around with no rings at all.  

Rings are not some official language.  No one has to wear them if they're married, and single people don't have to take them off.  Everyone can do whatever the f\*ck they want with their jewelry. 

A widower - a RECENT widower, who is still smack dab in the very early stages of mourning, is choosing to continue to wear his ring.  He may choose to wear that ring for the rest of his life - even if he falls in love and marries someone else.  It's his choice.  

I know someone who wears two wedding bands - one on each hand, one for his wife who died, and one for his current one.  I think it's awesome and beautiful - and his current wife obviously doesn't mind.

You didn't "overstep" - I don't even have a word for what you did, it was so awful.  

This was ignorant and petty.  You need to apologize, but I wouldn't blame him if he goes to HR and reports you for harassment.
