I have a theory. The dude thinks in pounds, not kg. Evidence:

1- 150 lbs = 68 kg, which is normal. But instead of lbs, he said kg. 

2- He called you too skinny for 70 kg. 70 kg is normal but 70 lbs makes 31 kg, which is legit skinny. 

Conclusion: He is delusional AND unaware of how measurement units work
