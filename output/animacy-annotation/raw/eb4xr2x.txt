"Yeah lets become one single hive-mind that repeats the same unoriginal dumbass idiotic unlogical fanboy shit until Bungie gets so confident and ignorant that we get another Y1 D2 for D3".

Thats what you sound like boy.

We are 800k people, everyone will say something different. Someone would want first forge to be harder, another want it easier. Thats on Bungie's side to decide. Still we can give feedback no matter what.

All you fanboyish ignorance thirsty guardians need a snickers, couple piece of powerful gear, and a boatload of chill.
