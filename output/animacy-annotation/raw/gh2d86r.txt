I agree.

I think my point was mainly that there is probably something of an upper limit on competence/intelligence when it comes to this type of appeal.

That being said, the Bush Jr presidency does show a massive danger of this. Because Cheney played a major role in that administration. And that's the real danger, having someone behind the scenes who is both evil and competent. 

To me it seems that there's two things that saved the US to the worst excesses of the Trump Presidency. The first is Barr coming in as late as he did. And the second is Trump being so narcissistic and unaware that he was unable to follow or listen to his advisors.

And I think that's the real danger. Someone who has a competent and evil advisor. But I think even when it comes to those there are a lot of self-defeating mechanisms. Look at Cummings in the UK or Stephen Miller in the US. 

Those men might be somewhat smarter and more competent than Trump and Johnson, but they too think far too highly of themselves and lack true competence. I think it's very rare for someone like Cheney, who is both wholly self-serving and largely competent, to rise to these kinds of positions. Because usually it's going to be those who are oblivious to how others think of them like Cummings or Miller.
