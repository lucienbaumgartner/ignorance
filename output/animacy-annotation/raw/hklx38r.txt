Positive thinking is crazy to me, and I associate it with being unaware and uneducated. Maybe it's why therapy has never worked for me, my unhappiness comes from external factors, money, manipulative people, in constant fear of hitting rock bottom.
Would we tell an abused victim to be happy with their situation. Just look on the bright side?
Im not calling myself a victim but just a passerbyer in life, I guess some people don't mind how things are, I just  can't see myself living happily in a world like this. 
I do think of what I would be thinking on my deathbed and all I could think is, you go the short end of the stick but it will be over eventually. It's the same mentality on how I get by each day.
