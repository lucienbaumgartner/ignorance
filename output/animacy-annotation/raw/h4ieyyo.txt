It feels like your being purposely obtuse to the story presented. It's straight up said that Skyward Sword would be the chronological first game. Demise the bad guy. Literally states. Link, Zelda and himself will keep on reincarnating to face eacgother. That's open and shut context for the entirety of the series.  I'm open to the idea of 3 separate timelines being wrong. But to say each game is 100% unconnected and that developers want you to just assume your in a different universe every time is stupid and ignorant of the actual storytelling these games present. 

It's very clear developers atleast were aware of the speculation in during BOTW as they purposely threw out a curve ball game that references shit loads of other Zelda games and the world is built in such a way that it's practically made to be speculated upon..

It takes place in the same world and there is some kind of continuity between the games. 
I really don't know how to take something like BOTW literally telling you with Rock Salt that most of Hyrule was under water at some point plus the fact you can see the ocean on the coast feeding into a gigantic labyrinth as if that may have been how Hyrule was raised from the sea, as anything other than conformation that Wind Waker happened some time before BOTW. Or the Minish houses you find. Or the literal sky temple you can find.
