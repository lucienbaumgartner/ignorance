no, pronouns are something some people use everyday yet try to push

on the rest of us who dont use them and then make out we are the bad

guys because we either dont use them or buy into the nonsense around

it

Do you understand what pronouns are? Because you seem as

illiterate and dumb as you are ignorant and queerphobic. Pronouns

are "HE decided to wash HIS clothes" or "SHE like to do makeup in

HER house". If someone doesn't use pronouns everyday they just

don't talk as it's nearly impossible to not use them.

IT and THEY are pronouns. You literally used pronouns trying to say

that you don't use them. A single google search would reveal that

you're just making stuff up.
