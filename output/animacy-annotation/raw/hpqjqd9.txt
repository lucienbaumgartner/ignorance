I was terribly traumatized by a narcissistic mother. I've been gang raped and have suffered other atrocities. But I was shown that the I Am that I Am is not this bodymind. That I Am cannot be touched. Those who do harm are ignorant and forgetful of their true nature. There is a reason Jesus taught to love your enemies and to forgive them. They, too, are that I Am that I Am. There is no one and nothing separate from or outside of God. You Am I.
