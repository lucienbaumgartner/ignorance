Regardless of how you feel you gotta be respectful to other people’s beliefs (as long as they aren’t harmful). Picking fights like this is a great way to alienate everyone around you, let alone piss off your SO’s family. Just seems narcissistic and ignorant that other people believe different things. My parents are very catholic and conservative, and although I don’t agree with everything they believe, they are still my parents, still good people, and I share this world with them. Why waste energy on a pointless crusade to force people to believe what I believe?
