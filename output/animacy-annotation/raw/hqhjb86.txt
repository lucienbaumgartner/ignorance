Lol what a short sighted attitude.

Unvaxxed people are playing a significant role in continuing mutations.

What about the people that are (sensibly) vaccinated and are surrounded by village idiots like the antivaxxers in the video? 

The vaccinated are looking after themselves and others.  These antivaxxers are placing everyone at greater risk.

The additional burden antivaxxers / unvaccinated people are placing on healthcare services in the UK and USA is placing additional risk for everyone.

They're selfish, ignorant and dangerous fools.
