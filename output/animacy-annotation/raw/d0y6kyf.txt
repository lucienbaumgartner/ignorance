It's okay.  You are a student and this exam must take precedence, it must come first.  It's your top-line job.  

The way I handle this is to log my food, period.  Don't try to do everything else -- don't worry about hitting the calorie goal, don't worry about planning my food, don't spend my mental energy on trying to talk myself out of hunger.  Just keep the log and "fahgeddaboutit".  

I notice that when I'm logging, I'm still doing better overall.  It's not perfect but its better than a) stressing over all the details and b) being totally unaware and uncontrolled and worried that I'm undoing my progress.    When I'm logging, my control is better.   When I'm logging, I clearly haven't quit and my control is back as soon as my next meal after whatever is taking my focus.
