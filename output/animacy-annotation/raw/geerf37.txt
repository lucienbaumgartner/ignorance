I imagine the consequences of watering the dhamma down are nowhere near as serious as taking the dhamma too literally to see the wisdom and truth in the world around you.

You remind me of the story of the two monks and the woman at the river. You are giving off hard vibes of the young monk who stood appalled that the elder monk carried the woman across the river. Rules are meant to be broken. 

Being attached to a completely literal interpretation of the dhamma is just as bad as being attached to any kind of worldly pleasures or other forms of ignorance and/or greed.

I think it's sad and ignorant that you would compare MLK to Trump or Hitler; even if you're just saying so as a way of diminishing the perspective of Thich Nhat Hanh or other Mahayana Buddhists. It may be unintentional but you speak with a rigidity that is uncompassionate and undermines much of what Buddhism is about. 

Does fanaticism (ego) surrounding an official declaration of loyalty/formal practice of Buddhism override lovingkindness? It sounds like that's what you're implying. I bet the Dalai Lama would disagree with you.
