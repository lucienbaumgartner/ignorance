Right. I hate to [shamelessly plug my own “work”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TTT/comments/dx1nfb/an_opinion_piece_on_the_state_of_ttt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but I wrote up a post on this sub a while back specifically about those problems. The skins thing is a big deal that all of these server owners just ignore because they’re either incompetent and unaware of what they’re doing *and/or* they’re trying to monetize their server’s content.

There’s absolutely nothing worse than seeing someone with some ridiculous skin on and having to bite your tongue and risk them getting away just because the server owners don’t see the obvious flaw in their design.

TTT is about blending in and being unseen. Sneaky. Tactful. When you have some assholes running around as Hatsune Miku, Minecraft Steve, or Pickle Rick, that all goes out the window. At that point, it’s just about killing people as fast as you can, and if I wanted that, I’d go play on a fucking deathmatch server.
