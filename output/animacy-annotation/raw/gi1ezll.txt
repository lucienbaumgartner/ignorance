&gt; What happens when someone gets pregnant anyway? 

I guess you're simply still required to undergo the same screenings, and be required to undergo any therapy sessions, or career / financial advisement services etc. A "late penalty" fine can be enforced on parents who delay going to these screenings and services. I know there's CPS and stuff even though I'm not American, but these additional screenings simply could be preventative. I'm definitely not advocating taking away their children before any abuse is present.  


&gt;And "testing" parents before they have kids is game-able. Knowing the right answer is separate from doing the right thing. This is especially true for the more insidious/intentional types of abuse.

I guess this is true, but I feel like a big part of 'emotional abuse' come from parents who are unintentional and unaware that they're being abusive, or how seriously they might impact their child because they think what they're doing is right.  


&gt;the better solution is greater investment in education (including Pre-K) and childcare, and a higher minimum wage. Addressing the problems that *cause* shitty parenting is easier than trying to identify the shitty parents in advance. 

I guess it's quite chicken and egg. Good early education and childcare can't undo the effects of emotional / physical abuse or financial strains at home. We could implement both.
