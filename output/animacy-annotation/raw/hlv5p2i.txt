I don't really know how to answer that without just reiterating my original comment. There's a distinct difference between having a general, long-term psychological abnormality and being completely unaware and unable to make conscious decisions within a specific window of time. A psychotic episode would qualify for an insanity plea but psychotic episodes are not universally synonymous with the personality disorders you've referenced.
