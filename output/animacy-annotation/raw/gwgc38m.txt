Not to mention that he and Bugs Moran used firearms that could punch through concrete (and so in Chicago, there were many contemporary reports of Capone and Moran killing dozens of people every month in daylight shootouts in the middle of the damn city). 

&amp;nbsp; 

I think Capone only became immortalised because of his constant attempts in gaining attention with the press, the Scarface movie (check out the 1932 synopsis), and the fact that he had married a 'tall, blond, and slender' wife who claimed to be completely innocent and unaware of his crimes (so it wasn't like many of the NYC mob families, where enclaves of italian/sicilian/russian mobs married among their own and their wives were very aware of the crimes that were happening). Mae Capone made the perfect morality pet (who looked like the girl next door, even) for the media/film industry--and her association with Capone made it seem like he had a 'good side' compared to the other mobsters.
