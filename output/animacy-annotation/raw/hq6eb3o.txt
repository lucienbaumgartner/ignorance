You asked me:

&gt;What exactly has led to you believe we don't apart from "they disagree with me so they must be ignorant and stupid"?

Which is not something I believe in the first place. You just made that up. That is not asking sometone what they believe. That is telling someone what they believe so that you can shoehorn in a strawman argument.

I also have no idea why you are now claiming that I am acting like "the aggrieved party" and calling me adversarial when you are the one bitching because you don't like my opinion. Irony.
