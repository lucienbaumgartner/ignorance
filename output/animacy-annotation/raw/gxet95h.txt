Here is the better reply: When a woman says "I'm choosing to show off my body" and someone responds to her "no, you've been groomed," that is criticism.  Specifically, it is telling a woman that she is stupid and ignorant of her own mind and wants.  That is a huge insult.  And I see a lot of "she's being groomed" comments in this post.  

When we say "believe women," we have to mean it.  We can't only believe women when it suits us, and then turn around and tell them they are too stupid to know better when it doesn't.  Women are either credible when speaking about their own lives and experiences or they aren't.
