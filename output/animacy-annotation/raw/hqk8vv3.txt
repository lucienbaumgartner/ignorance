I’m so goddamn angry and embarrassed as a US citizen. A good portion of our population have turned into mindless, propagandized idiots, ungrateful selfish pieces of shit.

Lost in all their anti-whatever bullshit is just slaps in the face of healthcare workers. They like to stand for the flag and claim patriotism and supporting first responders and turnaround selfishly not following protocols, and straining our healthcare system and it’s workers to unimaginable stress. 

It’s disgusting, shameful, and makes me so angry. How people can be so goddamn ignorant and selfish is beyond me. In an age where we have access to more information than ever, people CHOOSE to be willfully ignorant.

So sick of it.
