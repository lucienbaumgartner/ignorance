I'm going to contribute to my own post. There's a few incidents that come to mind but the most recent took place back in middle school. My friends and I were kind of jokesters, the kids that were quite funny but not cool enough to be the class clowns. We would make fun of people but nothing malicious or mean really, just having fun and hopefully cheer people up. There was a kid we used to call asparagus, and I'm not entirely sure why we did this. We just did. But we always made him laugh and smile, so we never thought it was an issue. Just a nickname, right?

My school used to do the morning announcements over the television. They had a tech class and would broadcast stuff in the morning using some cheap old news cameras over the schools wired network. One morning my friend Bandon was reading the morning news as the entire school watched in their classes when he says "and Happy Birthday to Asparagus". It flew over my head, but the other guys in the group nearly shit themselves in excitement.

About 2 weeks later the kid we called Asparagus thinking it was just a fun nickname as we all kind of had one for ourselves too, got suspended. There were rumors of a possible school shooting and this kid had a hitlist in his locker with a few of my buddies names on it. He had access to some pretty high powered weaponry as well. He was suspended for the rest of the year and eventually came back the next year and nobody had ever bothered the kid again. 

We were young and stupid and unaware that just a simple nickname, something I thought that had been just all friendly fun with people we liked could be so dangerous.
