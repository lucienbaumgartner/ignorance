From an outsider perspective:

Long time due. The US has been one of the countries with the first access to vaccines and has all the resources for a successful vaccination. 

The problem is that the minority of people who don't want the vaccines are not few enough to let them be without them ruining the whole vaccination efforts. 

People so selfish and ignorant that can not understand that by not participating in the world effort to eradicate covid, they are the reason why more and more people die every single day because of this pandemic. 

The vaccine is principally to prevent people from spreading covid and while doing that it is also saving many lives from people who would have died from covid without the vaccine.

It's time to really take responsibility and guide society in the US. Act like a true government and impose responsibilities for the greater good of your society. Most of the world does it and most of the people agree with helping society recover.
