Similar here, I deleted Twitter after being a regular for over a decade. The toxicity and stream of hatred was just too much and it was really affecting my mood.

The key is to make sure Reddit doesn't fill that void. Got to strike a balance between being happy but also not being totally disconnected and unaware of what's happening in the world.
