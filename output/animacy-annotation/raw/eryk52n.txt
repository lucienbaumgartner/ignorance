But they *are* your enemies. You won't make them not your enemy by treating them as if they weren't. They will kill you. Yes, they're misguided and ignorant, that doesn't mean they won't kill you. You don't need to dehumanise or hurt someone just by recognising that yes, they're your enemy, and you should act as such until they aren't your enemy. Otherwise you're likely to use appeasement and mollifying tactics which are exactly what they want from you, anything but the utmost resistance. Because seriously, they outright will not stop considering you an enemy until you're subservient or dead. You can't just pretend they're not your enemy and hope that stops "the hate" when sometimes yeah, they really are your enemy.

And that'll never happen when they're platformed on the media in the first place. It's equivalent to suggesting one debate ISIS supporters or something - it obviously only lends legitimacy to them and presents hem as a potentially reasonable possibility in a debate even when you shit on them.
