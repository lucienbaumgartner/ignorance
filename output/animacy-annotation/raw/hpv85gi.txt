I grew up in the WELS. This sounds similar to my experience. We were aware that people investigated those types of things, but it was always in the context of talking about how some evil people didn't want to listen to the Bible and tried to make up things to say that it wasn't written by God. Questioning whether the Bible came from where your pastor said it came from was tantamount to questioning God himself. I was pretty far removed from the WELS by the time I started to really doubt that the Bible was divinely inspired though. A lot of pastors in the WELS were raised in it (or a similarly conservative denomination). So they've probably had same slanted exposure to those questions that I've had, and they probably are also scared of them like how I was. That's no excuse, as they're perpetuating an incredibly ignorant and intellectually abusive culture, but it helps give some perspective.

I probably did have a similar experience of being angry when I started reading other denominations' doctrine though. Reading Baptist or Catholic theology wasn't nearly as taboo, but once I started, I realized all the things I'd been misinformed about. After confronting pastors and members about it, I've concluded it's a mix of outright lies, willful ignorance, and just plain lack of exposure. It's pretty amazing how insular the WELS denomination is.
