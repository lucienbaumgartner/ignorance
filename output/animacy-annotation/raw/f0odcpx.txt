Why is the a problem to debate this problem? I don't understand this fascitic approach to science,which should be viewed as a debtable subject rather than a dogma.


I agree that there is some kind of global warming,but to just simply shutdown debate by calling others is so dumb and ignorant,that the people who do that,appear to me as dumb as their target. Some weird kind of dunning kruger,idk.
