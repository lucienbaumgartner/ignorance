Hey there! I'm 35F and I just want you to know that you seem like a very intelligent person, and right now you are becoming more in touch with who you are, your personality, likes and dislikes are all becoming more clear to you and I just want you to know, you're doing great! Now, you have come to terms with what type of relationships you need in your life, and it seems you're looking for validation from the wrong people. I am sorry that as of right now your environment is not full of people who ride the same wavelength as you do.  Don't worry about earning anyone's attention or friendship. The right people will eventually gravitate towards you. I know this sounds like a bummer or a clich√©, but people get cooler with time, they become more self aware, and right now the people you are hanging out with are not self aware at all.  They all sound dismissive and unaware that they are hurting you by being dismissive.  My advice to you is, if you find yourself feeling uncomfortable, or unable to be your true self in front of someone, don't hang out with them.  Keep people who give you peace, and help you feel your true self, even if it is only you in the room. Being comfortable alone is just as important as feeling comfortable with others.  Be patient and don't let people discourage you from being a good friend.  I know the next good friend you will find will not be dismissed by you, and that is a great quality to have. Good luck. Stay kind.
