&gt; Why? It's true... There's only a British team that can rival them so why lying.

Manchester City, Chelsea, United and Liverpool can all rival them today, hence the panic among Real, Barcelona and Italian elite about PL money and the haste to start some Super League. Real Madrid's president said it himself that super league is "needed" in order to financially compete, what lie are you talking about?  
   
&gt;They would if Torres still wanted out, the first offer was rejected for a reason.   
   
No, that's ignorant and stupid.

He has a contract with Manchester City until Jun 30, 2025 and if City didn't want to let him go, Torres would sit there until Jun 30, 2025 regardless of what he wants, just like Barcelona didn't allow Messi to leave despite him handing in transfer request or like how PSG or United won't let their players leave regardless of what they want. THAT'S THAT.
