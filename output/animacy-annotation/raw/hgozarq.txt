So again, voting is easy just people did not use all the options to vote. Ignorance of voting does not mean it is hard to vote.

Just because amp sucks, does not mean it is hard to make a proper link on reddit.

Voting is easy, people are lazy and ignorant. That does not change the fact that it is indeed easy.

Again, the primary source.

Voting is easy and you have options.
