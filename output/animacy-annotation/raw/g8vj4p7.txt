Ugh. These inconsiderate, irrational people! I don’t get it. Maybe this sub just makes it seem like they are everywhere, but geez! 

I know you don’t want confrontation, but these (insert preferred bad words here) thrive on it. I just wish the landlord could/would make them use their own driveway. Then they can run over their own water meter as much as they want. The purposeful intent shown by them is shameful. And the typical doubling down of their behaviors only shows how badly they want to be cruel and ignorant. That they have their own driveway yet prefer to obstruct another individual’s life isn’t surprising, just appalling and frustrating. All that I can suggest is continue documenting and reporting. Based on the patterns of these things, it’s only going to get worse from here. Maybe try only communicating through the mail? Because not having a direct target in front of them to confront could diffuse any future situations? Probably not. Good luck!
