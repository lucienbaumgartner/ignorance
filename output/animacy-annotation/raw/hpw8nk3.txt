Again, you responded to me. You're arguing with me. I didn't go out looking for you just to have this conversation. 

And my point is that you're incorrect in saying that "most people know". I could go on endlessly on the things that "most people should know" but would end up just being ignorant and egotistical because now I'm assuming people should know what I know. 

And what defines instant? We were talking weeks. Is anything shorter than weeks instant? I don't understand what you're trying to say isn't "instant".
