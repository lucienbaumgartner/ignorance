Probably because the Imperium is so ridiculously elitist, fanatical, and ignorant that even if a Commissar is an incompetent joke that is actively harming the Imperium's efforts, fragging him would be seen as insubordination where the judges would immediately order for a horridly slow execution for insubordination and treason without bothering to look at the circumstances.

The few times that it happens is if the troops straight up do not care about the consequences, or if the Commissar is so comically inept that his orders are worse than the punishment of treason. And that is actually fairly rare since there is a standard for Commissars as enforcers of order, not commanders. They're rarely the ones making the orders, just enforcing the orders, so in a way they're on the same boat as the guardsmen where they have to do as they're told, just making sure that everyone else is also cooperating under that same order.
