Yes. It’s awareness/consciousness. For “spiritual” people who have been “enlightened” or “awakened” know how critical it is to have a “good” “positive” energy and what “bad” “negative” energy creates. When we are not constantly aware of this “knowing” and our connection to the divine is weak, we WISH for somebody to lend a helping hand to pull us out of the hell of being unconscious and unaware of our energies that we have within that’s showing without and reawaken us to that connection with the divine. It’s like driving in a car at night, as long as you’re awake and aware you’ll stay in control of the vehicle. But if you fall asleep you are unaware and lose all control, and we know what that creates. Too many of us are sleep walking and even the ones awake can fall asleep again it’s happened to me. But we need to wake up and “change our energy” So if anybody ever notices anybody that you are interacting with emitting this “bad” “negative” energy, please remind them and yourself to “change your energy”. We all want and deserve happiness and love freedom and liberation from “bad” “negative” energy. 🙏🏽
