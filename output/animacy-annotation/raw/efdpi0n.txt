Right wing extremists aren't the same thing as Republicans, which doesn't mean doing crazy stuff. I also find it hilarious, arrogant, and ignorant that you're dictating what my actions would be in a situation, especially one related to fantasy stories about sacrificing children. If you have a thing for sacrificial children, Ba'al, or patting yourself on the back for such things, that's a you thing, but keep me out of it. Have fun with that.
