&gt;Campaign platforms are now threats when its a republican

Way too much this. And I am really getting tired of them using the  media and manipulating the liberal base to do their bidding. Way too much power when the media is colluding with a party that controls the media messages. We already know they want an unaware and compliant citizenry base. The democrat/msm link  needs to be broken up and quick. Thank god for Trump draining the swamp. I can only imagine the types of emails that are flying around behind the scenes on the left now. Thank goodness it is easy to see through the BS once you are red pilled and criticize everything they say.
