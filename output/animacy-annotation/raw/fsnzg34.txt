Except I disagree with that. I live in Philadelphia. This city is a melting pot of different cultures. There are vastly different cultures all throughout the city. Even if you only visit predominantly white neighborhoods the cultures change dramatically. For instance, North Philly is largely Russian and you can see Russian influences in all throughout that section of the city. Fishtown is predominantly Polish and Irish.  Not to mention there are murals all over the city that celebrate different cultures. West Philly is predominantly African American. Chinatown has a large Asian influence.

I disagree with the idea that to be American is to be White. To say that we as a whole force people to abandon their cultures is outrageous and ignorant. That is not to say that pressure doesnt exist for immigrants to assimilate into the American Culture. I would never say that it doesnt. But to say that we force them to give up their culture in return is completely false. At least that is from my understanding and I am willing to admit I may be wrong on this so please feel free to correct me as I have never experienced being an immigrant so I cannot know. The way I see it (and again, feel free to discuss) the main issue is Americans tell immigrants to integrate into our society but then neglect to be interested in their culture in return. And I disagree with that approach. I personally love exploring the different cultures in this city.
