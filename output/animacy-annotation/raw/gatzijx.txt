Same situation at my office. We are a team of 14 though and only I wear my mask 100% of the time. From entering the office, till I leave. I don't get how you would feel weird by protecting yourself.. 

I don't feel odd one bit. Rather, I wonder what its like to be so dumb and ignorant that despite seeing the sickness + death , they refuse to wear the damn mask. I have a child and immune compromised family members, theres no reason to not wear a mask. 

I'm gona continue wearing post covid too!!
