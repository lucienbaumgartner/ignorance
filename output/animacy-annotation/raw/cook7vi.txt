You'll probably need a retort of some sort, and it has to be personal.  If your smarter than him, remind him in a way that makes him look dumb (rather than saying just saying you're smarter.)  Lower track math and english classes are perfect because you can just insinuate that he's illiterate or ask him if they're teaching him to count to 100 in math.  Make him feel like an idiot.

If he's intelligent go for literally anything you can get your hands on. Hot mother or sister works just fine, if he has a hot sister ask him how he represses the urge to bang her.  Stay away from making fun of his gf if he has one though.  No siblings? Go straight for the appearance. Hair, clothes, anything you can find stupid about him.  It has to be good though, something that will make him definitely look like an idiot rather than you looking desperate to get back at him.

These are all tactics I used to defend my friends in high school since a lot of them were picked on.  I, however, was relentlessly made fun of by older brothers and was pretty much immune to insults.  I am pretty smart so I usually got the best of people, turned things around on them and got them mad way before the even got close to getting to me because that was pretty hard to do. Here's what I would do not knowing this dude if I were you. Lets say this douche's name is Dave. You say, in a calm but mocking way in a voice trying to imitate Dave.

"My name is Dave, this kid's voice is pretty funny. Ha ha ha, I'll remind you guys all again tomorrow because I obsess over weird shit haha."

If he gets mad, stay calm and just continue to mock what ever he says. "My name is Dave, man am I mad right now. Look how mad I am."

This may all sound crazy but people knew better than to make fun of me.  In fact, most people liked it because I put people in their place.  A few people are just too dumb and unaware that you can't really beat them but this shit works pretty well. Turn the tables man.
