Listening to music (even if it would be considered a sin) does not invalidate fasting.  In fact, most sins don't.  The list of what invalidates fasting is quite small and most people are familiar with the common items (there are some small differences of opinion about some corner case items).

As for not praying, there is an opinion where fasting is not accepted from one who doesn't pray (and rather, no good deeds are).  I am not sure if this means that *the obligation of fasting* must be repeated if one didn't pray on a given day (without an excuse such as being asleep and unaware that it was time to pray).  For this you should seek a scholar.

As for making up things like fasts or prayers when you didn't record how many were missed, the scholarly opinion I follow is that you find a lower and upper bound (such as, "I know I missed at least 4 days last month of Ramadan but no more than 6"), and then you only need to make up the lower number (4), but it is recommended to make up the higher number (6).  There can be different opinions though, so consult the scholar's whose methodology you trust.  Also, this procedure is for fasts missed with an excuse (e.g., due to illness, menstruation, travel, etc.), there are some differences for fasts missed without an excuse.
