Nothing like gaslighting people to cover up your own movements shoddy history.

Definately make you look like a decent person who cares about making these better and not just a narcissist caring about their own image.

But then this is the same group of people who scream "we're for everyone" and if anyone who is Othered to themselves, minority or not speaks out of turn of their experience, it quickly becomes "Feminism isn't a space for you to speak, go sit in a corner quietly so we can exploit you".

Are you being disingenuous or are you just so deluded and ignorant that you think no part of feminism has every said anything problematic? I guess it doesn't matter which ( so admittedly kind of a disingenuous question), because neither makes it better and neither makes your movement better,  or more trustworthy "allies" as you continue to sweep the issues under a rug for your own vanity.
