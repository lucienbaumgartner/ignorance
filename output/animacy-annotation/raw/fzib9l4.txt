If you saw something with your own eyes, that is absolutely universally and factually agreed to be impossible by experts in physics and weather... than you misinterpreted what you saw.

The problem lies in people being so damn naive and ignorant that they refuse to accept that their uneducated anecdotal opinion is wrong.
