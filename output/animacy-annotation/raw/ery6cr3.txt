Way to totally ignore the original point. Where are your excuses for the US fans arrogance and disrespect? 

I’m not justifying or excusing the bitter salty ass haters saying rude things about the us women’s team. I’m just saying I am totally used to salty bitterness from the losers in every single match thread. That’s a normal r/soccer thing. 

What is less normal and what the OP and I agree on, is the disgustingly rude comments from Americans acting like they know football whennthe things they are saying are so biased and ignorant that it’s almost too obvious this is the only game they’ve watched
