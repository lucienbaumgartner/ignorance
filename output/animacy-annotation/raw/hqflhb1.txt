Vivienne is very stunning, has a stellar fashion sense, her self-confidence and the way she carries herself is admirable. She has very good reasoning behind each of her opinions, even if I don’t agree with them. 

Isabella is pretty badass, how protective she is of Merrill pokes through sometimes in their interactions and I find it sooo endearing. Also watching her fight was wild with how much she flies around. 

Leliana’s voice is so sweet, and I actually really enjoyed that scene where she sings for you. I was dalish origin, she said some unintentionally insensitive things to me but was unafraid to admit it when I pointed out she was being ignorant and rude. She said I’d given her a lot of things to think about. I can respect that.
