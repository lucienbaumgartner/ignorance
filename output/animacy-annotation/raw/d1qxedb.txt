You're only making it worse. First, you did get shit on. At least 15 separate people saw what you wrote and disliked it enough to make it visible. Second, it's that you've got no social awareness. We don't know who you are, so how do you *think* we're gonna respond to those kinds of statements? Even people who absolutely deserve an unbelievable person don't say things like that outright because they've got the social skills to understand how it will come across. So what others were saying was that just you *saying* that you have all of those enviable traits is a knock on your credibility for actually *having* them.

If someone walks up to you and tells you that they're a multi-millionaire, then acts in a way that most multi-millionaires don't act that was simultaneously socially unaware and somewhat braggy/rude, and then refuses to provide any proof even through anecdote about how he/she made his/her money, you'd be skeptical. You've essentially done that here with your personality.

You described a perfect woman in *very* pretentious language (e.g. "genetically superior"). The only natural response is incredulity, which you responded to by claiming you were good enough to deserve that girl, again in very pretentious language, all while never giving us any good reason to think you were that kind of person. If it's all true, then your knowledge that it's true is your solace and your victory, but if you're not going to back it up with evidence that you deserve to talk like that, any pretentiousness is going to be with skepticism. In fact, it will be poorly received either way (like a rich man talking about buying a yacht in front of middle class friends, regardless of whether or not he's earned it).
