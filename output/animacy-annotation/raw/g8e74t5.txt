YTA

You had a chance to show her she mattered to you. She wanted you to at least make an effort to spend time with her. You didn't. She mentioned a card. They sell them basically everywhere. How hard would it have been to pick one up at the grocery store while you were doing your shopping just to show her you were thinking about her? 

You did nothing. Yet, she sees you exchange gifts with other friends. And you wonder why she's hurt and feels she doesn't matter as much?

She was also probably really hurt you returned her gift. That is also an asshole move. Giving a gift is a moment of vulnerability. It says "I was thinking of you. I hope you like this." Rejecting that hurts, especially if she put a lot of thought into the gift. 

You seem remarkably insensitive and unaware of other peoples' feelings.

You have now rejected her twice. Once in refusing her gift and again in refusing to make even the smallest effort on her birthday. And yet you wonder why she isnt speaking to you? Come on.
