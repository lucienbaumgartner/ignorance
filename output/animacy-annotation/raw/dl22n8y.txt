I hope truth does come and the Justice Department finally hold these manipulators accountable. Remember their goal, as Bill Ivey wrote to Podesta:

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

If these events are part of their serious thinking, God help us all.
