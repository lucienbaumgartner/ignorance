Nazis used to exterminate slavs as they regarded them as inferior (sub human). Its just ironic and ignorant that some slavs have neo nazi views to even adopting the black sun symbol aka Schwarze Sonne. Im not here to argue its just basic historical facts that nazis didn’t like slavic people however I get were OP is coming from sometimes you do need a force that might be radical (necessary evil) in order to fight an invading force, I don’t justify them at all they have lynched minorities in Ukraine and thats horrific. They will need to clean up their image and rebrand Azov if Ukraine wants to make some sort of association with the European Union. 

Anti-Slavism reached its peak during World War II, when Nazi Germany declared Slavs, especially neighboring Poles and Russians to be subhuman (Untermensch) and planned to exterminate the majority of Slavic people.[1]
