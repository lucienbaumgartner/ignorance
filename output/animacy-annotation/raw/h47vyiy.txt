It gave me the worst SLS ever. I kept watching hoping that Jan di would end up with Ji hoo (didn't know about manga's ending). I basically then rewatched Ji hoo Jan di scenes (not very typical of me). 

I also feel bad for Ji hoo's grandpa. Although it was never shown onscreen, I wonder how he would have reacted to Jan di Jun pyo's relationship.

Ji hoo even became doctor for her :'( 

I also am confused whether towards the end other friends were aware of Ji hoo's one sided love or not.

I absolutely hate Jan di for using Ji hoo. She tried to pretend innocent and unaware of Ji hoo's feelings.
