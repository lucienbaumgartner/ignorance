Except it's a direct reference to the preamble to the US Constitution. You know, the one which says " We the People of the United States... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America." 

You know, the core document that places the ultimate power in the USA in the hands of the US public, and which says that government only governs by consent of the public?

You'd have to be willingly blind and ignorant of the meaning behind those words to try and twist them like you have. Somehow you've managed to turn a declaration of democratic values into some supposed demand for a dictatorship.
