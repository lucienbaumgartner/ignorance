That's a nice opinion and all, but the reality is that there are serious mental health and drug problems in the homeless community and unless we recognize and address those, the problem will only continue to worsen.

Obviously these people need help from us and from the government, but when did self governance go out the window? Why are our tax dollars being spent on a program with a proven negative outcome? 

You're being willfully ignorant to think that everyone with a conservative viewpoint is racist and ignorant of reality and working off of flawed principles just because they don't live in your LA bubble.

Seriously, what is your solution to this and what's the best way to pay for it?
