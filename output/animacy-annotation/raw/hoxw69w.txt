Please may I ask some more stupid questions? I have not read the books and am going into this show very blind and unaware of the lore, so apologies.  I am very confused about the Ways and how they work? Is the city of Fal Dara only accessible through that magical and extremely treacherous gateway, and if so how did Lady Amalisa send a message to the White Tower? How does any post/message go through that gateway? Or are there many "Ways" in and out of Fal Dara? I guess I am a little confused as to why our band of heroes had to use that gateway to get to where the Eye of the World is, when they could have just gone to Fal Dara? And what is Lan's connection to the City? I get he was a prince saved and brought to Fal Dara? If Lan came from Fal Dara - how could he not know how to use the gateway - why did they need Lolai to guide them? Thanks for all  your help in clearing my confusion!
