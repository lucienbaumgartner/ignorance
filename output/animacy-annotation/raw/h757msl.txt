I don't listen to the JRE anymore, not out of anger or hatred, but from a gradual disinterest in what he has to say. I don't share many of his values either. To be fair, though, I only listen to Chris Ryan's podcast now. My podcast addiction has been replaced with audiobooks instead. 

Before Joe had a podcast, I listened to him on radio shows and thought he was interesting. This was back in the Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn days. I was a different person back then, much more immature and ignorant of the world.

When he made a podcast, for a number of years I listened to every episode. Then overtime, I tuned in only for the episodes with interesting guests like Bill Burr, Duncan, Chris, NDT, Abby Martin, Kyle Kulinski, Michael Osterholm, Paul Stamets, Dennis Mckenna, Anthony Bourdain, Cornel West, and so on.

Around 2015, I started to become disillusioned with Joe after noticing some of his biases on social and political and scientific issues. Before then, I figured him for a reasonably smart person who thought for himself, but I was blinded by my own idealistic standards for him. 

When I stopped putting him up on a pedestal, he became just another ordinary guy. Nothing special. Kind of entertaining, kind of repetitive, kind of informative, kind of prejudiced, kind of arrogant, kind of humble, kind of insensitive, kind of curious. 

I might have listened to one or two of his Spotify episodes, but other than that, I don't tune in.
