There is objective truth in what you say but, objectively, that matters very little to us human creatures. We can't effectively know or function at that level of detachment. While we "are" a part of the universe in which the foot smooshes the roach and the immutable process of entropy continues unaware and unabated, we can only ever "be" either the foot or the roach. 

So while human events and individual misery may not matter in the grand scheme of things, sooner or later a day is going to come around where you will be either the foot or the roach, probably the roach... And that crashing reality is going to fuck your shit up right and proper if you spend most of your days trying to be as the entomologist.
