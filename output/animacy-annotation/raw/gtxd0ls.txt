Yes. I mean, Im hoping by house they also mean the things in it, otherwise, sorry kids, time to sell all your toys and clothes. Hopefully this representative won't need a car. Hopefully their spouse won't either.

And oh boy, I hope they only mean taxable income otherwise, and I hope they again mean only personal and not household, otherwise I guess husband has to quit his job.
If they mean all income, well, hopefully no relatives die while they're in office or for 20 years after, cause no inheritance or life insurance. Any gifts of cash, even $5, would be illegal. No money from gambling either, so goodbye late night poker games with some friends.

Also, any young and not reelected congressional reps, have fun finding a job after having a 20 year resume gap.

Yes, reps having massive external incomes is a problem, them owning stocks and that kind of thing _is a problem_, but this kind of overly broad crap completely disregards even the slightest complexities to the point where it's so damn naive and ignorant that it actually weakens its own arguemtn by essentially being a real strawman.
