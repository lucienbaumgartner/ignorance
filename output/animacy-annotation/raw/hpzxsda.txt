Are you implying I'm not Taiwanese? I'm literally in Taipei right now (quarantine) after returning from uni in the UK. 

I'm downvoted to shit in 'our' sub? By white people who are making ignorant and racist remarks towards our culture and people? Go ahead and show me the comments where I'm downvoted, and see the contexts. 

So? Have you always lived in Taiwan?  原住民在台灣住了多久了？你自己查一下.

"Yeah this sounds like a sockpuppet, not someone from Taiwan."

Convenient of you to to simply not address the comment, and resort to [ignorant assumptions.](https://ibb.co/JQjTMGW) That's literally documented, factual history, refute it if you can? 

You're definitely an avid DPP supporter. Ruin our economy more.
