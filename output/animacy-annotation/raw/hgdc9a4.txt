Crowd dynamics are an interesting thing. Yeah it’s not VT’s fault that everyone decided to trample one another, but saying this is a bit shortsighted. 

When in a large crowd, an individual is extremely detached and unaware of the overall crowd dynamics. Most people in a crowd have one thought on their mind: get where they want to go. I believe in during the notre dame game you had a situation where there was nowhere to go for the people in the tunnel, but the people outside the tunnel trying to either get in or out didn’t realize this. You had two large crowds trying to move opposite one another without realizing the impact it had in the tunnel.

Yes, students trying to get in the game without tickets or just generally being rough assholes is unacceptable and should be condemned. But VT athletics as an organization has a responsibility to ensure the logistics of getting people in and out of the event is conducted in an organized and safe way. There are many ways to mitigate “crush or stampede events” as they are called.
