First of all, they're not wrong. There are always butthurt people. Nothing wrong with admitting to that.

And I personally don't see any "homophobic" trope in there. I mean, maybe I'm just gay and ignorant of homophobia but it seems like a reasonable joke.

Yes, it may not be 100% true but fucking hell, it's a joke not a scientific statement.

The fact you have the feeling it was an insult *and* homophobic kind of just shows me you're one of those butthurt ones.
