&gt;But I have also dated people who exhibit all the AP-traits, but who are wildly ignorant and unaware of their own issues, and those people are the most entitled, petty, dramatic and violent people I met in my life

I am so terribly sorry to learn you were subjected to that. You hit the nail on the head: they were ignorant of their own issues and unleashed their untreated issues onto you. Don't let that be a reflection of you, let that be a reflection of their problems that they've refused to address.

As you've alluded to, APs who are at least cognizant of their issues and have the self awareness will definitely be less of a problem. In the past I've teetered on being excessively needy but I know better now that I can't demand too much from someone who doesn't have enough to give and to be *realistic* about what that someone else can offer.
