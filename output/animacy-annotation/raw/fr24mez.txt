Fun fact, I downloaded the game after the grumps played it and, playing with a touchpad rather than a mouse, I was unable and unaware that you could do more than the basic zoom as well. The first hour or so of the game sucked ass because I both wasn't good at the game yet, and the first gun has terrible stability and the crosshair of that gun sucks, but after I got the second gun, the game became really fun!

I only found out about further zooming AFTER I bought the bowgun.
