I never really realized how ignorant and close minded many Americans are. It also astonishes me how self proclaimed Christian's can support someone like Trump.  There is so much overwhelming evidence of his corruption and disdain for women I dont know how he became the face of the Republican party.
Socialism is not the answer for the American people, but neither is capitalistic greed. There is so much disparity between the rich and the poor it is disgraceful.
