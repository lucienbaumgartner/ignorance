Yeah, cause screw me for pointing out that not "that one specific group! they're bad!" but instead it's a human thing to lack empathy, respect and have little to no grace and that we need to keep this same energy going no matter the topic. 

It was in this sub in the AESPA Giselle post just a month or two ago that 50% or more of the responses in here, many from Koreans, were completely lacking in respect for another culture, for their pain, that THEY should not talk about what they don't know, that they should educate themselves, that arguments like "I'll say it if they put it in their music" and "how are we supposed to know about American black history? How is Giselle? Why would she know not to say that word?" and other ignorant takes. 

So let's ease up on the "of course someone brings it up" when it was ugly in here just 1-2 months ago with a popular post filled with these type of ignorant, disrespectful comments. Just like in these Snowdrop posts there are tons of ignorant and disrespectful comments by Blinks and i-fans who don't know anything about Koreas history.
