Followed yours! Looks like great odds!

Also, if you don't mind me asking: when did Food Club bets become a thing? I've just returned to Neo after a several year absence and have no recollection of this happening or being a common way to make NP. It's also quite possible I was just super oblivious and unaware that it went on though so who knows.
