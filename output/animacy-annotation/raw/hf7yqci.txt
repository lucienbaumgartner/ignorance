1. CRT isn't Marxist. Marx would actually hate CRT because it asserts that oppressed people are not inherently oppressed but structurally oppressed. 

2. It already has in informing law students on the effects of law on minority groups. With than knowledge, legal and public policy professionals are better able to see and correct the impact laws and policies have on people. 

For example, in the Army, there was a ban on certain hairstyles for women. What was not realized was that Black women have radically different types of hair from White women and even Latina women. The policy, though not intended to be racist, upheld white hair as the baseline and made people with just genetically different hair actually suffer. Like, lose their hair suffer. CRT would look at that policy and see the affects it has on Black and brown people, while attributing the cause to the glaring reality that senior leaders in the army were overwhelmingly white and unaware of the issue. It's not saying the white people were racist, just that the structure 0f the army allowed racism to occur. 

This is a minor example, but it's a low stakes one that illustrates how CRT actually works.
