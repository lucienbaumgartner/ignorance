As someone who has lived in Wisconsin most of their life, I think I have a pretty good handle on the situation. The main thing is that these people are so self righteous and ignorant of the real issues, that they can't even begin to see the racism in themselves and others around them. I can't tell you how many times i had a conversation with my random neighbor in West Bend or Mukwonago, when they bring up vehemently that them and their community "accepts everyone regardless of skin color" etc, and they simultaneously follow up that comment with a subtly racist comment about how if people in Milwaukee "just acted better" or "if they just stopped being so violent" etc ec. - the cognitive dissonance is off the charts.
