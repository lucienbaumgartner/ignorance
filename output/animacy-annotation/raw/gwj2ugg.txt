I’m an American and at the time I was pretty young and unaware of what was happening in England. I do know that the torture program was American-led, and I’m not sure the extent to which Blair was read into it or how much the British participated in it. I’m listening to a podcast called Slow Burn that’s going back over how we Americans ended up in Iraq. It hasn’t gotten to the invasion yet, maybe it’ll explore more if the British role.
