I have no problems with understanding motives. I do have a problem when men like Sargon BLAME women and feminists for an incel murdering people. 

Instead of actually investigating the roots of incel culture (a sense of entitlement and superiority, that men are somehow owed something from women) he instead blames ‘feminism’ 

That comment alone is enough to make Sargon somebody who’s so unbelievably biased and ignorant that he’s not worth taking seriously. 

And again you’ve seemed to have skimmed over the lying about Heather Heyer. 1 of these cases alone makes Sargon toxic, and yet these are the first 2 examples I can think of off the top of my head. 

If you think he’s not that biased and a decent source of information, you really need to give your head a shake and listen to the monstrous things he says on a regular basis.
