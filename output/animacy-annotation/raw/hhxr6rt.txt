Somebody touching you while you are unaware and unconscious is something that should be discussed beforehand. People should not assume that they can pull down their partner’s pants and touch them whenever they please. It’s your partner’s body, not yours, ask first. It’s just a respect thing not a gender thing at all. You have no right to touch someone’s “private parts”without their permission, it doesn’t matter who they are to you.
