I am a woman (&lt;30yrs old) and I take no offense, as I can understand how you may have arrived at such a perspective. I would argue that age isnâ€™t exactly a great determinant of whether a woman has developed integrity or not. Many women (and men) are emotionally immature and have a serious lack of self-awareness that can cause great insecurity, inadequate insight, and underdeveloped sense of true empathy/compassion. A good deal of the population, all ages included, are highly egocentric and unaware of this. Superficiality reigns in individuals like that, and young women and men are especially prone to it if they absorb their values from facile social mediums such as social media and mainstream entertainment. Choose a woman with quality of character and with values of integrity and empathy (one must be capable of attracting such a woman by having quality of character as well) as opposed to choosing a woman solely based on appearance or age.
