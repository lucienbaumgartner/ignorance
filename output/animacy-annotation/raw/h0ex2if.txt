Most of the value produced by a modern factory is not produced by the people working in it. It is produced by the engineers who designed the product and process design. It is produced by the people who designed and built the factory. It is produced by the people who designed and built the machines.

The problem with low value greedy narcissists is that they are incompetent and unaware of it. They do not produce much value and do not understand how to do so.

This is, of course, blatantly obvious - because those low value workers are incapable of producing value independently. That is why they work in factories instead of creating their own business.
