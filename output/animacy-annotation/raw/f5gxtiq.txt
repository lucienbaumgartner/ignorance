It's okay, like I said I understand the frustration and sympathize because I'm going through the same thing myself.

I'm upset that we have been so mislead by the lack of knowledge available about cerebral palsy. In my experience most of us are unaware and unprepared for this increase in symptoms over time which make our lives harder. Doctors don't tell families that this will happen and when we hear "non-progressive" it's easy to assume that mean that nothing will ever get worse.

I believe the lack of education and preparation for later life is to blame for this. We are some of the first generations of people with CP to live to adulthood and old age. There as been very little research and even less support around what happens to our bodies as we age. It's a real disservice to all of us.
