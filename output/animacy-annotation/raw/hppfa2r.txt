There are several things wrong with this even if was a good idea. (Which it is not) How would it be funded? Why not have the government pay for gym memberships? Why not have the government pay for healthcare? Why not have the government pay wages so we don’t have people working 2-3 jobs just to survive? Why not start nutrition and exercise at childhood? Why stop at 45? Why make poor and middle class people pay for more taxes and fines? Why are you not fining rich people high? For some people $250 is nothing, for some $250 is going to make them homeless. OP’s plan is ignorant and flawed.
