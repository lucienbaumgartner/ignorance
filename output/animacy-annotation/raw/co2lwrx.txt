It's a tradeoff. Duh.

You too increase various risks for your children, chasing various tradeoffs.

I personally wouldn't make the tradeoff they make, I don't make many of them that you make either. But then you're irrational and unaware that you make such tradeoffs (as evidenced by the sort of response you made to my comment). Just like they are.
