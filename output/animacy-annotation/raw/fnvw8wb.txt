So these people are so naive and ignorant that they think Trump isn’t a racist?  The dude has been whistling for white supremacists since he claimed they were good people years ago.

But yeah keep up the “trump ain’t a racist, he’s just old and that how he acts” routine.  The only idiots buying that line of thinking are magas.  Which have proven themselves incapable of recognizing anything wrong about a man they also claim is the son of God or God itself.

Delusional, ignorant, hateful, tribalistic, but not racist?  Come on...
