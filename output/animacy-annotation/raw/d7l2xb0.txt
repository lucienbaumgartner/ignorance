It happens when your performance bonuses and career advancement hinges on a goal that can't be achieved without unethical behavior and you pass this unachievable goal to everyone below you in the organization.

If they don't make the goal, they get fired and their life becomes very hard.  If you don't make the goal, you're just slightly less rich.

That's how this works.  Put people who can't lose a job in a position where they have to be unethical or lose it.  Then when they're unethical, use them as a scapegoat while profiting from their behavior.

When they're unethical, claim you didn't know what was going on that always works.  Nobody in the world is more forgetful, unaware, and incompetent than the executive of a division caught cheating.  And nobody in the world is more brilliant, heroic, and competent than the executive of a division who achieves a goal.

Funny how that works.
