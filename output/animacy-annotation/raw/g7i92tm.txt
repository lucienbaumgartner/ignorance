&gt;Why would I ever go to London lol

Yeah then there's no problems lmao

&gt;yeah our president is dumb but hey who gives a shit when all the world leaders are shit

Compared to everywhere else borris is a fucking god-send he solved brexit and clearly has covid under control, hows trump doing with all your dumbasses

&gt;How do you defend yourself when someone is about to stab you over there btw?

Do you know what the uk is like? Thats literaly just about 10% of London, its rare that anyone will have a knife and if they do its because you pissed them off, and you derverve the stabbing 

&gt;Hey didn't your country go from ruling like 3/4 of the world to being on an island.

Didnt Germany, Italy and France do somthing similar? 


And it was only 6 months ago since your country had riots and caused the biggest spike of corona making your entire country unsafe and unaware of covid, causing it to be the biggest problem
