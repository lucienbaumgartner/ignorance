Honestly, I feel like some of the characters are very one-dimensional on GG. For example, Madeline and Louise are by far my favorite supporting characters but ASP wrote them so blatantly one-sided???? Like I get that they are supposed to reflect Paris and Rory and I do like the fact that they are all friends I hate to see them put down so much by Paris and later Rory. Anyway lol sorry for the rant but here:

Lorelai: pro-hilarious and smart, con-impulsive

Rory: pro-hardworking, con-spoiled and unaware of privilege, puts down other women

Emily: pro-smart and witty, con-privileged and condescending

Richard: pro-calm and personable, con-authoritarian

Luke: pro-he cares a lot of Lorelai and Rory, con-doesn't take risks and bad communicator

Lane (love her): pro-funny and her relationship with Ms Kim is the best written relationship on the show in general in my opinion, con-she's kind of impulsive (such as getting drunk in Keg! Max! or running away from home to live with Rory in Yale)

Sookie: pro-she's a great friend and has an overall warm aura, con-she's unrealistic (I guess this is meant to be by ASP as she is supposed to be this ultra creative person but I feel like that's stereotyping by ASP bc it assumes you can't be rational and creative at the same time)

Paris (love her too): pro-witty and driven, con-kinda crude and extremely condescending sometimes

I think most of the rest of the characters are extremely one dimensional as I said about Madeline and Louise, but for example Dean is seen as this perfect boyfriend to Rory with absolutely no flaws in the first two seasons. But Rory leaves him he suddenly turns into this jealous monster who impulsively marries Lindsey and treats her like crap, then cheats on her with Rory??? It just seems extremely unrealistic.
