I totally buy Vess Derogna being able to get taken out by Lucien quickly. Lets go into a quick round.

Lucien uses the 10d10 psychic damage ability, Vess autofails her save due to being asleep and unaware of it happening. Lets also assume for the Lucien "rolled" high, taking out most of her health in a single round. Surprise round over, initiative is again rolled, Lucien rolls higher than Vess, does the psychic attack again, Vess is down. Few slashes from his blades to make her fail the death saves, bam, one dead Arch Mage.
