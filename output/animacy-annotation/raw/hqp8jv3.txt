-Being ignorant and uncomfortable with discussing about sex. I have found that a lot of therapists don't know much about sex and hypersexuality. I have met more people on Reddit with common sense about the topic.

-Stereotyping trauma survivors. We aren't all the same. I don't care if you have read a bunch of studies, books and have years of experience working with victims of trauma. I still may not be exactly like the other victims that you know. 

-Being unable to admit that you're wrong, especially when it comes to misreading a client and their situation. Therapists who brag about how they're such a good judge of character and are never wrong tend to be off-base, in my experience.
