Selling your games/consoles to GameStop is stupid if your economical situation isn't good enough for you to be happy with selling the items faster but cheaper. The original comment was complaining about GameStop buying games at lower prices than average, so they obviously worry about not getting their money's worth at GameStop. 

While selling games you have two options: You can either sell them online for other people to buy at a higher price, which takes some effort, or sell them to GameStop with ease but get less money. Expecting GameStop to both make the process is easy and pay high is hypocrisy. 

I am not saying these to shame people for wanting to save money. I am a student so I'm also far from being rich, but thinking you deserve the best service while paying so little to a profit based company is entitled, ignorant and lazy. I'd understand and agree with the complaints if GameStop was literally the only place where you could sell your games, but it's not.
