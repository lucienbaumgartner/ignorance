They all have their problems for sure. Iron Man 2 has the benefit of RDJ continuing to nail his role, the introduction of Justin Hammer and War Machine. All of the set pieces are great, and it’s a generally fun movie, even if the story is all over the place trying to do too much at once and not giving enough focus to any one idea.

The Incredible Hulk is the black sheep of the MCU, but it’s interesting at least. A good take on Bruce Banner, Tim Roth and William Hurt are a lot of fun in it.

Thor the Dark World is in second place for me, but nothing in Black Widow is better than the Thor/Loki Buddy cop dynamic. Again, fun set pieces.

Age of Ultron has its shortcomings, and needed a much stronger villain. It’s still an Avengers movie with a great team dynamic.

Black Widow has nothing. It’s AS formulaic as you can get, an invincible protagonist, the WORST third act Marvel has ever been a part of, the most generic villains since Malekith and Kurse, and it’s completely devoid of fun. It’s so self serious and unaware of how stupid the entire premise of the movie is. It actually frustrates me how bad it is, because it could’ve been a great spy-Thriller.
