I think for those especially who struggle with empathy or such benefit trying to learn how other people's brains think. Actually when I was more "naÃ¯ve" I assumed more the worst of people cos I had a lack of understanding how I though other people thought. ðŸ¤”

Instead of thinking this is people being rude or however they come across I find it fascinating I learn they are aware and unaware of different factors than me and they come across differently cos that's just how they are. Very few people are intentionally being asshole.
