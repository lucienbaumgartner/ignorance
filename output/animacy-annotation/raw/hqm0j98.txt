And as far as spreading it while vaccinced. Technically true, but still greatly reduced, especially when both are socially distancing and masked. Also only unvaxed are causing covid to mutate. This really is a no brainer. Think of mandates as an attempt to discipline the ignorant anti vax croud.. Shouldnt have to be this way, but ppl are ignorant and afraid thanks to the propaganda of vaccines.
