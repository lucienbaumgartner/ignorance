They don't have robot referees because that's impossible.

If you have human referees, you can't simply call the game, you need to manage it. Even if a ref were hypothetically perfect, if he calls 7 penalties on one side and none for the other, the game is going to go poorly.

The truth is that in any sport, tiny minor infractions are happening all the time. Guys holding jerseys, tiny chops with the stick, pseudo-interference to protect their space. It's never as simple as "Team A is committing infractions and Team B isn't".

Throwing a team a bone, giving them a softer call because penalties are 6-to-0 against them, is part of ensuring them that you're not biased/blind.

Idk, I think the arguments against game management are just so naive and ignorant of how professional sports are for the players
