My guess would be is that it somehow triggers your own inner being. 

You may notice some people create a negative (not in a bad way) , negate-ive, space that does not allow for anything super natural. Some people create space for all sorts of stuff and these people are usually totally unaware and easily frightened. Then another group who only have space for helpful events. I believe this all stems from our relationship with our inner world. We all have the potential for any direction. 

I'll leave it at that. I don't know really.
