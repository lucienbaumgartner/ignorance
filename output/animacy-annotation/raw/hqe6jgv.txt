Oh, I actually really like tbbt and their representation of ASD people. You know, Sheldon is not the only autistic one. The authors claimed that all of the guys were thought to be Asperger (Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj), and I think they have different traits you may find in many different people with ASD. 

Gotta be honest tho, I think at the begging Sheldon was more realistic, towards the end of the show he was more of a mix between a pet and a child in terms of behaviour.

Sorry for the long text but tbbt is my favourite TV show.

I heard Sia released something about ASD but I heard it's pretty ignorant and ableist.
