&gt;To be perfectly honest what it is sounding like you're trying to push is the story that minorities can't be as racist to white people because the words used have a heavier societal connotations.

There is a question: Can somebody be racist towards me? A white guy? 

Well, I don't know. Let's test it. And what is the only way we can test it here on the internet? Well by words. I want to test if a racist intent can produce a racist effect toward a white guy.

That's why I wanted the worst possible soul-crushing ignorant and rude racist slur OP could come up with. A spoken thing that is so vile, that if others in the supermarket heard it would become immediately obvious to them that somebody is racist towards me.

I think it's a fair exercise.
