I am in awe of all the comments insisting we should get out now. Have any of you looked at the monthly chart? Most people with experience investing knew perfectly well that it would look like this. The drop hurt less than we expected. Please don't panic newcomers, you will feel silly in a couple weeks if you doge out now. The "meme currency" name is irrelevant and ignorant of both how doge works in relation to other cryptos, and of today's culture
