Your ignorance is, once again, showing. 

The suspect was a violent felon, possessing a firearm was a direct crime. In fact, possession of a firearm as a violent felon is itself a felony in most states. Add to this the fact that surrendering of firearms is a condition of bail for violent felonies in Texas, and you are once again shown to be disgustingly biased and ignorant of anything that happened in this situation. 

Still love the unfounded ad hominem though. Way to stick it to the man by defending a violent felon who murdered a man though.

Youâ€™re pathetic.
