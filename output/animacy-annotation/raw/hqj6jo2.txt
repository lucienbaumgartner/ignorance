&gt; for all this helpful white people speaking on my behalf

Lucky for you it wasnt white people who started LatinX and its was not pushed by white people either. Nice try though. There were a few events (past video game awards included) that had "Celebrating People in the LatinX community" and none were fucking white. You delusional twat.

**it was first seen online in 2004, and first appeared in academic literature "in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language."**

But Fuck facts right? We gotta hate white people!!!!!

It was meant for people of such origins who were Non Binary to have a seperate identity from the gender set language.

**Nothing to do with white people at all**

And if you are getting angry at the strawman created white person for trying to keep up with modern gender identites you have even less sense than before. Thats been a really big part of our current culture. Respecting gender identities of others. Why wouldnt someone try to respect that?

Trying to do good and follow the identity inclusive language is not the same as speaking for you, the fact you wrote this shows how, again, fucking stupid you are. Its not meant to replace Latino or Latina. Its the "they" version of the word. So being Called a LatinX wouldnt apply to youunles you wanted it. 

**So your are complaining about a race that didnt start it and wrongdully assuming its use**

You have no understanding of what you are jumping on the race hate train for. Like a fucking idiot.

**Being ignorant and hateful is soo much better isnt it?**

Fucking morons. All of you. OP is a fucking idiot.

Your friends dont have an education or understand what they are complaining about. Your friends are fucking morons.

I am not on board with gender identities already, but at least I have a deeper understanding than yelling at made up white people.. I dont like them more so when you have "Faye" or "fairy" identities. Or call yourself God. These are not healthy displays of cognitive behavior.... But your problem with "white people" is a made up bullshit perpetuated because your average redditor is a fucking idiot and thinks a meme reflects the facts of the world and people like you eat it up because you dont have the capcity to understand basic fucking concepts outside of a picture of Doge.
