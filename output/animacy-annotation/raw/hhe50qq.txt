Very interesting. A girl on my team (who very much believes in the vaccines) had gone on multiple medications for depression and anxiety since taking the shots. A couple weeks ago she checked in with us from the hospital, trying to sort of the cause of her various ailments.

This is a young girl in her 20s. Totally naive and unaware that it was likely the shots she took that did this.

Most people are in denial because to face what is really being done here is incredibly dark, and most people just can't handle it... So with a weird bit of Stockholm Syndrome, they go along with it and do their part to support mandates and force it on others so they don't have to be alone in their suffering.

It is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.

If you haven't taken the shots, hold out. It will be short term suffering -- but we are living proof that the shots are harmful, and it's why they want to eliminate our group. Taking the shots, though, in all likelihood will lead to long-term suffering.
