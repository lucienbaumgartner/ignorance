Those are actually really good reasons! Well argued!

I think the main thing is that people feel like it's in character for the Chinese government to hide real numbers, and since they've already lost all credibility, any chance of protest that the numbers are genuine would be a lost cause. Because you and I probably won't know until we have the official "expected" numbers, and even that's a guess.

I will say that according to my dad and a few equally paranoid friends of his, there is motive to keep the numbers looking low because that's around the time when the Spring Festival Celebration Program was airing. Those are huge programs that people all over the nation watches, so they wanted to keep the people complacent and unaware that some deep crap is going down within the country. They didn't want that level of scrutiny around that time, I guess? They had a mentality of "if we can contain it, we'll just pretend that nothing ever happened". I have no idea the validity of that idea, but I personally don't like to make conspiracy theories like that and I feel like that theory is rather weak.

Anyway, just my thoughts. Hope they make sense!
