As an outside bystander who does service plumbing and doesn’t want his worked judged by those not involved and ignorant of all the issues... it’s possible you got ripped off. Transversely, it’s also possible that something was out of alignment besides just the b adjustment. The front chainring may also need a spacer. I doubt it’s frame damage but at the same time, without knowing, it’s a pretty tough thing to judge even with the amount of detail you’ve included.
