I know right..

&gt;This will ruin people's health

Certainly, but it generates revenue right? :/  (in the form of sales, evading additional verification stages, setting up of regulatory bodies etc) or implementation of regulations require effort there is no willingness to put in, perhaps.. not sure what the cause is, probably because it doesn't seem concerning enough at the face of "other"/ major aspects of nation's interest? if this is not at least one of them then what is.. 
All I take from this is that it's all in the hands of consumers now, because such organisations won't give in unless there's a compulsion to avoid dire consequences, and there *is* no such thing as of yet.. 

Truly frightening, especially for the unaware and unsuspecting masses, who have no access to information and have only such shady assets as options.

This is upsetting.
