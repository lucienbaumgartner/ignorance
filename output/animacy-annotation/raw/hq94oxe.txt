I assume you’re talking about Marx. Learned all about his economic theories in college. Not interested. If we lived in a communist society I would spend more time trying to figure out how to live in it. But we don’t. Only one of us is trying to buck the system that we can’t change. My gleefully ignorant and less than stellar arguments have pulled my family out of generational poverty for the first time ever.  But go off I guess.
