I've probably had sex with several people with genital herpes, given that over 1/8 of people aged 15-49 have it. The figure is higher among sexual active people.

Yes, I had sex with someone who had HSV-2, takes the antiviral, and did not have an outbreak near the time. I only had sex with this person twice, so there is a pretty low chance I caught it from them.

But I wouldn't be surprised if I have herpes (genital or oral). I've had a lot of partners, and if I don't have it, I'll probably get it eventually. The vast majority of people with herpes are unsymptomatic and unaware that they have it. You may have it - who knows.

Though I don't have cold sores, and still avoid kissing/receiving oral sex from people with them
