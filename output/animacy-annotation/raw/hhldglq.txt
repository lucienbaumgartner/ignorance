If you look like a strong/tall guy, you will likely be much more frequently asked to help someone move patients, open things, reach for things, and come help in code grays. 
You will have less drama directed at you, than if you were female.
I have never had a patient refuse a male nurse unless they were obviously devoutly religious like a Muslim woman fully covered for modesty.
I don’t know about chaperones, our male CNA’s help female patients to the bathroom all the time, I think it would depend on company policy and your comfort level.
I’m generally modest and wary of men but when I was a patient going through a real medical issue I could not care less if you were male and if you saw things I just needed a good nurse, period.
I think men in nursing get treated (in general) much better by everyone than women, get hired faster (for the stupid diversity ratios), have more opportunities, less drama. If you work out and keep your body strong you are also less likely to get an injury than a woman. Also doctors are likely to treat you with more respect. 

And I’m so sorry that you feel like you have to put a disclaimer to defend yourself, I did not at all feel like you were being ignorant or discriminatory. Gender is a reality and there are obvious differences in the nursing workplace that are gender related. I remember hearing a male nursing student telling me how he was going to get a job right away because they hire guys much faster. I thought how unfair that someone would be hired only because of their gender (same as not getting hired because of gender). It’s discriminatory and ignorant of employers to not hire the most qualified nurse only because everyone on the unit is a female and they need a man to dilute it for appearance sake to look more diverse.
