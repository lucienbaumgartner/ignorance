A small percentage of idiotic far-left Americans who think that what they see on the news is representative of reality doesn’t trust cops. Just admit you made an anti-cop comment because you know that it’s guaranteed free upvotes and awards on Reddit. And now you’re being called out by people who ACTUALLY can’t trust the cops in their countries and your argument is “well it’s all relative isn’t it?” I really hope you’re like 16 and going through a phase of following the crowd, because there’s no excuse for an adult to be this insufferable and unaware of his privileges. And no I don’t want to hear about your “a cop was mean to me” anecdotes.
