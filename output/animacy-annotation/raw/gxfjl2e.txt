Imagine being so arrogant and ignorant that you think that the good things can justify the horrors of life. No one talked about being able to enjoy life. Of course you can enjoy your life. But life is also horrible for countless human beings. One doesn't negate the other. Please educate yourself before talking nonsense. Thank you.
