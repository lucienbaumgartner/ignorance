Cool! In my experience west coasters (especially SoCal folks) are very isolated and ignorant of non-west coast things in general, especially Midwest things. Also a lot of Chicagoâ€™s reputation is steeped in racism - like other people mentioned, why does Chicago get a worse rap than other cities with a worse per capita violence rate? 

DM me if you have questions!
