&gt; However it didn't on the raikage unless sasuke intentionally made it miss or be slower which he wouldn't do. 

Raikage reacted almost instantly after it was cast with extremly heightened reflexes. This is just besides the point. I don’t know why you are constantly comparing v2 Ay’s body flicker to C2 Dragon’s speed. 

&gt; Yes, however this plus the Distance that Deidara would have would have would make it possible for Deidara to dodge it

The distance won’t change how fast it is. 

&gt; So he wasn't blitzed.

Nice leaving my words out. If you had included them , it says that Deidara would have been blitzed if Sasuke aimed for him and not Tobi. 

&gt; Funny how someone Is faster than another when distractions are being used this is just Sasuke being disoratied not him being blitzed remember this is also sasuke bloodlusted so he probably isn't thinking straight or fighting like he normally would.

Sasuke also unable to see him weave signs [mid battle. ](https://i.imgur.com/6vssFCl_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)


&gt; He was practically blind and unaware of his full capabilities whereas Kakashi has Kamui and years of experience aswell as no end of techniques to stand a chance at least. 

No , he gets slammed dunked. 



&gt; Just no Deidara one shots the Sussano as Madara's Perfect Sussano was able to rival Tailed beasts and Madara's Sussano is much stronger than Itachi's and Deidara one shot the 3 tails with his weakest bomb
