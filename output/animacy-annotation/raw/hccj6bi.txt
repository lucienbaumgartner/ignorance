That’s been the worst part of all of this for me, as an unvaccinated woman. Just a few days ago women all over the country were outraged at Texas’s heartbeat law because no one, especially men, has the right to tell a woman what to do with her body. Yes these same people support Biden’s vaccine mandate which just forced a lot of women to do something to their body that they don’t want to do. Women are being coerced in to getting the vaccine in order to finish their college degree, keep their job and in some places like SF &amp; NYC be able to participate in a normal society. These women are basically being forced to do something to their body. Technically it’s coercion but it’s dangerously close to being forced. And these people are the same ones who are 100% against school dress codes because they unfairly target females—girls should be able to wear what they want and if boys are distracted by it then don’t blame the girls, it’s not their fault. Yet they are ok with our male president mandating vaccines and they are ok with male employers coercing their female employees to get a vaccine if they want to keep their job! I don’t see how they can be so hypocritical and unaware of their own double standards here.
