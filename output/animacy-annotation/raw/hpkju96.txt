So, now you're an antivoting troll? Your last post you wanted better candidates, now your temper tantrum widens into a total refusal to vote? That's stupid.

If you want different candidates in general elections you have to vote in primaries, not throw ageist temper tantrums.

If you don't like the candidates in general elections, look in the mirror: When you refuse to participate in primary elections to promote people that share your point of view, they will simply NEVER accumulate the power required to implement the policies you claim to believe in, never be in a general election, and never win a general election and get to make policy.

The things you claim you believe in are farther away because of your weathervaning and your threats of non voting.

Here's a thought: You might be taken more seriously if you had some argument besides ageism. Honestly, when I hear some little shit complaining that a candidate is too "old" as their primary concern, I hear a person whose opinion I don't give a shit about unless they have some other justification and Also have some pretty huge redeeming qualities to make up for the ageist bigotry.

Democracies only work with consistent participation. Just shutting down throws away your power, completely. Primary elections, local elections.... The "boring" ones... That's how you get real changes made.

Handing over power to Republicans because Democrats are "old" is so ignorant and nonsensical it insults the people who died to give you the right to vote in the first place.

Good grief. Grow up.
