That’s the sad thing. A small part of me wants to believe they were on our side since they were going “Yeah this is weird… Wait for the owner” and then got all stern and ignorant and their excuse was “he’s nice” makes me wonder if he was secretly threatening to burn their movement to the ground if they didn’t give in to him cuz of how much power he managed to get through manipulation. Idk if that’s what was going on, but it could make sense why despite the evidence, they still took his side in the end and had a dumb excuse. It comes off unprofessional to be fine with someone who defends pedophilia just cuz he’s nice to you not to mention make even you come off as a creep…
