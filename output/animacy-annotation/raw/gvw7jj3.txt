It’s incredibly human, you cant change that. And no, sharing what you have with a new life isnt selfish at all, *youre* comparing what youre comfortable calling “enough” with what someone else is comfortable with and imagining it’s different, but it isnt, it’s relative. And yet we know it could be better, so using words like yours is undignified and ignorant of the rest of the world. You exist because of poor people having babies at some point in history, and if youre fuckable and straight, youll have them too, barring unknowns like whether youre actually a robot or just proud of not reproducing. Youre free to not reproduce - reproduction is a basic human right.
