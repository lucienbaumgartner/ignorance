No, HR in America is pretty bad. You're really fortunate, and unaware of that. I've worked at warehouses, inventory, fast food, etc, you're lucky to even have HR, if you do you're lucky to have any access to your HR department at all, If you do have HR that you can access they just communicate your options, their interests and the law. 

I've also noticed a lot of HR departments in the US automate the majority of the process, and per usual lazy automations they feel like they're designed to exhaust you instead of actually get you to someone who's job it is to help you. Having an HR department of an involved advocates for employees is a luxury.
