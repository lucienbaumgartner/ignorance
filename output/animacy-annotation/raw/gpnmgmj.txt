&gt; The entire actual (nerdy) joke is that this is in fact just cosplay of a real race in the world of DnD which fleshed out lore and Chang is just leaning hard into his character

I think there's another layer to the joke that you're maybe missing. The joke is that, even though yes it's character-accurate, any reasonable person would understand dressing up in blackface *at all* in a social no-no, even if your intentions aren't malicious.

So the joke is that Chang is so socially stunted and unaware of social norms regarding racial sensitivity. It's actually a joke that I think would work better with Pierce, but it's funnier if Chang does it because it's derived not just from Chang's social unawareness, but also from his desire to be accepted by going all-in on the group activity (something Pierce would never do... as the episode shows pretty clearly).
