I am not Asian myself and do not speak for them, but being friends with many I know that "slanted eyes" is a common insult and slur that they are unfortunately faced with often. To then fetishize something that has been used to discriminate them for centuries is so unbelievably ignorant and cold hearted! Y jaw dropped when I heard Mary say that. Interminority aggressions are a real issue, and Mary clearly hasn't done her homework.
