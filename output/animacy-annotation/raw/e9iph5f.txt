The delusion that future Batman movies can only feature Ben Affleck is so short-sighted and ignorant that it's getting a bit bizarre.

I loved Ben in BvS, my favorite live-action version of Batman. I hated his version of Batman in JL. I'm ready to move on. I'm a Batman fan, not exclusively a "Ben Affleck as Batman" fan.
