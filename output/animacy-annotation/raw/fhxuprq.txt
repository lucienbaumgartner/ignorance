"Being right and not spreading misinformation" should be important to everyone.

A good way to start is by immediately dismissing anyone who regurgitates the hilariously ignorant view of "The worst starter on the team could have been replaced by *anyone*." Everyone has that faction of village idiots who make such extreme hyperbole. It's amazing to not only see them constantly repeat the same ignorant talking points, but have so little self awareness when they speak. Like...I seriously don't get it. We see the people who say "They should bench him because *anyone* would be better." We know we point and laugh at people who are so stupid and ignorant that they say this unironically. So...why would you then make that claim yourself? Why would you intentionally choose to say something that makes people point and laugh at you? I don't get it.

Blake wasn't a good corner. This does not mean that there is any basis for the claim that Boykin would have been better. And it's important to shut down such ignorance, even if it's only on Reddit, before it spreads and makes other people even dumber.
