Blaming it all on the “natural” famine is a popular copout. The primary reason was the confiscation of people’s livestock due to the collectivization. And collectivization was not the local government’s idea. Saying that I was all caused by the locals is just so ignorant and plain WRONG.

I know you love your Soviet propaganda and you love to blame the “locals”. No problem, go ahead. Just don’t go on spreading lies about my country’s history (Kazakhstan).

And being reduced to 60% instead of 50%? Wow, we must be thankful for those Soviet policies then!!!
