Sorry I was answering why people are against LeBron as it relates to BLM. I can try to answer the latter too (pls don't debate me since not all views are mine). Things I've heard (I'm going to exclude the obvious racist stuff since there's no point repeating that):

- Why not all lives (in a non racist way). Yes All lives matter tends to be racist people saying it but there are many people that do think BLM is more about black supremacy than equality. There are outspoken black people that push back on some of the supremacist aspects of it (Terry Crews being one of them). You can see it coming up with the Stop Asian Hate stuff (you will see BLM people pushing saying SAH takes away from BLM) and also with how nobody related to BLM gave a damn about the anti semitic shit floating around the NFL.

- People can't stand the justification of the rioting and looting. The idea of "it's just property" or "insurance will cover it" is pretty simplistic and ignorant of a lot of reasons why that might not be true.

- Criticism that it's over applied. In some of the instances the people killed by police were in fact violent criminals as evident by witness testimony and forensics

- Black on black crime is a really popular one. Statistically speaking you're many many many times more likely to be killed by a black person as a black person. There's little attention to this and defund the police is considered naive by many as police departments are currently overwhelmed in stopping these crimes.

- Some white people feel offended by the concept that they have not actively contributed so the broad paint stroke of them as racist by BLM is off-putting

- Focusing on BLM implies Black people mostly get arrested due to racism and it gets into a cycle of why is there so much black crime in general. Alot of debate of institutional problem vs personal agency. A lot of debate about high arrest rates.

A lot of other reasons too, some valid some not. I do not necessarily agree with all of these but there reasons aside from just racism why people do not like the BLM movement. Some are in my opinion legitimate arguments but many do get coopted by racists unfortunately.
