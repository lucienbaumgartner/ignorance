I am well educated.  Not in the medical field, but I have many peers that are.  I have done as much research as the next guy out there.  I highly disagree with what you state as an indisputable fact.  The vaccine is not going to make this world go back to normal.  Not even close.  You can have your opinion and I can have mine, but donâ€™t for a damn second think yours is correct and everyone that disagree is ignorant or dumb. That in it self make you both ignorant and dumb.  There are plenty of sources that back your opinion and plenty that back mine.  Their are respected medical professionals in both camps.  

Good day.
