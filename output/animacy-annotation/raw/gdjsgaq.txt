Looks like I really hit a nerve with my first comment huh? You have a lot to learn little one. You are taking my comments and spinning them to fit your narrative. She is not malicious, never said that... I said they both need to work on communication. You make a lot of assumptions about people’s lives based on a few comments... I hope you realize how silly and ignorant that looks. I’m discussing the people in this post- which  a lot of others agree that they both are in the wrong. You seem very focused on me personally and my own relationship... which is not at all the focus lol misguided anger. Which just highlights your immaturity.
