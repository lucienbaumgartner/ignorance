My 7 year old son has pretty severe Tourette’s and I find this more amusing than offensive. Maybe I’m just too old but she comes off so ridiculous and ignorant that I can’t even be mad at her. I don’t fear that anyone intelligent is taking her seriously. If other idiots are than great, they can all mingle and enjoy each other’s stupidity.
