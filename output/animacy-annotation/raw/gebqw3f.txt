I would bet heavily that she is so thick and ignorant that she would think that if you took a rocket fired directly up at 90degrees to the earths surface, went 10 miles or even 100miles, or even 1000miles the rocket then stopped, she would be floating around like "In the movies" as surely "once you get to a certain height you just float around free of gravity right".

i bet if you told her that even at 10,000 light years away the earths gravity is still pulling on you, she would claim you were wrong and she knows better.
