My straight cis boyfriend has only ever said one of these things I think. The tits vs ass one. We talk about our interests openly so it makes sense. Unfortunately for me, he’s the one that DOESN’T want a threesome and I do lol. I knew he was a good one when I didn’t even need to explain to him that it still counts as cheating if I kiss a girl behind his back. Other guys I’ve dated were of the “it doesn’t count if it’s a girl/if I can watch” variety, which seems to be coming from their not believing me or taking me seriously, thinking it’s just for attention or something. He also gets that technically we’re “straight passing” because I’m queer even if he’s not. He’s a really good ally which is impressive because when I met him 7 years ago, he was still a good person just incredibly ignorant and unaware (his parents were pretty fucking bigoted/racist) and he has been really open to learning. I’m somewhat grateful I did experience the shit in the OP for a time because it’s made me more appreciative of what I have now.
