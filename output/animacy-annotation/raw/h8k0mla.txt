I just have two scenarios in my head
-Ether she completely love bombed me / was an avoidant and unaware of it.
-Or she was so afraid of falling in love again that when she finally had it she ran away. 

I've never felt someone love me and never loved someone with that intensity before. And the thought of it being fake is tearing me apart
