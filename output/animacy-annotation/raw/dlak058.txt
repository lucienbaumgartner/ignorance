As I read it, he says the situation described *"demean government, drop civics conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry"*. is a problem: *"This problem"* that needs to be fixed *"demands some serious, serious thinking"*

"*Unawareness*" may have worked for them in the past *"but"* it isn't any more *"compliance is obviously fading rapidly."* - so they have been bad - but the writer is not proud of it and thinks things should change. It is wrong to criticize someone for being openly self critical and wanting to improve.

But to avoid doubt, these guys as a whole suck, and deserve no  sympathy
