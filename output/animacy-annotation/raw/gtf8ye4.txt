I mean as long as they aren’t hurting anyone they are free to express their opinions. Killing them will only make things worse since it’ll make other nazis/kkk both more hostile and ignorant. That will also cause more of them to be created since they will see their previous ignorant thoughts they dismissed as confirmed. It’ll lead on and on to their children, grandchildren, etc, etc until the cycle is broken or it spreads to more people. 

You can’t solve these situations with violence unless you want major loses on both sides. If you a permanent solution without bloodshed, you need to find peace somehow.
