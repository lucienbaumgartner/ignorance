Im very self aware. Sometimes I try to ignore it in anger but I always know why I feel the way I feel and I know exactly when Im unfair towards others or selfish. In the end though I think it would probably be nice for myself If I was just ignorant and blind sided like some other people. Just totally unaware and in denial of your own issues
