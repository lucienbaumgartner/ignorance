No? No one is preventing Palestinians from visiting mosques, genociding them, or anything like that. I’m not trying to justify shit like the settlements of the West bank or the ejection of Palestinians from Jerusalem. And it isn’t a competition to decide who has suffered the most (but for the record, the prejudice facing Palestinians right now cannot be compared to what Jews have faced for millennia). But I’m saying the Temple Mount was always a Jewish site, still is, and should be returned to the Jews. I think Muslims should be allowed to pray there too, as well as anyone else who wants to. And if the Jews want to, they should be allowed to rebuild their temple as well. The first two temples didn’t actually take up much of the mount, so there’s space. 

For Muslims to oppose allowing Jews to pray at a Jewish site is pathetic, childish and ignorant of history. And I think maybe they would understand better if they lost Mecca for a while.
