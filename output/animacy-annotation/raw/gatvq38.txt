You’re making a lot of assumptions. For instance, where in this post does it specify “student”? Nowhere. In fact, it specifically requests a “Music Composer”. Which sounds a hell of a lot like they’re looking for a tried and true professional and not a student looking to hone their craft.


&gt; You seem angry and unaware of how certain industries work


I’m very aware that plenty of industries do indeed work this way. That’s not my argument. My argument is that it’s a bullshit accepted convention that professional artists (and many people in other professional industries) are expected to work on their own dime for years because some asshole says they haven’t “proven” themselves yet. Just because an industry functions a certain way doesn’t mean that’s fair or acceptable.
