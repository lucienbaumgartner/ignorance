Why should I care about the unvaccinated they do not care about us vaccinated if they cared they would get the vaccination they are being selfish and ignorant and putting everyone else in harm. If you’re unvaccinated and you get Covid stay in your home and treat yourself if you don’t need medicine to keep you from getting Covid then you do not need medicine to cure you if you stay home and die  that’s thinning the herd of the ignorant
