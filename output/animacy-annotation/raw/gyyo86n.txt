I can relate to that. Iâ€™d say I prefer to feel in control, but am typically able to put myself in a comfortable environment before tripping. But one night I was at a concert with a buddy having some beers when mushrooms were offered. My friend is someone who becomes very unaware and inconsiderate of people around him when intoxicated, and I felt like I needed to be overly aware of his surroundings for him. The night went mostly okay, but I had an extra layer of anxiety that likely would have led to a bad trip if I had taken more.
