I’ve had 4 Great Pyrenees and worked with breeders in breeding/showing and working farm environments. 

With that being said, my experience is with Great Pyrenees that we’re bred to breed standards with amazing temperament and disposition, so not knowing the particular dog I would take everything said with at least a pinch of salt ;) 

Most Great Pyrenees (every one I’ve met) are amazing with kids. But they can be clumsy and unaware of their body. Other than the potential of being snuggled to death I would trust my Great Pyrenees with the lives of my 3 and 4 year old nieces. I’ve never seen any aggressive tendencies in any of my Pyrenees with kids. Quite the opposite they tend to put up with everything. Even too much at times (I recently caught my 3 year old niece riding my one and a half year old GP 🤦‍♀️).  If you’re unfamiliar with dog body language and such, maybe have a trainer familiar with guardian breeds come in and work with the dog and your son for a session.  If he’s a standard GP my guess is the trainer won’t pick up on any aggression and it will provide your son (and you) with some good insights and confidence.

I joke that one of my Pyrs “Suzie” wants to be an inside dog, but she still loves her outdoor time. You’ll want to either have a fenced yard or plan on leashes walks. Great Pyrenees are not good off leash. Also, he will most likely bark at times when he’s outside which is a consideration if you have neighbors. GP don’t need a ton of exercise but being indoors I would suspect he may get bored so plan on things that will mentally stimulate him. Puzzle games etc for when you’re at work will help him stay busy and adjust well. After all, 1 and a half is still a bit of a puppy. 

My Great Pyrenees have all been fabulous with other animals and other people. However, I’ve had two Great Pyrenees, that were aggressive with other dogs. Not every dog, most of the time they were totally fine. But they were prone to resource guarding. I’ve never had a GP fight a dog at the dog park or anything like that. Mostly just aggression over food dishes which was easily solved by moving them to their own safe locations to eat. It doesn’t sound like this will be a problem for you, but something to keep in mind if you do doggy play dates. 

Health issues. None of my GP have had any. But GP are prone to bloat, elbow and hip dysplasia, and patellar luxation. Death by bloat can be almost eliminated by having the stomach tacked. This can be done while the dog is being fixed, so a good thing to talk to your vet about.  All other issues can be avoided by good breeding (which you can’t help at this point) and a good diet and exercise. 

I would plan on grooming him every day. (Allow 15 min) to keep his coat from matting. They don’t really drool that much. Nothing compared to a say a Saint Bernard. Mainly just when you have food they want or when they’re done eating/drinking. As for heat, they don’t love it but they can tolerate it with shade and cold water. If he’s indoor/outdoor he’ll probably prefer to be indoor in the summer. Make sure you don’t shave his coat. His coat is designed to keep him cool. Shaving it can lead to overheating and sunburn. He’ll tolerate cold just fine (bred to live in the snow). 

Talk to your vet about the stomach tacking to prevent bloat. And maybe ask for references to a trainer that has experience with guardian breeds if they have any. Having a trainer who knows the breed work with you a few times can change your entire experience for the better. 

Also be prepared for a lot of selective listening. GP are smart and can be trained, but they tend to ignore commands they don’t want to listen to. They also tend to be sensitive souls and get their feelings hurt if you’re gruff with them. Building trust through gentle but firm training is going to be the best way to go. 

I would say, start by visiting him and if that goes well see if you can take him home for a couple of weeks. The first bit of time will be the toughest time, but I think you’ll know personality wise if he’s a good fit. 

Good luck!
