Except that usually eyewitnesses and testimony and the like aren't enough to convict someone on their own. It's no secret that false memories can be rampant in courts. Mind you, I can understand not risking it with a public defender given that seemingly all the cases of people getting convicted and then later found not guilty are with shitty public defenders. Although this particular case involves someone who can easily get a top tier lawyer.

It's not like courts and judges are stupid and unaware that people lie, make mistakes, and hold false beliefs.
