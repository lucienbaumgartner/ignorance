I have a theory that he intentionally pretended to be less socially aware initially than he truly was. If he had made the rest of the crew aware of his full understanding of biological society and psychology from the outset, they wouldn't have seen an impressive android, they would have seen a human with something *off* about him, and it would have landed him in the Uncanny Valley. Maybe he even had a bad experience with this in one of his previous assignments.

But by starting out a bit naive and unaware of the biologicals' customs, the crew got used to the fact that he was an android, not a human. This way they don't expect him to behave like a human would and the honest mistakes he makes are easily-forgiven because, well, it's known to happen.

Evidence:

* "Accidentally" broadcasting the girl's pleas for help in Pen Pals
* Expertly manipulating Fajo's assistant into letting him go
* Knowing how to handle an insubordinate temporary XO in Redemption II without having seen Picard do something like that (because he never had to)
* Knowing how to handle Worf in Gambit II and being aware that even honest and objective criticism without ill will behind it can have an emotional effect on him

All of these were in circumstances where he was either not around the Enterprise crew, he had plausible deniability, or him pretending to not understand the situation would have had severe consequences.
