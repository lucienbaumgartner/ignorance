I've played third wheel to two couples. The first, I was young, stupid, and unaware that it's a pretty serious indicator if the guy is more into it than the girl. They broke up. The second couple was my best friend and her boyfriend, and after a few rounds over about 6 months I began to feel like I was expected to sleep with them whenever we hung out, and I didn't like that. I AM UNICORN.
