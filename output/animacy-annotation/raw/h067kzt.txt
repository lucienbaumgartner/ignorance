Anything. A railing. A few posts. Something to lock the bike to that also prevents cars from stealing the space. This looks to me like the driver was half blind and unaware that it was motorcycle-only parking since if they were going to park illegally they could have rolled 15 feet further forward and not blocked the bay. A row of ground anchors may have made it more clear to them.
