To single out just a few..

* Taking money from countries that she outright knows support ISIS. [[1](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774)][[2](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469)][[3](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828)]

* Admitting to having a 'public position' and a 'private position', in order to keep people from knowing what she really wants as a politician.

 "But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. so, you need both a public and a private position." [[1](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927)]

* Her campaign outright admitting that they want people to be unaware and compliant. 

 "And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly." [[1](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)]

* Her campaign outright wishing that the San Bernadino shooter had been white. 

 "Better if a guy named Sayeed Farouk was reporting that a guy named Christopher Hayes was the shooter." [[1](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11500#searchresult)]

* Saying "this is great" that a black man was killed by a white man, with only one dissenting voice saying 'No, we should make this story about gun control first, not racism'. [[1](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25750#efmAbVAbxAgZAgnAhlAiEAj8AmD)]
