As someone who has suffered night terrors off and on my whole life (starting at age 4 and we’ll before I experienced any kind of “trauma”) YTA so much I don’t even know how to tell you. 
As I’ve gotten older I’ve learned to connect my periods of night terrors to stress. Thankfully I’ve only experienced sleep paralysis a couple of times… but my best friend gets it pretty often. Guess what the #1 trigger for sleep paralysis is? LACK OF SLEEP. I don’t even have words for how ignorant and abusive you’re being to your daughter.
