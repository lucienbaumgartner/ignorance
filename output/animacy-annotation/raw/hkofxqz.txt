To gab is to chatter or talk with length about trivial subjects (such as 1 item she probably already knows most things about if she wants it.)

Usually these people aren't the least bit considerate and are just unaware and oblivious to the fact that other people have things to do and just talk away.

Usually these people just like to be heard, the only one heard and have a stronger sense of entitlement
