You need to think of the hierarchal power structure as very old to begin with, imagining how many rulers have been overthrown by the next greediest guy, until the most ruthless remain at the top. Then you have to consider how militaries, institutions, and agencies have been set up to protect that power structure and keep anyone from rising up against it. Along with that, you might say there are incompetent politicians intentionally put in place to create political theater, so there is always a scapegoat to blame for the frustrations of the people. The secrecy and corruption is all part of keeping the public relatively complacent and unaware of the true rulers that no longer exist in our headlines or even on the Forbes list. 

The symptoms of such vast consolidation of wealth and resources is mass suffering. Central bank owners and royal bloodlines continue to fund both sides of wars and profit massively from the suffering of enslaved third world countries. 

At this point, I think the 'machine' (mass of corporate interests) set up centuries ago to protect vastly powerful individuals, has grown too massive and incomprehensible for any one of 'them' to just stop it. They need to continue the illusion that people need money to survive, or society and the system will crumble, and they'll all go down together.
