So to be clear:

1) "Remain in Mexico" is against USA law. People have a right to Asylum in the USA. Just because Trump did something - didn't make it right or legal. He was going to lose that in court. 

2) 4 years later and the wall did nothing. Which is what Democrats said. All the money invested in the wall was wasted - because it didn't address why they are coming. (American is rich - not because of biden)

Everything you said is dumb and ignorant of reality. This isn't fox news.
