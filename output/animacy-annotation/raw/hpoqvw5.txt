I’m not a HCW (lurk), but this is what I’ve been saying to idiots who trot out the whole “if you’re vaccinated, why do you care if I’m not?” bullshit for months. This is why.

I’ve been in emergency quite a few times in my life (unlucky), and it’s fucking scary. It is terrifying when without the help of HCWs, you will suffer and die within days. I’ve also needed elective surgeries that completely changed my quality of life, without which I’d be in worlds of pain now.

People are so complacent, so overprivileged, so ignorant, and so intransigent not to listen to you guys. It’s horror movie stuff.
