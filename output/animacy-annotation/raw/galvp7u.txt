I wish Apple would kill non-authorized repair centers. So many issues from them. Remember Louis Rossman selling counterfeit *genuine* batteries (offense 1) with fucking apple logos on them (offense 2)?

Jesus. Either become authorized and trustworthy, or gtfo. I just can't believe that it's 2020 and people act like changing transistors on boards is a viable procedure to do at a global, hundreds of millions of device sales per year, scale. 

Some people are so uninformed and ignorant that they can't imagine the time constraints for those repairs at that scale. The training hours. The machinery needed. Etc. We aren't talking about specialized tractors, here. The only equivalent to that would be a low volume seller like a Mac Pro. And guess what.

Anyway, iPhones are still a lot easier to repair individually or through 3rd party changes than all relevant competition by a huge margin. Hopefully that chances. Samsung's latest devices get 2/10 while iPhones get 6/10. Let's change that.

More authorized repair centers, please. Better for the environment too, once you remember that the world is bigger than your specific case.
