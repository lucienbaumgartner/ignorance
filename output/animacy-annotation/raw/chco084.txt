The Senateâ€™s investigation into the C.I.A. program took four years to complete and cost more than $40 million, in part because the C.I.A. insisted that committee staff members be allowed to review classified cables only at a secure facility in Northern Virginia. And only after a group of outside contractors had reviewed the documents first.   

Who is in charge here? 

The USA is no longer run by the elected representatives, and the real powerholders are so used to the populace remaining calm and unaware that they're getting obvious and sloppy.   The outside contractors made sure the Senators didn't see anything the CIA didn't want them to see.
