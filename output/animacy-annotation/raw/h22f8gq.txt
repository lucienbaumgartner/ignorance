Exactly this. People who try to argue that Earth has anything that cannot be found in more abundance and with easier accessability in other places, are either scientifically incompetent and unaware of it or just trying to rationalize some other theories they are trying to push.

Gold? There's a planetary core floating in the belt, called 16 Psyche, that is full of Gold, Palladium, Iron and other things. All that and it is still untouched... it even has colled spherical blobs just resting on it's surface, waiting to be harvested. Water? There are entire oceans even in our solar system, below certain body's ice sheets... any element one wished to harvest could more easily be obtained from outside Earth. And it still looks like they didn't even bother with exploiting our system much. If they can get here, they can definetly also reach any of the other miriad uninhabited systems around us, that have the same composition with no-one to need it.
