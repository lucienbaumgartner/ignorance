Dude, right? One of my friends who is totally apolitical and unaware of the happenings around him said something like, "I mean, they didn't riot nearly enough to see change. They need to do more than what they did if they want to really make a change at the deep racism in the US."

I spit out my drink. LOL. I was like, "Are you fucking insane? There is not a racist person on this PLANET that is going to go 'Oh man. These businesses burning down really changes my perspective. I should listen.'"

Hell no. They're watching people burn cities down, beat people, scream in the streets, etc. and they're thinking "Wow, look at these unhinged people".
