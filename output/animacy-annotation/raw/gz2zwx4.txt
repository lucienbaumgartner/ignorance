I used to read Salon daily, many years ago, before they went off the rails. 

Now? I can take almost any article on their site, and if I know anything about the topic under discussion it becomes obvious the article is riddled with omissions, inaccuracies and outright bullshit. 

Firearms are one of my particular areas of interest, and Salonâ€™s coverage of that issue is so laughably dishonest and ignorant that it makes my brain hurt. 

I have better things to do than fact check every article from a site with such a shit track record. If you wanna spend your free time doing so, fill yer boots.
