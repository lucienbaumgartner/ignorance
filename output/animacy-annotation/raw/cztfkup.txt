The first two seasons of that show in particular, before it started getting gradually more broad and wacky, were VERY smart.  I liked that the characters were aware that they were being funny.  There's a rule in comedy that the characters are supposed to be sincere and unaware that they're being funny, but I think people stick too closely to that rule.  I always love seeing a show that's just about smartasses who can make each other laugh, but the only shows I can think of that do it regularly are this one (again, in the pre-zany years) and *Roseanne*.
