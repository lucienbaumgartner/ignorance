It’s not you it’s them. People are so emotionally immature and ignorant that when you don’t agree with them they automatically name-call you a racist or boot-licker. It’s disappointing that people can’t argue/debate in a civil manner and attack the ARGUMENT. 

The problem with the ACAB slogan is the person who says it immediately loses credibility. How can you make a blanket statement and expect reasonable discussion afterwards? Do we not teach debate in school anymore? I’m sure someone will say it’s white supremacy talk.
