If you think Walmart and their processes are so great go work for them! ðŸ˜‚ Luckily you are neither a slave nor does your working experience at Meijer give you ANY idea of what being a slave is like. You are free to walk off the job at anytime and I promise you wonâ€™t be chased down and dragged back. Youâ€™re clearly whiny and ignorant, and comparing a job you chose to work at and slavery is f***ing stupid as hell. Not to mention the fact that 3rd shift dairy is nothing compared to working 3rd shift produce or the majority of factory jobs. Good luck at Walmart, Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll promote your entitled ass to customer pretty quickly!
