Man, my heart really goes out to those trump supporters that stormed the capital. I just cant imagine how hard life must be, how terrifying the world is to people so utterly gullible, stupid, and ignorant that they think Trump of all people is their guy and worth all this pain for. I honestly cannot imagine how hard life would be if I were that fucking dumb.
