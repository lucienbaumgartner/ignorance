I like his work with Baumbach, so if this happens, cool. :-)  It seems as if they click on an artistic level and there's nothing wrong with exploring that.

Baumbach also has this uncomfortable, but IMO not wrong notion about humans: We're all the heroes in our own stories, but ultimately we're also all very self-absorbed and have a difficult time looking beyond our own narrow perspectives. 

OTOH, yeah, I get why people get irritated with his movies. They're basically all #RichWhitePeopleProblems films. ;-) And this is never more obvious than when he tries to be "relatable" and include something about "financial struggles" into his pieces. Like, dude, stop. And usually all his characters live lives of insane privilege and are completely insulated and unaware of this privilege. So the stakes are usually quite low.

Even in something like Marriage Story, these people are ridiculously privileged and totally oblivious to how cushy their lives are. Nicole/Charlie, Nicole's family, the theatre people, the TV people, the lawyers, their lives are obscenely comfortable. So they can then pursue their "existential problems" without ever having to be financially responsible.

But Baumbach will never change in this respect, I guess. It's mostly just an observation. ;-)
