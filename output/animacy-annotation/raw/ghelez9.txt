Your SJW ideology is overwhelming. What exactly do you mean by the way black people continue to be treated? The poorest, least educated parts of the country are predominantly white (Appalachia and Kentucky), and the average black family lives above the poverty line. While there are certainly instances of unfair and cruel treatment towards black people based on their race, the same can be said about any race because humans are tribalistic and have strong in-group preferences.

To suggest that the average black person in America is living through hell on earth is so profoundly laughable and ignorant that I doubt youâ€™ve talked with/met many of the people you claim to represent.
