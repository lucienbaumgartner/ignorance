That's very naive and ignorant of how little corporate chain restaurants give a fuck about their employees and how little leverage these employees have to do anything about it. It's at-will employment, you can be fired for having bad skin or speaking with an accent if management wishes. I've got 30+ jobs' experience across nearly 20 years in restaurants at just about every level from fast food cashier to waterfront steakhouse management. Workers get fired for much much much much much less than throwing a drink at a customer lol. When I worked a drive through years ago I had a coworker get written up for sighing. I know a former subway employee who was fired for walking out while the store was robbed at gunpoint. I've been written up for a 2 star yelp review. I know a former target cashier who was fired after placing cash change on the counter instead of directly into the customer's hand. All these examples involved belligerent and even violent customers. This employee was fired, I have no doubt. If she wasn't I hope she quit and never looked back.
