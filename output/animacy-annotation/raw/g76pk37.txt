Interesting take on the aspects of religious reform, would also be interesting to see what affect the changes in behavior and swell of worship would have on Tiamat herself as gods powers and moods fluctuate based on how much they are worshiped. Personally I was never really a fan of how at the end of tyranny of dragons Tiamat eats the other cults members as a mwhahaha im evil way to balance the fight mechanics and not have the players have to fight several wizards alongside her, so it could be interesting to see a Tiamat who while evil isnt apocalyptic. Could also have some fun interactions between other worshipers viewing the members with distrust while many members are blissfully unaware and honest in their interactions with others.
