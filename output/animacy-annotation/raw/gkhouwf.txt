we can begin by having a nice discussion about it. 

many people read that carbohydrates are converted into glucose after digestion and assume that means eating carbs is therefore like eating sugary desserts. However, that's an overly simplistic understanding of human digestion. eating carbs is a vastly different digestive process than eating sugars. I'll refer you to this [article](https://atlasbiomed.com/blog/carbs-vs-sugar-what-is-the-difference/) that lays it all out very well. 

Simple carbohydrates, like white rice, can spike your blood sugar. However, complex carbs, like many types of potatoes and brown rices, have no correlation with increased blood sugar. In fact, [studies](https://www.lark.com/blog/diabetes-and-rice/) show that brown rice not only doesn't increase blood sugar, but actually helps regular your blood sugar at lower levels. Yes, carbs can actually lower your blood sugar. 

There is so much misinformation and simple hacks thrown around by grifters trying to sell books and get rich. It's sad. but the "carbs = bad" shit that the keto kooks (and others) push is really toxic and ignorant of the facts.
