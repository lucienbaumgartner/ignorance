Yeah, this is obvious rage-bait tailored to this subreddit. 

- Not a single parent who actively seeks Reddit advice, especially on r/AmITheAsshole, can be so ignorant and cruel. 

- What truly makes me think this is a shit-post is the fact that you claim that life is apparently a movie. In the real world, the driver only gets a speeding ticket. No one else besides the driver gets in trouble for speeding (unless, of course, something highly illegal was done). 

YTA for fabricating such an atrocious post. YTA if this is actually real, and any 18 year old who sees their value would know damn well that parents like this are better off alone. Iâ€™d personally go no contact.
