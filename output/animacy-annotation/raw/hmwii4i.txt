A past lover of mine pulled the same exact things your guy doing and I stupidly fell for the bs. I felt so desired and special because he made me feel so desired and discuss for being “pure.” 

I was naive and unaware that there are men who seek out virgins to take their virginities away as some form of sick conquest. When I was uncomfortable with the things he said and how eager he was to have sex with me, and me expressing that I think he’ll leave me after I’m no longer “pure”, he would smooth talk and say that he’s just feels so good around me and that he’s just excited to be with me while calling me pretty or beautiful. 

When that night came, he was not gentle with me at all and didn’t make me feel safe or good with him at all despite him saying he would. Made fun of me for my inexperience and wasn’t interested in touching my body at all. He didn’t comfort me and was telling me to just push through the pain despite me sniffling from the pain. There was absolutely no foreplay or aftercare and I felt so used and “dirty.”

Days after that, he just became colder and colder towards me while rapidly losing sexual interest in me before he decided to dump me by using the “going away to college” card. Hooks up with one of my virgin acquaintances days later. 

My reason for telling you my story is to avoid assholes like my ex-lover. You deserve to lose your virginity to someone who cares about you and takes the extra steps to make sure you’re extra safe and happy. You’re not an object to be “taken.” Lose your virginity to a man who genuinely likes you for you and wants you, not because you’re simply a virgin. I hope this helps you ❤️
