I had all 4 wisdom teeth extracted- the anesthesia was supposed to keep me conscious but unaware and inhibit memory formation. In fact, it basically paralyzed me but didn't block the pain or memory. So I was fully conscious and feeling the cold metal forceps rooting around in my guns, but unable to communicate that it was extremely painful (because the local shots they gave me didn't take, either). They eventually figured out something was wrong because there were tears trickling down my face and put another painkiller shot into my gums. It is still a horrifying memory.
