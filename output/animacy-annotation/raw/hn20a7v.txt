they rarely get actual hate. people misconstrue hate with anything remotely critical nowadays, and it's concerning. hate comments are serious, sometimes very dangerous, or basically just an attack on someone's character for no reason. she doesn't get "hate". some of her reels get people saying things like "this is cringe" or "okay?" like her recent which was basically bragging about how she's never had alcohol and it just screamed pick me. some people were just making joke type comments of like alright? no one asked?

imo she deserves criticism. she has done some pretty awful things and behaves incredibly immaturely. she (and the rest of the family but really her in particular) is so incredibly sheltered and ignorant that i actually think some non-praise comments would be good for her to hear.
