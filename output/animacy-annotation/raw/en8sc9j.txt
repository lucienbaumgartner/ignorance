I am active in my tribe, living history interpreter, and even speak Chickasaw but still deal with this often because I don’t have dark skin. 

You can generally tell if the person is just so arrogant and ignorant that logical conversation can’t happen. I have literally had someone tell me that Natives needed to get over it because the Europeans needed the land more than they did.... ya I had to walk away from that one before I made a scene lol. 

If the person is reasonably polite I generally ask them what a Native is “supposed” to look like. Of course the televised western Indian stereotypes come up and then arises a great teaching opportunity to explain how many tribes look nothing like these stereotypes. We are the only race in America that the government requires proof we are who we are and that is the ONLY reason blood quantum matters is the USA government. I had a tribal elder tell me once that being native has little to do with your blood and everything to do with your heart. People were regularly adopted into tribes that were other races but that made them no less part of the tribe. They were a tribe member because their heart aligned with the heart of that tribe. 

TLDR: Be YOU. If your heart resonates with your native heritage than that is who you are. Don’t be ashamed. Don’t be brash or boastful about it but be proud. If we return their behavior with aggression than we are no better than they are.
