My best friend when I was in HS was Flava Flav for Halloween one year. We had a bunch of black people in our school and nobody said anything. 

I think the controversy wouldn't even be a thing if people would just be like "listen I used to be dumb and ignorant of what this might do to people, now I'm not!"
