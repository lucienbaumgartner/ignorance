First of all for both your argument against humans knowing everything as well as your argument against humans being able to see past the observable universe you used theories to confirm them, you are making the same mistake humans 1000’s of year ago made and that is thinking we know everything, we most certainly don’t and believing that is ridiculously naive and ignorant of science itself, science allows us to create models of reality that can convey things we see, that doesn’t mean that just because a model works it is instantly and forever correct; the first model of our solar system with the sun being in the middle was explained by using the 5 Platonic solids’ 2d counterparts alongside inscribed circles and circumcircles to outline each planet’s orbits around the sun, that is what led people to look into the sun potentially being the centre of our solar system, and the model was correct at the time, no one saw any problems with it, but as more discoveries was made and more knowledge was acquired this model changed. 

Now I know you might be thinking ‘but we are smarter now so our models shouldn’t change’ ,how do you think people in the 1500’s felt, or the 1600’s or any years after that, at the time that any theory is made it is suitable and understandable for the current time period, however so far throughout the entirety of history the common trend has being of humans being wrong and theories changing so it is very likely that trend will continue. 

Also have you ever thought about the universe not even having any rules or laws? Maybe stuff just happens randomly and there are no true laws, humans might have just being finding these patterns that don’t exist which btw is something very common in human behaviour. And your argument could be ‘but things have being the same for 1000’s of years, well sure but in the scale of the universe that is truly nothing, the dinosaurs existed for 1,000 times longer than humans have and that was still just a fraction of the earth’s life which is just a small fraction of the universe’s life. 
Either way that argument is kinda pointless so I’m gonna end it there.

We know the Big Bang had enough energy to make them all isn’t answer or even an argument, Christians know that their god had the power to create them all too does that prove their religion? No. And yes we ‘know’ the Big Bang happened, simply because of CMB but I mean that really just proves there was a big explosion with the power to create the universe, for all we know that could be the amount of power a black hole releases when something happens to it, because we don’t actually know for certain that black holes don’t just explode, we have a theory thanks to hawking but that isn’t proof, not to mention the theory states they will slowly radiate away but considering that they are a literal breakage in spacetime there is no definite way to know they continue radiating away and something else doesn’t happen. Not to mention the fact that we have no clue what came before the Big Bang, if anything did, and why the Big Bang occurred so the theory of the Big Bang really brings more questions then answers.

How do you know there would be an indicator of god, for all we know he is the one that controls every aspect of this universe, why are you imagining he is just sitting somewhere and just sometimes popping in, also with the power god supposedly possess he would be able to literally recreate the entire universe after visiting he could come down talk to someone and then recreate the entire universe except with the event of him coming down being removed and it’s actions still occuring, hell he could physically make anything happen, as well as make the things that make that thing happen, happen and so on. By no means does god’s actions need to have any traceable effect on the world, maybe he even does he just alters everyone’s thoughts to make them think he doesn’t, don’t forget god suppsodely created everything including you more or less. This is a big reason i lack belief of any god because this seems stupid, but that doesn’t mean it’s untrue and my word isn’t going to disprove it.


Edit: sorry for this being so huge I went on a couple of rants
