Yeah one side is fighting against a known and measured systemic racism, a broken policing system, healthcare, and women's rights (Those were the big protests over the past 4 years). These people took to the streets of cities all across America in the thousands to fight for a better tomorrow.

The other side claims that their leader, the worst president to grace America, had an election stolen from him with no proof other than him saying it. These people assaulted our capital with intention of stopping a transition of power at the highest level of our government.

You are stupid and unaware of the world around you.
