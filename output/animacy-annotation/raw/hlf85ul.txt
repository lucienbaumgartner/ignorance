There's a woman I went to school with who both had a lot of sex, and who did a lot of drugs. She almost died from cocaine. She used to wear the hoodie of her friend who died of an overdose before her very eyes because she felt guilty about his death. She actually knows 5 people personally who has died from drug overdoses. I know only one person, a family member, who had to be revived because she tried killing herself with an overdose at 15, and my Uncle has been a drug addict most of his life and I'll be surprised if he doesn't die that way.

Neither myself, nor the girl I had gone to school with who slept around, know ANYONE who has died from sex. Why? Because sex is not inherently dangerous, unlike drugs. STIs may be dangerous, but that is wholly separate from sex -- they can be transmitted through any bodily fluid, such as blood transfusions or potentially even sharing drinks, sex just happens to be the most common form of bodily fluid exchange. Probably even more dangerous than STIs is pregnancy and labor, and again, wholly separate than sex itself, as it's simply a potential outcome of sex instead of a continuation of it.

The fact you think sex is as dangerous as drugs says you're insanely sheltered and unaware of how the world works.
