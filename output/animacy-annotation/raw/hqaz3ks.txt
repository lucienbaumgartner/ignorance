It's gonna take a lot to get people to the point where they're *okay* with LGBT adoption, but I think getting them to understand that refusing gay couples looking to take in a child leads to even worse consequences for said child than what they're imagining will happen with the gay parents (even if what they're imagining is ignorant and wrong) is probably a more realistic avenue to take in getting those kinds of harmful discriminations phased out in a practical sense than demanding total, whole-hog acceptance right off the bat (especially considering that, for a lot of orphans, this is a pretty time sensitive issue. They need to be opened up to that larger pool of parents as soon as possible, even if the method used to get there is less than ideal). I think it just comes across weird when presented to US because we know there's nothing wrong with LGBT parents AT ALL, but in the eyes of the people this argument is intended for, there ARE two "evils" to choose between, and we need to get them to understand what the lesser of them is.
