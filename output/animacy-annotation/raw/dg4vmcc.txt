This IS a legit tactic. It's in the game, when it is fixed it won't be. until then, it's fair game. This is also very easily avoided by picking a different spawn. If you're in casual then just prone and wait for the fix.  
Also rushing outside immediately after the prep phase to go and get kills on stupid, unaware and unsuspecting attackers is 100% legit. As an attacker you are an ELITE COUNTER TERRORISM OPERATOR. You're about to enter a building full of danger and adversities the least you can do is pay attention and not just blindly rush to the first entrance of the building. GIT GUD
