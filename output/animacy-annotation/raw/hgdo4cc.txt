I'm such a cynic, my immediate reaction was annoyance. "She belongs to God...immediately and without awareness, no thought in between." Like, dude, she's been thinking about all this stuff and put it into words and metaphors that specifically you could understand. He even says it himself "she can put all...into words." How is that "without awareness"?

To me,it reads like those guys who say "she was unaware of how beautiful she was" and "she needed no makeup, she was fresh and innocent and unaware of her sexuality." It's adoring the shell of the person, instead of the individual spirit.

This is what happens when you try to describe an altered state realization or dream to someone else. Sigh.
