I think so much that I rarely have anything to say, I often come across as unaware and aloof to people.There’s someone in my class who thinks that we are friends, called me stupid; but I give them a fake smile everyday and they believe it. 

Silently ignored my crush for 4 years but had soul crushing deep eye contact every now and then.

“Umm, how come you are following everybody but no one’s following you on Instagram?”

People ask my friends about my personal life all the time.

Hate small talk

My boyfriend keeps on saying that I have an “exquisite set of eyes”

Never attends a party or a celebration but expects an invitation every time.

Thinks about sex, a lot.
