post public notices alerting patrons on the use of harmless atmospheric and/or lighting effects. Have a FAQ ready to hand out explaining the harmless contents etc, research studies and any possibly at-risk health risks (asthma or COPD sufferers) who may be the 1 in a billion to actually be affected. Short of shooting the complainers and whiners in the world on sight to end their and our misery--not much else you can do to better the situation except kick them outside where car ad bus exhaust is far more noticeable and actually dangerous. Some are so deeply stupid and ignorant that if they see smoking on a TV show they start complaining, wheezing and gasping like the insufferable twats they are.
