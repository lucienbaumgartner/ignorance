Bear in mind most of those LNs/ anime don't try to be anything but power fantasies with other genres attached like comedy or fanservice. They're okay if you feel like dumb fun. 

Slime started off as a genuinely funny and warm &amp; cozy adventure. The episode where &gt;!Rimuru names the Goblins and they were thrilled and ignorant of his inability to come up with good names, then the visual gag of all of them becaming handsome and beautiful overnight except one who never seems to realise nor care!&lt; are funny and clearly made with enthusiasm. 

I was disappointed how season 2 turned the villain into a joke after the fans had hyped it up. I get the series is power fantasy, but there's a lot of potential wasted even for something intended for turning off your brain. 

It's at an unsatisfying and middle ground of neither comedic enough nor serious enough. Serious arcs and villains are resolved far too easily, and the comedy has been hit and miss since the great start. 

SAO season 2 part 2 (mother's Rosario) and season 3 (Alicization) are way better than the first season and a half, which for the majority here would be your understanding of the series.
