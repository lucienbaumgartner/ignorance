I like this post...makes me think a bit...to me this is a question of teaching and misunderstanding. 

Does 'meditation' necessarily imply 'good meditation' or 'correct concentration'? Is it whatever happens when you sit still and watch your mind? 

At least in the second article, almost every 'finding' that is described is based on a misuse of terms, or bad practice methods. There is no doubt a misconception that is widespread about what concentration and mindfulness is...and it tends to err on the side of becoming exclusively attentive and unaware. That combined with a misconception of 'emptiness' as a nihilistic void rather than the impermanent and composite nature of our reality, and 'detachment' rather than 'non-attachment'....becoming despondent and shut off rather than fully engaged with life and one's own self in an equanimous way...is certainly a recipe for suffering.

It's like in the car metaphor...you drive it, know when it's running well, know when it needs service, bring it to the mechanic...if the mechanic is bad because his instruction manual is bad and he is a novice for example...he might make the car worse! That doesn't mean 'the science' of mechanics and car maintenance itself is risky...it's when it is performed wrong.
