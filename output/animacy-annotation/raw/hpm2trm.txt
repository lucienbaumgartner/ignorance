&gt; At least, I assume you're not offering sacrifices in your backyard. If you aren't offering sacrifices and bringing all the different tithes, you're not really fully observing the Torah.

This is how it almost always goes with people who are against God's ways. If I had a nickle for every time I heard the "sacrifices in your backyard" comment, I could buy something substantial. People say that I should be doing something that is **against God's Torah** and since I don't do things that are **against Torah** then I'm not observing Torah. I really don't understand the logic. Perhaps it comes from people not reading about God's ways. 

&gt; You also failed to recognize the inherent flaw in your own logic. Yes, we are granted into the NEW covenant - not the old covenant. We are not under the old Mosaic Law.

I had suggested that you look into the new covenant, to see what it is. Apparently you didn't look into it. Jeremiah is the first and most direct prophecy of God making a new covenant. This passage is quoted in Hebrews 8 and 10. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. **For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my Torah within them, and I will write it on their hearts.** And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”      Jeremiah 31:31-34

Hebrews 8 and 10 quotes this, saying exactly what the new covenant is, God's Torah (the "Mosaic Law") put within believers and written on believer's hearts. 

&gt; Lastly, you failed to address the verses from Galatians I posted. I could post many more from throughout the NT that deal with the law, not judging others with regards to diet and feast days, but I suspect that would be equally fruitless.

There a couple of important things to consider. Paul delighted in God's Law and said that "with my mind I serve the Law of God". In Acts 21 Paul completed a Nazarite vow to prove to the world that what was being said about him--that he was teaching people not to keep the Law--wasn't true and that he himself "lived in observance of the law". Did you know that Paul "lived in observance of God's Law"? Did you know that Paul fully intended to go to the Temple and make a sin sacrifice? We know from other passages in Acts that Paul was insistent that he return to Jerusalem for God's feast days. **Paul followed Torah**. 

Another point that can't be overlooked is the fact that Paul is the only Bible author that we have a warning about, that he is hard to understand. 

&gt; And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are **hard to understand**, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with **the error of lawless people** and lose your own stability.    2 Peter 3:15-17

Peter warns us to not misunderstand the things that Paul says, especially concerning God's Law. But Paul is always the go to for Lawless people. Nobody ever quotes the PRO Law things that Paul says. Nobody counts the number of times that Paul tells people to keep various Laws, and there are MANY. 

Contrary to what most people think, Paul didn't side with the man of Lawlessness, he said we should imitate Jesus....who followed the "Mosaic Law". 

&gt; If you want to follow the Law, then have fun I guess?

Thank you for granting me permission to walk in God's ways. I had been a little apprehensive about being obedient to God, but since you at least questioningly approve, I can be at ease about emulating Jesus. 

&gt; Just know that if you claim that you need it to have right-standing with God or even some sort of **blessed standing with God**
