* "History, teaches that the fratricide Romulus, from whom also the Romans are named, was born in adultery-; and that he made an asylum for himself in which he received insolvent debtors, fugitive slaves, homicides, and those who were worthy of death for their deeds. And he called to himself a certain number of such and called them Romans. From such nobility those are descended whom you call world-rulers, that is, emperors; whom we, namely the Lombards, Saxons, Franks, Lotharingians, Bavarians, Swabians, Burgundians, so despise, that when angry, we can call our enemies nothing more scornful than Roman-comprehending in this one thing, that is in the name of the Romans, whatever there is of contemptibility, of timidity, of avarice, of luxury, of lying: in a word, of viciousness. But because you do maintain that we are unwarlike and ignorant of horsemanship, if the sins of the Christians shall merit that you shall remain in this hard-heartedness: the next battle will show what you are, and how warlike we."

-- Liudprand of Cremona, emissary on behalf of Otto I (supposedly "Emperor of the Romans"), to the Emperor Nikephoros II, 960s 

Roman culture and titles were prestigious, and thus imitated and sought-after, but this wasn't the same as adopting an actual Roman identity, which the Germanic lords of the post-Roman West never did. "Roman" in fact remained a distinct legal category through the 8th and even into the 9th century, with Frankish and Lombard legal codes granting them fewer rights than their Germanic neighbours, to illustrate just how deep the division went. See Laury Sarti's *Frankish Romanness and Charlemagne's Empire* for a good overview of the issue in a Frankish context.
