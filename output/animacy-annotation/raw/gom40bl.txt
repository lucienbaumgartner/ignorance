Make sure to tell your mom three fundamental truths about weed: 1, it's not physically addictive. You can get addicted, but in the same way you can get addicted to soap operas or gambling. 2, it's less harmful than alcohol, nicotine, hell it's safer than red number 27(that being said, that one had Amaranth in it). While it can stunt brain development in people under the age of 23ish, it's better than getting whiskey and beer with the football bros or getting tequila and trulys with all the volleyball girls. 3, the stigma around marijuana is literally an advertising campaign for paper companies. Humans have been smoking weed since before the great wall of China was built, and it's only been considered medicinal, right up until the last century or two when people decided out of nowhere that inebriation of any kind was wrong(caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, amphetamines, narcotics, etc.). The fact that she's so upset makes her look foolish and ignorant. 

That being said, if your mom thinks you're a meth head, maybe it would be best to convince her to chill out for a minute and smoke weed for an hour. Show her the science of what tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) does to the human body, how it effects the brain and compare it to various other common vices(caffeine comes to mind for coffee and soda). Then show her what cocaine, meth, heroin and crack do to the human body. Let her come to her own decisions, and tell her that she doesn't get a say in how you live your life. She can try and help, she can support you, but it's not her life you're living so she needs to blow it out her ass of she's gonna keep trying this guilt trip "oh no you're a druggie" bullshit.
