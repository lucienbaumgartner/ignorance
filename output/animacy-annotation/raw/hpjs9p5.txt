its for the exact same reason weve all been told that our climate and planet is dying but none of us have made any effort to change our own lifestyles, pressure our politicians and corporations, or engage in discourse with our friends and family when they repeat demonstrably false things about these issues.



because it would make us uncomfortable to have to confront people we have relationships with, especially when we know its largely the most ignorant and unreasonable people that we have to confront.




we can just bitch at people online, feel like were doing something, but not actually risk any discomfort or change in our own relationships or lifestyles. we want other people to inform our friends and families. we want other people to call them out. were all too busy to engage with the most ignorant people in our lives. thats someone elses job.
