&gt; And condescending too. You'll have a job at The Verge before you know it.

My reply towards you has been explained above already. You’re unaware and ignorant about the individual and community responsibility when it comes fact-checking, preferring to conflate it with your disdain towards gaming websites.

That’s a dangerous and extreme way of thinking since it implies that you’re also disdainful and against fact-checking, and that you may be prone to dishonesty. Why else would you react that way? And why else would you react towards me?

Before you attempt to “judge” me, it’s best that you look yourself in the mirror. Simple as that.

Again, be better next time. And if you have nothing of value or worth to contribute in a discussion or conversation, then what’s the use of you joining one?

Good day. 👍🏻
