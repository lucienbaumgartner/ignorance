They want to fight for "independent rights".  I say label them as the enemy and give them what they want.

But sadly I also know that's what those in positions of power want:  a more divided country.

The US is a country where the lower and middle classes are completely unaware and ingorant of the fact that the higher class actively tries to divide them every single day, hour, and minute.  (see media channels) because the higher class are afraid of a unionized middle and low class.

If that ever happened the 1% wouldn't see another day in power and we would see a more socialized, more responsible country.  Unfortunately lack of education and political distractions keep the masses eyes, ears, and minds closed to all except talking heads that guide them through life.
