Sources on population size? Just use Google. They'll be your first results in bolded text. As for sources on theory, check out the Federalist papers in their entirety. I also suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government for a more complete view of the philosophic context. Reading those with the Constitution as a companion is the only way to go. Sorry that's kind of broad, but it really is necessary to understanding the US government. 

If you're looking for sources on the growth of the federal government... well, they're evident all over the place. If you really want I can send you some links that try to quantify its growth, but I hardly think that's necessary. 

I'm afraid you're missing my point. Corruption in the United Stats isn't about population size alone -- it's about each branch and level of government having specific powers and duties. Checks and balances. Federal, state, and local governments constantly pushing and pulling at each other to ensure that no faction, no part of government becomes tyrannical. Federalism. 

How populations are represented in federalism, and the abilities people have to control their governments at various levels, are essential to the a federalist government's functioning.

I'm not at all making excuses for the rotten state of US politics; I'm lamenting that Americans have allowed the unholy alliance of special interests, federal (in colloquial parlance) politicians, bureaucrats, and activist courts to eviscerate the Constitution and the rights that it guarantees. 

Most people on both sides of the aisle don't have the faintest idea what Federalism accomplishes, nor do they understand how seriously imperiled their liberties have become in its effective absence. Like the Podesta Wikileaks e-mails clearly state: "we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."
