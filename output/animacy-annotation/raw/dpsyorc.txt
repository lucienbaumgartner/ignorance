…it's because many women *want* to bang hot guys in their most attractive, fertile, youthful, and best years all while being "strong, independent, and sexually liberated."  

Later - they want to "settle" with the Nice Guy/Beta Provider Schmuck they ignored years ago and coerce/influence him into agreeability and supplication  - not because they TRULY want to, it's because they can no longer attract the men they *actually* desire. 

Most of the reasons men don’t like promiscuous women are outlined in the Original Post/Summary. 

The best reason for this conversation is that it helps men who are unaware and devoid of smart and solid male mentorship, leadership, and guidance. 

The one point of disagreement in the Original Post: 

*...I am assuming that the husband is actually both alpha and hot...*

I don’t see most true Alpha Men creating either lifetime or short-term attachments to known sluts. It’s contrary to Alpha Behavior. 

Regarding N-Count: virgin is best, barring that – a count of one to two is okay…three MAXIMUM, all of which occurred in Long-Term Relationships (LTRs). ANY sex outside of an exclusive relationship is suspect. A lot of women like to say: "oh…that didn’t count." That’s a Big NO-GO.

The caveats are as follows: She better be young (ages 18-20-ish), attractive (to the man’s preference), fertile, amenable to his ongoing life-program/goals, and very enthusiastic and dedicated to providing outstanding sex to this man over her lifetime. These women are salvageable. If she can’t – it’s a wash.
