Hmmm, I don't want to gang-up on one season; I'd rather be even-handed with the seasons, but then again, I haven't cut from this season yet, so might as well bite the bullet.

#In a land far, far, far away, beyond the Narrow Sea and the Seven Kingdoms, a trio of women played a social game of wits. 

These three witches churned their cauldron, as they muttered, “Double, double toil and trouble -- fire burn, and caldron bubble.” Of course, a Famous Fish *misquoted* the above line to say “boil, boil, toil, and trouble” but the quote remains apposite. The three witches possessed a majestic force, with beauty beyond compare. Many whispered about their status in legend, which weaved a tapestry of intrigue and ill-will in the land of blistering heat. **Although three men are labelled Friends and Comrades, three women are maligned as villains**. Three enchantresses with tresses that hid their ambition.

The leader was a tall woman whose golden locks and beguiling smiles commanded the hearts and minds of those who once underestimated her. A veritable **idol** and paragon, who stood like a Grecian statue above the fray. The second was a dark-haired conspirator, who leapt at the shadows and held the first **rock** to be cast onto the enemy. After all, she would betray anybody for one more day to play the game -- and she played to win. The third was a creature of pure **spectacle** and magic that scorch the earth upon which braceleted foes stood. Assisted with magic, the smallest of women can become a dragon.

While the underestimated leader and the magical spectacle have their believers and acolytes who will defend them to the ends of the earth, the dark-haired conspirator remains vilified, crucified to the stake of “playing to win”. After all, this witch *dared* to endeavour for the stars that only golden men and bounty hunters were allowed to reach. **Brawn and Friends can ask for collusion**, but a dark-haired girl *must* accept her allotted position and fall onto the savage sword. No matter the children who wait at home for her or her gentle smiles outside of the tribal arenas, a girl has no name.  To the stake, a girl must burn with the flames of her revilers. 

Indeed, the dark-haired conspirator dared to unseat the natural order. Armed with vim and verve, this girl approached the crone whom many consigned to the death-row’s lot. All but few had already determined that the crone would not outlast the many golden men with their savage swords. The crone was weak and unbeknownst to her, valuable to none. **But when the dark-haired girl asked the crone to work with her for a mutual benefit, the revilers screamed and declared that the girl must burn.** Whether the girl was right had little importance. Whether the crone herself *liked* the girl held even less significance. No, a girl must accepted her place in the shadows of men, and if she dares cast a stone, the witch must burn.

Later on, the crone regretted trusting the men with savage swords. When her favourite man heeded the words of the Egotist Goat, the crone fell into the cliffs and missed the final place of the stars. To the witch’s revilers, the crone whimpered that perhaps the witch was right: some men cannot be trusted. That sometimes, games must be played with the intention to win. **But nay, nobody would listen, because a savage sword is just, and a girl must never dare to presume.** Women with their simple brains behind dark locks do not comprehend that they must giggle, laugh, and resign to their fates.

Although a girl has no name, this dark-haired one once had a name that many could see. And her name… was **Brianna**.

#539. Brianna Varela (16th place, Guatemala) 

In this particular case, Brianna tried working with the older Lydia. However, Rafe and the Egotist Stepheme had control of Yaxhá, including Lydia’s own vote. Brianna scrambled and tried to get Lydia out. Because Brianna lacked the social finesse and *likeability* of other players ~~such as Ciera Eastin~~, **Brianna fell flat on her face and was never mentioned ever again**. What a truly pointless “witch”, and that entire Guatemala trio of premerge girls can easily get out of this rankdown without much tears. Rafe and Brian wielded their savage swords, the women fell into place, and in the end, the trio of girls went out consecutively. 

At least Lydia grew into her own person and started to play towards the end. She has that trait in common with several other players. Indeed, Lydia was likeable, fell onto the right side of every post-merge vote, and was ultimately cut because the Egotist Goat didn’t trust her. Thus is the story of Lydia, who was *far* more relevant than Miss “Make-Up” Varela. I mean, this girl is so ridiculous: she claims that she has manifold “social skills”, but unlike a Ciera, she doesn’t know when she should listen and play nice. **Truly irrelevant** and unaware and strategically inept. For example, **Exhibit A:**

[Do you need $285 wrinkle cream? Do you? Let’s be honest. You do!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvvnaAZEkX0) And I'll tell you why: that's my job! I sell women... what they don’t need. 

Do we need Brianna Varela in this Rankdown? Do we? Let’s be honest. We **don’t**! And I’ll tell you why: that’s my job! I sell rankers… that what they don’t need, **should be discarded with the trash**.

Brianna is basically [Tracey Davis] (https://www.harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tracey_Davis) from Harry Potter. Do you remember her? The answer speaks for itself.
