“I’m sorry I’m ignorant for not listening to a sub genre in my free time which I don’t enjoy”

No, you’re ignorant because you’re arguing about a topic that you admittedly don’t know anything about. I just can’t imagine being so self obsessed and ignorant that I tell people (who actually have knowledge on the subject) that they’re wrong about something I’m totally clueless on. What a fucking embarrassment, get a life.
