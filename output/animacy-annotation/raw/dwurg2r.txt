I can't find anything on the muscle density either so I retract that statement. Regardless, apes are shown to have greater power output than humans, which is the point I'm trying to make.

I'm not saying the sword would bounce off the gorilla like a rifle round ricocheting off a tank. But it's also not going to pierce through the gorilla enough to deal any kind of meaningful damage because that outcome demands several things to happen:

1. The knight has to be in position before the gorilla charges

2. The weapon has to be angled directly perpendicular to the gorilla's torso if there is to be even the slightest chance of a decent stab

3. The knight has to (as mentioned) have the strength to brace long and hard enough for physics to do the work and let the gorilla impale itself. If he can't hold the weapon in place, it'll cause at most an inch-deep wound that wouldn't kill the gorilla in a thousand years.

4. The gorilla has to be so enraged and unaware that it wouldn't simply slap the weapon away

5. The knight has to be 100% unwavering in the face of a wild animal twice his weight charging at him.

Those requirements put together make it virtually impossible for the knight to get in a good hit. I refer you again to the video linked, he has one chance and that's it. Once the distance has been closed no amount of dodging is going to save him. This is absolutely about physical strength because OP took away the one thing we definitively do better than other animals. He's putting the knight in a situation that the gorilla is more comfortable in.

Also, nice "aren't touch" stab there. Didn't realize arguing this point was such an angry matter for you.
