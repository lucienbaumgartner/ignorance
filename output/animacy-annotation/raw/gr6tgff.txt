No, not really. They just pretend that they existed when surgical methods and hormonal treatments/technology never permitted such a thing.

It's revisionist history just like everything the far left spins. Just like the false mythology that minimum wage used to support 3 kids, a wife, two cars and an upper middle class home with a white picket fence back in the 1950s. It's all so laughably stupid and ignorant that only someone born recently could possibly buy into it. Oh, and everyone used their secretaries as fuck puppets because men could just do that. They would say, "Hey doll, it's time to earn your pay!" and then they would fuck their brains out over the table. You know, how it was in the old days. *eye roll*

The only bullshit justification they're making for this is to assume that *cross-dressers* were actual transvestites. But last I checked I could throw on a bra if I wanted and I'm not a female. And/or they're just including anyone who *wanted* to be trans as *officially trans* which is a big leap.
