He's going to run out of low hanging fruit by just rolling back Trump's decisions.

And once he does he'll run into the same problem every American president runs into. A government filled with self serving career politicians looking to exploit their office.

And a nation filled with a people so divided and ignorant that half of them see working towards the greater good as something bad. And the other half feels virtually no responsibility towards fixing that status quo beyond whining about it and insisting they shouldn't be associated with the rest of their countrymen.

Biden's not going to fix that in four years.
