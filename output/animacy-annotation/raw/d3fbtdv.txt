Also, it is not a matter of "saving you." 
It's far more complicated.
The Ael'Kayeen claim ownership of the human genome in much the same way you humans might claim ownership to a gene sequence used in the treatment of say... Cystic Fibrosis, for example.
The counter argument is that your species has developed *beyond* ownership. That you are **not** *property* despite your accelerated evolution by the "plaintiff."

We reptilians and our allies took great pains to put an end to human slavery despite its horrific cost in human life as well as the vulnerability caused by the loss of states rights, **knowing** full well that it only opened up a greater opportunity for the Ael'Kayeen to direct the enslavement of humanity through orchestrated national debts via a corrupt international banking system.

We had hoped the influences of people like your Andrew Jackson would have prevented this occurrence or at least put it off for a few more years, until your technological development could allow you to use an information based, algorithmic currency, rather than one the banks could control or influence.

That did not happen in time.
And such a currency here is in its early infancy and vulnerable to say the least.

So things changed.
 The current argument submitted before the Assembly is no longer that humans enslave each other through iron chains by those without conscience---but rather---through debt from an essentially valueless artificially created money supply.

The argument is, that it is in your *natural nature* to be enslaved and dominated by the crowning genetic achievement of their research and development, that is to say, humans without conscience; which the Assembly views as an entirely different subspecies than the majority of you.

Understand that whether you willingly allow yourselves to be enslaved, or accept the mantle worn by the masters of slaves, it doesn't matter by what means such slavery is devised... By such acceptance, you forfeit the right to be free creatures yourselves, and with it all birthrights associated with being born upon this world.

In other words, you can become property.

For the purposes of auditing the human species, and to make this name available in familiar language, I will call the sociopath *Homo Toxicus* so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

The overwhelming majority of the human species would, by comparison, be akin to something like *Homo Somnius:* in that you are sleeping, underdeveloped, unaware, and inferior.

The globalized feminization of the male of the species guarantees that there shall be no violent or risky opposition. 

In other words, you are being both castrated and fattened for the slaughter.

If you do not take a stand against this human subspecies, and their plans for global dominance, you will be harvested.

Hundreds of millions of you **will** be pulled into the void, and vanish without a trace.
