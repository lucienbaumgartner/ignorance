This is anecdotal and not really answering OP’s question of “why?”

Likewise as the above comment, but to add, my eyes aren’t wide open while sleeping, but partly. I found out when my cousins told me (sleeping on the couch in the living room and others had gotten up already; confirmed by my roommates the next week).

The weird thing is my eyeballs will track any movement; my cousins walked around and my eyes followed them; my roommates moved a pen and my eyeballs followed the tip of the pen. All along, I was asleep and unaware of any of this happening.

I now wear a good-quality eye mask which stays on some days when I don’t twist and turn too much in bed. Otherwise, it is on my forehead or side of my head. 🤷‍♂️
