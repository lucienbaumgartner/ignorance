The driver of her car that crashed was intoxicated by alcohol and under the effects of prescription drugs (anti-depressants and anti-psychotics), was solely responsible for the crash as he was also driving at a very high rate of speed (65 MPH in a 30 MPH zone, ergo 2x the speed limit) and none of the passengers were wearing seat belts.  This is why she died.  It wasn't some terrible conspiracy.  Assertions otherwise are delusional and ignorant of the actual facts and circumstances.  Everyone knows what they're getting into when they marry into the royal family.  Some handle it well and others not so much.  By all appearances Ms. Markle is a grifter and an opportunist.  Prince William chose wisely.  Harry, not so much.
