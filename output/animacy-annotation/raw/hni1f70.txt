Bullshit.  Women are exploited, discriminated against, and held in contempt in Islamic society. 


And you are obviously so completely and utterly brainwashed and ignorant, that you are unable to see that you have been enslaved.  

It’s sad.  Honestly.  

And shameful.  

But you keep right on supporting oppression.  It’s your right to exercise your religion, and brainwash your sisters into slavery.
