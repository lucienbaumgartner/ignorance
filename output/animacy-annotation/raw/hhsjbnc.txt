This isn't anywhere close to true. This is so wildly ahistorical and ignorant of modern Africa that I don't even really know where to start.

Most of Africa didn't have independence until 1960 and many of them still don't. Why didn't they have independence? Capitalist imperialists. Many of these independence movements were destroyed by capitalists for the express purpose of \*preventing liberal democracy in order to maintain wealth extraction for capitalists\*. Not even fighting socialism, but literally preventing the system they benefited from so they could steal more.  This isn't some distant memory either France the US  England Germany and more all have bombed or invaded African countries within the past thirty years. I can't find an instance of Chinese military operations in Africa outside of small UN peacekeeping and arms sales.

China has 1 military base in all of Africa the same number as Canada, the US alone has 29 nearly every European country has at least one if not more.

China just simply hasn't had the time to do anything like you're describing. The 60s through the early 90s they kinda had their own shit to deal with. Recently they've been \*trying\* to do the shit Europe and the US did for the past century, but Africa seems kinda hesitant to engage (weird right, almost like they learned lessons from the past). Hell, BELGIUM ALONE HAS DONE MORE TO AFRICA THAN CHINA HAS.

At worst China has been trying to do dept-trapt diplomacy as the west had done in the 80s-00s, but it's not really working. Do you know how many democracies the west has overthrown in Africa since the 60s? Dozens. China? None. Bombs dropped? None.

Read some history books and stop making the basis of your understanding of the world "us vs them".
