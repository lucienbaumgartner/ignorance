My daughter has been missing for months but I am not gonna tell anyone about it. I’m just gonna keep partying. When I can’t perpetuate the lies any longer I’ll admit she’s been kidnapped by the made up nanny. Then I’ll send investigators hunting down someone that didn’t exist. Except that person did exist, was completely innocent and unaware of what was happening and I slandered her name. Oh help me find my missing daughter but first let’s drive to a bunch of bullshit places across Orlando wasting more of investigators time looking for her. And when I’m done giving the investigators the run around, I’ll go back inside my house and delete all the search history on my computer about the homemade chloroform and painless death research. Then my daughter’s decomposed corpse is later found nearby, practically in my backyard. And then I’ll have sex with my expensive lawyer. After hundreds of other lies and deception I’ll get away with murder. Casey Anthony is nothing more than a clever turd wrapped in soft skin.
