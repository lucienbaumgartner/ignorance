I think all your opinions are just as valid. It’s an important piece of literature that is still discussed today thus making it completely valid. The characters are flawed and unaware that they’re in the wrong but that were a lot of people at the time who had these same beliefs. I don’t think their voices deserve to shunned just because they were wrong. They believed in this way of life because it was all they knew. From a historical standpoint, it’s important to read the book. I will warn, there are heavy instances of loyalty that the slaves felt for their masters that is hard to swallow but like I said, this is what they knew. It’s important to read about that just as well.
