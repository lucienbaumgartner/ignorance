imagine if it was normal for parents to teach all of these concepts to their children as they grew and developed.  


to me, that is the bane of this society - the disconnect of learned experience between adults and children  


everybody who grows up seems to have to go into totally unprepared and unaware of ANYTHING that they should know, even though ALL OF THEIR PARENTS - KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT, their parents have LIVED IT (hence being able to afford to "raise" or at least provide for them)   


but then again, parents just don't have enough time in the day? surely that's some bullshit, but there ARE STATS showing that there are fewer opportunities a day to spend QUALITY time (teaching) your kids   


both parents work. both parents are TIRED when they get home from work. both parents need to have DOWN TIME for their own sanity and safety.   


if we could save money on monthly POWER BILLs - by seeking the installation of SUSTAINABLE and naturually replenishing ENERGY SOURCES  - we can free up some of our parents time - and then they can then begin to teach their children.... AND THEN WE HAVE COMPETENT ADULTS AGAIN! YAAAAYYYY
