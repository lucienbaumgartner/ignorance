But men like to cum in people's mouths, so whatever residuals are there in the urethra will end up in the mouth. Also the seminal fluid that comes before that you ingest during a blowjob has those residues, it's inevatible. I think you missed my point. 

I am not just calling him dumb and moving on because that's a very immature way of dealing with factually false statements. But if you draw their attention that both men and women anatomy is not designed to shoot rainbows and be germ free, probably he'll understand that a) getting dirty with someone implies mixing fluids/ bacteria regrdless of gender and if you don't like it, refrain from sex without shaming said anatomy, and b) villanizing women anatomy like men are some perfectly built machineries and hiding behind that just because he doesn't want to give head is disingenious and ignorant. That was my point
