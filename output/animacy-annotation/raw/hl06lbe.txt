but its not apologistic and ignorant of the problem.

It is exactly admitting the problem and offerign a solution.

yes l2 is not perfect jet. far from perfect. BUt its also crazily new thing that rollups exist at all.

CDC already offers a direct bridge to arbitrum.

Arbitrum is still in beta but already working.

Optimism the same, and every major exchange will soon have a bridge to both of them.

Uniswap is moving to Optimism

Developers can DEvelop on Rollups too and benefit from the cheaper fees.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes its all nto a perfect solution jet but it can help alot and its just beginning.

Sure other chaisn have cheaper fees on L1. But how does it help when there is next to no ecosystem supportign L1.
