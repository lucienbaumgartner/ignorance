First off I've been a doctor for 4 years.  You could have seen this if you knew how context works instead of looking at subreddits.

Second, your response is exactly the problem. You are so very egotistical and unaware that you can't see that literally no one has dismissed your experience at a single point in this thread. You read it that way because you take any disagreement with you as a disagreement with the entirety of your argument instead of parts of it.

So yes. You are a bigbheaded dumb cunt
