Hey guys, I'm not gonna pretend that my pain is anywhere near the grief of those of you that have served, but these last few weeks have been crushing for me in my own small way. I was a little kid when the towers fell and within weeks my father was off on his first of 5 deployments to that theater. I grew up talking with him on the sat phone every once in awhile and laying awake staring at the ceiling wondering if he was coming home or if I was going to see his head cut off on the news. My dad survived unscathed, but I know so many dads and moms, sons and daughters, husbands and wives didn't.
  

  
20 years later my little brother is an officer in the Air Force and my best friend from high school is a infantry officer in the Marines. It's been wretched to see so much of what my father struggled with come to pass and to know the horrors that will follow, but I had some solace that at least they wouldn't be going back to the same place our fathers did. It's been difficult to talk to even close friends because people have just grown so utterly detached and unaware of even the simplest aspects of our involvement. We reflexively lean on these pithy opinions about our involvement that don't capture the complexity or daily horror.
  

  
Yesterday some warriors who were better men or women than I will ever be, some warriors who weren't even old enough to look at the TV and see the towers fall, gave the last full measure of devotion to shield tens of thousands of innocents with their lives.
