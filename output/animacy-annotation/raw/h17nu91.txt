At the minimum, your husband needs grief counseling and you and both need to schedule a visit with an obstetrician so the OB can explain to him on direct, small, simple words that he is wrong and ignorant of how pregnancy works. 

Lashing out when he is grieving is somewhat normal, although clearly not healthy or acceptable.  He needs to see a grief counselor and apologize to you directly for wrongly blaming you and lashing out.  

If your husband has a history of lashing out like this, you have a bigger problem, but if this is a change from his typical behavior, I would also suggest marriage counseling for both of you.  

Of course it should not be necessary for you to drag him to the doctor to tell him the obvious, but ... man, people are weird about how pregnancy is viewed.  Family folklore and attitudes get sublimated and "everyone knows" that X or Y is bad for the baby.  I once had a friend tell me I couldn't do anything that needed me to put my arms over my head because "the cord will wrap around the baby's neck and strangle it".  This friend was as certain of that truth as he was that the sun comes up in the east.  Nothing I said could remotely budge his opinion.  

Your husband clearly has some kind of similar misapprehension about how pregnancy works, that he picked up somewhere when he was quite young.  It's going to take a pretty significant level of authority figure to counter it. Yes, it is bullshit.  But humans aren't exactly always rational.  

All that being said... 

I am so very sorry for your loss. I hope you are recovering.  Good luck.
