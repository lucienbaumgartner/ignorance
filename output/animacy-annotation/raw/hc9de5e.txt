Agree with everything except the disclaimer - not really aimed at you, but aimed at everyone who seriously thinks this way:

You can criticize the execution a relationship of ANY sexuality, whether you yourself are straight, gay, bi, asexual or else. Being the same sexuality as a fictional character doesn't give you special privileges of critiquing that said character - it would, however, make you look biased depending on how much your critique is/isn't based on objective observation and evidence.

By the same logic, you can criticize a character that is either of different skin color or ethnic race while you yourself are of a different skin color/ethnic race than the character. E.g. I myself am Serbian, and if an American is criticizing a Serbian fictional character due to how their whole personality is based around their ethnicity and if stripped away, they are basically a shell of a person, I wouldn't automatically say that they are discriminatory of Serbs simply because that would be pretty stupid and ignorant of me to say - it would really make me no different than the person who made that pinned post on the FNKI subreddit about "not getting same sex relationships if you're not ok with Bumbleby".

Apologies for going off topic!
