Common sense is just the set of prejudices and biases one has by the time they turn 18. 

Labeling everything you don't like 'wokeism' so you can remain ignorant and biased, all the while maintaining a sense of intellectual superiority and the moral high ground is the social experiment conservatives are running. Not the other way around.
