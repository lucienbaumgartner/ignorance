This - and more - is essentially what I try to explain to people. Our incentivization model for the politicians are just completely wrong.

Most people are very unaware and uneducated when pertaining to basic economics (I was included in this group until this year when I started studying economics on my own) 

So the politicians can cite things like "boosting the economy" , "efficiency/productivity" blah blah and completely ignore the long term issues and negative externalities (happiness cost, culture costs etc)  --- and people WILL buy it.  

The negative externalities usually take it's shape/form years later. Politicians don't care about that because they can't make policy for the long term benefit of the country cause most of the time people wont understand it and/or  it will look like the work of the NEXT politician that is in power
