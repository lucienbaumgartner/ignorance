I think you are speaking way too much for your self here. You could’ve pointed out everything you just said as reasons to consider the pros and cons, but your experience is not the same as OP. 

Just because you’ve found success with covid doesn’t mean it hasn’t devastated many of us. I’ve been here since freshman year and my grades have also suffered. As have many of my very intelligent friends. Everyone responds to isolation differently and this has literally been a devastating experience. I think you should stop being so self centered on a post asking for help and advice. You sound very privileged and unaware of it entirely
