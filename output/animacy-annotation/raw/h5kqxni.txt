YTA. The 8 year old probably doesn’t really like all the things you think she does; she’s trying to make you like her unlike the “boring” older sister you have already rejected.  Youre training your youngest to be a people pleaser. And side note YOU CANT JUST LEAVE YOUR KID WITHOUT TELLING THEM!  Unfortunately, it’s human nature, but you’re just really selfish and unaware of the impact it’s having on your family.
