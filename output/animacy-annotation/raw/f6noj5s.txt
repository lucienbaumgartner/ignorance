&gt;I think it's just the gaming crowd is more on the young/naive side and can't relate or empathize with people who "play games for a living".

That's exactly what I thought as well.

I can't imagine(I actually can, but it's still surprising) grown up people being so narrow minded and ignorant that they truly believe people don't deserve empathy just because they earn a lot of money for what seems like an easy job.

There's a reason many streamers and content creators go on pretty lengthy breaks. And some never return. Same with actors and musicians. You're in the spotlight constantly and you have the eyes and ears of hundreds of thousands of people, simply having two or three extra zeros in your account doesn't cancel out the effect that can have on a person. As has been proven countless times.
