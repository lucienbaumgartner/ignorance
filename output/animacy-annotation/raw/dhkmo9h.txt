Not the guy who rammed the shit out of him and could've easily avoided the wreck? What stupid fucking perspective and reasoning you have. The guy is 1 foot over a line you nunce. Oh yeah that means you can just floor it into him. The other car obviously did not even see the cyclist. The car is 100% the at fault party for being completely unaware and incompetent and ramming oncoming traffic. If you think the cyclist is at fault please set fire to your car so I never have to share the road with you in my own car. You're going to kill someone.
