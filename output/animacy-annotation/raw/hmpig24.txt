What if one of the denizens we're a sole survivor, unaware of the fact that his family and friends were dead, and unaware of the passage of time kept alive by the magics of the beasts, but as each one dies he ages from childhood to adulthood until eventually he's a 100 year old human on his death bed in the ruins of his home? He remembers everyone while the other villagers forget, and with every passing encounter he becomes more frantic.
