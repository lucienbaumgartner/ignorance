I'm going to get downvoted for this, but I don't care.

If you are so unbelievably out of touch, insensitive, and unaware that you think it's okay to serve your son's mother divorce papers on his birthday, you shouldn't have custody of him.

You claim 

&gt;Only thing which have kept me sane is my little one. My country thinks custody of a baby under age of five should be given to their mother. And by my knowing of her, she wouldn't let me have any custody of child. Now when my son will turn 5, I can finally go to court for divorce and custody. 

If you cared about this boy, you'd never destroy his birthday and every birthday for the rest of his life by forcing him to remember the anniversary of the day his father asked his mom for a divorce. 

If you were a decent parent you would have known this intuitively. But you didn't. 

It didn't even occur to you. 

When you said

&gt;But honestly, I am still in love with my wife and maybe it can open her eyes and save our relationship.

I suddenly saw your whole motivation -- you're creating this drama because you foolishly think it will shock your wife into loving you again.

You're using the kid and his birthday as leverage and you've chosen a time when your wife will be less able to protect her son from a man who would do that.



&gt;She started spending most of her time at her office.

I'm not surprised. 

&gt;When i tried to communicate with her about our relationship, she involved both of our family in this mess and i was labled as a sexist who is jealous of my wife's growth and wants to sabotage her.

You should consider the fact that the problem may be you.

I think that's a real possibility.
