No offense, but teenagers these days just make me sad. It's like all they lost that rebellious teen spirit. All they seem to think about is memes. It also seems like they don't have any initiative. Just being a bystander in their own life. Do what they are told, follow the path laid out.
  

  
I'm in my 30s and while teens were always kind of dumb, shallow, and unaware of how dumb they are (myself included), we used to have more rebelliousness. It was like we wanted to fight the system rather than just passively follow it. Where did the teen spirit go?
  

  
Anyway, this is just my personal anecdotal 2 cents. I know it doesn't apply to every individual but I hope I made some sense about what I see as a general trend. What do you think?
