Just a note; many people are vitamin D deficient in winter and rebound in the warmer months without supplementation. Many people are also vitamin D deficient and completely unaware and unaffected. 

However, severe vitamin D deficiency can cause tiredness and irritability so supplementation in a *diagnosed* case of vitamin D deficiency can be of benefit. People shouldn't just take supplements willy nilly.
