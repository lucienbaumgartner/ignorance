They live those few hours likely in pain, probably unable to breathe on their own and unaware of anything. Also they probably can't see as well. So you'd rather they have a few hours of suffering, for both the baby and the parents, rather then prevent all that by making abortion accessable? 
I'm curious now on your opinion on medically assisted death, do you think every life is worth living, just because it's life? Even if that life is constant suffering?
