ADHD or not, that doesn't make what he did ok!  Just like being drunk doesn't excuse you, neither should having ADHD.  His ADHD doesn't prohibit him from taking responsibility for his actions. ADHD doesn't MAKE you do anything. It might make you pre-occupied and unaware of something but it doesn't lessen the severity or impact of his actions.
