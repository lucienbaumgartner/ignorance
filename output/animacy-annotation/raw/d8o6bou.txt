I still think w33ha is a little shit. And that's my opinion to have. As it is people's right to like him. 


And regardless of how much a dick Puppy is or isn't, EE totally pulled a massive MASSIVE bitch move by just putting Puppy on blast like that. Especially when EE is the most socially unaware and awkward week who can't understand social interactions. He can go ahead and bash the organizers, the companies, evil rich Kemal, but he's definitely a little cunt after that.
