No, both suffer. Nobody is arguing otherwise. 

 However, If I had to choose between having the skin of my fingers and toes slowly peeled off while red hot prod are inserted into my eye holes before being beaten and stabbed and set ablaze, I think I’d prefer some dirty cocks to penetrate me for a while and leave me with the psychological trauma.

At least then I’d be alive and get to choose how to seek revenge or how to live the rest of my life.

If you think women have had it worse during wartime, you’re sadly mistaken and unaware of the horrors men have endured for thousands of years. 

Generally the men are brutally tortured and killed while the women are raped and left to raise children who will be more sympathetic and loyal to the invading nation, as they grow up with the understanding of being a part of them.

That’s the just of “Divide and conquer”.
