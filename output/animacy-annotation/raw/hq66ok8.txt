you should think about nuance and context. i recommend looking at her tiktok to hear the stories about how she almost killed herself trying to get feminization procedures and knows many people who did die before these procedures became available. obviously her opinions are ignorant and harmful, but i think it’s lost on a lot of young people that she’s not an old bigot, she’s someone from a different and much more dangerous time. writing her off is erasing queer history which we cannot do.
