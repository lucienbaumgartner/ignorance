This is all delusional idiocy. You're writing this under some assumption that dumb people are like one in a hundred and when they speak up, everyone around them can "correct" them. But that's completely divorced with reality.

I mean seriously "In the past the dumb were surrounded by people who corrected them or let them know they were wrong" ? How absurdly ignorant and uneducated can you be to actually write this drivel. Historically, when a dumb person said something dumb, something like jews being evil or a witch needing to be burned or that potatos are toxic - *they were fuckin patted on the back and assisted by endless hoards of similar morons*. Hell, the witch thing in particular was ignorant people fearing the rare person who had a shred of intelligence. 

So no, its not a new development. Its always been like that, and ironically enough, your own delusional ignorance is also from staying in the exact same kind of echo chambers that pat you on the back for your "smart" views..
