I mean, they are. It’s objectively true. They were bred that way. Just like retrievers love the water and retrieving things, fighting dogs love fighting. And yes, Pits are fighting dogs. Doesn’t mean they’re all horrible dogs, doesn’t mean an owner who is responsible and knows what they’re doing can’t keep one under control, but to say they aren’t aggressive is simply ignorant and factually incorrect. You can see in every video of a pit attack, they aren’t angry, they aren’t scared, or defending themselves, they’re wagging happily and excited. They’re doing what they were bred to do.

All this nonsense with calling them “pibbles”, or “nanny dogs”, or “velvet hippos” is dangerous, because it encourages people who can’t handle a dog like that to get one, thinking they’re just poor and misunderstood, and that people are just “racist” against the breed. It’s irresponsible to misrepresent the breed that way.

I don’t think they should be banned necessarily, but they should be controlled and only responsible, experienced owners should be allowed to have them. The breed standards should also be changed, breed out the aggression and high prey drive, the bite strength, the tenacity, and the love of fighting. We, as a society, have decided making dogs fight for our entertainment isn’t ok, so why are we still breeding fighting dogs?

Inb4 downvotes and people calling me ignorant. My mother is a very experienced and respected dog breeder, has been the president of her breed club in my country, and I promise has forgotten more about dogs than most people know. She watches Caesar Milan and points out what he’s doing wrong. I’ve had dogs my entire life, helped train them, been going to dog shows and other events for decades.
