Kratz will not be so bothered about intentionally manipulating and being complicit in a cover up.  He will see at as him being clever and superior.  I've never known a narcissist to think anything other.  You can see this in the way he vehemently defends himself in those e-mails, he has no concience and no acceptance that he has done anything wrong.  Quite the opposite, these women should feel grateful for his attention.

he will be concerned about being prosecuted but I believe he is immune as a prosecuter?  Plus lying and twisting evidence seems to be accepted practice.

MTSO, unaware and incompetent does not wash with me for a second.  You can't be 'unaware' of something you have been clearly told.  Refusing to have the bones properly studied, refusing to step back etc, etc, these are deliberate actions.  MTSO as a whole will be happy to take incompetence as a defence I agree, but I believe they were acting will full awareness, entitlement and arrogance, how could it be anything other?  I agree it appears malicious in nature.  What disturbs me is it seems so natural to them, and they don't even think they have to do a good job at covering it up.
