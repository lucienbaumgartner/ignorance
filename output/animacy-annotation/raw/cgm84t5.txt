1. C employs B, and orders B to steal the car.
2. C employs B, and does not order B to steal the car.

In the first, C &amp; B are liable.  In the second, only B is liable.  C is liable in the first, because he's a participant in the crime.

&gt; In your example, we can only hold C liable for being a careless buyer.

I dissagree.  My example, " C pays B to steal" C wasn't a careless buyer (i.e. neglect), he knew he was a participant in the crime.

However, if we consider a careless buyer example - if C were careless and unaware that the car was stolen, then the car is still A's property.  A is a victim of B's theft.  C is a victim of B's fraud.  In this scenario C may have some small liability for neglect.

&gt; My dilemma though is that if A hired C to do a job or A was shopping in Cs store when B attacked, then C is liable, because A only knows C and B is an unknown factor to A. C should have had the foresight and knowledge that B would attack. Complicated indeed.

I didn't understand your example.  Try slowing this one down?
