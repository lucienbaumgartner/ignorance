&gt; I'm not sure if it's actually happening, or a Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, but I've been noticing a lot more relation"shipping" by fandoms lately.

This is absolutely just you having been oblivious and ignorant of a widespread element of fandom. It's pretty easy to argue that modern Star Trek only exists because of shipping, including slash - it was the fans and fanzines that brought the show back, and they did it through the power of Kirk/Spock.
