Okay, so you're racist and ignorant of the constitution. People have the right to carry in these places, correct? And they are not acting with the intent to cause others harm/to feel uncomfortable?  

So you're saying that you want others to not do something they have a right to because you have prejudices/fears? Fears are based, normally, in severe ignorance of the thing/people being feared.

So, at it's core, your ignorance means other people cannot exercise their rights?
