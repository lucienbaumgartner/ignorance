&gt; Gaming is great now too. I'll even go far to say that in general it is much better now than it used to be

Well. You are wrong.

**Gaming LOOKS better but gaming is NOT better**

Resident evil 4 had enemies that had different move sets, scythe ganados would toss the weapon, pitch fork wielders did the long reach stab, dynamite tossers were a thing, unarmed ganados which would chase you with out streched arms... Very good stuff. On gamecube. 

So much replayability too. The chapter scores encouraged better performance. Mercenaries was fun as fuck.

**You could even shoot the dynamite on the belt or hands of those explosive carrying ganados.. On gamecube**

Resident Evil Village.

The enemies will lazily take some side steps before charging you. They may stop and do a leaning in glare at you. Welcome to ps5.

Should I add Leon had MMA moves? Ethan has a shitty counter that looks un natural and "jank" as fuck because its a poorly animated outstretched kick that should by all rights do fuck all.

Love the bonus content. Follow the map and shoot what pops up. 

**Yup. Game design and gameplay has sure gotten better**

Final Fantasy 7

After a 3 hour romp through midgar you are introduced to an expansive world. You need a car, a boat and a plane to navigate it all. So many secrets to uncover. Optional bosses and characters to find as well as side activites and encounters. Well designed world.

**In the thing they call a remake you only go from one end of the map to the other. All secret bosses are in one location there are no optional characters and nothing of value to find really. Of course the story isnt even complete either after being neutered and bastardized by a hack director and his fan fiction shounen trope BS**

Games LOOK better. Many games have drastically decresed in mechanics, gameplay and story... I dont even know how you can argue this. 

**Games from 2002 and 1997 have more gameplay, story and mechanics than games do on modern consoles. What past games dont have is graphics and I dont play things like Shovel Knight or Undertale for fucking graphics. Graphics should be the icing on a completed cake.**

"better now than it used to be"

Fucking hell what a grossly ignorant and blatantly wrong thing to say. There are plenty more than these two examples too. 

**We can get into how sims 2 is better than sims 4**

**Battlefield 2042 sure is living up to its predecessors**

Tales of Arise.

**No grade shop, no open world, no... anything from past tales games and has a far more simplified and unrewarding story than that of Berseria. Just another Point A of the map to Point B and most collectibles you will find without even trying. Not even a character called Aifreed. A series fucking staple.**

This is why content and mechanics are getting worse. Fools praising mediocrity because it looks pretty.

&gt;GaMiNg Is BeTtEr ThEsE dAyS

Such an asinine statement.
