It was pushed by the people in power immediately following WWII in most powerful countries. Almost all of those countries had leaders that were on the left side of the spectrum and after the horrors done to the Jews were revealed, these leftists didn't want to be associated with that. So the narrative was that it was right wing despite people on the right typically wanting to restrain government control over their life and it was never challenged to any real extent. The Communists were worse by every measurable degree, but we can't let those facts become widely known now, can we? 

I digress, but the short answer is that it was inconvenient to tell the truth. Instead, they point out vague differences like "central planning" vs "corporate state". Is the governing body controlling the means of production and dictating how people need to live their life? Congratulations, you're on the left. But when you approach your political views as "socialism" being a moderate position then anything to the right of that is far right because nothing further right than socialist can work within the confines of socialism. Notice how there are no facist states left? Only Communist ones, and even those are a dying breed?

The left always changes what their moral outcry is depending on culture and whatever the elites want to drum up and it usually involves dehumanizing whoever is on their hit list "for the good of the people" and the right is too busy being willfully ignorant and too scared to do anything that might make life a bit more difficult. This is an old fight that has been going on since the dawn of civilization. It gets new names, new labels, new enemies, and new technology, but it's the same fight every time. People refuse to use their eyes and listen to what their ears tell them in favor of making the same mistakes our grandfathers did.
