I’m starting to hope (but not really believe in) a Law of Conservation of Consciousness, guessing most people would call that souls, and something like reincarnation, here or anywhere else in the universe that supports life or getting to do ride alongs in other people’s heads. I don’t need a paradise, I’m just used to existing so I would like to keep doing it in some form or another. May not get to keep memories, which might be for the best, leave your baggage with your last meat suit, but it would be nice to think you get to go on. I try to tell myself that sleep is a nightly warm up for the real thing, but I don’t really like going to sleep as it is, and it’s always under the assumption that I’m waking up in a few hours. Anyway, finger crossed to die old and unaware that it was coming.
