You can support, oppose, agree, or disagree with any of these things and still be lib. You just have to oppose government intervention in the issue, for or against. 

Not to mention, everyone's opinions on individual issues are unique. Someone can be absolutely against any government intervention in everything except specifically, say, animal abuse laws, regulations, and punishments and despite having that one auth position they will still be overall extremely libertarian.

Stereotyping a person based on one opinion they hold is both unfair and ignorant.

That being said, much like the watermelons, there absolutely are blue lemons.
