Look, I love animals, especially puppers, I volunteer at the shelter where we adopted one of our pups and I'm constantly wanting to bring home every animal on the planet, but if my fiance came home tomorrow with another dog (we have 2) I would tell him to take it right back to where it came from. Your pets deserve a relaxed happy full life and they are not going to get that with you at this point. They need homes elsewhere. It is NEVER ok to gift someone a pet if they are unaware and unprepared. Pets are not toys and he's treating them like they are.
