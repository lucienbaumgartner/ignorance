plot twist, Islam is a politics. Muhammad was a slavemaster and wrote the koran because no one translated the holy text into Arabic at the time. the slavemaster inserted his selfish desire into the text. Islam is a story built on slavery, people captures were forced to convert, those who did not felt the weight the jizya or tax implemented on them, others had no choice if they wanted a higher social status. Bragging that islam has 1.8billion followers is like a slave plantation bragging about its workforce being diverse.

Islam, plaguing and enslaving Africa for almost 2 millenniums. Putin and China will have to pick a side because a lot of non Muslims in Africa hate islam for the genocide they bring to the continent. 




&gt;One of the most commonly invoked argument by political online groups (alt-right, tankies, nationalists etc...) is that the NATO intervention of 2011 is responsible for the country's instability and concerning rise in slave markets. I would like to tackle this talking point in order to clarify what actually caused all of this.

 

&gt;Who are these slaves?

 

&gt;The slaves are usually Sub-Saharan African immigrants or asylum seekers that have fled instability or impoverishment. Some of these immigrants wanted to go to Libya and stay there, while for others, Libya was just a station on the way to the real final goal: Italy (or southern Europe, in general). Keep the latter in mind, as this will be important later on.

 

&gt;How exactly is Gadaffi to blame for all of this if these slave markets appeared after his death, and how exactly did his policies contribute to this mess?

 

&gt;The answer is simple: There was already widespread persecution and enslavement of immigrants before the NATO intervention of 2011. There was simply less reporting involved around the matter due to restrictive policies that made it difficult for anyone to investigate thoroughly under the presence of Gadaffi's police state. However, the research was always there. We had reports of slavery being a huge issue in the region since 1996.

&gt;Gaddafi’s Libya also regularly brought slaves back from its “adventures” in other African countries (Claiborne, 2011). Speaking of the Gaddafi-supported Arab supremacist terror campaigns in Sudan and Mauritania, Jeff Jacoby wrote in the Boston Globe, April 2, 1996, “Tens—maybe hundreds—of thousands of black Africans have been captured by government troops and freelance slavers and carried off into bondage. Often they are sold openly in ‘cattle markets,’ sometimes to domestic owners, sometimes to buyers from Chad, Libya and the Persian Gulf states.[1]

&gt;According to a massive study from Sara Hammod (American university of Cairo, 2006), Gadaffis police state contributed heavily to this predicament as they would capture immigrants and facilitate them to slavery auctions/prisons or exploit those immigrants and freeing them only on the condition of a bribe [2]

&gt;HRW (2009, 55) gives us this story:

&gt;Aron, a 36-year-old Eritrean who was detained at the airport jail in Tripoli in 2007, said that the cost for a bribe was either $500 in cash or about $800 for a wire transfer. After he paid the bribe, Aron said that a policeman in uniform took him from the jail in the police car and put him on the street in Tripoli. He later made an appointment with the policeman and “gave him money to release my friends.” Aron said, “It’s a rotating business. They take people out in the city, get money, and replace the prisoners with other Africans.”

&gt;Perhaps, one of the biggest reasons that Gaddafi is admired by the Western alt-right, is the fact that he struck an immigration deal with the notoriously right-wing PM of Italy Silvio Berlusconi. The treaty between two countries basically dictated that Gaddafi would capture immigrants and refugees and prevent "ignorant and barbaric" Africans (Yes, he said that, among other racist remarks [3]) from overflooding Europe in exchange for financial aid. This sort of rhetoric parrots word for word the style and lingo of the "White Genocide" conspiracy theory. According to multiple accounts of asylum seekers at the time, MANY of these people who were captured on the way were forced to work for no wages, while being abused and imprisoned and this mistreatment of asylum seekers eventually devolved into slavery. [4,5]

 

&gt;But why? Why these policies and all this racism?

 

&gt;Two things:

&gt;1) The legacy of Slavery in East Africa by the hands of Muslim Arabs seldom gets a mention, even though it was insanely horrific.

&gt;"Only estimates, some of which vary widely, exist as to how many Africans were sold from East to North Africa. This is also due to the fact that many of the slaves perished. Scientific research concludes that about three out of four slaves died before they reached the market where they were to be sold. The causes were hunger, illness or exhaustion after long journeys." [6]

&gt;The fact that this topic is almost never discussed, not even within Arab circles, goes to reflect how much the discourse has failed many Africans and minorities.

&gt;Racism within the MENA region exists. The fact that many never account for it, and try to find a way to blame Western interventionism for a problem that had already existed far before NATO did anything in the region, is exactly why I am writing this. Many are unaware that Arab supremacy is a very real thing. As one example shows:

&gt;Tomas, the 24-year-old Eritrean, remembers the racism as well as the abuse he experienced in Libya: “They called me ‘n*gger’ as they beat me” (HRW, 2009, 89).

&gt;"For sub-Saharan Africans, there are additional difficulties faced from society at large, notably racism. Testimonies of some of the Egyptian respondents, as well as those of sub-Saharan Africans, describe a situation in which sub-Saharan Africans face greater difficulties both from state officials, such as police officers and prison guards, and from ordinary members of society by virtue of the color of their skin." [6]

&gt;2) Gaddaffi clearly held beliefs as shown by the above statements. More importantly, the sort of racism that drove Gaddafi was mainly fueled by a twisted sense of paternalism and a ton of ignorance.

&gt;From the "Green Book" by Gaddafi:

&gt;"the inevitable cycle of social history, which includes the Yellow people's domination of the world when it marched from Asia, and the White people's carrying out a wide-ranging colonialist movement covering all the continents of the world, is now giving way to the re-emergence of Black people.

&gt;Black people are now in a very backward social situation, but such backwardness works to bring about their numerical superiority because their low standard of living has shielded them from methods of birth control and family planning. Also, their old social traditions place no limit on marriages, leading to their accelerated growth. The population of other races has decreased because of birth control, restrictions on marriage, and constant occupation in work, unlike the Blacks, who tend to be less obsessive about work in a climate which is continuously hot." [8]

&gt;Notice the return of "birth rate" rhetoric. He poses that safe sex would have been a bad idea for the Africana, because African can only dominate the globe their sheer numbers. Suffice to say, not only is this a ridiculous statement by a ridiculous man, it also pushes an arab version of the "White Saviour" complex, where he prescribes keeping black people in worse off conditions because they will one day take on the hegemony by having multiple babies.
