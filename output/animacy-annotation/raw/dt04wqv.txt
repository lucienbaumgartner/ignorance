"Know your enemy." ~Sun Tzu, the Art Of War

The left are clueless. They are so brainwashed that they struggle to comprehend reality, and therefore assume that anyone who disagrees with them must be a bot.  

This is one of many strategic incompetencies from the left. They are literally the definition of 'unaware and compliant' and that is just one of the many reasons why they constantly fail.
