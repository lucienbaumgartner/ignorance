&gt; with age comes wisdom.

Wrong, man. With *experience* comes wisdom. If you think you can just sit there and get old, and somehow that will make you wiser than someone that actual tries new things, then clearly you've got a lot of growing up to do. Your age isn't an indication of intelligence or taste, it's just how fucking old you are. There's a reason that there are still old racists in the world; age doesn't give you any new insight.

&gt; And I'm the moron.

I edited that part out, we might disagree on what makes a good movie, but there was no reason for me to call you names.

&gt;...insulted your childhood faves.

It's not about that. I'm just flabbergasted that someone could be so close-minded as to judge a film solely on the format that it's presented in. I mean, you have to realize how dumb that is, right? That would be like claiming Picasso isn't real art because his paintings aren't "realistic enough". Sure, you may not like Picasso, but calling it "not art" just makes you look inexperienced and unaware that there are people that dislike *your* type of art.

&gt;... a lot of words to put in my mouth.

No, not really. You said "golden age", which implies that there was a time when Hollywood was better. There wasn't, ever. Hollywood is, has been, and always will be about the paycheck, no matter what Quentin or any other director will tell you.

&gt; keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.

Don't worry, my brain is set firmly enough that it'll never happen. I can see how you'd be afraid of that, though. ;) Take care, good luck when your kid inevitably likes the complete opposite of everything you like.
