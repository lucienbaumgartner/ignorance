&gt;Usually this stuff is purposely left out of the news

It's because our news is controlled by the elites for our consumption. \*THEY\* don't want you to know what they're doing to you, so "Here, look at the latest drama the Kardashians are doing!" and "Wow, look at all this drama in the British Royal Family!"

It's always about pushing a political narrative for their benefit, never about helping the common people. They want to keep us dumb and ignorant, and battling with each other, because then we'll never see how bad they're screwing us.
