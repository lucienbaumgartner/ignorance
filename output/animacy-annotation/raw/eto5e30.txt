Both of my parents smoke. Around sort of 7 a day, give or take. My father is 56 and has diabetes, but regularly does exercise like chopping wood, walking, gardening etc. My mother does gardening 3 times a week but she is overweight and also diabetic. Both of them are not in great health, and they smoke, which really pisses me off. I understand that it's hard to stop smoking but I don't want to lose my parents in 5 years because they don't fucking take care of themselves. I am only 16 so I need them for a long time still and it would crush me if they got in any kind of medical trouble. We just arrived on holiday yesterday and lo and behold, they are still smoking like a pipe. We went out into the town and they had to sit down to drink tea and smoke a fag. Bear in mind, whenever we drive anywhere, we stop every hour or so for them to spend 15 minutes smoking. This happens everywhere, we waste so much time because they smoke. When we stopped, the smoke blew into my face, and I'd had enough. I had a go at both of them because they have recently had grandkids from my siblings and the fact they continue to act like that is horrible. I called them both disgusting and ignorant that they willingly spend god knows how much each week on tobacco, and how they smoke so much. My mum, when she gets a lung infection or a cold always has it so so bad. Now, I love my parents dearly, and they are the most helpful and supportive people I think I'll ever meet, but this has really pushed me over the edge. I haven't spoken to them since that argument and I can tell they're pissed off at me. Reddit, AITA?
