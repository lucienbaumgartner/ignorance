I don't relate personally. I can vision or make up almost anything in my head. I often go into a trance-like state where I watch stories in my head for hours. I'm not actually looking at the wall, I completely tune out my surroundings and I'm in my head at those moments.

My imagination can be a massive hindrance, it's what causes me to be so unproductive and unaware of my surroundings. I wish I could shut it off at times, because it's so intense and I forget the real world is there.
