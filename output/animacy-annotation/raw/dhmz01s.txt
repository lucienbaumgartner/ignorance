It's important (I think) to keep in mind that medication isn't a cure-all. It treats some of the symptoms (like working memory, impulsivity, resisting distractions), but it's still fundamentally *you* that is in control. That means it's still you that has to make the choice in what to do, and how to go about it.

Some of us are "lucky". I have co-morbid ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), along with Anxiety and Depression, and I somewhat "fell" into a career in engineering, in a way that masked my symptoms for years (along with copious amounts of soda/sugar). I went most of my 20's un-medicated and unaware, and it was really only once I started putting a conscious effort into my health that many of my symptoms from ADHD appeared.

Once I started getting treatment, which includes medication, it calmed some of the symptoms down, but I still have to put in the work. There's no free lunch, as they say.
