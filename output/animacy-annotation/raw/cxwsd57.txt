I am angry with the owners, absolutely! Who lets dogs that big run loose? (or even small dogs) Even if they're friendly, someone's going to be terrified of them! But not angry with the dogs. They really were sweet, and obviously well socialized, just uh, enthusiastic and unaware that they should NOT be trying to jump on people.. I'm grateful they're willing to pay for their screw-up at least. It'll save us both the headache of trying to sue for medical.

Not too worried about the downvotes. More concerned about how I'm going to drive with this thing! It's going to be an exciting next several months, that's for sure. As a bonus tailbones take forever to heal and may never stop hurting, hurray for me again.
