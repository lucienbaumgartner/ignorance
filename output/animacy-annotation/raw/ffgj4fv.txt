The Jedi might win round 1 but the Sith take the other two rounds easily. 

Palpatine outclasses Yoda, and probably Windu as well despite being "defeated' by him because it's more than likely he threw the fight too manipulate Anakin.

Plagueis is arguably on par with Palpatine. He definitely has a greater knowledge in the force and was only killed by Palpatine because he was unaware and intoxicated. 

Now Maul and Obi-Wan I'd call a stalemate. Obi-Wan did win in the Phantom Menace but that's only after Maul had already fought off him and Qui-Gon for a significant amount of time. Maul also forces Obi-Wan to retreat in the Clone Wars, which really tells me they're closely matched. 

The one the Jedi would take would be Dooku vs Anakin but that's not an easy fight and regardless Anakin would be no match for Palpatine or Plagueis.
