Then you fell for exactly what they wanted you too. His entire campaign and presidency was based on making people doubt the system. Guess what... people who voted for this guy. They don't doubt themselves or the system they believe in. They're so stupid and ignorant that they believe that only their view is correct and they'll show up and vote for their guy no matter how dumb or sideways he is. The more people on the other side that start doubting the system and pulling themselves from the voter pool because of it, the more the system becomes broken and presidents like Trump have a chance.

The system is far from perfect and needs changes but it's also absolutely not broken. The best candidate can win if people show up to the polls and vote for him/her. We had Trump in the first place because so many people who voted for Obama didn't show up to vote for Bernie or Hillary.. they just stayed home because they didn't like either candidate and Trump voters absolutely did not stay home.
