I never said anything about evolution but it makes more sense than your creationism. 

And again, theres no proof or evidence of god. You religious people use the concept of a god to explain the unexplained because that is so convenient for those who dont question anything and are completely narrow minded. You blindly accept theres a god when none has ever been proved to exist nor is there valid evidence of any. How pathetic. At least atheists acknowledge this lack of evidence as opposed to you brainwashed people who will believe in anything. Tell me, do you believe in the tooth fairy too? 

You're so blind and ignorant that you cant even tell the difference between fact and fiction. Religion is on it's way out, get used it.
