I'm sorry that you seem to be having a bad day. I would like to point out to you that you are doing 3 things here which are worthy of self reflection. 

1) you are over reacting. I'll spare the text wall here, you know what I mean.

2) you are being hypocritical. You told me that there are all sorts of people living all sorts of experiences so I shouldn't presume that your experience is unique or uncommon. Then, you told me that it's only a matter of time before I'm in your situation and that I'm naive to think your situation isn't the norm. Consider this: if there are many different experiences and its impossible to have them all, yours might be just as different as mine.

3) you are asserting a position that the majority of men are so filthy that they will willingly and, presumably knowingly since this must have come up, leave urine on surfaces for you to find. I find it offensive and ignorant that you would presume it likely that I would behave in a way that I find abhorent, simply because of your limited and specific experience with your husband. Myself and others on this platform (see downvotes) are telling you it's worth reconsidering that opinion of men.

Please try not to judge half the population based off of a single relationship. It's not rational.
