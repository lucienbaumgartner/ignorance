I agree, I had a talk with her about setting boundaries and sticking up for herself, it's just not really her nature to confront people, even if what they're doing really bothers her. Trust me I want to talk to the girl and give her a stern talking too about how disrespectful and ignorant that is, however, I don't have a way to contact the person. When I do see them I am most definitely going to say something.
