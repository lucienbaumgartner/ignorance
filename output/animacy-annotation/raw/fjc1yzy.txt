Oh, I’d 100% disagree. That film made me go through an intense emotional crisis. Not kidding. 

I related so much to the main character and noticed similar behavior patterns and how the people around her reacted to her quirks, and it’s almost a carbon copy to how people react to my ‘quirks’ and subsequently Ian’s ‘quirks’. Watching Frances Ha (even on rewatches) still often makes me wonder if I’m being perceived as an obliviously unaware and emotionally immature kid in an adult body whilst simultaneously debating if I’m actually as smart as I think I am. It made me question how I’m perceived within society and given I’m not always happy with the fact that I can’t help who I am at times, it still makes me tear up. That movie was drenched in subtle and realistic melancholy and honestly made me more sad than Call Me By Your Name or The Florida Project just to name a couple of examples. To me, Frances Ha is one of the most honest portrayals of an ADD-mind adapting to the real-world the best way someone knows how. 

On the surface it’s a comedy, but it becomes another story when you look past the facade.
