Scorpio Sun and Mercury tend to want to get very serious in relationships very quickly. Libra moon also yearns for a harmonious relationship partner.

However Venus and Mars in Sagittarius are less likely to ever settle down permanently and view love as something fun rather than something deep and eternal. 

There is therefore a disconnect between the Sun, Moon and Mercury which rule the self, emotions and thoughts wanting a strong, stable loyal relationship, and the Venus and Mars, which rule love and sex and drive, wanting a fun, more light hearted, and less intensely committed relationship. To put it in clear terms, there is a big part of them which wants to commit and settle down into marriage, but there is another big part of them which values freedom and independence and not being tied down. This explains constantly getting married, and then getting divorced.

As to lack of self awareness, I think most people will point out that Aries rising can be pretty socially unaware and aloof as to saying the wrong thing etc, however in the context of one-sided love, Scorpio can also be very oblivious and unaware of the other person's feelings. I have seen it so many times with close friends and acquaintances who have Scorpio Sun or Venus who genuinely believe they are in a long term committed relationship with someone, but the other person has no idea or interest in dating them. Then they get upset when the love is unrequited and lash out.

As others have commented, there really does seem to be a good explanation behind that behavior from this chart.
