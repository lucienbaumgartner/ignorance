Honestly, I think that's a really ignorant and dangerous stance to take, and you likely only feel that way because you haven't been personally affected and when the numbers get this high, they just become a statistic.

Why do you think we need to "just go back"? To protect the economy?
The economy is fucked because of a Pandemic of government documented government corruption and kickbacks for handling out contracts to friends which harms the average citizen and costs the government more than it should. The vaccines cost money too, and manufacturers are currently price gouging because they're in such high demand.
Give it a few years and the cost of all of this mismanagement is going to become evident, and the "we'll deal with it then" mentally will result in a lot of people suddenly developing surprised Pikachu faces when they are forced back into austerity.

I don't think you understand that the reason covid is staying with us, is because people aren't doing enough to mitigate the spread. We were down to 500 cases a day at one point. It's crazy when you think about it now. It really puts it into perspective.

People need to get over this selfish idea of "I just want things to go back so I can go back to the pub and see my mates" because there are more important things at stake now.
