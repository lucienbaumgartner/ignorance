Actually in the Middle Ages it was generally assumed that God didn't just make life on Earth but on other worlds as well who were similarly separated and unaware of eachother as we are to them. As a child this was something I often pondered(yes even the hands) and came to a few conclusions:
1) If God is the source of all life, and created life elsewhere, than if something created a civilization they would be humans, created in his image, then they would have hands.
2) Even if they didn't have hands, if they had Space Jesus, they would probably just burn him or something else slow and painful.
3) If God does have some grand plan for humanity, then the lofe on other worlds would probably have a similar history to our world.
