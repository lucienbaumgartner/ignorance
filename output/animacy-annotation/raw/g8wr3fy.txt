Yeah I couldn't believe it when I walked up and there was this tiny puppy in the middle of the park, I just took my dog off to the side and threw the ball for him.  The parvo risk in my neighborhood is pretty low but thats insane to risk it and risk traumatizing him if a big dog accidentally hurts him.  This guy also owned the mom and the breeder took her back to have this litter so it isn't like he is dumb and unaware of the risk
