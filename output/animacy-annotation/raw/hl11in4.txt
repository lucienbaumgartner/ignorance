I mean he says it was in the instructions so you knew ahead of time. Unfortunately, you're an asshole for this one. This us a VERY RARE instance where I side with a customer and almost hate doing so but you knew full well what was expected of you if in fact it was in the instructions. Also, be real, you knew and could sense there wasn't much, if any, risk associated with the drop off. You were just being selfish and ignorant of any other humans current situation.
