Best: more opportunities than I could have ever dreamed of when I was younger given my background. 

Worst: I spend most of my time reading, writing, or talking about the law with other legal professionals, lawyers, or professors. I feel that I have become more insular and unaware of human experiences outside of the law. I do not want to live life in a bubble like that, but it takes a lot of energy to maintain friendships outside of the law (at least in a new city like I am in).
