Are you referencing the Podesta email where the Democrat discuss a decades long effort to create a dumbed down, compliant citizenry?  Sure seems like it, but I would think you would reference said email so your fellow Americans can wise up and not be duped in the future.

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599

Who needs a Russian troll farm when you control the entire US education system.
