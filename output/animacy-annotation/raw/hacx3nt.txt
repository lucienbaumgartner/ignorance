The rest of us realized how stupid you and your dumbass peers are when you booed Trump for suggesting you get vaccinated. You’re lost and will never learn. It’s a lost cause. But for the love of God please leave the rest of us alone and quit trying to convince us of your absolute stupidity. 

Your argument is so obscenely wrong and ignorant that to address it would be more of a waste of time than counting the hairs on my ass. I have a degree in bio, thousands of hours in lab experience, 20 years in healthcare, and I give a shit about other people. You and most of your idiot pals have NONE of those.
