"From 1998 through 2001 Ivey served in the Clinton-Gore administration as Senate-confirmed chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and in that capacity is credited with both increasing the agencyâ€™s budget and restoring good relations between the NEA and Capitol Hill.
Bill Ivey is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, and was a Team Leader in the Barack Obama presidential transition. He is the author of two books on culture and politics, Arts, Inc: How Greed and Neglect Have Destroyed Our Cultural Rights (California, 2008), and Handmaking America: A Back-to-Basics Pathway to a Revitalized American Democracy (Counterpoint, 2012)."  
Center for American Progress founded by Podesta.  All they want is an unaware and compliant citizenry.  Pat yourselves on the backs, Pedes. We spoiled their plans.
