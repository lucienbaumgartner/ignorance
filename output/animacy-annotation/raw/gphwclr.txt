Another story in which I’m the patient. 

When I was first born and my mom tried to breastfeed me, I’d seem fine at first but then projectile vomit the milk back up within the hour. This happened every single time she fed me. They took me to the (very small town) walk in clinic multiple times with multiple different doctors who all insisted that I was being fussy but would learn how to eat and keep it down eventually. My mom said that after a week or so, she looked at me and noticed how bad my color was and that I just didn’t look right. I was pale and unaware of my surroundings, clearly starving/malnourished. She took me to a different hospital, who suggested we go to Seattle Children’s. There they immediately diagnosed me with pyloric stenosis which is a birth defect where the valve between my stomach and small intestine is essentially stuck shut, which prevents food from moving through the GI system and nutrients being absorbed. They did an emergency surgery to correct it, and I was able to eat and digest completely fine after that.

I’ve had a scar across the right third of my stomach my entire life from the surgery. I almost died of starvation because doctors wouldn’t take my mom seriously.
