I carry a pretty large backpack for work every day and this shit drives me fucking crazy. I usually commute by bus and the amount of unaware and inconsiderate kids never fails to amaze/infuriate me. It’s so easy to just take it off and place it between your feet or on your lap. Also why would you wanna keep your heavy ass bag on your shoulders? 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
