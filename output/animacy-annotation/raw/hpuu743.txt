Thank you, it helps to know that some men care. After a while on reddit, I (F) started to have the impression that all men, or at least the vast majority, were misogynists and that some hide it better than others irl. With all the hate/discredit/shaming directed at women on the internet I started to believe that this is what men actually think. Sexism has always been everywhere (literature, movies...) so internet was the last straw, how could be men so ignorant and degrading toward women in every possible media? It must be because that's what they are and that's what they believe. 
I write this but I am not even a proactive feminist, just a girl a bit annoyed to see sexism/misogyny that often irl and online. 
So thanks for being you, too bad there is so few understanding men talking about those kind of issues. I understand the lack of time of course, everybody has to work and have a life.
