If you think the Canadian and US cultures are similar, then you’re only looking skin deep.

Ask a USian how they feel about basic rights like healthcare and you’ll get a glimpse into a fundamental difference between our two nations. 

They have a very bloodied history on governmental distrust, taxation (war of independence) and puritanical individualism that we simply don’t have here in Canada.

We might all sound similar and have similar surface interests (western world all does) but we are very different in some very fundamental ways.

Canada’s high horse is a figment of our imagination too. It’s only because we pretend we’re better and keep hush-hush and ignorant of the actual problems we have here. Racism is abundant. Look at the rise in white supremacist groups in the last 5 years.
