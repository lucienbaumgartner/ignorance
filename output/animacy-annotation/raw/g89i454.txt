Okay theres a lot of things wrong with what you said.  For one thing, we have no way of knowing if powers are the reason why he cares about Ryan. Remember that he has never had a son before.  i think powers are are involved, just not for the reason that you think.  Homelander feels very isolated and alone.  No other supe has the kind of powers and capability as Homelander.  And now he finds out that he has fathered a son who is just like him. HE ISNT ALONE ANYMORE!!!  Its less the powers, and more his similarities with his son. He finally has someone that he can relate with

Also Homelander is clearly very blinded by Stormfront.  I have some personal theories, like how Stormfront is totally his mom!!!!  The dude has got mommy issues. During the truth scene, you can tell he doesnt really acknowledge the fact shes a nazi. Hes just happy someone is finally being honest!  

Did you really solely put the on blame Homelander for Ryan being where he is.  I feel like thats more of a group effort!  I blame Butcher, Stormfront, and Homelander for that.  

I dont think really reading what I am writing, cause I have contradicted everything you wrote in the last paragraph.  HE DOESNT KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MOTHERHOOD!!!  Why should he?  In his mind, Ryan already WAS going through the same life as him.  Isolated and unaware of the world
