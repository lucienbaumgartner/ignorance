Right. A 2 minute "report" from a left leaning media company based in a country that's abjectly terrified and uneducated about firearms with support from the Democratic party who is also abjectly fearful and ignorant of firearms.

It is a constitutional right to own a firearm that can be infringed. And as is clearly stated in the article/video, you must be 1. A US citizen and 2. possess valid, government issued identification. Not at all like handed out like candy.

Besides, liberals love ignoring ID requirements, so why not be consistent here and make citizenship the sole requirement?
