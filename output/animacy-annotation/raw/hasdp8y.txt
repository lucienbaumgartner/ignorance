It's a small number in the world who have wealth and try to hold on to it. Most don't have access and so don't have the choice. If most people in the world are invisible to you, I can understand why you think the behaviour of the wealthy is somehow a "human norm".

Asia, being large economically dominated by the west (South Korea and Japan are still occupied by the US military for Christ's sake), cannot be blamed separately for the climate crisis. We have now idea how things might have come out if Western empires had not sought to subjugate the region.
