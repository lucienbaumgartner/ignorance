&gt; If you act like you can so easily fall out of love, I hate to break it to you, you were probably never really in love to begin with.

And how would you know? You think you know what love is? It's just a bunch of chemicals in your brain telling you how to feel. Something as simple as birth control pills or antidepressants can make the feelings of love and lust go away, it's that easy for your hormones ( read: love ) to be tampered with.

Stop romanticising what is known and researched. 

&gt;If both parties are trying

Big if. Cause usually it's 1 party trying and the other not trying anymore.

&gt;I've never heard of a couple that BOTH continuously worked at their marriage/relationship and tried being their best self and best partner, then it ended in divorce or a major break up.

Lol. That's just being naive and ignorant of reality.

&gt;What an absolute sexist piece of shit statement.

Not at all, marriage is far riskier for men because men get screwed over in divorce courts and women almost never pay alimony ( over 80% of those who pay alimony are men ).

Facts cannot be sexist, honey.
