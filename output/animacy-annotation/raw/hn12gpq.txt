Half the teen mental health situation is clout and drama, and the other genuine half is eclipsed by the clout. The teens who have problems are criticized about that by their parents and the teens who follow the clout and drama get all the attention. That mixed with asian parenting style and homework and school stress and I am very concerned about these problems. Noone is anxious and depressed until they get a diagnosis, only exception is if the parents are too idiotic careless and unaware of the situation.
