And you’re very egotistical for someone who believes in fantasy steroids and fairy tales told to you by the Diaz bros. You assume they do this often but you don’t assume that steroids need to be taken readily and repeatedly for any significant gain?  You also conveniently ignore the fact that even if that were true, the trace left by the steroids in your system will be picked up by USADA later on? You’re delusional. 

Steroids aren’t a magic pill you take to become fucking Superman for 10 hours and then go back to being Mr. Clean right after they’re done, that mentality is just wrong and that’s why you believe in fictional steroids. Also LOL at You thinking USADA are so inefficient and unaware that athletes could do this and haven’t prepared measures to tackle it. This isn’t your high school drug test program, this is a government agency. Piss off with that logic. Yoel successfully demonstrated it was a tainted supplement as well, you don’t have a clue what you’re saying: [here’s the source](https://combatsportslaw.com/2016/04/04/romero-reaches-usada-plea-bargain-given-6-month-suspension/) From the article:

&gt;	Romero tested positive for Ibutamoren following an out-of-competition test conducted on December 16, 2015.  Romero alleged the substance came from tainted supplements and independent USADA testing “**conclusively confirmed that a supplement Romero used was contaminated with Ibutamoren“.**

Basically, unless you know something USADA, the most advance anti doping agency, doesn’t and have some undeniable evidence against Yoel, (you don’t) then stop spouting nonsense of fantasy steroids that aren’t traceable and about Yoel being guilty of use even though he hasn’t ever been proven to be using steroids.
