Simon's awkwardness is completely different from Ray. Simon is pompous but insecure. Ray is confident and unaware that he's awkward yet charming.

Also: Rip doesn't act like Mal or Wash. He has shown no sense of humor. The only thing he has in common is he's the captain and the pilot. 

You're really stretching it to say Kendra acts like Inara and River, but I'll give you credit because Kendra is suppose to be an exotic woman (Inara is a consort, Kendra is a reincarnated Goddess, both see  exotic to me), and a warrior, but she's not psychotic or psychic like River.

I totally get Kalee and Jax, but how the Hell is Jax like Inara, high class companion who are clearly part of an elite class, while Jax is a working class teen mechanic. It seemed like you just added that so you could have your little joke of Mick is exactly like Jayne, no combo.
