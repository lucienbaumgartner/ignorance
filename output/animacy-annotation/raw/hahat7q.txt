Who gives a shit about the person making the explanation? It amuses you that young people are getting engaged in politics? It thrills me. So many of my peers are so apathetic and ignorant of politics it horrifies me.

If you're arguing politics, you should be arguing the substance of the issue. I've seen successful people in their 50s make arguments that are absolutely absurd in their face. And 17-year old cashiers make scathing and accurate indictments.
