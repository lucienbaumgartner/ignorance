&gt;people have been successfully indoctrinated into hating Trump by a media landscape that is overwhelmingly leftist and unabashedly dishonest in its tactics

So... thats a yes then. You literally just said no, then proceeded to describe exactly what I said just in a more roundabout way. I'm not necessarily saying you're wrong, I'm just trying to show you how blind and ignorant that sounds. To fool yourself into thinking that people can only hate him because the media "indoctrinated" them into hating him. Its just such a self serving and fraudulent way to think, even though the media *is* dishonest and sensationalist. I've hated trump long before the media made him out to be hitler 2.0 and I'm sure many others did too. You can hate someone for their candor, demeanor, total lack of intelligence or ability to pick up on social cues and general weak negotiation tactics not to mention a litany of other things including being quite possible the least perceptive person I think I have ever seen hold a public position. I'll be honest I hate Trump just as much as Hillary, and I didn't vote for either of them. But to say that the majority of people that hate him were "indoctrinated" or fooled somehow into hating him is one of the most idiotic things I have ever heard and really shows why people tend to think that people who are fans of him are complete and total morons with their heads in the sand. If it makes you feel any better I would say the same thing if someone was telling me this about Hillary. 

The fact that my completely innocuous comment was downvoted then your comment saying *exactly* what I said just in a prettier way was upvoted proves my point better than anything I can say could.
