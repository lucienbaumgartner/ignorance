From my personal experience, ENTJs seem more chaotic &amp; ruthless with their words and express love in aggressive ways.

ENTJs seem to enjoy “adopting” introverts and are a little manipulative whilst INTJs seem to want to be left alone.

ENTJs say mean things out loud and unaware that they hurt others that way while INTJs don’t say much and unaware that they hurt people that way, lol.

ENTJs are always looking for adventures &amp; enjoy sharing memes. They are known as meme lords.

ENTJs are very caring and check up on those they care a lot. They give off “overwhelming caring parent” behavior and enjoy deep conversations.

While other extroverts enjoy other extroverts, I think ENTJs enjoy introverts because I don’t think they like other extroverts it seems.
