I mean I love his music, but she's kinda not wrong.

My counter would be that that headline: a) generalises the themes in his music too much, b)assumes there's no value in listening to the complex themes and relationships between Abel and drugs/women etc, and c) that's the point.

Nobody's listening to The Weeknd and unaware of what he's talking aboutðŸ™„, wish people would stop acting as if we don't know the music we're consuming and like it's some big revelation.
