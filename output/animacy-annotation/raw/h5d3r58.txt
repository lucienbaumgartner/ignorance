I agree with the sentiment there and that it’s fucked to overlook the horrors people commit because they’re part of a minority or have other struggles. I feel the same way with school shooters getting special treatment because of “mental illness.” Please know that the true meaning behind BLM is just that. That Black Lives Matter. It doesn’t mean that white lives don’t, or that black people have a right to overstep society or judgment because of the world’s harsh past. Anyone that tries to validate a clear murder or crime against the world because of the color of the committers skin is stupid and ignorant of the cause. It isn’t mentioned much in relation to BLM because that isn’t the point of the movement. But do you not see how after seeing this video and making that a focal point, while having no mention of BLM in the video/comments or anyone trying to validate it, makes it seem like you’re the one victimizing yourself and painting BLM in a bad light for no reason? People aren’t out rioting because of this are they? So why was it even necessary to argue that that would be the case?
