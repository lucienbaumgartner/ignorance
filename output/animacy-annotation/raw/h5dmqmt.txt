i know you think you’re cool and smart by telling me this, but you don’t know what you’re talking about. i don’t care about becoming popular, wether i do or not is beyond me and i’m not thinking about it right now. what i want to do is bring enjoyment. i know a tier list of an artist’s discography isn’t going to make me popular that’s not why i do it. and i don’t share it in the hopes that it will become popular and everyone will love me. i get enough validation, i spread my videos so someone might decide to watch it and enjoy it. i know what your opinions were about me before i even spoke to you, and that’s your problem. so at the end of all this, my last thing to you is sincerely, kindly, fuck you. don’t look at my content ever again, because the last thing anyone really needs, is an asshole that is so close minded and unaware of anything, and thinks that everything needs to be criticized.
