thank you so much!!! This really does help those of us who have anxiety disorders/use prescribed benzos/medication for it and don't want Sandy and Malia to keep adding to stigma and justifying their behavior. People don't always know how crazy controlled substance laws can be and i know on the seas it's gotta be even murkier. But the language they use is so unprofessional and ignorant that we really needed someone to step up like this. You're awesome, Adrienne!
