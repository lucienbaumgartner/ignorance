Its really disingenous and ignorant of Maoist policies to compare, let alone equate them, to the general public idea of "wokeness".

Biggest difference is that "wokeness" is just awareness, its not a national policy with the explicit aim of removing colonial influences(since the US hasnt been a colonial subject for like 300 years and even then they were the settlers, not the displaces).

The methodology isnt close at all, because the Cultural Revolution was a closely coordinated removal of narratives to provide state propaganda and "reactionaries", alongside centralizing the education system from the disparate warlord systems.

And Mao wasnt a Marxist. He ditched Marxism as a dogma, since Marxist practice doesnt let agrarian societies try socialism. He just used Marxism as a base for his further anti-colonialist ideas, since he saw capitalism as a system unfit for "new countries", especially ones that had no history of mercantilism, hyper-individualusm or systemic colonization.
