Independent doesn't mean unmotivated to vote, and not voting for either party *certainly* doesn't mean unmotivated to vote. It means hating the options and being unwilling to believe that buying into the status quo is acceptable.

My vote is very simple. The candidate who runs on a platform to break up corporations ala Teddy Roosevelt or to protect the working class ala FDR gets my vote. No general election candidate has done that in 50+ years, so they don't get my vote. 

But both the Ds and the Rs know that, and they're okay with it, because they get their corporate money and they keep their position by keeping the masses pitted against each other (or against Russia, or the Middle East, or China...). That keeps people busy and unaware that the real enemy is the corruption we've had all our lives.
