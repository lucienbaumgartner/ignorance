I agree with part of what you're saying yet I think you're also very wrong about the "performative" description of native shamans.

The indigenous tribes of the Amazon have millennia of culture, knowledge and history with plant medicine and I think we can pay them respect. You don't have to buy into all their world view but I believe we can value their knowledge and skill for its own sake. It also seems like you're conflating genuine traditional shamans with fly-by-night Western yogahuascas which to me is unfair and ignorant.

That being said, we humans constantly evolve and experiment and learn and I think it's fair game to build your own practices on the shoulders of traditional knowledge. If you want to DIY, go for it.

The two don't have to be in conflict with each other.
