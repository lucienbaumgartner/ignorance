While I very deeply can relate to what you're saying. At this point in my life, i'd frame your comment a different way. Specifically one with regard to acceptance.

The reason there's no movement is because the pattern of behavior is in a way engineered to get a specific outcome. Put differently, it's a defense. Now it might be an unhelpful defense by the current person's standards but at some point it served to achieve something for the person that was sorely needed. That's why it became ingrained in the first place. It's not all physiological addiction. It served a psychological purpose as well.

So in that sense, I might sound asinine here as well as unempathetic and ignorant of the feelings of despair and whatever painful malese that exists, but (speaking in personification terms) ... don't you just want to thank it in some way? It's a part of you that has been desperately trying to help you in some way, in its own. It might not be the help you want or especially need. But it's still a resource at your disposal in a way.

In that sense, you can say the goal is to de-engerize and/or integrate that defense. Because once you free up the energy from it you now have a modicum of energy you can invest elsewhere, consciously, into something more healthy and helpful (by present you's standards). And isn't that all rather freeing?...freedom borne from gratitude, if you will.
