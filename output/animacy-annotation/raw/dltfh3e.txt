I appreciate your comments. My therapist has said that all of my adult children have been pushing/pulling since my husband's death. And we did have some inappropriate boundaries in our family. I did always fix everything, so why didn't I fix this? There is still so much blame. The saddest part is the assumption that when someone moves forward with their life, they didn't grieve properly. It's a bizarre phenomenon that I was totally unaware and unprepared for. 

As for my current partner, he has been a rock solid presence in our time together. That is why I chose to have a child with him. I would guess that he is acting out with the imminent due date and you're right... he had better pull his head out of his ass. I am confident that he will. We all make mistakes but let's not make one where we drive while intoxicated!! That is a hard rule for me. Period.
