I noticed that in the article it said there was as a rigid gender binary in the books, ie there are two sides of the source. Isn’t the same thing being done in the show but this time it’s women fix things and men break things. As a woman I very much like the idea of strong female characters but why are all the men being downplayed as stupid? Are we saying that women can only shine when men are portrayed as ignorant and arrogant?

I’m not saying that there aren’t things that need to be changed. It’s weird say that WoT is too high fantasy but still be a fan of GoT when it is just as high fantasy. There’s a weird disconnect happening there. WoT can thrive without being compared to GoT. It’s very strange to me that what is being praised in one show (GoT) is being disparaged in another.
