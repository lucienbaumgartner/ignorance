Hey man, I’m so sorry. This can be a really scary topic, I know, but you were raped. I was assaulted a few years back, and I only really grasped that that’s what it was recently, so it’s good that this is something you’re addressing now.

The most important course of action is to take care of yourself. They say to put on your oxygen mask before helping others on planes for a reason, you can’t do anything if you can’t help yourself. If you feel like you’d like to go to the hospital for a rape kit, know you can do that without submitting any kind of police report (at least in the US with adults, unsure what happens with minors but if you want me to look just lmk). Tell a person you trust, ideally an adult, because holding this inside isn’t gonna do any good. Make sure you’re doing things you enjoy and talking to friends.

Just know this wasn’t your fault. You were assaulted, taken advantage of, and raped. You did not choose or want this. The people in these comments saying you should’ve enjoyed it or that you’re lucky are ignorant and clueless and have no idea what they’re talking about. Your feelings are valid and that’s that. If you ever want to talk just lmk
