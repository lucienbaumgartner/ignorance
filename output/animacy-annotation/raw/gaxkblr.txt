It is a bit difficult for me to be okay with seeing him. But it is just confusing because for some reason I want to fix things and solve the problem. You are right. I replied to him and I will tell him that he has unfair expectations and is ok with treating others poorly and see what he says to that.

I think if he makes an attempt to be accountable, it will be hard to trust him. 

Part of me feels like it is my fault for having to cut things off and ruin both of our fun. For some reason I feel like I should be expected to take other people's shit, and I don't know why that is. I wish there could have been a happier ending but at least I did still end up getting to have sex with him one time.

I can't get past the feeling that if we just both pretend there is no problem, we can be blissfully ignorant and unaware and still have fun. Do you disagree with this?
