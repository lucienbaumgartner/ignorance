“However in the 2,299 cases where police pulled motorists over for "suspicious activities" or "criminal offences, a disproportionate number involved racialized minorities.

As far as outcomes, most stops ended in charges (44.65 per cent) or warnings (41.29 per cent) and race didn't seem to have an impact in whether the driver had either of those two outcomes.”

There’s literally so many of these types of studies, of course most are worded as “it’s racist practice with no real benefit etc, it’s why we are getting rid of it in Toronto etc.” 
.....but all their studies show that although they pull so many people over for being suspicious as fuck, and some don’t end up being anything. 44%........ THATS A LOT BRO. Anyone who can’t see that math is blind and ignorant, that has an impact on what they find on these criminals.

And it discourages, key word discourages them from being so open and free with carrying weapons drugs etc and other hoodrat shit. 

When criminals go unchecked it gets worse and worse, as we’re seeing now the city is ridden with shooting and drugs all the time. A kid just got kidnapped at gun point the other week for 4 million in cocaine.... there’s a issue bro.
