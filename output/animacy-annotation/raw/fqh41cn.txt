I’ve had to cut ties with a ton of friends and family members because they are too fragile to even be associated with a vegan. Being around them is like torture, they were so insecure and ignorant that they would create nicknames for me and pry into my personal philosophy every time we got together. It sucks because I loved them, but damn, it was so tiring being around them. I wouldn’t change my decision any day, I have way more respect for animals than them and that’s the unfortunate truth.
