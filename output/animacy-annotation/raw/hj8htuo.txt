I fell out of a tree and hit my head on a rock when I landed, hard enough to knock me unconscious and black out the memory of how I even fell in the first place (figured out later that a branch broke). Mom not only didn't take me to the doctor, she left me alone in my room to "play quietly" when there was a chance of concussion. Not malicious, she was just young and ignorant of the risks.

Knocked the back of head though, not the front. I suspect it might be the reason I can't learn proper names (people or places) for shit though... Literally it's like memorizing their phone number, and even after calling someone by name a hundred times, I can still lose it. So frustrating.
