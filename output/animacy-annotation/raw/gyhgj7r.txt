For #2, what happens if person A goes through those common law methods and then (letâ€™s say years later) person B goes through the registration methods. Will person A be in a vulnerable position? 

Person B may do this intentionally, knowing that nothing has been registered, or unintentionally, assuming they are the first and unaware of Person A. 

Always curious about this.
