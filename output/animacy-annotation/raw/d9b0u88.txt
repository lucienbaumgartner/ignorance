Nice copy pasta of gishgallop. Absolutely nothing you posted shows 'actual corruption':

&gt;Transcripts from Hillary Clinton’s lucrative closed-door paid speeches delivered to elite financial firms and other special interests groups (which she has refused and failed to disclose to the public after much demand) have finally surfaced: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927 (See Attachment)

Not corrupt. Actually, the speeches seem reasonable and well considered and we knew about them in the first place because they were disclosed in her publicly released tax returns.

&gt;Clinton staff conspiring to stage ‘leaking’ of favorable excerpts from wall street speech, in efforts to calm down the public while leaving out more damaging parts: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8086#efmAYqAgR

Not corrupt, standard attempt to drive narrative by workers in a political campaign. 

&gt;Leaked private speech, Clinton: “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders”: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmFjUFkd

Not corrupt.

&gt;Mocking environmentalists in private meeting with unions, Clinton: "I want to defend fracking." Climate change environmentalists should "Get a life": https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9617 (See attachment) Politico article

&gt;

Not even remotely corrupt, or even really out of keeping with her current policies especially with context.

.... Im noticing a pattern here, so let me skip around a bit.

&gt;Hillary admits Qatar &amp; Saudi Arabia are funding ISIS: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774#efmBA5BDe
Qatar gifts Bill Clinton $1,000,000 for his birthday: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8396#efmAEOAGW
"Take the money": Clinton Campaign welcome foreign donations: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915#efmAAGAAWAFJAGeA0nA3B


First link: not corrupt, widely held as common knowledge, not actually from Clinton - I dont understand what is supposed to be the problem here.
Second link: Not even remotely true, or corrupt. Qatar gives CF a million dollar donation coinciding with Clintons birthday. This wasnt secret, the charity does full disclosures.
Third link: Not true. They are taking money from registered foreign agents, which are US citizens who have lobbied for foreign interests. Trump had one as his campaign manager. 

Skipping some more:

&gt;Clinton Staff hosts private “off-the-record cocktail party” with 38 “influential” reporters, journalists, editors, and anchors (from 16 different mainstream media outlets including CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, &amp; more) with the stated goal of “framing the race”: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5953 (see attachment)

This is not at all unusual. Every major candidate has had off the record events with the press. The rest of these 'media collusion' stories are similarly non-unusual. Do you think similar emails dont exist between RNC staff and 'friendly' reporters and commentators?

skipping some more:

&gt;Clinton strategist: We need to “produce an unaware and compliant citizenry” to defeat Trump: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599#efmARKATm

This is not a Clinton strategist, but a random third party who emailed Podesta unprompted and apparently got no response.

So, the vast vast majority of this is not really remarkable at all. The very 'worst' emails (DNC prepared to fake Trump craigslist ad and perhaps Doug Band complains about Bill) either dont point to anything concrete that actually happened, or are concerned about the appearance of something untowards, not actual impropriety.
