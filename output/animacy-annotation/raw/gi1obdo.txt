Look, I'm not trying to put you down here. 

I don't think the word "conservative" was used in a political sense here. It's more about "moral conservatism" which sometimes equates to a "righteousness" attitude towards society. They often judge others based on their own circumstances thinking that other's mistakes are inexcusable because they wouldn't make them. 

Instead of showing us that what you think is morally correct, which is what I think you are doing, you are instead coming off as highly insensitive and unaware of how the world works. I'm only telling you this as a favor to you as an individual and those around you who have to endure what most of us who downvoted you believe is your flawed judgment. 

Look, there's time for you to change. My best suggestion to you is to volunteer in a place like a food bank and talk to the people who come there. I'm sure it will change the way you see the world. 

I wish you all the best.
