OP, you **NEVER** owe ANYONE  an explanation of your suffering OR behaviors due to abuse from the hands of others. People are often unaware and ignorant  to the  severity of what abuse by parents/family can do to a child,  and damage done is multiplied when within the confines of abusive religion. 

You can get free and heal. It may take time, planning and effort. You're aware now and that's the first step. Others have been successful in similar situations.  Know you can survive and thrive! 

You can rise above the life you were unfairly dealt  by **NO FAULY OF YOUR OWN!** Believe it. See it. Feel it.
