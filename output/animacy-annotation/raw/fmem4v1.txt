Here in Utah the governance is so business friendly and employee unfriendly that the state is dragging it's feet until it can sap out the very last penny before all hell breaks loose. It's embarrassing. Add to that there are people here so dull and ignorant that they aren't even familiar with the term "corona-virus" or "COVID-19." Add to that Lowe's is dragging it's feet as well. Our store won't be implementing the customer flow controls until after today (Saturday) our big Spring Black Fuck Off sale. If I can't maintain at the very least 4ft distance in all directions today, I'm gone for the day. I put my life on the line for 6 years in the military, I did my due diligence, Lowe's is not the military or the healthcare field. I'm done feeling like a number with no value.
