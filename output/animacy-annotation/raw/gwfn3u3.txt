Not quite!

Worker ownership is the *prerequisite*, but not the sole description! It is the “classless” that leads to “stateless” eventually.

Marx’s problem with anarchists wasn’t their view on the dissolution of the state as they defined it (he agreed, after all), but whether there would necessarily be a post-revolutionary state! Marx’s take being that the workers, having only known the capitalist state, would mimic it post-revolution (that is, until it dissolved). After all, it would be necessary in order to prevent counter-revolution by the remaining capitalist states.

Anarchists of the time called him an authoritarian for supporting the existence of a state, while Marx called them naive and ignorant of history for thinking a post-revolutionary society could spring up without one.
