I'm going to *akchkchually* this one and let everyone know that simp is an old word, not a recently found acronym at all - and in early 2000's it was occasionally used to describe simple-minded women who are dependent, unaware and gullible. Now, it's been repurposed to describe a man who sacrifices his dignity to gain (=buy, simps buy female attention and thus feel entitled to it since it's a 'purchased good' of sorts) crumbs of female respect, while detesting men who don't sacrifice their dignity (men with expressly sound self-esteem and pro-social yet assertive conduct make a simp uneasy).

Everything else Nervous\_Skink said in this thread is spot on. I've tried to explain this stuff to others as well and I'm happy to see that there are people who get this and it's not just me going sane.
