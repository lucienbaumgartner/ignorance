I never denied it was *a* known thing, only that ignorant assholes *only* know that.

Seriously you literally don't know shit about the country if you think that's the *only* reason for someone to live there, and you're either a pedo or an idiot if you don't understand there is more to the country than one city.

You're the type of person that probably thinks all of the Netherlands is defined by Amsterdam, or more likely is so uneducated and ignorant that they don't even know anything more about the country than "Amsterdam is there, and they have weed and hookers!"

Wise up dumbass, learn about the world a bit.
