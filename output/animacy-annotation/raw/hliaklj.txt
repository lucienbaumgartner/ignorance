My kid is in kindergarten now and I'm seeing the stupidity from parents in a new light. My kids can read pretty well and he's one of about 3 in a class of 25 that can do so. Why can my son and these others read?! They must be geniuses! Nay. We simply read to them and start small with pronunciation. "Tell me what you think this says:  CAT" but the parents don't get that they are 99% of their child's learning. 

My kids can add and subtract up to ten. He must be a genius! He can read too! Nay. He has ten fingers and we simply practice the basics. "This has has 3 fingers to, that hand has 2 fingers up. Together I have how many fingers up?" I look at how he throws/kicks/rides a bike/etc. He's Going to be an Olympian! Nay. He has good tours and activities at home and we just play and practice. 

I'm amazed at how utterly unskilled, unknowing, unaware, and unwilling parents are. There was a recent thread in /r/education where a parent expressed fear that their kid was learning enough in a Waldorf school. We all have tips on how to find and compare standards. "I just don't know." We all have advice on what to do at home. "I've been slacking." Excuse city. Multiply this by every state and every district and it is no wonder our nation is stagnant and decaying.
