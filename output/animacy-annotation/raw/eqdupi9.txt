It sucks because I am a huge fan of Rick and Morty. Even have a few shirts, comics, and all 3 seasons on DVD. However the community is so irritating and ignorant that I dont want to be associated with these idiots screeching about McDonald sauces and how superior their intelligence is. I am very well aware that my intelligence is more than likely in the average category.
