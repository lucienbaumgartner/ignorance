I asked a tinder match to a walk in a state park once and she agreed, (maybe because we were both bringing dogs, but still) and it wasn't until much later that I realized how dumb and naive it was of me to make that offer. Totally unaware and oblivious to the privilege of not having to worry about my safety in such a scenario.
