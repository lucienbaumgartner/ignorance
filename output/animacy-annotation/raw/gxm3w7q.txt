Honestly no. Now that I am an adult I am much more comfortable knowing what the important things in life actually are. I am now fully self-aware and have complete control over most things in my life. I make my own money, write my own path, and am fully responsible for myself. 

As a kid I was always unsure, afraid, and ignorant of so many things. Life is MUCH better now as an adult.
