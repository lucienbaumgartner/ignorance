I think this is too harsh. I agree that you should encourage treatment, but this comment comes off as dismissive and ignorant of mental health disorders. A lot of DID develop the disorder as a result of deep trauma. Sometimes they might not even understand it. 

Again, not your job OP. But with the right help people can heal. Overall, this is not a good question to ask Reddit and perhaps a good question for couple therapy.
