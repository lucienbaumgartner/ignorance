I feel like you are not reading the words I'm writing. Stupidity doesn't mean ignorance. Ignorance is when you are unaware and can be fixed by learning, Stupidity is when you choose to be unaware and can't be fixed.   


A 7 year old is ignorant and unaware, But a 7 year old who repeats something over and over again after being taught and chooses not to, is stupid.
