Wow, obviously you no absolutely NOTHING about Kroger and how it treats/pays It’s employees or the amount of profit they made from the start the of Covid-19 pandemic to November during 2020...

*How dare you call me **entitled** when I **have to work this shit job** because NO ONE else will hire me after my narcissistic abusive ex—who beat, sexually assaulted, emotional/psychological put me down and destroyed who I was to the point I no longer felt like a person, and forced me to use/“party” with him to the point I became dependent on drugs* (although I accept my responsibility for continuing to use/abuse after being discarded by him because that was my choice/a coping mechanism for a while)—***especially when I don’t complain, slack off, or do anything except above and beyond for my store/customers/higher ups** even though I am now full-time and STILL making my part-time top-tier pay of $12.45/hr (and NEVER allowed to work overtime under threat of termination)?! *

AND, keep in mind, I do all of this while holding a MASTERS degree, worked in education as a public servant for nearly a decade prior (but ex cost me that career), have 100% open availability/will work weekends &amp; holidays, and came in to work even when I was **homeless** for nearly 3 months with not so much as a “how’re you?/everything ok?” when it was clear I was struggling but still never complained.

**Who are *YOU* to tell me I don’t deserve an extra $2/hr as appreciation, dare I even say understanding, from the multi-billion dollar profiting grocery giant regarding the struggle of having to come in, day in and day out, and deal with a shitshow of a store/lazy and complacent coworkers and management/and anti-mask customers in hoards not wearing facial coverings (and caretaking for my older parents who have weaker immune systems and can’t afford catching Covid-19)**?! 

Our store doesn’t even put enough hand sanitizer out, provide gloves or masks anymore, or even provide enough cleaner and paper towels so that there is some on every register on the front end (a mandatory store protocol)!!! I’m given 90 minutes to “clean” the front end on the nights I’m put in charge of utility—which is NOT EVEN CLOSE to enough—and still expected to condition all the end caps, put the chip aisle back in order and handle trash/recycling on the front end. 

**WHO ARE *YOU* to act like I don’t deserve to earn *a livable fucking wage* after enduring over a decade of abuse which has me now suffering from severe depression, PTSD, insomnia, and panic attacks (linked to panic disorder) that are so terrifying and debilitating it’s hard to even function—and yet still showing up to work every single day and busting my ass to do as much as I can to help wherever I’m asked to go**?! 

It’s extremely inconsiderate and ignorant of you to Oh, and just so you know, while those two specific store locations may have not been doing well, *Kroger made $32.8 in 2020 from the start of the pandemic in March until November of that year—and yet cut hazard pay in JUNE... after only giving it to workers for 3 pathetic months!!! 

I deserve the hazard pay, and Kroger can more than afford what they should’ve been paying their employees all along. #KrogerGreed #Bitchbehumblesitdown
