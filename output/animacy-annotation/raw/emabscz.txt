It's everywhere I'm afraid. I had my own awakenings in my 20's when I moved away from home. I've had quite a few Korean friends over the years here that have gotten married, moved out of their house, and complained about how hard life is. I do feel like the age is a bit older here... with young people these days waiting until they are 30/30+ before they get married and move out, but that's due to many problems in the society here. Try to think back when you were young and unaware and understand that it's just a part of life.
