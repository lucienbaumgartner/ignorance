No.  That's just the easy cop out.  I get along with people in their 60's and 70's.  I have other friends in their 20's, so it's not that I'm just getting old.  Even my friends in their 20's bitch about their peers and the inability to get them to do their jobs and whatnot.  While the generational gaps exist, and there are those that shake their fist and yell for the kids to get off their lawns, this isn't that.

If you're taking that position, I assume that you're young and unaware of how toxic the work ethics of this generation truly are.  It's not just about what they're being paid as I agree the wages in the US are fucked.  It's a much much deeper problem.  I've hired and fired multiple people, and my experiences (while antidotical) have shaped my attitude that you have to pay them to show up, and if you want them to work you have to pay them more.  The upcoming generations aren't the same as the past ones, and that's not a compliment.
