And as I said North America doesn’t determine the relevancy of an artist whether there speak English, Korean or whatever. You can have a wrong opinion. The original poster didn’t say “North America”. Making it about America is an ignorant and wrong take. You and the op may have only thought of psy when hearing the word kpop but billions around the globe and millions in “North America” at the time would recognize other artist. This is why you’re ignorant and wrong. Notice how I didn’t have to insult you.
