For anyone wondering feel free to read the paper "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments" by Dunning and Kruger because the Wheeler bankrobbery was discussed on the first page in reference to common sense and logic and overall the study is pretty interesting
