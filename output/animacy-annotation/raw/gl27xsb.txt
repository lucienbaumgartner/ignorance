If they're forced to buy at the higher price, would that turn a GME from being a bubble worth 10B to actually worth that much? I have minimal stocks in GME being entirely honest (like 30), just wondering what happens to the people who bought thousands of shares. They're hopefully not left holding something without worth?

Also can we calculate how much of a price is needed to force a margin call? Are we past it already? Sorry, I'm very new to this, and sorry again for my previous post saying "shorts expire on Friday" that was clearly wrong and ignorant of how things actually work &amp; thanx for correcting me
