So believe there shouldn’t be a single popular subreddit on this website that features black voices?  That white people are being oppressed if one subreddit out of thousands isn’t dominated by white people on all threads?

Like, honestly, are you really that abjectly stupid?  Are you deliberately being obtuse, or are you actually so dumb and ignorant that you can’t tell the difference between a minority being told they can’t speak anywhere, and the majority being told that there’s *one* place out of tens of thousands that they’re not allowed to dominate?
