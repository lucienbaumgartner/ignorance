Lol everything you said is so misguided and ignorant that it’s probably useless to have this discussion. Capital riot is completely overblown: a bunch of idiots were protesting and then the small mob got out of hand. The 45th president was absolutely not implicated in it that is another false media narrative. Not that it matters but he’s a billionaire and having some failed businesses is part of being a billionaire you absolute dunce. Him being impeached is a political play by the opposing politicians and means almost nothing, specially now. 

We by far produce the most innovative tech by a million miles compared to other countries. 

Man power is absolutely useless against the tech the us military has. One American f35 could destroy a thousand chinas.

The us leads culture worldwide on so many aspects it’s crazy. Majority of the world listens to American music, watch American movies, use Facebook, use Instagram, use Snapchat..

Look dude, you’re not going to accept this cause you feel like it’s a personal attack on you but America being at the top of the world still is just a fact I’m sorry.
