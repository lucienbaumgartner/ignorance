No, that would be you. You realize that just saying things doesn't make them right... right? You're so fucking ignorant and retarded you think slavery was not practiced in the world at the time. 

Think for a second just how retarded you are. I don't even need to insult you, you're already making yourself look more retarded every time you comment.

How does it feel being so stubborn and ignorant that you actually think your right? You realize this kind of delusional reality is a mental illness right? Got some shocking news for you kiddo, you're wrong, and you don't know anything about history.
