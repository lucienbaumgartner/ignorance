&gt; Your judgment is really quite.

Sorry, I know I promised I wouldn't respond but holy shit, AHAHAHAHAHA

You really are undereducated and the victim of a self-inflicted frontal lobotomy. A literal walking Dunning-Krueger zombie. 

Your "Doctorate" in Underwater Basket Weaving doesn't make you smart, or even educated, it makes you specialized and ignorant of things outside your narrow scope of expertise. But if I ever need to know how to dry out a reed basket like you've dried out your brain, I'll be sure to contact you first!

K! Off to watch good, anti-capitalist cartoons (since most of them are, we're certainly not lacking choices!) with my kids!

You have a wonderful day and thanks for the chuckle at your expense, sport.
