They overlap in one(1) sense: that they oppose trans people. This opposition is for largely different reasons and on the basis of different belief systems, the comment I was responding to wasn't saying that they were superficially similar or even had overlap on trans issues, it was saying that they were conservative on all issues; which is just plainly wrong and ignorant of these communities.

Also I'd argue Tumblr terfs aren't an exception, rather it's home to one of the larger online terf communities *because* it's a less male dominated platform (tho I'd contend abt extremely onlineness there esp. among the terfs...). But the trend tracks equally to real world politicians and theorists behind the 'terf' movement.
