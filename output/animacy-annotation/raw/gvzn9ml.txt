I honestly wasn't sure on that draft. I knew I didn't want Rosen, and I didn't want Jackson, but between Darnold, Allen, and Baker I couldn't make up my mind. Part of me still feels like if we were planning to have Tyrod start for a year, Allen made the most sense since he was such a raw prospect, but with hindsight I'm glad we got Baker. Allen had a stable coaching situation and still looked like a shitshow his first two years. He would've collapsed if he had been tossed into the fire following Tyrod's injry and then had to deal with Hue, Haley, Greggggggg, Kitchens, and Monken. Darnold, we'll never know, since he kinda had a raw deal in NY, but I feel like he wouldn't have survived the coaching here either. Baker having to deal with so many different systems and so much instability in college was the perfect fit to deal with dysfunction in Cleveland. Can't wait to see him hit his full potential over the next few years.

Oh and for the record, the Manziel comparisons were always lazy and ignorant of facts. Manziel was never good in scripted scenarios, all of his big plays were when the play broke down and he had to improvise. Manziel also had problems with accuracy. Also, Manziel only had two season in college, his redshirt freshman and sophomore years. Baker was one of the most accurate QBs in NCAA history, made most of his plays from the pocket, not from improvising, and had 4 seasons of play in college across multiple schools. The only possible comparison is that both were short QBs from Texas who had character question marks.
