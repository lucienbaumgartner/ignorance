I'd suggest googling "immigrants rights [your state or nearest big city]" and if that doesn't turn up any promising organization, try the next state over. Here in Minnesota, we have groups like the Minnesota Immigrants' Rights Action Committee and the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota. RAICES and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center are two national organizations.  Locally, there are probably church groups (churches do a lot on this) and small legal clinics; there might be one run through your state university.

It's tough.  I once hurt some people through doing something stupid and ignorant that I could easily have avoided if I'd thought even a little bit. It didn't have the same kind of consequences as deportation, but it was serious and I did try to make ongoing amends.  I set up a monthly donation to a related local organization (obviously you have to consider what you can afford) and I tried to speak up about the issue whenever I could. When it seemed appropriate, I told people about what I'd done and why it had been the wrong thing to do. I still feel bad about it, but I can't undo it.  All I can do is try to be a better person and pay down what I feel is a kind of karmic debt.
