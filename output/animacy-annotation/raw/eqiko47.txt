yeah, i’ve never done it either but ketamine gets a lot of flack for making people radiate the blackest, most negative energy. just from being around them at festivals i’ve noticed they can be super rude and unaware that they’re affecting others. sorry that happened to you dude! hope you had a great time otherwise
