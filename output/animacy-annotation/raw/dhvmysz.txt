There is some historical debate about whether Hitler was actually unaware and furious or whether he was in on it and tried to save face after the plan failed so disastrously. I certainly wouldn't put it past Hitler to throw his old friend (including remaining family members, etc.) under the bus for his ego.

Then again, there's also debate about whether Hess was just batshit crazy and hallucinating at that point. It's all very murky.
