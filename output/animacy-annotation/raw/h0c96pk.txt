My wife and I paid good money to be able to have children together. She had 3 from her first marriage and we wanted two of our own so she had to get a tubal reversal. Expensive.

We were able to conceive and have two beautiful children who we love very much, along with my three stepchildren who are now adult's and mostly moved out.

As expected we struggle as ALL parents do. 

We don't complain about having children, but dear god the amount of work we put into them grants us the leeway to vent now and then.

While I would definitely agree there are parents who martyr themselves and are fucking obnoxious doing it, most of us just need moments of appreciating the exhaustion that comes with it.

The whole, "you chose to have kids so shut yer yap" is just as bad and ignorant of a position as those parents you are talking about.

When you get a job, whether you love or hate it, it's going to have its moments when you will definitely complain or vent your frustrations. You are allowed to do that, even if you were the one who accepted the job offer.

Hopefully you aren't martyring yourself and telling people whose job is less rough than yours, that they don't know what you are going through.

We all have a soapbox to stand on.
