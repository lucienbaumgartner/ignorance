YTA. You sound really immature and unaware of the realities of being an adult. People share apartments to *split the cost of the bill.* If your old roommate could afford to live alone they probably would. Your decision to move in with your bf or barely occupy your room has nothing to do with said roommate. Whether or not you keep your shit there, your name is on the lease and they can’t rent it out to someone else who would pay 50%. Offering you to pay only 25% of the electric bill is generous of them. Your bf suggesting that this is “unfair” says a lot about his understanding of adulthood and responsibility in general. Consider how he will regard you and any financial obligations that don’t convenience him in the future, because it all comes back around eventually. Cough up the $$ and apologize to your roommate for being ignorant about the basics of roommate etiquette and bill paying.
