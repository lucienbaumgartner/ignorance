I’m a Buddhist and nearly all of the statues of the Buddha have halfway closed eyes to symbolize him being in a meditative state but the eyes aren’t fully closed to indicate that he isn’t blind and unaware of what is around him despite him being in a meditative state. Maybe the much older statues are a bit different since their appearance has changed quite a bit over the centuries but no, it’s not to align the statue’s appearance regionally since in Buddhism it is stated that a Buddha will only ever be born in India as an Indian so, there’s no reason as to why Buddhists would want to believe otherwise.
