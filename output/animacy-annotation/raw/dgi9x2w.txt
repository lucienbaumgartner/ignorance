I was at my partners parents house for thanksgiving last year. We were chilling upstairs in her sisters room smoking their bong. Earlier that day we all made cookies with the whole family. There was a bunch left and we were super hungry. They all ask me to go get the cookies. Now i'm high as giraffe pussy and unaware that her parents are downstairs watching tv near the kitchen. I walk downstairs and her parents must have heard some of the conversation and say "Oh are you here to get some cookies for you and the girls?" I panic not wanting to look greedy or something and loudly say "NO", walk over grab the cookies and run upstairs...
