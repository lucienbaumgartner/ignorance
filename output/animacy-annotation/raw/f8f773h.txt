That's because most people totally misunderstand the book. 

Only the outer party in the book was under surveillance.  

The rest of the population (86% of the population) was just kept so poor and ignorant that it did not matter what they thought so they were expressly not under surveillance.  

"Double-Speak" was a central feature of the book, but that has become so common now that people don't comprehend it anymore and just think "duh, surveillance" when they think of the book.  

It's a brilliant book that predicted much of what is going on today, but since people only read it in 7th grade or just hear about it from others as "that surveillance book", no one understands it.
