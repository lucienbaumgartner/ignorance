It most definitely WILL be a problem in the future for warranty claims, plus they could have done a shitty job installing it.

Volkswagen is VERY unhappy about people messing with the wiring harnesses, security systems, and tuning. If it causes a problem they most definitely will not warranty any work related to the mod.

There is no way to install a security system on a Volkswagen. There is no manufacturer-certified option, other than what's installed from the factory on SEL Premium vehicles (not including the immobilizer which is installed on all vehicles).

Same applies to remote starts: if you don't use their factory starter and have a dealer install it, they will not warranty problems with the wiring harness. A lot of those third-party remote starters involve messing with or *disabling* the immobilizer which is fucking crazy and of course VW will not help you there either.

Of course, I don't know what the franchise agreements spell out but I'm pretty sure either their VW rep is complacent or dull and unaware of it.
