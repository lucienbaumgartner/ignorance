One thing you could do is make their "evil" attributes be a mixture of slander and misunderstandings from people who only saw them from afar. Even better if they have similar beliefs on the "good" races.

Orcs are seen as brutish, disgusting invaders, when in reality they're displaced people who are attacked whenever they try putting down roots, and because no one will trade with them they have learned how to intimidate and terrify villages into giving them supplies. To them, humans are vicious hoarders who never bathe and get confused why they keep dying of sickness, who claim everything belongs to them and them alone, and will chase you to the ends of the earth to take what little you have if you ever show weakness.

The Drow nobles are constantly striving for more power, dancing around one another politically, brainwashing, enslaving, and hiring impressive outsiders to show off, some few even sacrificing slaves to demons for flashy powers and a new tool to weaken an opponent. The average drow though will just go about their life as a human peasant would; indifferent and unaware of the goings on of noble families, and glad they're not a human on the surface. Imagine being forbidden to travel from home, unable to read or write if you're not stolen away from your family by priests as a child, and if you ever step out of line you'll be deemed a heretic and burned at the stake while your neighbors cheer and declare it the will of their demonic god.

Adventurers would probably make the problem worse as well, even unintentionally. No one cares about the goblinoid farmers that offered their barn for the night and some stew, get to the part where two days later you saved a princess from being eaten by snake people!
