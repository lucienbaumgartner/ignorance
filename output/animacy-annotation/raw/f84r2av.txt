Okay so you respond to my rant about patronising comments from people older than me by another load of patronising comments. 

Let me ask you a question: do you really think I'm so stupid and ignorant that I don't know that the internet changed the way we do things? This is exactly what I'm talking about, you assume I have no general knowledge of what things were like before. I'm not 7, I know at least to some extent what life was like before I was born. 

I never said the internet didn't change things. That's really not my point. My point is that it doesn't mean I didn't play outside, it doesn't mean I didn't have a proper childhood or an enjoyable childhood and it doesn't mean someone who grew up without the internet is in any way superior. People act like them not having the internet as a child is equivalent to them going through some sort of hardship that I didn't go through. You didn't suffer from not having the internet if none of your friends did either. You didn't suffer from having a slow internet connection if that's what all internet connections were like. 

And just to add, it's the ignorance about what technology I actually did have a child annoys me as well. I'm 17 so no I did not have a smartphone in my pocket from as soon as I learnt to walk. I only really started using one from the age of 13. I had VHS tapes when I was little. I didn't use the internet at all really when I was a child except for club penguin and school work. I've had millenials assume I don't know how to use CDs and DVD players before when movie streaming has only become popular in maybe the last 5 or so years. I still use DVDs and CDs occasionally now. 

The internet has changed the world in the sense of making a lot of things easier and quicker. Sure there are downsides but the positives outweigh the negatives in my eyes.
