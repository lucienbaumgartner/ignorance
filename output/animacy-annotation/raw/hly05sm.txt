I agree. But don't forget that for every left winger villifying him, you had right wingers trying to prop him *and* his case as paramount to the very constitution.  
People posting about how they *cried* when he was found innocent because they "couldn't imagine being that young and having to go through that" are clearly way too sheltered and ignorant of the shit that goes on both in this country and the world. We need reforms on a lot of levels, but each side only wants half and refuses to work with the others to enact betterments for us all.
