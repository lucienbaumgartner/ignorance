You do realize that only approximately 160 million voted out of a population of almost 330 million. Biden also received more votes than any president ever.

I'm sorry your experience with the "western media" has been bad, but it's narrow minded and ignorant of you to lump all Americans into one category. You are perpetuating the exact thing you are saying is wrong. Gtfoh.
