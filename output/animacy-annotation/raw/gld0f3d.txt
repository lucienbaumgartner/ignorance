Glad you received some good advice here. I’m a historian. I started my bachelor degree at 22, and finished my PhD at 34. I found employment just before completion of my PhD. 

I was a very weak high school student; unfocused, uninspired, and unaware of my abilities when I applied myself. I decided to do a trade, and after completing decided to go to university. I excelled when I was finally studying something I was passionate about. 

You’re certainly not too late to begin working toward your goal. Don’t let a weak academic record in your past stop you. As a young adult, you have more life experience, more maturity, you understand your interests better, and your brain has undergone physical and chemical change that allows for easier acquisition of knowledge. All of this will help you to find it easier and more enjoyable to study than earlier in your education. 

It will be a ton of work, and you have to focus and ask critical questions about what you are learning, but it is possible. I find that, although there are lots of brilliant people at universities who have excelled throughout their educational journey, there is also a significant contingent who did poorly in high school but now excel at their studies.
