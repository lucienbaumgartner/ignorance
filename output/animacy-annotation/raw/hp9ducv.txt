There are multiple compilations of Crowder just telling instead of arguing an actual point... He isn't intelligent, he's loud, ignorant and stupid. 

Also anyone can talk to anyone, it is not impressive that Rogan has a "wide variety" of people on a podcast. Just as it isn't important that he also has a very select person on his podcast that either agrees directly with him or is ambivalent to avoid arguement. 

I never said you get your advice from them, but the way *you* are talking and the examples *you* and the logic *you* display are all directly 1:1 with Rogan and Crowder. I don't care how you vote cause it appears you are in a different country to I just by your mannerisms. 

I do, however, care that you give nitwits like Crowder and Rogan the time of day who deserve it far less than people who legitimately do good for this world.
