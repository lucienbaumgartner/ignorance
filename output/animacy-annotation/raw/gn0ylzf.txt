A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screenersâ€™s position, or make illegal contact with An opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, (Why WCS tipped and domed him. Do you not try and catch your falls by instinct?)  or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given the opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, (durhurrdur) or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed legal position. The screener may move in the same direction path of the opponent being screened. (Again, not allowed. WCS Trucked him. Because Trae set a bad/unfair screen.)
