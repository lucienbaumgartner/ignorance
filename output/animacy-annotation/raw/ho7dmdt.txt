A) your parents fucking suck!! B) check out r/tinytits - there aren’t 800,000+ subscribers because everyone hates small tits girl. 

I’m 27 and similar situation - every woman I share blood with has D’s or bigger and I’m also a 32a and it made me feel really insecure when I was younger. But you know what? People fucking love tiny boobs and if you love them then your life will be so much better. I love my tits now and so does everyone that is lucky enough to meet them. You HAVE to be confident. And confidence is one of those special things that you can literally fake it til you make it. 

Nsfw / TMI but it helped me watching porn stars with small boobs that everyone thinks are hot (long live Riley Reid who won MANY awards for being hot as shit with tiny little boobs just like mine and yours). I never wear a bra and I look cute as shit. I say go braless and embrace those babies. You will be surprised in the coming years how many guys LOVE your little boobies and how much attention and love they will pay them ❣️

Your parents are insecure and WRONG. Plenty of people will want to marry you and find you incredibly beautiful exactly as you are. I have INQUIRED throughout my life trying to decide if I should get a boob job and it seems to be a 50/50 split. Some people like big boobs and some people like small boobs. You will never be everyone’s type. But you know what’s awesome? Your dad doesn’t want to fuck you. They are toxic. Get out as soon as you can. 

“Are you guys really so insecure and ignorant that you feel the need to repeatedly degrade your own daughter?! I am BEAUTIFUL and I AM SEXY and I would appreciate it if you guys could never talk about my fucking boobs again. That is disrespectful and straight up weird for either of you to sexualize me or reduce my worth to the size bra I wear.” Then flash then a tit and skip away.
