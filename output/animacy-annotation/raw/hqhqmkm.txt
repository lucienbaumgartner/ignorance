5 years down the line, only the people who vibe with you are going to matter. If you can't find good friends in your class, look around more. In other classes or other colleges even. Non academic activities are a great way to meet new people. Being in IT, I'd recommend you participate in hackathons.

Only the unaware and unemphatic bitch about others. You're better off not having the toxicity they bring.
