&gt;What would have happened if Sang-Woo's plan didn't work in Tug-of-War. It didn't seem like there was any contingency for Il-nam.


This is a good question and definitely up for discussion. Maybe the man would have been fine to actually die in this scenario and it was worth it for him. Or there would have been some trick that occured while the losers were hanging while the rope wasn't cut yet. I don't think there's a real answer to this and everyone can decide for themselves.

&gt;So was the entire thing about "equality" in the games just BS? Il-nams presence is a complete violation of that notion. Even if he didn't tell others, he clearly knew the games and came equipped with strategy for his allies.

Well yes. The gamemakers talk about how equality and fairness is so important but it never is. I think that's one of the main themes of this show, how they are so privileged and ignorant that they think this game is in any way fair or positive for the players. 
So yes, the equality thing is bs but I dont think the people orchestrating the events realized it (because they didn't care to consider it)

&gt;Outside the game master, I wonder how many guards knew who he was (the ones in the marbles game clearly did - but what about elsewhere?).

I think most if not all of them knew. They were probably instructed not to shoot him in any round and even protect him in the hall where the players were inbetween games.
