I operate somewhere between blissfully-unaware and hyper-vigilant depending upon a lot of factors.  Getting pretty fed up with adults riding their bikes on sidewalks.  I tend to walk at a brisk pace and quickly get frustrated by people who stop suddenly and without apparent reason - the blissfully-unaware.
