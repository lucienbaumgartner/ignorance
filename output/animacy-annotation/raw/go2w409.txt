Always singing, "hearing music" in full symphonic stereo or having an internal dialogue in the background. Whenever things were dull I'd bring it to the forefront and amuse myself. Sexual attraction/fascinatiin with girls, even at six, whether my age or up to 30's. Acute sense of smell particularly people's skin, perfume and breath. Gregarious, outgoing, very talkative and unaware of people's dislike of me until they lost their temper or somebody told me. Often the first to know the answer in class and blurting it out before anyone raised their hand. Busy work was the bane of my existence, as well as homework and math drills.
