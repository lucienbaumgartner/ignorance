What are you babbling about?  You think the pandemic was bullshit?   

This sounds like more of that incredibly stupid "Fauci said we didn't have to wear masks but then later as the pandemic got worse he said we did so now he should be in prison!  MAGA!"

That sort of ignorant and intentionally thoughtless "contradictions" Trump supporters cry about while opposing all masks or vaccines?

Fucking morons.
