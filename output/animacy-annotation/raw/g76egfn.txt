You’re just making stuff up at this point lol

The guy’s literally on record saying he wanted to make the prospect of crossing illegally so abhorrent that it would serve as a deterrent.

My favorite part is when he got everyone all riled up about how we were about to get attacked by a caravan of illegal immigrants and the horror that the poor defenseless Americans were about to face then.... nothing lol

Actually live near a border and the ridiculousness of how strongly people hold opinions about things they’re completely unaware and unexposed to is saddening.
