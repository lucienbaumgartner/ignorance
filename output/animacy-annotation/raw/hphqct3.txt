Sokka gets shit for being a sexist pretty consistently in the fandom, and rightfully so I suppose, as he was sexist. But Sokka was 1. a literal child when he expressed those views, 2. he naturally grew out of this ignorant mindset as he learned more and met more people and realized his generalizations were not right. 3. he was literally the only "man" in his village for the entirety of his formative years- from childhood to \~16. Lastly 4. he saw his ignorance for what it was, apologized and learned his lesson. He lost his mother and then his father as a small boy and all the men left because it was their gender role- hard to not have some hardwired gender generalizations when those gender roles stole your dad. To accept that these roles are not universal and often fairly arbitrary is to have to admit his father leaving was not a 100% necessity, and yet he still does eventually learn! I think expecting him to have a developed sense of gender relations in such a bizarre circumstance is pretty unfair.

And more importantly, I have no idea why Sokka's sexism at the beginning of the show is constantly brought up, but Master Pakku is framed as a good guy. He was old as hell and had decades of life experience to draw on in order to not be ignorant, and yet he does something more sexist than Sokka literally ever does in refusing to teach a woman to bend, even throwing a hissy fit at the /literal Avatar/ for having the gall to teach his friend things. He cared more about being sexist than literally the fate of his tribe and the world. Psycho shit.

Then, he realizes he wanted to bang Katara's grandma, and this is \*literally the only reason\* he relents on his sexism. He has no other arc where he learns he was ignorant and IIRC didn't apologize either (yet Sokka did). Then grandma takes him back? and Katara is giddy about it? And it is never mentioned again that pussy is the only reason he stopped being a sexist, and not the looming genocide of his people or seeing Katara's power and realizing he was wrong, as happened with Sokka.

At least showing Pakku telling grandma that he met her granddaughter who taught him he was wrong about gender roles and had been ignorant and short sighted and apologize. Then I could stomach it. But as is he just shows up with her and they're engaged already.
