Too many Aussies find too much comfort in deliberately remaining naive and ignorant of politics. It is comforting to them and so they refrain from participating, preventing the rather horrid experience of  being aware.  
I often wish I could go back into the "oh, I don't understand politics" or " I don't do politics" mentality, it was a simpler existence and far less infuriating. It was so much easier to just pick one side and run with it back then. The media fed me what it wanted and I voted accordingly, but it was blissful ignorance.  


and it is definitely not 'cool' to be political in most middle to lower income brackets.
