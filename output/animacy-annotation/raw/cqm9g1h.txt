You'd think complete beginners would be the only people that would get hit by something like a stair stab or corner stab. Every time I see someone die to one of those I think "wow that guy is bad." It is so obvious what a spy is trying to do when they run up some stairs that the only people who should die to it are people who are new and unaware that a spy can kill them like that or bad and keep doing it even though they should know better.
