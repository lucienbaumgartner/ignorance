People who ask questions like this don’t seem to understand that Michael Scott was deliberately written to be offensive. That’s the point. He’s a terrible boss because he’s so unaware and offensive. He doesn’t have any friends because he is such a horrible person. Why would the show get cancelled, literally or figuratively, when this awful character is not rewarded for his bad behavior? 

The show is written as a critique of how power structures currently exist, with a moron like Michael being able to be in charge. People like Michael *still exist* and still hold positions of power. The appeal of The Office when it first aired was that it was *so relatable* to people who actually worked in offices. 

Cringe humor is still wildly popular today. The horror of the non-pc antics is the draw and appeal. The realism of the show is the appeal. Jfc I’m so tired of these one-dimensional, shitty “hot takes” of this show. It is expertly crafted and it’s sad to see the artistry of the show go so far above people’s heads.

Edit: editing to add that if you LOVE Michael and relate to him, you should really think about his character through a critical lens.
