Yes both sides are being pitted against the each other to distract you. The media will just keep fabricating controversy to keep you focused and unaware that problems like wealth inequality get worse every year. It doesn't matter if its trump or obama in power, the media will try to influence you.

Conservatives and liberals are both brainwashed in their own way.
