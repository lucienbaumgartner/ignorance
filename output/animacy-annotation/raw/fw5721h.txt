It could have literally killed them? If they had come off the mattress without waking - or if the mattress had deflated. In the first case there’s a chance of survival, in the second case they could have become caught up in the mattress and unable to save themselves. Falling off a floating item while awake is completely different to doing so when asleep and unaware that you’re even near the water.

You can’t honestly say there was no danger to OP with this prank.
