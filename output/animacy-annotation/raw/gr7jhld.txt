I understand that but with crypto, especially with their plans to be decentralized, they need to be transparent and build trust. 

The Pi network is not taking a typical route for a decentralized project (external financing and parent company, no open source code) We should all want transparency and we should have expectations. 

Simply holding and hoping for things to work out is pretty lazy and ignorant. Of course people want things to succeed because they will make money, but if we are complacent things will never take off and they will capitalize on our time and energy.
