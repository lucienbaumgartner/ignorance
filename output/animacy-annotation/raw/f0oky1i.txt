NTA

If you move somewhere where the official and majority language is different than your own, you must make an effort to learn it. Doing otherwise is simply foolish and ignorant.

That goes for anyone. English to Chinese, Spanish to English, English to Hindi, and vice versa, etc.

Stop translating for them though. Let them fail.
