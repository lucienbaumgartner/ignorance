I think it’s a lot of younger people here who don’t have much to invest to begin with and I get that. 5 years ago I hardly had much so I understand their sentiment but they’re just being reactionary and ignorant of it all. They can shit on it all they want, but that’s a lazy way of going about it. The world is changing and crypto is never going anywhere. The same people shitting on it are similar to those who shit on the internet in 1995.
