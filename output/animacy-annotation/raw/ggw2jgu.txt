He was raising Harry to be a weapon against Voldemort that could be sacrificed. His expectation was that Harry wouldn't be able to survive the damage that Voldemort had inflicted upon him by cursing him and taking his parents, nor would he be able to heal him because Voldemort would be actively hunting him down. At worst he was expecting Harry to become another Voldemort, a great evil that had to be put down, incapable of Love and Empathy, at Best he was hoping for another Snape, having enough emotion that he could be manipulated, but not enough to reverse the effects of the trauma he experienced. Harry far exceeds any expectation that Dumbledore had for him, and Dumbledore tells him this on multiple occasions, that his ability to not only Love, but Love Selflessly is astonishing. That it is what truly sets him apart from Voldemort and will allow him to survive. However, Dumbledore doesn't realize this until after Harry is already at Hogwarts, when he's watching him to discover the type of person that Harry has become because of his Trauma.

&gt;“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well—not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. **I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. **Thus far, my plan was working well.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced.* ***Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? **I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.” “I don’t—” “I cared about you too much,**” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

Not only was Dumbledore not expecting to Love Harry, he was actively trying to prevent it, but failed because of his Goodness.

&gt;*“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have—and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined—not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy?* ***I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, **but you had proved you were exceptional**. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon…

All of this is taken from Chapter 37 of Order of the Phoenix, after Sirius Dies and Harry is returned to Hogwarts raging in his Grief. There's a lot more story and explanation going on in this scene between Harry and Dumbledore, so it kinda gets lost within the information dump. I highly encourage you to reread the chapter, and other chapters in previous books where Dumbledore and Harry are together. 

I don't believe that Dumbledore had a plan to save Harry until after the events in the Graveyard in book four where Voldemort takes Lily's sacrifice into his body, redoubling the bond between Harry and Voldemort. That's why he stalls so long to tell Harry about the prophecy, because he's slowing realizing that he's come to Care and Love Harry, and he's hating himself for what he knows must happen, that Harry must die to Voldemort. He doesn't want to do it, he's stalling because he wants to save Harry. However he knows can't save Harry and the wizarding world at the same time, but then Voldemort does something so incredibly stupid and ignorant that he has hope that Harry can be saved too.
