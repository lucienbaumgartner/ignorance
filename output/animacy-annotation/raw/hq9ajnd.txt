&gt;The truth is that most anti-crypto people arn't actully interested in the space. They are interested in "moral superiority"

You say this in a way that makes it sound like a bad thing to try and be moral or ethical.   I don't invest in businesses that I feel are not aligned with ethical practices.  

I am fully prepared that you will argue that I still purchase things from companies that exploit child labour, and that I am not without sin etc etc, and I do accept that I am not perfect nor do I always make perfect choices, however when I am presented with a situation in which I am very clearly able to distinguish good from bad, such as the cult following of crypto, I do prefer to make what I believe to be the moral and ethical choice.   Not because it makes me feel superior, but because I believe it is the right thing to do. 

I am very "interested in this space", as I have numerous friends and family members trying to convince me to get involved, but all of the research I do leads me to be very wary of the whole thing, as it all smells like a cult, and is full of greed, ignorance and hysteria, and I believe it will all come crashing down. 

&gt;They will complain and point out every flaw they can find but will not interact with the market to improve it due to fear of being seen as "unclean"

What does this even mean?  How would buying crypto help to improve it, and who are we worried about calling us "unclean"??   If anything, crypto fans call everyone not involved "blind", and send through videos of "no-coiners" crying when the price goes up.   Crypto fans are in general more judgemental than anyone else, as they believe the world is evil and ignorant, and that governments, banks, corporates, and no-coiners are all blindly walking into a path of imminent destruction.   And only those wise ones who have invested in crypto will be saved from it.  

And this is not hyperbole.
