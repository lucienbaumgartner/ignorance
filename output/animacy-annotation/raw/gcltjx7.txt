one of my BIGGEST fears...now I will be reliving it again and again WITH you....I have read about this happening...thank GOD you could blink your eyes.

I woke up SCREAMING...in the middle of a colonoscopy....yeah, a colonoscopy. The doc was in a particularly tough curve in the intestine (and I am full of adhesions from endometriosis and previous surgeries) and it woke me up. The doctor growled at the assistant, "shut her UP!!" and I woke u p bawling like a toddler in the recovery room. I have to be FORCED to go have ANY procedures now.......

I am SO sorry you experienced this....but you are kind of lucky in that had you NOT been able to blink (sometimes the part of the medication that makes you unable to move will work, just not the part that keeps you asleep and unaware of the pain......horror stories!!  I used to be a surgical technologist and have heard of this happening more than you would think.....
