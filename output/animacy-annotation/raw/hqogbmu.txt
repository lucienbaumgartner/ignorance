You sound like me. I always loved my father but he is insecure and ignorant. That is the truth I took a long time to discover. Like your father, he rarely hit me but he verbally/emotionally abused me. He insults me to this very day when I see him (I no longer see him though) he feels entitled to do so. If I become upset, I am blamed. Its my fault somehow. 

He claims He loves me. He doesn't love me, he wants access to me so he can control me. Breakdown my self esteem to gain control. Basically it's domestic violence.

I am an adult woman on my own so I avoid him at all cost. At first I didn't see him as clear as I do now but I am of a certain age and I'm not falling for it anymore. He will not change. I am prepared to let him think whatever he wants, tell people whatever he wants. I've moved on. I have neutral feeling towards him like he is another human being, not my father. I don't have a father. 

Sorry for my rant but your father sounds like mine. I'm probably older than you and gave more chances and seen how he won't change, he just got worse because I got further and further away from him. He can only try to hurt me with words because he is just that limited as a person, even at his ripe age.
