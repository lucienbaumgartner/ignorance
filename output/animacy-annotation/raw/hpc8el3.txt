I have read most of those studies, and none of them could claim that they were able to create exactly equal cases for comparison.  How one acts in court, if someone has a history with the court, their circumstances and chances of rehabilitation, etc...  Many of the studies left out many important variables like previous crimes committed.  It isn't some "scientific truth".  Here is a tip, if something is coming from the field of sociology, you need to take it with a gigantic grain of salt.  Many scientists don't even consider sociology as a science, it has no predictive power and is easily influenced by ideologues.   Just look at all the university students who say that their sociology professors are rabidly partisan.  They could turn in well researched papers, but if they don't come to the exact same conclusion as the professor, they get an F.  Among STEM scientists, sociology is not regarded as particularly robust, and that is putting it kindly.  

Furthermore, read what I said again.  I was talking about minimum sentencing.  Minimums are created through law, a judge has no discretion in that.  So, to suggest that a judge somehow got around the law for white people is just an incredibly ignorant and stupid take.
