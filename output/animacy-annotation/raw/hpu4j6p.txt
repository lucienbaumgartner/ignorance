I saw you have posted similar question in r/Turkey .  This subreddit has many people, which are highly ignorant and uneducated.  In Turkey,  'payitaht abdulhamid' is streaming on TRT. .Don't trust their suggestions, they hate TRT's series just because of their political views and try to blame every TRT series as bad. ( TRT is the first turkish television channel and supports today's government, so the people from other political views think every TRT-produced film&amp;series is bad, even though it is only a prejudice)
