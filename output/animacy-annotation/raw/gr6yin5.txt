&gt; Another HUGE difference is that men aren't expected to constantly be on the lookout for potential muggers. Men aren't taught that it's their responsibility to predict who is going to mug them and who isn't, even with very limited information.

We are, though... I grew up in a household of only boys and it was: don't expose jewellery, hold your phone with both hands if you're using it, don't leave zips on bags exposed where you can't see them, avoid shady areas and always bring a torch, don't try to put up a fight and just run if it comes to it, and, even still into my late twenties, "call me so I know you got home safely"... and I grew up in a *good* area. Lord knows what it's like in cities.

I don't mean to belittle the plights of women, but I get the impression many of you seem to think we just get to walk through life completely unaware and unafraid... life's damn scary, and the only difference is that we have a bit better a chance of getting out of an altercation if it comes to it, but it doesn't mean we're not also looking for ways to avoid them.
