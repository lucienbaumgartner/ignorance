Well, the kid does have a point, they make everyone cringe.  So stupid, so fake, so dishonest.  And as this tweet illustrates, so self-righteous and unaware that they really are the "bad guys".

We want a free and fair press, that's why we are opposing you.  Just report the facts, please.  You can even criticize Donald Trump when you write editorials, that's fine.  When it is 95% criticism, it is something other than the news, it is propaganda, that's our point.
