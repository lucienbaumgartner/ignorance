I found an iPhone on the sidewalk one night while coming home from work. There was nobody around, so I picked it up and luckily it wasn't password protected.

I could've easily taken it home with me and never tried returning it, but I opened up the Facebook app instead, found out who it belonged to, and posted my cell number on his wall explaining how I had found it.

Soon enough I got a call from some girl who had seen the post, claiming she was with him and he was really drunk and unaware that he had even lost the phone. I gave her a location where I could give it back, but she said it would have to wait until the morning. 

The next morning, the owner of the phone calls me, confirming that he can come pick it up. I tell him the main intersection to meet me at and says hell be about 30 mins. While I wait. I decide to look through his pictures to get an idea of what he looks like. 

From what I can see he sort of looks like a scumbag. White dude with 'gangster' clothing, lots of self shots,  pictures of him trying to look cool with weed... and then lo and behold I come across pictures of him taking self shots of himself holding his erect cock. 

By the time he comes to meet me all I can think of when seeing him is the pictures of him and his dick, and I think he knew that I knew, because it was extremely awkward. He ends up giving me 5 bucks and saying "Thanks bro" and that was pretty much it. He was acting like it was weird that I had gone out of my way to return the phone.

I thought I would feel really good about myself but it was actually just really anticlimactic. He didn't strike me as the kind of guy that would have even thought of returning a phone. For all I could tell he could've stolen the phone in the first place. 

Either way I did what I thought was right and I'm contributing the story here because no one knows I did this.

**TL;DR I found a lost iPhone which I returned to its owner after seeing the pictures of his dick on it.**
