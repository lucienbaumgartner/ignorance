I know you're annoying as fuck and completely oblivious to the fact that it is in fact racist. 

Did you not even read when I said Xs sound like Zs or are you that stupid and ignorant that it's blinding to you? 

The girlfriend is the AH because she chose to just say ching chong and stereotype. It's not her mispronouncing and it's not her looking up the lyrics to get it right. It's her being an ignorant asshole. 

You can go back and forth with me all you want dude, but unless you actually experienced racism in one way or another, you're just going to think it's perfectly fine.
