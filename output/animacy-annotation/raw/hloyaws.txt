This is the thing about it, it’s hard to consider veganism when it seems inherently white washed, Eurocentric and ignorant of the people they stole the land off of. 

I do not need to eat animal products at all. It’s not culturally required. However, our cultural practices are so entwined to the land I can’t give up everything. I use shells to pray. I wear my totem animals. I give culturally appropriate gifts to my Spirit Guides. I make, use and wear ceremonial regalia that has used animals parts from the beginning of time. We’re trying to save our culture. I can eat vegan, but I can’t give up prayer and dance and generational teachings and customs. I won’t fail to act in accordance to my Elders when duty requires.

Eta: and asking Northern Indigenous people to give up their culture and diet when they still heavily rely on it is a straight up joke.
