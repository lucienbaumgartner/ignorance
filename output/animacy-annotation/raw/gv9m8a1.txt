First thing to do is confirm if she is aware of it.  

If she's just naive and unaware that can potentially be more easily addressed.  If she knows it and is either exploiting it or doesn't give a fuck, then you should just reevaluate what you think of her.

Life's too short to spend your life on someone who views people as objects to manipulate and use.  It's also too short for a relationship with someone who doesn't care about you or value you.

If she's naive and then gets into denial when everything is laid out for her, then that is a bit more complicated.
