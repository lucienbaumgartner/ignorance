[Here’s 13 pages of lies that Donald Trump has stated](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false), with 20 verifiably untrue statements per page, and articles explaining how and why each statement is untrue. [According to a paper published by the American Anthropological Association](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/amet.12475), “by all metrics and counting schemes, his lies are off the charts.” 

The cheating part depends on what they meant. Perhaps they meant his constant cheating in his business practices, such as scamming over 6000 students out of tuition money with worthless classes at a quickly defunct university or, in the words of the NY Attorney General, the “persistently illegal conduct” perpetrated by his charitable foundation, such as self-dealing and illegal campaign contributions. The 2017 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting was actually won by David Fahrenthold for his initial investigatory work into the illegal practices of the Trump Foundation, because he was not in fact, as you put it, “making shit up.” There is an *excessive* amount of evidence and proof, and if you’re interested in educating yourself on even more of it you can read the documents pertaining to the ongoing state investigation.

Of course by using the word “cheating” in regards to Trump, the person you responded to might also have been simply referring to his extramarital affair with Stormy Daniels, which you might remember from his long time personal attorney now being in prison due to the related campaign finance violations made “in coordination with and at the direction of,” you guessed it, Donald J. Trump. 

“Treasonous” could be referring to multiple things, perhaps the conclusion of the Mueller report that enough evidence exists to indict Trump on obstruction of justice were he not a sitting president, along with its finding that there is reasonable suspicion of the Trump campaign having colluded with Russia which is likely not provable beyond a reasonable doubt because of the obstruction of justice committed by Trump firmly established in the report. The false attempts to spin the report as an exoneration of Trump were concretely denied by Robert Mueller in his letters to William Barr. [Here’s a lawyer’s explanation of what you need to know in order to understand the findings of the Mueller report](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f71Rasj_0JY); with that in mind you should give it a read. There is plenty of your desired evidence and proof  within.

Now, their reference to treason might also be in relation to Trump’s [repeated violations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/trump-facing-emoluments-lawsuits-heres/story%3Fid%3D65217053) of the [emoluments clause](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-and-foreign-emoluments-clause/) of the [US constitution](https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/old-uploads/originals/documents/Trump%20and%20the%20Emoluments%20Clause.pdf), perhaps it’s referring to the Veselnitskaya meeting, perhaps it’s referring to the outing of secure intelligence to the Russians that resulted in the extraction of one of the CIA’s top informants in Russia, perhaps it’s referring to him personally ordering his staff to freeze almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before he pressured the Ukraine president eight times in the span of one call to investigate his political opponent...there’s so many possibilities it’s impossible to say what they were referring to specifically.

To say something like “You can’t just make up shit about someone because you don’t like him” is either so dangerously misinformed and ignorant that you absolutely should not be saying anything on the matter, or it’s possibly because you’re a part of the wave of Russian agents, trolls, and bots (including but not limited to the ones that were proven to have influenced Trump’s win in the 2016 election and the ones having already commented on this post) that come out in droves whenever Trump is receiving particularly bad press, as he currently is now in regards to the Ukraine fiasco. One or the other.
