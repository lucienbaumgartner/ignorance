&gt; I would just like to point out to the casual observer that you went VERY deep into my post history for that quote, it's actually a little off-putting.

I searched your username and "free". It took 10 seconds.

&gt;The refill is actually, factually

And that's **exactly** how people are using in regards to healthcare. When they talk about "free" healthcare nobody means it's paid for by the healthcare fairy. They mean there is no additional charge beyond what they've paid for in taxes, regardless of how much healthcare they need and receive. 

Which I literally just explained, but you're apparently too addlebrained to understand. 

&gt;It's a very good measurement of how it is deceptive that you're willing to spend hours pouring through my post history desperately trying to find some way to defend it.

I'm not being deceptive at all, and I wouldn't bother spending any significant time on your intentionally ignorant and pointless argumentative ass. I could have a more productive conversation with my dog, and he's an idiot.
