Oh I have no doubt that we'll figure it out. 

I already see the path. 

The point is that every time we have to rise to the occasion due to a new paradigm shift. Many die. Many suffer.

The scale of this particular issue will command an equal scale of suffering. We can't afford to be wrong on this one. We cannot afford to compete. This is a prisnors dlimea we must realize exists before we are jailed, otherwise we will be unaware and unable to act in a way that assures survival. 

Some people think cheap products and productivity are the goal that needs to be optimized. In reality we need to all agree that optimizing our management of resources and the enviroment in relation to sustainable growth is the real variable that needs optimizing.

I agree that it is a Malthusian_trap, but he admits "The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress." We are not considering all factors. We are already putting severe stress on our planets biodiversity. Biodiversity that took millennia to form. We can never replace the natural feedback loops that the planet has formed. We are not yet Gods. Soon those feedback loops will not be causing harm in flora and insects, but increasingly more and more mammals until it reaches us.

The people of suffering will be too great this time. Unprecedented, because it will be caused by an unprecedented new technology that leads to efficient never seen before on this planet. In my mind, It will be the first artificial conscious mind. Allowing us to exhaust our resources tirelessly. Productivity will skyrocket, at the cost of the enviroment itself. Similarly to the Industrial revolution. Productivity skyrocketed, life was harder during the transition for farmers, but we never recovered the enviroment from the disasters of our new found growth. It's happening again. Before it was automation of our physical facilities, now It's automation of our mental capacities.
