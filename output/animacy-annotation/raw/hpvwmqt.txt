this is unfortunately an ignorant and unhelpful comment.  yes, you’re 16, but most gyno begins anywhere from 13-16 and is there to stay, with surgery being the only real solution for true gyno.

laziness has NOTHING to do with true gyno.  you can do cardio / HIIT / lift 6 times a week, eat healthy and avoid all dairy and sugar, but that pesky gland that is 100% hormonal and random can still peak its ugly head.

without making you feel bad, this looks like true gyno (puffy nipples, most likely, caused by enlarged gland).  but, im not a doctor, nor is the above poster, nor is anyone else on reddit.  your best bet is to visit a top rated surgeon, hear what they have to say, and run the gauntlet of tests that they may recommend.  but the reality is, true gyno (caused by gland, not “lazy” fat), will only disappear with surgery and gland removal.  

good luck to you, you absolutely have time on your side - and don’t feel bad or think this is caused by any “laziness” on your side.
