Kyle's defense lawyer was paid for buy a bit of a lunatic, who got Kyle posing with Blackrifle Coffee and junk just before the trial.

The Lawyer has done very little to help Kyle, and almost seems like he's trying to throw the case for the prosecutors to win.

But the prosecutor seems so incompetent and unaware that he cant help but lose anyways
