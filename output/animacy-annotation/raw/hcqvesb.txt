 Something that is known to be true also becomes evidently true in a particular case. 

 "Why conflict? I'm a nihilist anyway, supported by others like me, along with the fearful and ignorant of all classes and races; you make a difference to nothing except badly if I have my way with you."

 That isn't me, but what I understand of how some other people do think and process. 

 What I do have issues with are this: "What do you want?" Someone gives me trust or I believe they could be acting in good faith, and I'm beset by uncertainty because I don't know what that person wants. I attempt to trust or act in good faith, and I fear I'm not really doing it because I feel entrapped by a lack of communication about a potential system of interaction so I disbelieve that person would ask, "What do you want?" of me in honesty.
