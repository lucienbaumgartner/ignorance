The two of them are so fucking arrogant and ignorant that I can't even take it. David seems like a hollywood douche producer type who's probably banged at least one of the show's actresses. D.B. seems like an introverted weirdo who probably sees himself as an "artist" and actually believes his writing is on par w/ GRRM's. Together I bet they both believe that they're responsible for this show's success and any failures are the fault of the fans for having misguided expectations.
