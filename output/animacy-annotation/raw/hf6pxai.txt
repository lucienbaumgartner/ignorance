You are right in what way? Because the officer is in jail now? Nope. You didn't win anything and the case hasn't even started hahahahaha. How stupid and ignorant of the law do you have to be? 

The fact that you can't even defend direct comments about your country is hilarious. Because they are all facts. But you are proving once again that Americans can't read anything more than a couple sentences. Great work! 

PS: You are also wrong with your shitty update, as of 1 hour ago, there have been no disciplinary actions taken against this officer but there is going to be an investigation as there would be with an, according to CNN.

Other important aspects of the case - The person who was killed here was attacking a 15 year old with her 20 year old BF, also this person who attacked the 15 year old did not go to the school where she was shot (So she was trespassing and attacking students at this school). Good luck trying to convict this peace officer! He will be fired and given a full pension on your American tax dollars. And then there will be another shooting tomorrow in your stupid country full of guns. Rest easy and I will update you more later with this!
