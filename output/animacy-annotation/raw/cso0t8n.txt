When my husband and I first started dated, he was so clumsy and unaware that he would routinely give me bruises. He would apologize, not really do anything about the behavior, and make more similar mistakes later. He gave me a black eye once by elbowing me in the face while standing up from the couch. 

Needless to say he doesn't do that kind of thing anymore. 

It's  not about making someone feel bad over something that can't be controlled. Clumsiness isn't this.  This is an awareness issue. He's not taking the safety of others around him seriously enough. He might not think it's a thing that can be addressed. It might just be that no one has ever called him out on it in a way he understands.

 Clumsiness relates to balance, not awareness. This is not him being clumsy.  It's him not paying enough attention. It's the difference between sitting on a dog because your body went an different way then you expected it to, and sitting on a dog because you didn't know the dog was there.

Is it clear to him that he's putting others at risk?
