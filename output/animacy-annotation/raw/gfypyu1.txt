&gt;I never said that was a fact, although all evidence suggests that it is in pretty much every part of the world....

What evidence exactly? You just decided Cypriots and Armenians are killing their babies because it seems to you that maybe that's how it should be, which... I don't know how to explain to you how funny it is as a suggestion. Like, I live in a country that's basically the same as Cyprus in almost every regard, there are many, many Cypriots living here (as well as Armenians) and the suggestion is just so offensive and ignorant that it's simply laughable.
