&gt;How am I supposed to know your ethnicity when you never even mention it?

Like I said above, it does not matter. This obsession with blood quantum is awful. This is not how the Saami are. We are the children of the sun not children of eugenics. 

&gt;not someone worried about harassment in private messages. 

Yeah, well, you're not Saami. You don't know what I am talking about. Some right-wing Scandinavians get really mad about the existence of the Saami. I have been harassed IRL and harassed on the internet enough to be wary. 

&gt;Reddit is US centric as fuck, and no US citizens even know about Saami people. Unrelated, I was born on Mars and you should believe everything I say.

This is pretty ignorant and pretty insulting.

&gt;The gulag system was just a system of prisons you dork. 

I cited you a source *from gulag.online/articles/historie* saying you're wrong. Prove me wrong or shut up.

[Here's another](https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/social-science/law/crime/gulag) 

&gt;The Gulag scheme was adapted into the infamous concentration camp system used during World War II

[And another](https://thetogetherplan.com/holocaust-in-the-soviet-union/)

&gt;But the concentration camps are not where most of the victims of National Socialism and Stalinism died. These misunderstandings regarding the sites and methods of mass killings prevent us from perceiving the horror of the twentieth century.

&gt;How reliable are the available estimates of forced concentration camp labour in the Soviet Union?

[Encyclopedia](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/crime-and-law-enforcement/gulag)

&gt;An acronym for the Soviet bureaucratic institution, Glavnoe Upravlenie ispravitelnotrudovykh LAGerei (Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps), tasked with oversight of the Soviet forced-labor concentration camp and internal exile system

[So many sources](https://gulaghistory.org/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/)

&gt;Concentration camps were created in the Soviet Union shortly after the 1917 revolution, but the system grew to tremendous proportions during the course of Stalin’s campaign to turn the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power and to collectivize agriculture in the early 1930s.

Here is reference to what I was talking about with the forced farm labor or go to concentration camps for the forced farm labor. In the 30's, according to our histories, the Saami were forced to either give up their nomadic life to become farmers or go to concentration camps. 

[Here we have Gulag used for concentration camp in North Korea](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korean-gulags-terrible-or-even-worse-nazi-camps-auschwitz-n828751)

&gt;Satellite imagery shows the Sinuiju concentration camp (Kyo-hwa-so No. 3) — a reeducation camp in North Korea, on Oct. 29, 2016.

I don't know how you can still argue this is not true. 

&gt;The only thing the USSR did that you might disagree with is collectivize agriculture and raindeer husbandry.

There were 3 unique Saami cultures in the Kola peninsula, with at least three languages. Those languages are dead, those cultures are dead. Dead to concentration camps, dead to forced labor. 

You self admittedly know nothing about the Saami and now you are *telling me a Saami* my history?

&gt;And during and leading to WWII, it was the Norwegians who were aligned with the NAZIs who tried to genocide the Saami people.

Saami have been the target of genocide for over 500 years. There have been **two attempted complete genocides** in the last 4000 years. In the last 100 years there have been 120k+ Saami sterilized between Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia. 

&gt;I'm going to need some real sources that 20K Saami people were sterilized by the USSR, because even the most anti-communist propagandists don't claim that.

No. You insult me and ask me to educate you. Educate yourself. Go buy the books of the histories, don't read the propaganda on the internet. If you want to look at that propaganda there's some pretty ridiculous racist stuff like saying we bite off reindeer testicles. It's pretty fun.

I doubt you will but as an olive branch I can give you books to read - primary sources from the Saami ourselves. 

&gt;I know you don't care if I think you're lying because you're a disgusting propagandist and NAZI apologist, who is trying to pin the war crimes of the SS on the Soviets.

The Saami were in the Nazi concentration camps. I don't know how much you know about WW2 history, but here's some free education. There is this idea that 5 million Jewish people were killed and 6 million others. Well, that second number was made up on the spot when someone needed a number to compare the Jewish dead too. 

According to Jewish historians in the last couple of decades it looks more like 5 million Jews and 30 million other ethnicities.

You're seriously barking up the wrong tree there. 

&gt;You're probably a holocaust denier too

The Saami were in the Nazi concentration camps. When the Nazi's fled into Norway they destroyed a massive amount of Saami cultural infrastructure. 

This is like telling a Jewish person they deny the holocaust because they have information you simply **don't want to accept.**

&gt;who is trying to pin the war crimes of the SS on the Soviets

In your world, did the Soviets not commit war crimes? Did they not commit atrocities? 

The Nazi's targeted us. The Soviets targeted us. The Norwegian government, the Swedish government, the Finnish government - they all targeted us. The catholic church stole our spirituality from us. 

The Swedes had an exhibit in their national museum dedicated to Saami genetic inferiority using actual Saami bodies. 

You don't know what you're talking about. Why are you acting this way?

I don't know how to respond to this, honestly, beyond showing you that you are factually incorrect. It is so insulting and you probably don't even care.
