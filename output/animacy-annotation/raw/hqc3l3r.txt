I think he was a lil too off putting with his boys club stuff. Michael was sexist too but in an ignorant and lovable way (I thought). DeAngelo was just a dikk. 

I get what you mean. But he had “good” moments which muddied the water and didn’t make him too much of a juxtaposition.   

But I like his ending. I thought those episodes were okay.
