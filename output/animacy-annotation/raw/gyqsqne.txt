I cannot endanger others with a disease I do not have. This is why I keep telling you this is a mental illness.

The statistics on asymptomatic spread are miniscule. It is not a risk. Even if I were sick and unaware of it, I am not a risk to anyone I am in close (3ft) proximity to for less than 15 minutes - therefore, I am not a risk to people I pass in a store, a checkout clerk, a waitress in a restaurant, or my kid's preschool teacher. That is actual science. That is reality. 

Your blithering about "societies \[sic\] rules" isn't because of social responsibility or even courtesy - it is catering to a mental illness, and I don't need to do that. I refuse to do that. It is not reality; it is insanity.
