What an incomplete narrative lol. What happened after the 4 wins? Wins aren't a QB stat and it's only the uninformed and ignorant that use them to evaluate an individual player. But if you're going to reference wins, at least tell the whole story. 

I'm glad you brought up The Athletic. Do you follow Mark Bullock?
