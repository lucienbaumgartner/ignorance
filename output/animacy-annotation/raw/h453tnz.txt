&gt;If you don't like life, you're mentally ill, because only the mentally ill would not be enjoying life.

That's not the logic I am using. So it can't be circular logic, and also this is clearly your strawman of my position. 


&gt;If you even TRY to assert control over your bodily autonomy 

You don't have control over if you are alive or dead. You don't get to control being born into life, and you wanting to end that life despite your biological drivers that do whatever they can to keep you alive. Ya your mentally ill, and need help.

&gt;Basically, you're trying to assert totalitarian control over other people's bodies based on a religious conception of what the value of life is. It's disgusting

You are a moron. This has nothing to do with religion.

You are ignorant as fuck when it comes to mental illness. Do you know why there's so many schizophrenics on the streets in California? It's because we don't force them to take medication. Your position is so stupid, and ignorant that it'll litteraly lead to death of mentally ill groups. Because you are stupid enough to believe your ideology applies 100% to everything. Your disgusting.
