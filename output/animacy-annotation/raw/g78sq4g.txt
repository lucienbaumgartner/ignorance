"In Short Program, the final GOE must be -5 if the Jump Element is not according to requirements. This means for
example that the Jump Element has wrong number of revolutions, jump is repeated or jump combination has only one
jump and the sign +COMBO."

I just realized that you think she should get -5? Are you that biased and unaware of when +COMBO should actually be  notated? Unreal.
