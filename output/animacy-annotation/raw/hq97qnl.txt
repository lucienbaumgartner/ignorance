Lightening network doesnâ€™t do what you think it does for privacy. Not to mention that with the total supply almost minted and all these transactions that have gone on a public distributed ledger (and continues to) the chain is compromised in terms of privacy. Bitcoin is very much traceable today as it was before. It is what it is. To suggest that bitcoin transactions are private is absurd. This also is not default privacy. So even if they were as you claim they are (they are not private) one user not using would comprise the next. That would be like using an optional model in which I send you $50 bucks Zcash. It is known that your address received that Zcash. Regardless if you shield your transactions. All the other users and transactions compromise the rest. Default privacy from the start is the only way to achieve true privacy with crypto currencies. Saying al otherwise is ridiculous, ignorant and wrong.
