I still havent played P4 but isn't the idea just that Kanji is gay and unaware that Noato is a girl cuz she dress, talks, and acts like a dude? Did the guys think Noato is trans or non-binary. And as an outsider having only seen clips from the animes dub is Kanji not gay, from what I remember isn't that why people shit talk Yosuke for his homophobia towards Ryuji. 

Lastly is P4 really worth it, I slogged through P5 because I only had hype burnout after finishing Harus palace and the art really carried me after that, fuck Sae's palace though for real
