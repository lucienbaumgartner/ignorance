&gt; Not ignorant just no control.

You are in fact ignorant and wrong about all kinds of things. Like claiming the US ranks 18th on healthcare when the actual study ranks it 68th. 

Not to mention even 18th would be a disgrace when you're spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars more per person on healthcare.

And here's a life pro tip. When you have absolutely nothing to add to a conversation, just don't say anything. You're only wasting your time and mine with pointless comments about how you don't care enough to comment.
