I do costuming and alt-fashion, and I go to events often that aren't just on "costume-appropriate" holidays so to speak. I vaguely remember being in like, a full fucking drag beat with glued down brows and bright red contacts and my neck completely painted black from my chin to chest with latex doing some kind of goth look, and some person just had the audacity to tell me 'that's too much makeup, it's way too intense.' Like, as if I thought this was the appropriate day time work-wear look I was going for? They were like, totally shocked and unaware that costuming makeup art existed. I'm literally carrying around a staff with a human skull on it. Missed the fucking point entirely lol.
