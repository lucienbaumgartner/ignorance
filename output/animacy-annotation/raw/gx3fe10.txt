You realize that the vast majority of careers require a college degree, right? Y’know, most things STEM.

People who go to college tend to be productive members of society. Having a more knowledgeable society benefits everyone...have you ever wished there were less idiots? Well, better access to education means less idiots.

Real cynical and ignorant of you to assume people go to college for “underwater basket weaving”.
