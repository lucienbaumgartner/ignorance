&gt; Modern fascism is all about espousing beliefs that one isn't really sincere about. 

There's more to it than that, actually.

Having a public life means your career relies on your visibility to everyone. Doing outrageous things to attract eyeballs, however insincere or throwaway on a deeper level, help to bolster that visibility. The visibility, in turn, opens up access to more things that give you material benefits as well as platforms that afford you even better visibility. From here, we can see that visibility is, for all intents and purposes, capital for YouTube talking head-type public figures, and by manufacturing controversies, they *capitalise* on supporters and detractors alike that are, at the end of the day, free labour for the generation of spectacles, which are then sold to media and sponsors for profit. If you are in your adolescence or twenties, this neoliberal formula for "success" is one that has practically been drilled into your head regardless of you being unaware, and White as well as those around her were simply following it the way they were taught.
