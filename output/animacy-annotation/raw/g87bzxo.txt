I’m not talking specifically about the masks only but yea, again, I’m not trying to generalize to that degree. I’m not saying ALL white people are like that or ALL first world country inhabitants are like that. However, manyy are. Essentially what I’m trying to say is how entitled and fortunate they are (which is ok of course) but how insensitive and ignorant that can lead them to be.
