Unfortunately,  parents don't always understand or aren't capable of giving you the emotional support you need. Abuse is a complex thing, and I would argue a lot of people don't get off without emotional scars from parents. My mom falls into this ambiguous category were she can be a very good and nurturing parent, but her parenting falls apart when she drinks, and she is in denial about many important issues. 

In your case (this is just speculation since I don't know you), it seems like your mom could be scared and unaware of mental health issues, so she responded in anger. It can be very hard to deal with parents that don't understand, and even when you make progress, they may never get there. 

The best thing I can say is everyone's journey is different to healing, and you should work towards what you think will help you the most. Maybe if you have another honest conversation with your mom, she might let you start therapy, which could equip you with better tools to cope with your family. If your mom refuses to give in, you can try to find community supports in your school or even get your own therapy appointments if you are independent enough to go without your mom's consent. As for the abuse, if you feel really unsafe or uncomfortable, you can try to reach out to the community or get a 3rd party involved to deal with your case. 

Everyone's parents are different, so the right approach will never be the same for everyone, but you seem to have a few things figured out and I believe you will find the right way to deal with your trauma.
