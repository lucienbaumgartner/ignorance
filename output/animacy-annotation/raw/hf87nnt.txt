FY22 budget hasn’t passed yet and the Progressive  left. Bernie Sanders and AOC publicly stated they want to cut our pay and DOD expenditure. They weld   massive influence in the Democrat party. Bernie Sanders is in charge of the Budget proposal. 

No I am not lying. I am stating facts. Sorry if you disagree. And hey genius. You know it’s Congress and the Senate that passes the Budget right? 

You know that the Dems has the majority last year in the Senate and Congress? So In reality we could say the fy21 was bi-partisan. Wasn’t Trumps budget

Inflation is going higher then 2.7 percent and also you need to post the reference for that number since your are spewing numbers. Show proof and put up. 

I love how your trying to tell me Dems actually support the military. Blind and ignorant of facts. Please show reference and then subtract that from this years and next years inflation.
