What a load of horseshit. Yeah, Trump was wrong to say it was a obama's policy, that isn't true but obviously it was just lazy wording. It was from before Obama's presidency but obama DID separate kids and cage them. The child separation policy is not trump's policy either. Both were wrong in their statements but shepard smith is far more wrong.

What changed in Trump's administration is not that they started caging kids whereas obama gave them a "pass". That isn't at all true. Obama DID cage kids because that was the policy to separate kids from adults who were being charged with a crime. What changed is that Trump's administration started prosecuting adults for crossing the border illegally. They were separating kids before but now more were being separated because every adult was being charged and the law required them to separate them in that event. Trump ended that policy that existed before he became president so that he could continue charging adults without unnecessarily separating kids as a side effect. The goal was to punish adults for breaking our law rather than just letting them get away with coming here illegally.

It's disturbing that our media and politicians are so dishonest and ignorant that people still don't know this shit. There should have never been any confusion on this if they actually did their job and informed people rather than trying to play politics and mislead people for their own agenda.
