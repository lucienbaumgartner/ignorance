My problem is how these things intersect. Summing this up to being just about one problem is short sighted and ignorant of other impacts decisions will have than just the ones that are being loudly considered. Cheers to you as well. I reply only as this is a forum where Iâ€™d like to see these points be made available to others who may wish to have multiple points of view on the e subject, and all the necessary context that needs to come with it.
