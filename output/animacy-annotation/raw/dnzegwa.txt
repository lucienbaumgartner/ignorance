My thoughts: He realizes that aliens are from the future, a future version of us traveling through dimensions and parallel universes. He finds a way in 2048 to come back in time and warn us. Being that this drunk man might be of an age where he is not yet born, just at t legal drinking age, or alive right now and is a small child - he figures out a way to move through time like the aliens that have invaded earth in 2048. Coming back, he takes a look around, see's Trump in the white house, how we are going about our days, completely unaware and unawakened to the realities of our existence. He begins losing hope. Each day on earth in 2017 is a horror he only heard about, before aliens took over mankind and made us their slaves in 2048. The growing sense of hopelessness increases with every passing day until finally he witness our president tossing paper towels to crowds of people. All hope is lost. He goes to the local bar in Wyoming where the portal opened up and said "fuck it" - he began to drink until it numbed the pain of the dooming imminent reality of our species.
