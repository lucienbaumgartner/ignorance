It sucks but I think with dating we tend to expect people to come fully formed and well packaged but this is so rarely the case.

I didn’t understand emotional intimacy until my most serious relationship ended and now I am much more attuned.

I might get crap for saying this but maybe some people need time to get there and they’re being written off too quickly so they will never get the chance to learn how to give and receive emotional intimacy (unless it’s in a therapy setting which btw I think directing everyone to therapy is becoming so lazy and ignorant of the fact that people are messed up because of the way systems have programmed us to treat each other and not just due to traumas).
