He snuck in to view kylo's mind while Kylo was asleep so that he was unaware and unable to hide things (Luke having sensed some of the dark already).  He also didn't want Kylo to feel like he was being treated with suspicion by having him conscious for a search like this.  

Luke was basically checking where kylo was at, and how was his own progress with helping kylo.  He was completely shocked and horrified at the depths of the darkness Kylo had been hiding, growing darker while with the only person he felt could turn him away from the dark (himself). He's totally floored by it, and has no solutions. He has a brief imagining of the probable future of Kylo's unchecked descent, and it's terrible.  

1 life versus millions of lives?

He panicked. It's amazing he stayed his hand at all given the stakes. I think it was morally incorrect to not kill him, given that Kylo was getting worse, not better, even before this incident.
