I work with a few of them.  They just do not believe anything mainstream media tells them.

When the internet and the web first came out, I saw it as a possible for e for good, democratizing information and ideas.  The reality is that most people do not have the capacity to use it responsibly.   Instead it has become a sewer of racist poison and reality ignoring reinforcement, preying on those ignorant and uncritical.  It makes me sad, and I despair.
