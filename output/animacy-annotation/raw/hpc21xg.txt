So in my studies for an English degree, it was quite apparent that Frankenstein is not THE first science fiction novel. Mary Shelley is a massive part of the canon that would develop into science fiction as we know it today.

Shelley’s novel is more aptly a gothic work. The themes of which don’t preclude it from considerstion as a work science fiction, but the foundation of science fiction had already begun and her contribution just continues the evolution of story themes that would become the genre Verne and then Wells would later define.

It doesn’t erase her role in science fiction’s cementing as a significant literary genre. Making this shit up and not learning what her real contributions were is far more ignorant and degrading of the accomplishments made by her and those before her.
