I almost agreed with you. But then I remembered the lives lost because of them not wanting to do the right things but also spread misinformation. I also remembered that half my family work in hospitals and are susceptible to COVID despite the vaccinations. So yeah, what a shitty take you have. I suggest you read Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion by Paul Bloom. It's good to think and empathize with the victims of misinformation, but that empathy narrows the perspective and ignores the broader contexts. I empathize with you empathizing with them. I just can't empathize with them. Conclusion: your take is alright at first, but with more thought, it's quite shitty and ignorant of the broader stuff.
