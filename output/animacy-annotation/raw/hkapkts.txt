Exactly!! They talk shit about liberal "elites" while worshipping Trump, a born billionaire, and the likes of Tucker Carlson, the heir to one of the richest families in the country. They are r/selfawarewolves ðŸ¤¡ 

They're so unaware and ignorant that they've literally facilitated the unprecedented and insurmountable wealth disparity that we suffer through today.

They're so unaware and ignorant that they vote for politicians who have, and continue to, destroy unions and the middle class, even though a large percentage of Republican voters are themselves low socioeconomic! 

It's almost unbelievable.
