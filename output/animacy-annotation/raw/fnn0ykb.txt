I relate to this so much.. If I walked slow, didnt respond fast enough or didnt speak loud enough aka "mumbling" ..in my dads words he would flip out and make me feel like a fucking idiot. I was a different type of smart as a child.. and when my brother's would make fun of me for my insights or interesting expressions.. I would just internally despise them, because I wasnt stupid- they were just too stupid and unaware and close minded to understand or SEE.
