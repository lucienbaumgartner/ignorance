Yeah I am just loving the discussion the topic brings. I agree with your points, I think that it is done that way to showcase that while she wants to be a child, she has no real idea of what a child is. And someone who refuses to grow up is not a child, but an immature ignorant and oftentimes cruel person with none of the beautiful endearing qualities of a child. Like you said she is not a kid distracted by the world from learning. She is refusing to learn out of a desire to be that kid.

So I think her character will take a massive u turn once she is forced to face that she cannot be a child, she is not a child, and refusing to accept that is turning her into a horrible adult. 

And I agree there is nothing wrong with not liking a character, I just wanted to engage in some convo, did not want to come off as antagonizing.
