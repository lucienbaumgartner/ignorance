Sounds good. Imagine being so obtuse and ignorant that you look at literally the entire world taking drastic measures fighting against something and the first thing you think to yourself is, “This isn’t that big of a deal.” I’m sorry it’s so challenging for you to adjust your world view to a new situation. You’re right though, maybe it will magically go away, might as well just do nothing and expect that will happen!
