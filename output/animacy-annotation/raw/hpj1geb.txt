When someone has very strong opinions and they almost brag about their point of view (usually it’s the kind of people who say things like “I’m not racist but” or “Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve” you know the people) 

When I then share my views of the world they change their opinion to fit with what Ever I’ve said NOTHING annoys me more if you’re going to be ignorant and rude in your life at least own it 😩
