In the books, a hologram of Hari emerges from the vault following resolution of each Seldon crisis to explain the analysis and application of the math leading him to predict the events and crisis, years earlier, with a very high degree of accuracy.

That said, I agree that it’s counter Psychohistory’s fundamentals for an interactive version of Seldon to be there, meddling in affairs and derailing his own plan. The whole theory of Psychohistory was that the population being analyzed and forecasted had to be unaware and ignorant of said analysis. Cognizance of the predictions beyond a scarce few led to changes and artificial behaviors that wouldn’t have occurred otherwise, thus invalidating the original predictions.
