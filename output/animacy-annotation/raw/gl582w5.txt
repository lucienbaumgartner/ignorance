&gt; As cool as it feels for a player to sneak up on people, it looks really stupid when players are driving past each other from a spectator stand point.

As much as I agree with what you stated above I think people driving by each others generates tension and hype, just look how hyped the crowd gets when 2 csgo players of opposing teams are close and unaware of their respective positions, I get we aren't quite there regarding the level of hype but I think it could be interesting to see.
