I don't think it's infinite. It's just one or two more timelines/realities, if that. Cap while returning the power stone to Morag could have arrived a little earlier to instruct Nebula to turn off her cloud sharing so as not to trigger End game Thanos. Then after Rody and Nebula steal the stone, Cap replaces it and everything works out like the previous movies with no alternate realities. (I'm not sure how likely this is as it creates a paradox)

The second clean version might be Tony stealing another of Thanos' ideas and amending his snap wish to include amnesia. Tony didn't kill Thanos and his armies but returned them to their timeline, alive and unaware that the time heist ever happened and leaving a duplicate Gamora behind for Quill while creating a second one to return to the OG timeline.  (I thought of this while writing this comment and like it better than the previous paragraph, I'm now pretty sure this is what Tony did).
