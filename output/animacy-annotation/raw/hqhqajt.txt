My opinion on this sub is irrelevant but I just want to chime in and say in a comment no one will read that I really fucking hate people who put their pets above other humans. I love animals I always have. But the older I get the more pissed off I get when people act like their pet is the center of the universe. I think it started from my family and the way that they treat cats which has legitimatly made me hate cats and it's not their fault. But I really hate when people think that their pet deserves to be the center of the entire universe. It's so selfish and ignorant and frustrating because people think that you don't respect the lives of animals just because you don't put them above the humans that are already a part of your life
