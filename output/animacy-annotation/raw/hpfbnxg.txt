Ignorant and naive? Broseph I am a social studies teacher in a red state.  Not only is my state red but I work in the reddest congressional district in the state.  I have crazy parents who are out to capture the boogeyman that is CRT. 

When I covered the Constitution we went in-depth into the 3/5th Compromise, voter enfranchisement, and discussed how that fit in with the idea that "all men are created equal."  When we get into westward expansion we will talk about the IRA (genocide will be mentioned), and I will talk about the current state of Native Americans/reservations in the U.S. When we get into the Civil War, we will talk about life in the North vs the South and the brutality that was slavery, in addition to southern history revisionism and the lost cause when we get into the causes of the Civil War.

In my estimate, there is nothing in that law that will prevent me from talking about those topics, but it will prevent me from blaming some white kid for what happened in our past (which would be inappropriate).  As it stands, the law is vague, which is the issue at hand.  I have to admit I am not familiar with NH curriculum, but I'd imagine the 3/5ths compromise, the IRA, and life in south are part of the curriculum, as is providing "experiences that provide for the study of culture and cultural diversity" and providing "for the study of the past and its legacy."
