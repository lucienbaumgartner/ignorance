Edit: been watching the reviews, there was actually one negative left earlier this morning:

 “Sent seller several messages after I purchased phone which they ignored, ignorant and poor seller, 2nd hand phones he is passing off as new, avoid seller. I had to go through eBay Support to resolve”

which has just now been removed…
