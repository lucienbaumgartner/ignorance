Locking the doors is one of many things to do. The point here is to give him an opportunity to stop and if he wonâ€™t stop at least she can avoid it when possible before she outcries. You could not help your dad and that breaks my heart because you feel like you might have. He did this to you, you were unaware and powerless to stop it. My goal is to get you guys to not feel forced to endure it.
