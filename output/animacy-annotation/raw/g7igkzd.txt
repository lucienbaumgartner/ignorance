Harry Potter Wizards having an inverse form of innocence that messes with their ability to understand Muggles and interact with Muggle technology makes a disturbing amount of sense.  Upvoted for that idea alone.  I think you could tie that idea into the apparent difference in power level between Wizards that lack the standard means of power and Practitioners.  Wizards may seem more powerful and unaware of the karmic balance that maintains the status quo, but in actuality, karma has them more closely tied down by their own obliviousness and isolation than even the weakest of Practitioners.
