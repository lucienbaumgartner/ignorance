Really？Im happy my English is ok hahahhah.(=^▽^=) Well, about the North Korea, most Chinese think they are poor and ignorant of the world, but they are the happiest country. I know your capitalism can be hard to understand, because it seems like you always tie happiness to money. In some ways, you can't be happy if you're too poor, but North Koreans have enough food and clothing, and they're happy. If they feel that way, it's none of our business. You know, some people like to impose their own definition of a happy life on others.

There is a story that there was a woman who loved to travel around the world. Once she arrived in a remote village and saw a woman who had never left her hometown. She thought the woman was so pitiful that she had never been anywhere else. But the woman who lived in the village thought she was pitiful because she had to run around.

You see, happiness for every country is different, we just need to respect each other.
