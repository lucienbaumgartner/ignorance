IMO a mistake.  Unlike many other shows  Manifest is story nor character driven. Usually a series is toast  if you lose the actors to other contracts but  as long as you get Josh Dallas as ben waking up from a strange dream  on a plane trip from Jamaica the story is back even two years from now.   Its a bit rash to  just blow up such a great idea ( plane missing  comes back years later with everyone alive and unaware of any time shift)  for a two hour movie. Even five years  later you can do a reboot.
