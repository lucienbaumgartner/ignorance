Hey all, just sharing some artwork I recently completed. This is a Knight of Aepra starting a battle with a large Djinni – I’m not sure I fancy his chances, a Knight I played in a campaign before was so devoted to his city and god he bordered on idiotic…

Larren took his final steps onto the precipice of the mountain, he was warned of the Djinni that lurked there, but someone had to confront the monster. Maybe he could talk some sense into it, he was feeling persuasive today.
He kept his sword sheathed as he waited for the encounter, so as to not provoke any action. As he waited he thought of the rest of his party, asleep and unaware of his venture. They had told him he didn’t stand a chance at convincing the Djinni (whose name he had forgotten) to stop attacking the city. But when has listening to reason ever served Larren, never, reason was for the faithless. 
He dared a peak over the edge of the cliff staring down into the ravine. As he did so he noticed an otherworldly heat on his face. The heat grew stronger and flames began to flicker on Larren’s vision. He rubbed at his now dry eyes and took a step back. As he did so he heard a mighty boom and when he opened his eyes again the form of the Djinni filled his view.
This thing was massive, thought Larren.
“I errrm, can I…take a moment of your time?”
The Djinni appeared to consider this question for a moment, then the heat around Larren began to get unbearable as a great sword was summoned into existence and the Djinni drew back to strike.
“Oh….”

If anyone wants any artwork commissioned please let me know 😊
