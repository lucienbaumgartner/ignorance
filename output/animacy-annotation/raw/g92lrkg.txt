So when I saw the film, I thought it was hilarious but would never think it was based in truth based off of race/ethnicity. In other words, the jokes made are unfortunate that they single out a single place because in reality, theyâ€™re applicable to any place. The sad thing is that people are so stupid and ignorant that they would attempt to take the movie at face value.
