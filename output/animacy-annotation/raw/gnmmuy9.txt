"Only the Sith deal in absolutes" ^/s Seriously, it is hard to come up with rules and I have made mistakes before in another sub, banning the wrong person.

A low Karma account is often used for messing about/spamming. This can often be banned without consequence but it could be the person is simply new and unaware of the rules.

Btw is there any mechanism for killing the removed/deleted posts on Discord?
