Because they think they are beasts instead they fuckin suck (for their rank), and blame everything on you. This shit already starts in gold 4, most hardstuck are so fuckin toxic and unaware of the reality. Even if you score triple the damage and kills, a hardstuck will try to blame his failures on you.

Average dumbass hardstuck g4, p4 or d4 on landing: runs 1 vs 3, get downed, starts screaming "wtf you do!! Where are you??!" And say you suck because you were looting on landing. When I'm in those ranks passing by, I swear that I score higher RP by playing totally alone
