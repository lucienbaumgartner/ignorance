Nice job on the big words.

Fine, let's use double plus ungood, but, since it's easier to say wrong, so I'll stick with that. 

Shall we return to the problem at hand?

OP is in misery and hates the country. Also says that the CIA is what's wrong with Cuba and Venezuela. OP is upset about everything from climate change to nursing homes. I say work towards a solution. You say that I'm misguided, ignorant and simplistic, then go on to accuse me of being a libertarian. 

Yet, I don't hear you or anyone else suggesting any other solutions that may be available to OP. 

You obviously know something I don't. Could you please share, what am I missing?
