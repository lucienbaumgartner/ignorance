I've been very critical in the past of the more theoretical episodes, as they sometimes  veer away from capoeira entirely. This time they managed to talk about an interesting theoretical topic while always keeping the perspective on capoeira. 
A+ episode!

There is a video of Mestre Poncianinho giving a similar view on the topic, that I really like. it goes something like this:

1. First you are unaware and unable. You don't know capoeira exists or don't really know what it is.
2. Then you are aware and unable. You've seen capoeira and started doing it, but you haven't yet mastered the movements.
3. Until you become aware and able. You have mastered the movements and you do the movement you want to do in the way you want to do it at the moment you want to do it.
4. The final level is unaware and able. You don't have to think about the moves you want to do. You move freely and your mastery of the movements is such that you will automatically do the perfect movement at the perfect time.
