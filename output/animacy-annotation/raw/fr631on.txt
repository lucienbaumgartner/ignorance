well of course it was a dick move, they wanted to get away with it by shafting the community without telling anybody there might be a new unit. For that I won't spend any money on this game anymore. I think everybody should show them with their wallet. Sadly too many people are unaware and especially newer players. We need principled people to take a stance against such methods. If they ever want our money they need to adjust and win our trust back.
