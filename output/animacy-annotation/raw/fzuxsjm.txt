You need to understand, right here, right now, that scammers do not use actual names and addresses for themselves.  Every single name you *think* you have is either someone whose information has been compromised (and they are unaware) or someone who is willing to be a middle-mule but also unaware, and they are also also dealing with the same scammers who are giving out fake names.

There's nothing you can do about this as that money is long gone, and anyone you MAY find will be just as clueless and believing it was 100% legitimate.   Sucky situation, but these romance con games have gone on for centuries, and the reason con-men and con-women keep doing it is that they are (usually) very good at knowing how to cover their tracks and not be caught.
