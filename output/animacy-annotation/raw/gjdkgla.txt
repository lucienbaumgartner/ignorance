This Nesara thing seems hypocritical, because it would basically be the “socialism” they’re so concerned about, and the “great reset” they’re so concerned the democrats are going to do. The great reset will basically be Nesara, and redistribution of the wealth. 

They want what other people are actually fighting for, but are hoping their dear lord and savior DJT is going to do it for them - when he’s never said anything about loan forgiveness, and his party if the opposite of the kind of people that would actually do this. They’re so contradictory and unaware of the reality of politics, it just blows my mind constantly.
