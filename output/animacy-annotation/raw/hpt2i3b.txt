Peter endorsed Paul as scripture:

And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved *brother Paul* also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, *as they do the other Scriptures.*
2 Peter 3:15‭-‬16 ESV


And Jesus endorsed Peter:

And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
Matthew 16:18 ESV
