Right?! I’m happy there’s any Asian representation at all. There are a lot of Asians who feel the uneducated and ignorant of the general population will think Bling Empire represents us all. I don’t know. I almost think that’s a reach. How come people don’t think all white women are just like the Real Housewives of NJ?
