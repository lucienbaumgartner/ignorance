&gt;Columbus, however, was an idiot who thought the earth was pear-shaped. If he hadn't stumbled onto previously unknown lands he and his crew would have all died. But

 No, he wasn't. That's historical revisionist nonsense. You *honsetly think* that the royal family of Spain would have funded the expedition if they thought the man was an idiot? Good lord some people really need to stop believing people who needed a good hook to lure in suckers tonread their new books. 

Also he didn't "invent the slave trade." That professions is ten thousand years older than him. Then that idiotic idea that he assumed Native Americans were Indians because *he*, who had never met a South or Southeast Asian native, was a moron is completely ludicrous and ignorant of how first contact between dksparate cultures occurs.

But hey, this is the 2020's and we true intellectuals now what *really happened* instead of what those corporate posers told is in school! 

What a load.
