“Guess not understanding is proof of privilege”

“PS” (a PS indicates a sassy, often rude indication of idiocy or ignorance on the part of the person who was on the receiving end)

“It’s not contempt from you to say it’s not necessary for women to be included?” (obviously twisting my words, I never stated anything even slightly close to that disgusting statement.)

Plus, you then give a description of the line referring to men who fought in war, when it was a time of war and death. If this truly is what it was referring to (I’d like to see some sauce) then should we really be doing anything for Remembrance Day? Those are all _men_ we’re respecting. That isn’t fair to women, we should get rid of it. If they were to remove something to include women, why not remove the religious portion of “God keep our land glorious and free” instead of something indicating the people? No, we removed something indicating the people who fought for our right to live. That makes it worse, no?

Also, once again twisting things in your favour. You say you never indicating me being privileged, but everyone? Then why was all the privilege things you mention have “you” instead of “men” in general?

In the end, you’re opinion is clearly that _all_ men are privileged and ignorant. That is such an unfair point and you haven’t put anything up that really argues your point other than “We’re privileged”. You haven’t contradicted me on anything. You told me I was privileged, ignorant and wrong for my opinion. You’re ignoring practically everything I say to paint me as the villain in the next comment you make. I was trying to be nice at the start and your underhanded insults irritated me. You can keep saying you had no intention to insult me. You’re lying, plain as day. You didn’t answer any of my questions, theories or statements. I’m done here. Polite conversations in continue to elude me, clearly.
