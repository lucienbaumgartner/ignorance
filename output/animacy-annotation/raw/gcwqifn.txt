Lmao, imagine being so entitled you have no idea how entitled you are to be so unaware and unempathetic to the very real and genuine struggles fellow students have to go through. If you want to talk about unfair or entitled, don't come after the people who are deeply affected and traumatized by their worlds falling apart, go after the privileged kids at our school who cheat, sleep with professors and TAs for better grades, and have the world at their feet from the endless resources they were handed down.
