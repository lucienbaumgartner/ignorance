It’s not about sharing a bed.  It’s about acknowledgment, respect, adult decision making, and autonomy.  The daughter is making a very small and reasonable request and her parents are refusing to acknowledge her committed relationship, validate her feelings, or accept that she’s an adult who is pregnant and engaged.

I can’t imagine depriving a pregnant woman the comfort of her 6 year partner next to her at night over a nonsensical juvenile rule because of nothing but control issues and obstinance.  

If there was some other reason they couldn’t sleep together it would be a non issue.  Like they only had single beds in the rooms and they wouldn’t hold the weight of two people.  That would be an understandable and reasonable issue.  But this is only about the parents personal feelings about the status of her relationship and they are ignorant and stubborn.
