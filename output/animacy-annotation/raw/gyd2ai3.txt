Lmfao the fact that you think Biden has anything to do with the gas shortage shows you have absolutely no clue as to what you are taking about.  Let me break it down for you; we just went through a year of lockdown where the demand for gas declined significantly as people were not traveling so naturally production slowed.  On top of that there is a significant shortage of truck drivers licensed to haul fuel as a lot of the old timers in the industry decided to retire and people are not exactly lining up to fill those positions.  Now the US is beginning to open back up and demand is increasing; add the mix a major production facility being shut down to ransomware and you have a temporary fuel shortage.  

Biden literally has done nothing to effect the gas situation.  He also has nothing to do with the conflict in Israel/Palestine.  You implying trumped fixed either one of these things is incredibly dumb and ignorant of facts or history.  

Iâ€™m sorry but that was one of the dumbest things I have ever read.  You should be ashamed for believing such nonsense without doing any actual research into any of it.
