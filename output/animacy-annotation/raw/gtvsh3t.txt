I'm a 50 year old who's been interacting with people internationally on social media since 'social media' became a thing. It's not being 'obsessed' with the US to make the observation that many Americans are extremely inward focused and ignorant of the rest of the world. It's likely got a lot to do with your media and education systems.

Don't be too defensive, sweetheart.
