Amazing. I’m so happy you got to experience it. And hopefully one day you’ll meet another fan who’s local and unaware of the absolute gem right in their backyard and you can send them there as well. So glad to have been able to share it with someone it meant so much to. 

Now I just gotta get to see a collection of Boris Vallejo’s work and the works of Brom haha. Then I’ll have my artistic fanboy bucket list complete!
