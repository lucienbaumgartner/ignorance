I think you are taking the wrong lesson from this:

"I feel like I can never trust anyone again. You can give someone your heart, and for years say you love them, they love you, you call each other your soulmates, but I don't know how to just disregard and forget about all of that... After so much searching, I realize that the only lesson learned is how to be afraid. "

I just went through something similar, but involved a marriage and a long one. I think you can look at it another way. How long can you be expected to keep your guard up? When is it time to drop it. Someone can go 10 years as your soulmate, and change in an instant. You can't keep your guard up for 10 years, or even 2 or 3 with the next person you fall for. 

So the answer is, it is futile to think you can be fully protected from heartbreak. It is impossible, without being lonely the rest of your life, which is the very thing that you think you can avoid by being over cautious. You can always be betrayed. So, knowing that, just live your life. There is no way to FULLY protect yourself, so there is no point in trying. You will always be a LITTLE guarded after this, it's ok. Just be free to live your life, and know that after what you went through, nothing else will ever hurt as bad...so LIVE YOUR LIFE, and don't be afraid. It will never hurt as bad as this, because you will never be so completely unguarded and unaware that this can happen, ever again. You've taken a sword through the heart and lived. What else is there to be afraid of?
