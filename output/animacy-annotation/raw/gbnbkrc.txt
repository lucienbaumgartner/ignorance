My name is Alexandra and my middle name Angela so try again.

I just don't like people being dumb and unaware of cultural and linguistic differences and talking shit about names just because they're unaware of their background or existence. Get out of your bubble.


Also, made up spellings of common names isn't the same as names that are just uncommon where you live, learn the difference.
