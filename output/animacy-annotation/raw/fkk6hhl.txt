I work in a restaurant part time on the weekend.  Worked Friday night and last night....on my way there now.  It is in a wealthier suburb of Pittsburgh.  The amount of 60 year olds or older that have been out and dining is unbelievable to me.  People are fucking stupid and ignorant.  That is all I can gather from what I've seen the last two days.
