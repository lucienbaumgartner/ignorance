I feel like people in this sub/ Phoebe haters read too much into the conflict she causes.

Phoebe is flaky and unaware of normal human interactions. Things that bother other people don't bother her. She's not trying to be a jerk, she's just being herself and it rubs her friends the wrong way sometimes... that's the comedy of the situation... you know for a sitcom. Case in point when she pointed out Rachel and Monica's flaws and they retaliate and Phoebe is unbothered by it. 

Also the whole "Phoebe hates Chandler" thing where ppl say she hates him bc of all the jokes she makes at his expense is so biased. EVERYONE makes fun of Chandler for being undesirable/ bad with women, thats his character trait. Just like EVERYONE makes fun of Ross for being a geek or Monica for being a control freak or Phoebe for being a weirdo. Joey has made just as many jokes at Chandler's expense and no one claims Joey hates Chandler.
