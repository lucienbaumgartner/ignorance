Absolutely, 100%, no exaggeration true. Not just restaurants- coffee shops, gas stations, everywhere they go. I now work for a telecommunications company outbound loyalty call centre and they are rude and ignorant “that we’re working on Sunday”. Like it’s fine for you to frequent many businesses on Sunday but heaven forbid we try to get you off this crappy grandfathered plan and save you money on your bill.
