Whether or not you think the refs should call it this is by definition an illegal screen. 

'A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.  
In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be. This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.'

At some point the NBA needs to revamp reffing entirely.  The rules, especially screens, are not properly enforced so teams are doing something illegal every single play down the floor.  Which means the refs just get to decide when to change the game at their whim.
