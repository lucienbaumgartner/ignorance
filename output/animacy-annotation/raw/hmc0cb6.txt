Wow! Nice savior complex! Now, to reality. Heroine and fentanyl, and many other drugs are dangerous, government or no. If you disagree you are sheltered and ignorant. That is a fact. There are real world examples. I love that if I condone the government trying to stop horrible drugs like this affecting our society, I approve that drugs are going to kill people, because that's how it goes. Your logic is flawless.

I am on a libertarian sub. Though I agree with most moderate libertarian views and would love more libertarian representation,  I can't outright support them because of people like you. Unfortunately,  libertarians fall into three categories: moderate, (which I back, for the most part) the socialist, (which is oxymoron and idiotic) and the extremist, (which I don't even understand. They want no government, so, tribalistic? How would we defend our country? How would we have any justice against rape, murder and many other crimes?). I'm pretty sure you fall into the last group, and you have no good answers. Guvment bad, so no guvment. It is childish and stupid. You are what is holding the libertarian party from its potential.
