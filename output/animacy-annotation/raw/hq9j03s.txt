Very true - it's a nuanced and delicate situation, with a lot of grey area, but I just wanted to make the point because for many, this sort of thing doesn't even cross their mind. We saw the same a lot over here as a result of the migrations into Europe, which indirectly fueled the fire for Brexit, and we see it continually in the US. There are many ignorant and xenophobic people who use this argument as some sort of 'end of discussion' or 'checkmate' moment.
