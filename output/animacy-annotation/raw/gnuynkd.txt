Yikes, yeah, I'm isolated from all that apparently, small town in a rural area, everyone for the most part is kind and helpful to one another. Yet, surely these times can't be the worst ever. History tells of much worse all around the world. You at least have the ability to travel easily to a new part of the world where things are better. In the past you were stuck and unaware of the outside world. Today thet vis opportunity for everyone. Mobility and sharing of vast amounts of information is attainable by many. Reddcoin is an example of an opportunity to change your world or that of others for the better. We've never met, this thread has connected us, and through reddcoin and reddit we know each other from across the world to share ideas and stories. We live in a world of hope. We live in a world where we can build a brighter future together. Redd.love
