Well yes, they think Americans are stupid.  Remember Gruber?  They were counting on the stupidity of the people to get Obamacare through.

Remember the Podesta emails?  Keep the people unaware and compliant.

As for what Russia supposedly did.  Maxine Waters claims that it was Russia that created the strategy Trump used to make Hillary look bad.  Putin created "crooked Hillary", "lock her up", and created the narrative that Hillary was ill.

Obviously, there are people who are stupid enough to believe it.  I think they also claim that the DNC emails were "hacked" by Russia, which allowed people to realize how Hillary was cheating.  If it hadn't been for Russia hacking--people would have never known she was a cheat and so would have won.

Yeah, a lot of the american people seem to be stupid enough to believe this crap.
