I'll give the answer in terms of money spent, if that's okay.

I lived in my Brooklyn apartment from March 1, 2011 through Memorial Day Weekend 2013 (I'm good with dates, that's why I  remember this.).  I smoked pot every one of those days except maybe four or five.  I had the number for the courier service (which I still keep in my phone for nostalgia purposes) and placed an order for a "ticket" every Sunday night like *clockwork*.  Each of these little containers cost $50.00 and always lasted me exactly one week.  So that's 200/month. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 2011 - May 2013 is a 27 month span.  So I spent $5,400 during my time at that apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I pay my guy using Venmo and was able to look at what I paid him in the last 12 month period.  That figure is $1,920.00, or $160/month.  I think that's a perfectly good number to use for an annual figure from May 2013 to the present.  So lets use that $160/month figure and prorate it from June 2013 to March 2019 (not counting April since we're only 9 days in.).   I think that's a 70 month span right?  That's (gulp) $11,200.00

&amp;#x200B;

So since March of 2011 I've spent \[11,200  + 5,400\]..................... $16,600 on weed.

My numbers are possibly wrong, I ran through this pretty quickly.  But let me just say for the record, to me, this is money well spent.  I love the stuff.  I've got a fantastic career, a home in an area that people dream of living in, and a family that I love more than anything.  My wife says I'm a doting, supportive, and selfless father/husband.  All the smoking is done when they're asleep, away, or otherwise completely unaware and unaffected by it.

This, and the Philadelphia Eagles, are my one (okay, two) things that I weaponize as a break from my stressful job and the rigors of parenting.  It's my release, and I don't think I'll ever stop.
