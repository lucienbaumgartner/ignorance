“Kids” aren’t stupid.  They know cops.  Spoiled crybaby millennials; absolute morons; and guilty people, react like this kid.  I feel bad only for the absolute morons who truly are unaware and scared.  That’s not this kid.  He’s either a millennial or he’s guilty (and I give him the presumption).  The point is not his in once or guilt.  The issue is why is he so fucking stupid.  Stand still, be quiet, let the cop violate your rights, then hire lawyer.  Millennials and guilty people won’t, and I don’t feel bad for either.  True idiots won’t either and those people I do feel bad for because the cops’ initial violation that ends up with the idiot reacting and getting further injured is very wrong.  When a millennial crybaby or a guilty person squirms and worms, the beating they get is something I won’t shed a tear over, even where the initial stop is wrong.  Again, if you are wrongfully stopped and the cop says, wrongfully, “You are detained” or “You are under arrest”, then guess what... you ARE detained or you ARE under arrest.  Whining crybaby millennials don’t seem to get this (guilty people of course do get it but they’re trying to make a run for it).  Millennials....the world is a tough place.  Your rights can be violated.  You have a remedy for it.  Hire a lawyer AFTER it’s over.  Don’t hurt yourselves by being crybabies and thinking “It’s not fair!!” Is going to stop the cop violating your rights.  It won’t.  All it will do is get you a beating and more charges
