There’s a difference between being privileged and being an elitist. Yes, I live in a privileged area. Yes I’m aware of that. That doesn’t mean I am sheltered and unaware of other people’s situations or that I can’t and shouldn’t speak up for my brothers and sisters who aren’t afforded the same luxuries I am in this beautiful city. Saying it is a shit hole and that other people’s basic rights are “horse shit” makes me wonder who is sheltered here. 

I won’t argue with you any more. I am hopeful for our city and our communities.
