Oh, I’m going to have to refrain from addressing the ‘it’s just what kids do’…nope, my kids are reminded that that line is just a cop out line. Or, if they think about it, it’s condescending of kids. Are kids not as thoughtful or capable of being considerate? Their answer should be ‘no’ because thinking about and taking care of the little things is valuable practice for doing big, great things. I also suspect those who believe and say being unaware and inconsiderate is just what kids do are probably the same people who never learned as kids to operate with (more) awareness and consideration for others. 

Besides, cleaning as you move is just more efficient. Who doesn’t love efficiency? The bonus is that you’ll generally know where everything is. 

That’s awesome that your husband had converted to the easier way of things. Life is so much easier when no one at home as to nag or feel like a maid. I refuse to send my kids out into the world behaving like there’s a maid around. Even those hired to clean shouldn’t be treated like they’re servants. My kids get one question if they ever forget to clean after themselves: “are you expecting a maid to do this for you?”
