This was the first bonus episode i heard and it was excellent, explains and forgives some of the free episodes that sound totally mailed in.

The argument for social media companies not offering verified non anonymous accounts made by two blue checked twitter addicts, this gave me pause. I believe their policy of forcing anonymity on the unwashed masses discourages healthy engagement and fun. I love the stereotype of blue checked twitter users who left facebook years ago because they couldn’t handle it, delusional and ignorant of those who stayed.

As a pure business decision, having more widespread non anonymous social media accounts would open up legal privacy issues surrounding cross site tracking??

I feel like a lone voice who recognizes a potential of being able to have an increased trust and be less suspicion of whether certain online voices are sock puppets or “gasp” spooks hired to misinform and dogpile arguments.
