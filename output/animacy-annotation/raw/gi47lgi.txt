I dont hate Howard. I have listened since 1999 and I admit he has lost a few steps, quite a few but I still listen and enjoy their old people banter. With that said, who in the fuck of christ didn't understand how big this would be? Any producer worth their weight in salt would have taken photos from the stage as well as had a single camera recording the whole thing from behind. This way you could pinpoint who leaked these photos. 

Two things: Either Howards entire staff is completely incompetent and unaware of what he is doing, Or: He has surrounded himself with people who don't tell him the truth.
