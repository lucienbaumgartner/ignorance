From a gameplay perspective I agree that's no fun. But from a "realism" point of view (as much as I can really use that term in 1984 alien hell), it makes perfect sense. A guerilla force by nature has to hit enemies unaware and unprepared in order to have an effect. If we tried to roll up on any real military strongholds -- like a barracks or an armory, not necessarily research facilities and the like -- the wave of bodies they could throw at XCOM would kill them, even if they were all regular ADVENT guys and nothing else.
