Those aren't right wing views. You're either not familiar with Harris' views or are a leftist zealot that sees centrist or classical liberal positions as right wing. You're also engaging in projection as well as shallow ad hominem attacks when you call him a "whiny baby". It shows you don't really have a coherent argument to make as to why you disagree with Harris on any of these things and are unaware and unreflective.
