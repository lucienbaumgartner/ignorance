&gt; No, saying "biology degrees are worthless" is so preposterous and ignorant that I don't even think I can argue it with you.

Right... it has nothing to do with the fact that you CAN'T argue it with me... no, that CAN'T be it.

&gt; I quoted your own article at you to show that it does not mean what you claim it means. 

No, did you bother reading the study at all?

The study that the more gender equal a society is the less likely women are to join STEM fields?

That study? 

The study that said that they DID find a link between one thing and women joining STEM?

That study?

You quoted a study you didn't bother reading.

&gt; As I said before, doesn't "women don't want to do STEM" contradict your previous point that women are overrepresented in STEM? 

And I said before College versus work.
