Wow. She's absolutely a threat to your daughter.  Your poor son, having not only to witness his grandma having sex (when she *should have* been watching his little sister), but then for her to follow up her horrible behavior with a *bribe*.  Wow.wow.wow.

Everyone makes terrible choices now and again (not excusing what she did in the least).  How you act once you've been caught (often) reveals more about your character than the act itself.  


For him to not only catch her, but *then*, for her to additionally attempt to bring her grandson in on her sexual deviation (by bribing him to keep the secret, because *she knew* it was wrong.), I'm just at a loss for words.  She's supposed to be someone your son and daughter could look up to. What a betrayal.


I'm so thankful your daughter was unaware and healthy when he found her.
