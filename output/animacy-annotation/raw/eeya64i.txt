Okay, look. I know this sub gets hard when shitting on tumblr woke femnazis and whatever. But to seriously call this entire march and rally the equivalent to anything like the Nuremburg Rally is stupid and ignorant. That person who is holding that sign (which I think originally calls for male genocide or whatever) is clearly a radical and you can call a maniac. But the march majorly is not calling for the removal of men. It isn't condemning men (for the most part).

You may disagree about what the activists (on a majority base) are calling for in regards to women reproductive rights, and their myth of the wage gap and what-not. But it is more than idiotic to call it the same as a Nazi rally.
