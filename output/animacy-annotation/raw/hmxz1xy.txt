Former (and still licensed) loss prevention here.

***AMEN***

I have been doing my part to encourage LP's to give up that work and do safer stuff they are authorized to perform. 

Fun fact, in December 2010 a major electronics retailer up here in Canada was caught on video making their underpaid, unlicensed, and unqualified teenagers do loss prevention work in direct violation of provincial law (Ontario private security law in particular the PSISA). Video and a formal report was submitted to the appropriate ministry and the head office was told in no uncertain terms to stop endangering employees (mostly young and unaware of rights) by making them do work that by law was unsafe.
