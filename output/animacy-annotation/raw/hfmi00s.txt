I personally love the idea of a cruel and non-relatable protagonist. In a way, it makes them more relatable, because for most of us, we don’t often see the good side of ourselves. For me, my protagonist is someone I almost hate. She’s so arrogant and ignorant of other people’s feelings that she wouldn’t mind to kill them. But as I wrote on, I realized she was only telling herself this. Really, she hated herself for killing and never wanted to be lonely. But she never outright admits this, so to keep the child like stupidity I’ve given her. Actually, despite being an adult, her ideology is very childish and she has almost no good traits. But I think this plays into the story line and her character well. Thus, I don’t think it’s important to make your character relatable or even likeable. As long as their character fits in with the themes of your book and is accurate to themselves, do what you want.
