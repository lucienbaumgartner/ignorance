Both of them are complete jokes. I didn’t vote in either election because all of our candidates have just sucked and I don’t want to be affiliated with either. They’re both racist, old, dumb and ignorant. That being said, Biden has done a way worse job and we’re only 7 months in. He’s annoyed our allied countries, military and given the taliban a pedestal.
