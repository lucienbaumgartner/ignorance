You know there was a post the other day about what scene or episode don’t people like. I read through the comments and thought about it myself and could not come up with any. I am the same about skipping and watching in order and thought I didn’t have anything I disliked. But I literally just watched this scene/episode last night and I totally agree. 

I also don’t like how Rory and Lorelai come across as unaware and unconcerned about others feelings, at all. Can they be selfish, possibly self-centered at times, maybe, but I don’t see them as they were painted in that talk.

I agree with the Dean and Max stuff too. Dean may know them a bit better because he may spend more time around them both, but this is just over the top. It’s not like Max just met them either, shouldn’t he be more aware of these things by this point in his and Lorelai’s relationship? 

I do think it’s meant to be a bit cringey/over the top though, it’s the start of why/how Max and Lorelai won’t work. The two of them have chemistry but their worlds don’t fit, she wasn’t comfortable changing or compromising at all to let him in. 

Anyways, this is the only scene I dislike and tend to go on my phone during.
