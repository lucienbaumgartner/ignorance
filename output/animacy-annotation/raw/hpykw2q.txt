I'm trying to have a discussion in good faith here, but it's beginning to seem like you are not.

&gt;defending the Chinese government in its entirety

Incorrect. For example, I personally oppose the CCP's censorship policies.

To recap, the comment I replied to was questioning why anyone would spend time criticizing anti-China talking points. I replied with a general point about how anti-China stuff on Reddit is ignorant and racist, and how that can have real-life consequences. My comment didn't make any specific claims about the linked thread in particular, so your whole line of reasoning is a non sequitur.

That said, many of the comments the OP of this thread cited- calling Chinese culture "absolutely dystopian", generalizing Chinese as cheaters, and outright saying "I hate China" are indeed racist.
