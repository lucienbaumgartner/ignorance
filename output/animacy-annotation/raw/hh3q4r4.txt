...so the tone here seems to be a troll, but whatever

There was follow up - it led to a shadow war between the Space Wolves and the Inquisition/Grey Knights for a period of about 8 months to a year. The Grey Knights refer to this period as "The Months of Shame," it's detailed in their codex, the Wolves codex, and forms a big chunk of the novel _The Emperor's Gift_. 

In essence, the Lord Inquisitor who directed the purge in the first place gets a bug up his ass about the Space Wolves, forces the Grey Knights to start going after the Space Wolves ships, even when they weren't putting themselves between the Inquisition and the Guard, culminating in the Inquisitor going literally crazy that a first founding chapter wasn't dropping everything to do what he wanted. He amassed a fleet, went into orbit around Fenris, made some very bellicose statements, and promptly got his head chopped off when Logan Grimnar teleported onto his command deck. Bjorn the Fell Handed was woken up to mediate the dispute after that, and everyone basically just picked up their ball and went home. 

Also, it's worth noting that the Warhammer wiki has this to say about the "probably chaos infected guard":

&gt;the Inquisitors voted to sterilize and quarantine-for-life the remaining population of the Hive World in Adeptus Arbites work-camps scattered across the galaxy even though it was generally considered untainted and ignorant of the truth concerning the existence of Chaos. The valiant Imperial Guard and other human defenders of the world were to suffer the same fate or be liquidated. 

So, they were to be killed or sent to the gulag for potentially knowing demons existed, not for being tainted/corrupted...which is why the Space Wolves stood up for them in the first place. 

If you're going to be an ass, at least know _something_ about what you're talking about. Otherwise you just look like a dumb ass.
