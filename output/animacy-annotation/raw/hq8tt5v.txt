We all make mistakes some bigger than the others. At the end of the day if you realize what you do is wrong then you always can have a chance to improve and make yourself right. It’s just about showing that and actually acting on it. You know your not a bad person but and the end of the day your human like all of us. We are reckless, ignorant, and just stupid sometimes I know I’ve said some dumb and hurtful stuff to people however I know it was wrong. And changed my actions from that :)
