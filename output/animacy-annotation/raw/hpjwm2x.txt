Yeah, when I was young, I thought my mom abandoned me because that's what my grandparents told me. In reality, they kicked her out because she was dating someone. They ended up getting married, and when MY MOTHER tried to take me to live with her, my grandmother threatened to send her to jail for child abandonment. 

Not sure if it would have worked that way, but my mom was pregnant with my half brother, scared, and ignorant of how those legalities would work. She eventually signed away custody of me to appease the harpy, and we had no relationship because then how would my grandma pretend to be mommy? 

It sucked. So much. You carry those feelings of not being good enough or wanted enough forever. Even knowing what really happened, I still carry that on my shoulders. I remember when she got kicked out. She told me she would be back when I woke up in the morning, and she was just going out of town for a conference. I had never spent a night without her before, and I sleep walk, so I always woke up in her bed with my fingers in her hair. I cried. I held her leg, and begged her not to go. That's my earliest memory. Don't leave your kid if you can help it. 

Reach out and see if there are programs/churches/whatever that can help you in your area. Good luck. Your position sounds awful. Wishing you the best.
