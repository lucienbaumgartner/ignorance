You are brushing off the self esteem issues of all men because the minority of men committing crimes is larger than the minority of women committing crimes. And to clarify, yes, they are referred to as MEN, not MALES, as you called them in a different post. I know it must be tough trying to pretend that you aren't an incel, but calling men "males" or women "females" is kind of a dead giveaway, not mention calling "males" stupid and unaware and advocating for a world in which 70% of the population are women. Admittedly I don't know if you ever argued for trying to transition to that ratio, but that's still a big yikes. 

Your original post was that some women have been left with 0 self worth due to men, which is true. Someone says "and vice versa..." and you respond with "Hardly." Not only that, you then respond with rape, murder, and theft statistics which no one fucking asked for. Are you trying to argue that the main way people lose self esteem and self worth are due to rape, murder (how the fuck can you lose self esteem from being murdered, you are dead ffs, why on god's green earth did you even cite this statistic), and theft (also pretty irrelevant but ok). I understand that rape isn't exactly boosting people's self esteem, but the large majority of people have not been raped, and yet over half of the population has poor self esteem. Clearly, they are losing self esteem from other places, so when you argue that men lose self esteem from women a lot less than the other way around, you might be able to successfully argue that, but the statistics you cite are irrelevant. I'm not aware of any good way of measuring exactly which people are degrading your self esteem and what their gender is. Usually, you don't even notice when your self-esteem is being whittled away, since if you did, you would probably ignore it. The fact is, trying to figure out which gender reduces the other gender's self esteem more is extremely difficult, and copy/pasting crime statistics 15 times in this thread isn't gonna change anyone's mind. 

And yes, you do need to look inward, because you are a femcel and possibly a misandrist who is using statistics that, while alarming and speak to a bigger societal problem, are completely irrelevant to the discussion on self-esteem, yet you are using those statistics to justify ignoring problems a large number of men face. You need to understand that men (not males) are people and individuals and most face just as many problems and societal issues as most women do. Yes, some statistics are disproportionately skewed towards one or the other, but those aren't (or at least shouldn't be) discussed right now because it isn't relevant to the topic.
