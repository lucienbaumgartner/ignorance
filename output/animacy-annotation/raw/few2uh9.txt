&gt;We have has a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengaging the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.

&gt;To win in 2008 we will need to mount two large campaigns. The first will use national, state and local media to define the issues and narratives that will ultimately shape the election—a progressive “Messaging Campaign.” The second will be a voter contact and mobilization effort in targeted states to move swing voters and mobilize progressive voters—a progressive “Mobilization Campaign.” A successful joint strategy must be developed and executed to connect the messaging component to the ground game.

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

&gt;Every “person of color” should read Podesta’s emails and see how they’re being used and manipulated. DEMOGRAPHICS IS DESTINY is a DIRECT QUOTE FROM JOHN PODESTA TO GEORGE SOROS

&gt;Email from John Podesta to Soros from WikiLeaks. Mass immigration is really mass incarceration of people who oppose population replacement to the required demographic shift in order to obtain a progressive majority. Minorities are being played and used for gaining power:

&gt;"An “emerging progressive majority” is a realistic possibility in terms of demographic and voting patterns. But it is incomplete in terms of organizing and political work. Women, communities of color, and highly educated professionals are core parts of the progressive coalition. Nationally, and in key battleground states, their influence is growing. Latinos and young voters are quickly solidifying in this coalition as well. But many of these voters are new to the process. All of these groups—in addition to working class voters and independents picked up in 2006—will require significant long-term engagement in order to keep them reliably on our side."

&gt;As someone else once described it: It's a step by step plan on how to control the masses so that they believe fake things about the Republican candidate that makes them look unelectable, and fake things about the Democratic candidate that makes them look like the only safe/rational choice. It's basically a blueprint to purposeful mass indoctrination. It's not just about the Republicans - it is specific to cutting out white men and white working class people.

&gt;If you can't change the VOTES, change the VOTERS!
