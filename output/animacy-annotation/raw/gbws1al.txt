That’s awful. “Staying together for the children” is the stupidest, most shortsighted, selfish bullshit I’ve ever heard and it blows my mind that people are so dumb and ignorant that they think that’s the best way to go and a good idea. If you don’t give a shit about your children (or yourself) and you want them to be raised by two obviously unhappy, incompatible people who treat each other badly and have constant tense, uncomfortable interactions in a toxic household and then traumatize them further when you inevitably split, then I suppose that’s your prerogative. Hopefully OP is smarter, more rational and realistic that that. Why would you put yourself and your kid(s) through all that trauma and bullshit if you could prevent it by just being smart and logical? Also, once a cheater, ALWAYS a cheater. Why would you try to make it work with some worthless asshole who didn’t even respect you enough to tell you how he was feeling before he decided to stick his dick in some other random bitch behind your back? That’s disgusting. There’s NO excuse for that. Period.
