As the mom of a 26 weeker I disagree with your comment that the grass is always greener. It's also very disrespectful to say that. I can assure you that the mom of a baby born as early as mine was would want the long tiring miserable pregnancy any day. The mom of a healthy full term baby would not want a 4 month NICU stay with baby coming home on oxygen- if they did wish that they'd be completely insensitive and ignorant of the reality of a severely premature child.
