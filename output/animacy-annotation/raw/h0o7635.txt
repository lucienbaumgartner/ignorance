Well, how do you address the failure of Marxism in Russia and China, the crimes committed under these regimes, and the fact that USSR fell apart and China turned into a capitalist dictatorship with massive inequalities?

To me, it's even more important as a reason to be Social Democrat. Marxist theory is interesting but it's not advanced enough, and we need to go far beyond Marx's ideas.

The reasons you give are practical, but to me the most important is that the underlying theory is extremely insufficient and ignorant of human nature.
