you'd think that, but if it's busy and they're doing 10 things at once (which they do sometimes) it's very possible. I was a teller for a few years and I know how when theres a line of 5 people, your shorthanded, and your manager tells you to keep getting people out as fast as possible, you will overlook a few things that arent done perfectly or get back to them later (like counting your cash that you get from the vault). 

plus if that guy was smart, he would've probably said he just exchanged cash from a friend or was given it at "X" store after buying something (having a receipt from that day or whatever as an alibi. You can't just prove someone made counterfeit money just because they happen to have it. They can be innocent and unaware that they are circulating it. Just feign ignorance.
