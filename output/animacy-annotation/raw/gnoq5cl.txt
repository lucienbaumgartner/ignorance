The fact you do not seem to understand that your comment DID carry a blas√© and dismissive tone makes me seriously question your ability to understand social interactions in real life. Do you actually think yours was an appropriate response to someone sharing something they're excited about? The appropriate response is to either say nothing and move on if you don't agree, or add something constructive to the dialogue that explains why you don't feel the same. Saying "I'm good" blankly carries a tone, no amount of aimlessly talking in circles changes that fact. This is not a contribution, it's detracting from the point of the post and fucking annoying, frankly. 

People who act righteous and non confrontational on the internet while being generally rude and unaware of the way they portray themselves are likely the most insufferable people. Fuck.
