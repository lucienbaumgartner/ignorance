Yeah, he is.

But the knee vs Bipsing is not an example of that. And obviously there are no examples of that in the Brunson fight. Or either Weidman fight, or the DC fight.

So you have to go to October 2012 to find an example of Anderson Silva knocking down a high-level opponent by catching them clean and unaware. And 6 years is a long time whatever age we're talking about, but between the ages of 36 and 43 it's an especially long time.
