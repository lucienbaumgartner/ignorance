&gt;Assumption number 2 is strange, how can you sell a buisness in a socialist society?

By selling it's components. Sell everything inside at a cheaper price and then sell the building.

&gt;It isn't just that it's more efficient, there is higher worker satisfaction, lower turnover rates, 70-80% higher wages, etc.

How in the world did you managed to quantify and measure personal and subjective satisfaction from people around the world in today's system, measure the personal and subjective satisfaction of hipotetical people in a hipotetical scenario and say with absolute certainty that "**There is higher worker satisfaction**". HOW?

You are just being arrogant and ignorant of reality now. There is no way you could do all that or logically prove it.

You can't logically prove anything you said on that number two. But I'll stick to the satisfaction thing.
