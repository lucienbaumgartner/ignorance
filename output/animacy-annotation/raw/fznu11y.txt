Main accounts and ironman accounts buying services are both scumbags.

Reddit has been noticing tweets from these service providers that show main accounts and ironmen both having bought services.

While mains and ironmen are both scumbags for doing this, it seems especially scummy and ignorant that an ironman account would have someone else do the work for them. 

This is obviously because the entire point on ironman is to show the world that you did all of these things yourself. It's a challenge.
