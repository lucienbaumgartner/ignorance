I didn't say that. 

From my impartial view of this - as a Canadian with no horse in this race - everything I have learned about this issue has shown me just awful, reprehensible behaviour by the Israeli state. 

To act surprised that you are seeing violent outbursts from a repressed population, with no avenue for meaningful democratic representation, is naive and ignorant of history. 

Do  think violence is justified? Never. Do I understand it's origins in this instance given the situation? Yes. And the Israeli state and government shares culpability with those launching the rockets.
