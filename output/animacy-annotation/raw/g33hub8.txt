That is a really good point. Unfortunately the people posting to this sub are too obtuse and have to have things explicitly explained to them.

My favorite / classic example is this one:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

But the people here still take Tapper's POV when it is laid out for them in black and white. And they also fail to grasp that we have our Party and strategy completely planned out, to specifically **prevent accidents like Trump** from happening. (and have demonstrated that twice in a row with Sanders, in 2016 &amp; 2020)

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to* ***produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.*** *The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly*. *This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. "*

So, had the Republicans followed our lead, all of this could have been avoided. And the really sad thing is that John Podesta would have been Chief of Staff to the President in the Clinton Administration. So, the only thing we can hope is that the Biden Administration will pick him up.

Anyway, on that side, it is only the "Never Trumpers" that have clue. You have to treat voters like mushrooms: ***"keep them well manured and in the dark"*****.**

We can only hope that the Biden Administration can undo all of the damage and get King Kong back into the cage, if not we have a long long road ahead of us. (sigh)
