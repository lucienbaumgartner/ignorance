I guess you have to be honest with yourself about your own biases and the general human tendency to associate liking something with that thing having the authority to sway you to a certain point of view. For example, if I like Jimmy Dore and agree with most of what he says, but I need to be honest with myself when my admiration for his work bleeds over into blind devotion and agreement with his opinion. Use discrimination and aim to be a true “free” thinker to whatever extent possible.

Really though, within the MSM, I think much of the disagreement is manufactured and is made out to be political differences (Republican vs Democratic viewpoints) or if one side appears to disagree with the other, then one side points out that the other side is racist or sexist. You see this time and time again. A most obvious example is people who support Trump are racist and sexist. This does not address the real reason Trump was elected. 

Doing stuff like this—finger pointing and deflecting and pretending to disagree—instead of engaging in open and honest discussion works to sew division between groups of people, which keeps them fighting with each other, which gives MSM more money and political fodder. Manufacturing discontent and disagreement among groups of people keeps them distracted and unaware of the true source of their frustrations (rich sociopaths in control). This is the conspiracy theorist in me coming out though I guess...
