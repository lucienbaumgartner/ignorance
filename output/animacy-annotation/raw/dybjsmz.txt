I have a kind of similar experience that I’d like to share although, I don’t work at Starbucks. 

So sometimes I work at my fathers deli/restaurant/bagel place in NYC. We have a repeat customer who gets an expensive sandwich that becomes even more expensive because of add ons. The place customers place order is not the same place they pay. So he asks for his sandwich and comes toward me to pay at the cash register. I have to ask what he got and he tells me “I got a bagel with blah blah blah.” One of my employees comes while I’m ringing him up and as Customer is leaving, he tells me the customer had his sandwich on a flat bagel with avocado  (+$3.50). Customer heard, pretended to be surprised and unaware that he had to tell me and begrudgingly paid the difference. He was  handed his order and left. 

Apparently, he’s done this many times before.
