Gotta say, this is where a lot of random video game stuff is gonna come in handy, pretty sure I’ve seen things like “greaves” “gauntlets” “cuirass” and “vambrace” before. I’ll probably be ok, just gotta get that things mouth under control, less of an armor question and more of a strength thing. Maybe I’m ignorant and overconfident but I’d say it’s like 7/10 me. Inb4 someone pulls out a whole Wolf Respect sheet about the thousands of ways I’m fucked regardless, but I’m feeling good about this.
