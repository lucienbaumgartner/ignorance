Multiracial fan here: I’ve never dealt with racism directed at me personally. But I started watching hockey in 2014 and distinctly remember thinking, “wow, nobody who plays this sport is like me or my family.” It felt very weird to be a Latina who watched hockey. And with the way that players and the league as a whole acted, it always felt like I was watching and enjoying a sport that was very white and very racist, even if unintentionally.

But I feel like that’s starting to change. Auston Matthews has a lot in common with my family background, so seeing him succeed has been a big deal. There seems, to me at least, to be more diverse players and more space for them to talk about their experiences. Anecdotally I’ve seen more and more fans of color in my city. So overall I’d say my experience with hockey has been one of (slow, but steady) progress in the right direction, and I’m really proud of the players themselves for being a big part of that driving force.

Edit: tbh hockey fan spaces can be a lot worse for me than hockey leagues and games. I can’t count how many times I’ve seen something in the comments here on reddit or elsewhere that was just...incredibly hurtful and ignorant. That gets tiring after a while, even though I love hockey and want to hang out in fan spaces.
