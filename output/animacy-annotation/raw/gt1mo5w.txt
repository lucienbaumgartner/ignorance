Also pro choice, but against late-term abortions. In my opinion you've had ample time before three months to figure out what you want to do with your body. I think a late-term abortion under normal circumstances should be considered unethical. 

It took me awhile to come to that - because I know it's totally possible to be pregnant and unaware of it, if you don't go to the doctor that often and in the rare cases your cycle is weird enough to randomly stop/you keep having periods/your birth control failed. The idea of someone going to the doctor, finding out they're three months pregnant, then being told there's no possible way to get out of it, sounds horrifying... but if there has to be a middle ground, I'd say that's the softest one. 

I do think there should be obvious exceptions, when the mother or the baby is at risk. Forcing someone to have a baby when they know they or the child could die is just ignorant and cruel.
