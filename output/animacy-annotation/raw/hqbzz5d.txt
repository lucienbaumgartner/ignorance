My bad. I thought we all had common sense in an intp subreddit...
Children are incapable of protecting themselves, that's why they have parents until a certain age.
Saudi Arabia doesn't concern me because that is not my country, what they do over there is their decision to make.
Same as for China. I'm not sure what an uyghur is tho so I can't say to much.

I never once said the world is balanced or equal at all. On the contrary it is a very corrupt and vicious and "emotionless" place.
In this world If You Don't Develope Thick Skin, You ARE Going To Be Miserable Until You Die.
Or accept this world is a Cold Place.

Shit Happens. You Can't Force Anyone To Be Or Feel How You Want.
Don't Try. You only make yourself look ignorant and pushy.

I'm stating simply What Is and What Isn't. There's no in between. Either You are or You aren't.
Either you are alive. Or you are dead.
You can fly or you can't. 

The world needs changing but 1 person won't make it happen without a backing or following.
