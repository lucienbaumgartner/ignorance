I brought fiction as you are those who ought to believe in it. This is why you always make bible refferences when you have to explain a certain phenomenon. You forget things such as exposure, and so you thing that because an image doesnt have stars, it is fake. These "truth seekers" have done research only on subjects that support their narative, feeding their *confirmation bias*. You claim everything that doesnt agree with your perspective of the world "CGI". You use spiritual quotes as arguments. You say the same shit as every flat earther, as you cannot come up with original excuses to your uneducated and false beliefs ("I am woke, i did my research by watching youtube videos and reading facebook/reddit posts"). 
You consider yourself to be woke because you have a different idea than everyone else, it doesnt matter how stupid and ignorant that idea is, it doesnt matter to you how many actual professionals (You know, people who spent all their life studying the scientific method and the behaviour of nature. People who have official studies. People who helped build the technology you have today. People who have mental capacities far greater than yours) contradict it and you
