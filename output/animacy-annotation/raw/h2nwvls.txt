I appreciate the clarification, thank you. I will amend my statements accordingly. 

I understand and respect the desire to foster a friendly community, but in my view this was a matter that should have been handled internally within the Colville camp. If Colville fans are "harassing" Colville (quotes as I am unsure and unaware of the extent and nature of said actions), then Colville Discord mods should deal with them and police their own community. If Twitter is an issue, there are tools to deal with that as well. 

I believe Atropos' statement was unnecessary, but if that's his choice to end the issues, then I can respect that. He didn't need to address the "controversy," since all Atropos is "guilty" of its making a quality product people like to talk about.

But, as I said, I'm keen to put this overdramatic nonsense behind us, and I look forward to seeing what amazing features are coming that I can talk to everyone (but Matt Colville) about!
