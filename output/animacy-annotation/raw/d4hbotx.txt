It is not possible to be happy all the time. "messing up" is unavoidable for all human beings. No one has to put on a happy face if they don't feel happy and it's best not to. It's best to be sincere and portray your mood accurately. It isn't possible not to disappoint others once in a while. It isn't possible to be responsible for anything you cannot control. the feelings of others is not something you can control therefore you cannot be responsible for them.

You must ask yourself why you feel you must be pleasant and in control. You must question your programming and break free of your conditioning when it is inappropriate. This is something we must all do. Otherwise we risk becoming unaware and uncreative, like automatons.
