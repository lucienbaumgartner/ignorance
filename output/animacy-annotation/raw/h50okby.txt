I like the Cthulhu mythos and all but it's got about as much depth as a puddle. Its answer to most questions is "the human brain can only handle so much so there is no answer I can give." I understand that's the point but it really seems like a copout. Lovecraft was very ignorant and scared of anything that wasn't upper class New England, or stuff that existed outside of his house. Like the dude was so afraid and ignorant that he made short horror stories about Math, UV light, rural people, and air conditioners.
