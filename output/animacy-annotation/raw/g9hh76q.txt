I got an IUD last year, but it was Kyleena (not copper). Like you, I was unprepared and unaware of the pain I would experience. It was definitely the most painful thing I've felt. I was sure they had ripped apart my insides. It took about 3 or 4 days before I started feeling better. I'm already dreading going back in a few years to have it removed. I don't know if I'll have it replaced.
