Oh 😯😲🤯 i didn't see the part about the devils and thought it said \"your soul spirit having sex with your spirit 👄💔 This is suicide sex 👅\"

Somehow 🧐 as nonesensical as that might be 🔫💨 i think it makes more sense 🙃😅 like 👾🔍 if demons were 🚬🔫😈 hypothetically 👾 fucking my spirit with their presumably hot something 🥵😈👅 it wouldn't be suicide sex 😐🙃😋 with that logic (which for some reason involves death) it would be homicidal rape 🚬🔫 and that doesn't make sense either 😅🙃😂 why would they fuck my soul while i'm alive and unaware of it 🤨😐😟 They torture the souls of the departed 🔑 and my judgement 😅😂 hypothetically 👾 hasn't even come yet 😕😐🙃 why torture my soul now 💔 Fuck my living body you cowards 🤬🤮 This is merely a hypothetical scenario of course 💩 demons aren't real 🤢👿 but if this person was right and there were 😐🔪💀 ¡they'd be a bunch of cowards for not fucking my living body 💩😡🤮 Can you believe it 😅😉🤣 Fucking my soul 🚬🔫😈 got no guts demons these days 🔫 I remember back when a small deviation from the heavenly path would lead to torture and death 🩸💔🦍 what a time to be burned alive 🥴🙃💨 Was i talking about some hypothesis 🤔🔍 Ah 😅🙃🌝 yes 💋😚😽 i conclude demons are guilty of homicidal rape on sinner souls still residing on living bodies 👹🚬👿 that is all 🔫😀

Note: i've read somewhere that devils are in 🦉 definitely not in me though 😕😐🙃 spineless bitches 🤮🤬 I guess angels are out then 😕😐😑
