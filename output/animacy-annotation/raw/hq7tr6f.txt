All you need to know is theres another generation in that picture who's going to be a product of the ignorance of their mother. Is there nothing more sad than someone being ignorant and proud of that ignorance? It's bad enough when its behind closed doors or when it's just a few people who you have to be embarrassed and ashamed of as a child, but this child is going to have live her mother's embarrassment and ignorance for the rest of her life because this woman has no class, no thoughts of how her behavior is going to affect her child, and worst of all, is this child growing up to think this is normal. 

To all the black folks who suffer Legitimate hatred, racism and being treated shitty by others, this is the white person you should hate because she's doing your race and culture more damage than you could ever imagine. You have alot of your culture being mocked right in front of you and some even encourage it. 

I'm very sorry you have to live with this ignorance for the sake of ignorance. This to me is just as bad as being proud to be white trash, taking videos of yourself smoking meth, and waving a rebel flag around. There is no future in either situation and it truly makes me sad for the children that grow up in these environments  because they think this is normal. I can only imagine that this woman's mother wasnt much different unfortunately. I don't believe in God or organized religion in any way, but stuff like this truly makes me want to pray for these children.
