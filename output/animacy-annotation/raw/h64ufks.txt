I think it's a difficult one, deciding who is worst and why in this family. At the top of the pile for me is Kody since he chose this lifestyle, it's a patriarchal and hypocritically conservative lifestyle and he is in control of a lot of aspects of the women's lives at least. But everyone here is probably traumatised by something; jealousy, loneliness with an absent husband, the stress of bankruptcies and providing for that many mouths, low self esteem and brainwashing by the church/patriarchy that leads the women to believe any of this would be a good idea, parentification or absent parenting, lack of privacy, bullying and good old plain old emotional abuse. Expecting any of the women or kids to act like saints isn't going to get anyone anywhere because they're all probably carrying a lot of trauma that is affecting their behaviours, whether it's aggressive and selfish or fawning and passive. A lot of trauma can produce manipulative behaviours. Kody is a total dick but I do think the man has undiagnosed ADHD after watching the show. He's so impulsive and emotionally unaware and the amazing business ideas he was so passionate about get completely thrown to the side as soon as he's seen something new and shiny to do, like move house for no reason. Full on armchairing now though.
