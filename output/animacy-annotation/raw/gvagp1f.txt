That's how it works in weed shops in my state....ðŸ¤£and they try to say stoners are the stupid ones. Reality check...na the US west coast has a lot of randomly smart people out of nowhere. Most of us just never make it to power because beucracy doesn't like creative people. The tech companies are starting to fight for that though because they realize they can aid in it and profit of it. Some see at as them taxing small guys but I think they are enabling small guys by giving them the scalability, infrastructure, and security most small guys could never afford on their own. It also gives them a fighting chance against the corporate traditional compition. For example youtube vs tv networks. Youtube in a sense makes the possibility of stardom more accessible to the average person rather than just people in LA. It in a sense democratized economics but is given great power in doing so. Some creators are idiots and don't understand copyright laws though which I find funny they complain about that. Copyright is made to protect creators ðŸ¤£lmao society disappoints me so much it's depressing. We have all these great things come to find out most people are just horrifyingly stupid, arrogant, and ignorant. That or some people are just so smart that everything seems sh1#ty because they see how everything can improve.
