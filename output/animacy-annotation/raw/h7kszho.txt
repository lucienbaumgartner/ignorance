For me is the "people of Costco". 

This is going to sound a bit classist but I don't care: why are so many people in Costco so completely inconsiderate and unaware of their surroundings? And worse, you bring your kids with you to show them how to be equally inconsiderate.

You don't stop your cart in the middle of the aisle while looking around, and then stand on the other side of the cart this blocking the aisle for everyone. 

If you simply must get some samples, park your overflowing cart somewhere that is far less trafficked, get your sample, and get back to your cart. Don't hover over it like some animal requiring a feed bag.

And for christsake, return your cart to the corral like a human being that lives in a society.
