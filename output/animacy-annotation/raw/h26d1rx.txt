Suppose a young woman wants to have exactly one child. Suppose she gets pregnant at 14. If she keeps the baby, she will not have another. If she aborts the baby, she will have another later in her life. Plausibly, both the young girl and her potential child would be better off if she waits until she is out of high school and has a sustainable income. Thus, from a utilitarian perspective, she should abort the baby.

Another important argument for the utility of abortion is the many positive social effects. It has been shown to lead to reduced crime rates, slowed environmental deterioration, significant decrease in poverty, improvement in the quality of child care. (See *freakonomics*, and the paper The Social Effects of Legal Abortion by Richard Schwartz)

My limited understanding of Singer's view on abortion is that he thinks that fetuses do not have the right to life because they are unaware and non-rational. Thus, the mother's rights automatically take precedence.
