Say they should stop using Animals for consumption of their meat or body fluids,  animal testing, circusses, as Clothing, stop hunting, stop fishing. They all cry like a baby that has got his Favorit toy taken away. Then they complain about their bad health, that the Environment is changing but they dont know what they personally could do about it. So stupid and ignorant of facts, to justify taste over lives.
