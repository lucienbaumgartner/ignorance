They are just jealous.

But as a German this is nothing new, you get used to it. They all shut up as long as german citizens pay taxes for incompetent governments in Italy, Greece, France etc. ,but when we stop caring for them they turn into little bitch bois that cry about how awful Germany is (because of the past) and that the germans didnt change meaning that they are still Nazis and so on. Those people are usually uninformed and ignorant that dont understand how much Germany contributed to Europe and the EU since 1949. 

Greece would have been a 3rd world country if Germany didnt bail them out 3 times and some of them even blame Germany, because they have to pay more taxes now, so that the Greece government can pay its debt back to German and other western and northern european tax payers.
