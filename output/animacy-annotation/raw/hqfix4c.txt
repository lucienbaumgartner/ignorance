&gt; Do you think the term "plague rats" is a neatly defined technical term?

It's. Salute, I wanted to understand how you use it because clearly you're not being objective about it. I said 40% after 4 months but that falls to 15% after 6 months and that was for Delta which started at 85% protection from spread, Omicron currently at about 75%, so by 6 months there's no measurable difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

  


  


&gt; Its used to express frustration about people that aren't doing their best to help stop the spread.

By that standard anyone implementing vaccine mandates is a plague rat because unvaccinated people aren't required to be tested spreading the disease and prolonging the pandemic.

  


&gt; Vaccinated people are much less likely to spread the virus.

See above comment, beyond 6 months there's no measurable difference, but really unlesss you boosted last month you're more likely then not to spread Omicron.

  


&gt; So someone not getting the vaccine making the choice to be a carrier of disease.

That's also false, if you've had COVID you can't spread it the imunity is more lasting and more diverse then the vaccines, as you have more then antibody imunity but native and celular imunity as well. Furthermore if you generally avoid big gatherings you're not likely to catch or transmit it, as such vaccinated or not less outside contact is the biggest factor, classical modeling shows there's usually just a few super-spreaders it's not a game of averages.

  


So overall you're just being ignorant and fearful when you're discriminating out of your disgust towards your fellow man.
