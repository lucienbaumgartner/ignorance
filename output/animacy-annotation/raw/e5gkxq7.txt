majority of the classes will lose access to the AK and almost all will not have the akm depending on map,time, etc. they decided it would be a good idea to let the americans have m60's, m14's, and lazer16's, but that they guerrillas were to too effective...many players are unaware and unhappy as it was not as widely announced as it should be.

My bet is that if they posted this on the steam forums as an announcement itd been shot down in seconds.
