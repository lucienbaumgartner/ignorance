The Macron asslicker is back and talking like a fool once again.

First of all you ignoramus, you should not be speaking about such things with the amount of brain cells you have, you clearly don't even understand how humans communicate. You are limiting how humans express themselves to just "Speech". There are many ways a person can project/express themselves. For example, if I were having a conversation with a woman and sent her a "love heart emoji" after she said something nice to me, am I then projecting hate or love? The universal understanding of that is positive/love. DING DING DING DING, DID YOU JUST GREW A BRAIN CELL YOU MACRON ASS LICKER! SEE HOW LOGIC AND RATIONALE WORKS. HUMANS CAN EXPRESS THEMSELVES BEYOND SPEECH, VERBALLY, SOUNDS, WRITTEN, PICTURES, SONG, SIGN LANGUAGE WE HAVE MANY FORMS OF EXPRESSION!!!

&gt;The majority are trying to class cartoon caricatures as hate speech and even **seemingly sympathising with terrorists motives**

**LMAOOOOOOOOO!**

Please don't ever be a lawyer, or even get into law. You would be the worst lawyer ever. Actually, what am I saying you wouldn't even last one lecture. Do you actually think before you type or do you have Aspergers? Just because people are trying to figure out the motive of the attacker, doesn't mean they sympathize with him. What are you saying has to be the most illogical and stupidest thing I have ever read. Now if we go by your logic all the people in the world who try to come up with say a killers motive for doing a crime, such as a lawyer, judge, or a detective automatically now sympathize with the criminal......ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ

Stop talking honestly.

People like you are just emotional cry babies, who get up in arms when something like this happens in the news, you are ignorant and unaware of what's going on in the world, you don't even know what the hell you are defending, you don't understand it's history nor do you know its laws. So please, either go educate yourself or stick to playing your video games, you man child.
