It's lucky you've met noone that has. I have long covid like the commenter above has described. I understand that we can't remain isolated in our homes forever but it's pretty insulting and ignorant of you to make light of something which is really affecting people's lives, health and for some people their ability to work. Just becauase you personally haven't experienced it doesn't mean it's "blown out proportion". And it's not anxiety either. Count yourself lucky if you can painlessly walk down the stairs to the bathroom or make dinner without being out of breath. Sincerely, a previously very fit and healthy twenty-five-year old whose life has been drastically changed by covid and long-covid.
