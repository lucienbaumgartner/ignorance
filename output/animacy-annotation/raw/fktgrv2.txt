It’s difficult to say. This could be the calm before the storm.  I’m unaware of how many people have actually been tested so far but it seems like a relatively low number.      
Best advice available is to wash your hands, continue social distancing and encourage elderly and immunocompromised people to distance themselves as well (they are most at risk of severe illness or death if infected).      
It is likely that many people are already infected, but may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infecting others.  Unless we test large numbers of people we will never know for sure.      
Where we will have trouble is if too many people fall ill at once and overwhelm the available health system.  Social distancing is the best we can do right now to try to keep the number of active infections low and avoid that outcome. I hope that we do.
