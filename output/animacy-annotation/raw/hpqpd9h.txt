Im a PSW and I care for a man with cerebral palsy. Being in Alina's situation could mean the end of his trip as he's not able to walk at all. Until I started caring for him I didn't realise just how ignorant and clueless some people can be. I felt for Alina. Climbing up those stairs must have been very uncomfortable for her.
