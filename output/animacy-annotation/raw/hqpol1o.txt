Haha I saw a music sun with the same question and the same answer being the most common. Not very controversial and also not correct or a very hot take either. It’s pretty funny that they think they’re being edgy. 

I’m biased bc I grew up with the Beatles and have heard their entire catalogue and it’s literally a part of my family’s history…so seeing people judge them by their singles just makes them look ignorant and lazy. But even objectively, you wrong.
