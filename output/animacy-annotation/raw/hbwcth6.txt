They care more about being right then about other people. 

The very concept of hell is so fundamentally hideous to me. What could a person possibly do to deserve a literal eternity of unimaginable suffering? I can't think of any crime in human history so heinous that this makes sense. Who does it even help?! Who benefits?! 

The Buddhists believe in hell, something most people don't seem to know. Thing is they think it is something you impose on yourself. You're so full of hate, greedy, and ignorant that after death you end up manifesting all of these horrors for yourself by force of your own negativity. Thing is, it's also not "real". It's like a nightmare, something cooked up by the mind. The only way to end is to admit that it is just a dream, that none of it matters. 

I can buy something like that. At least that has internal logic to it. But when christians or muslims talk about hell I just think it is fucking horrifying. Not because of hell itself but because it means god is *really* that fucking terrible and cruel. Like we're stuck in a universe totally controlled by this inhuman entity with no compassion or pity whatsoever that will destroy us body and soul for some vague moral point that we were never equipped to understand to begin with.
