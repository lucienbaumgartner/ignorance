Tbh doesn't sound like a problem with NPD. She just sounds very selfish and unaware of herself.

If she really is a narcissist, be careful of getting on her bad side, having all your roommates turned against you and being kicked out. Never out a narcissist roommate.

I would throw all her nasty dishes and expired food in the trash next time.
