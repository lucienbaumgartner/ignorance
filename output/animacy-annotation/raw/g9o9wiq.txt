There’s a saying that if you have to choose between two people you should always choose the second one because if the first person was really meant to be, you would never have been able to fall for someone else. 

That being said, as an INFJ I have very little patience for people with ADHD. I have a friend who has it and I am especially drained after hanging out with her. I’m pretty informed on ADHD and it’s symptoms, but it’s still hard for me to wrap my mind around how someone can be SO distracted and unaware of their surroundings, and I certainly can’t imagine being in a romantic relationship with someone who is that scatter brained and unreliable. 

I would choose the INFP if they seem like they’re taking steps to get their mental health under control, and as long as these “daily routines and habits” align with your career goals and financial status. I know INFJs like to change our partners, but in reality change needs to come from within, and really our most successful relationships exist when we aren’t constantly having to worry about our partners.
