This literally means entering someone's PRIVATE sphere. This isn't even about vegans at this point, this is about an employer violating their employees' basic needs' sphere. It's insane that I have to explain to anyone that this is fucked up and wrong. 

Also, you absolutely CAN love animals in general and also eat some of them. Assuming you can't is just ignorant and simplistic and frankly outside of any realm of reason.
