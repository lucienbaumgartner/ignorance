You are talking about different jobs then I am talking about. There is blue collar and white collar and whatever you are mentioning. You still refuse to actually listen and you more or less cherry pick the argument. I am anti-capitalist. I am not trying to argue for another reform of capitalism. I am a communist. But i am arguing the socialism aspect. 

You can ask a large amount of people if they should be paid more and use a scientific method of doing so to actually get an answer. Saying that i cant find someone who is being paid less then they should is clearly stupid because even you know that you can. 

A large amount of people want to raise the minimum wage that they have been working under for a long time and they know their labor is worth more. The longer you work at a job the more you realize what your labor is worth. So saying you can find someone else to do it for less may be true, but its a never ending system  of taking advantage of the worker, because the others are less experienced and educated. 

It has to be set by the government because they would drive down the wages as much as they can. No wonder why people outsource to impoverished countries because those people are less educated and experienced. 

If he said, “I need $75/hr to do this job” what would happen? Some jobs can be a negotiation of salary, but thats not all jobs. But we will have different definitions of jobs.

You dont understand so you are afraid to understand, and so you refuse to try. Its like calling Venezuela “socialist”. You are afraid to be wrong, so you do no research your own that might contest your opinion. 

Arguing with you is pointless because you refuse to actually realize what I am saying. You twist my words around in your head in order to fit your view of what socialism is. You just refuse to understand socialism and how a planned economy works. You wont even go as far as to read about the basics. I cant argue with ignorance. 

If you have any readings that you could suggest I would be happy to take a look. I have mentioned multiple times that if you do a quick search, you might have an easier time understanding but you have only mentioned taking a class, which I already am, and nothing pertaining to something I could read to get a better understanding. You seem extremely annoyed and ignorant that I am not understanding your viewpoint but fail to provide anything to help. If you do then great, otherwise have a nice night.
