First Time betta wonder here. My betta, Spyro, has had a rough couple weeks due to renovations. When I first got him, I taught him to jump out of the water to fit my finger to get food, put videos on my phone for him to watch, made him follow my finger along the glass, and used a mirror every day to help with mental stimulation and keep him entertained. Once we started Renos, I just dropped food into his bowl and wasnâ€™t engaging with him like I did before. 

Today while I was cleaning his tank, I noticed that he had these black blotches on his head and he seemed a little nervous I guess. Also a bit on aggression when I was sitting by his bowl (swimming erratically and opening his mouth-no flairing though) 

These black blotches were not on him before... so I am very concerned and unaware of what this is due to. 

Also there has been an oily/cloudy film over the surface of the water every 2-3 days. I take a few cups of water out, wipe the sides of the tank and refill the water with a few drops of water conditioner when this happens.

Does anyone have an idea what this is?
