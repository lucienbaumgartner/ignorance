They literally can’t. They are designed in a way that makes it impossible. The law is the law...there are so many layers, legal teams and paperwork involved that in all honesty, I doubt she will fully get out of it. Unless the laws around these conservatorships are reviewed and changed. Never heard of anyone getting out of one and many people have said the same thing. 

The judge who approved this needs a trial...how did they let an absentee, abusive alcoholic father take financial control. It makes no sense. Thee will have been lots of dodgy deals going on behind the scenes before it was put in place. It was all set up so carefully. These sketchy individuals pulled in other sketchy people who agreed ensure Britney remained vulnerable and unaware of what was happening. 

Her father and Jodi are psychopaths. There are multiple others involved. What the hell is happening right now behind closed doors. Is there anybody there to protect her??? I don’t think so...
