I cannot wrap my head around how a nation founded to create a homeland for a religion/ethnicity that was nearly eradicated by this exact same rhetoric, behavior, and governance could do the exact same thing to another group. It's being illogical. It's so desperately stupid and ignorant of their own history and culture. It's disgusting.
