Could he beat Biden in a debate? Given that Biden has threatened to beat him up before, he probably could. All he needs to do to win is to make the other candidate look like just as much of a buffoon as he is, and the racists and ignorant people could still carry him. By this point, everyone has heard of the many, many things that Trump has done which the media has reported, but if those things aren't enough for the republicans or independents when the media say them, they won't be enough when the democratic candidate says them. What we need is someone to go up there and make Trump look unprofessional, incompetent, and ignorant. That won't sway most republicans, but it might sway some independents.
