But that's not even what you said yourself. I can quote you if you like....

&gt;more people should be alarmed at 13% of the population committing 52% of the violent crimes.

&gt;people from the black demographic" commit half the violent crime while only being 13% of the population

That's still completely ignorant and highly inaccurate. Why would you compare particular crimes to an entire races population??

White people make up 67% of convicted Rapists would you compare that to the entire white race, women, children, the elderly, disabled? That's not how statistics work.

If you're sensitive about the ad hominem, then don't say things that are completely FALSE and ridiculous. Read a book!
