&gt;You're clearly uninformed; pick up a history book.

Projection is hilarious.

&gt;That is such a non sequitur it's not even funny. Having Israeli technology in your phone does not at all mean that users of those phones accept that Israel is a country. It means nothing, because the vast majority of them are entirely unaware and unconcerned with where the technology or components of their phone come from. Most phones are manufactured in China, does this mean all of us approve of the CCP's concentration camps?

Pretty much, since I never see this much vitriol about China ever.

&gt;You made an irrelevant statement about some people liking Israel, and I charitably made your point for you: that you think people liking something makes it credible and legitimate. I refuted that by giving examples of things that some people also like that are not credible, legitimate, or good.

I too give sly insults because it is cruise control for cool.

&gt;Some people like Iran. Now what? What does saying "some people like Israel" do to further any semblance of a point you're trying to make?

Israel isn't going to cease to exist because some people are butthurt.

&gt;You're embarrassing yourself.

LMAO at least I'm not a BDS member.
