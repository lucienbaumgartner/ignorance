Your age is irrelevant to my comment. Millennials always complain about the boomer mentality of hating new tech like the internet and smart phones simply because they don’t understand it. But here you are hating on crypto for no reason other than the fact that it takes graphics cards off the market. What you fail to understand is that crypto mining has a minor impact on the gpu market compared to the impact of the global silicon shortage. In fact, Bitcoin is pretty much the only major crypto using gpu’s due to ethereum switching to a proof of stake model. On top of that, Bitcoin mining isn’t even profitable with gpu’s anymore and miners primarily use devices called ASIC’s for mining. This further highlights your lack of knowledge on the subject. You also claim crypto is a scam, but I doubt you could describe at a remotely functional level what crypto is, how it works, and what it can provide for a modern society. This proves that you’re simply uneducated and ignorant of the technology, and just like the boomers, you refuse to spend any modicum of effort in understanding the technology. And come on; you’re really using nerd as an insult like you’re coming straight from the 90’s.
