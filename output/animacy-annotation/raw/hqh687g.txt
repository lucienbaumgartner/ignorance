what i want from you? to stop trying to invalidate peoples feelings, concerns and opinions about an UNFINISHED game in a forum that is literally about that unfinished game. this is THE place to talk about these unfinished pixels. you saying "just game, pixel, beta" adds literally nothing to the table. you dont care about your docs case? cool man, thats great for you. a docs case is an investment of time and energy (into pixels) that this game essentially deleted from your possession. you got robbed of your time. im glad you dont give a shit about it, but i guarantee some people do, and rightfully so because that lost pixel = lost time (real life time). sure, "dont play beta" is the simplest of responses but thats akin to an american saying "if you dont like it, leave". its ignorant and illogical. yeah, OP is being whiny and annoying but the VALIDITY of his concerns is there, whether or not you want to accept that or not. these major server-side issues are killer. I have played hundreds of betas that didnt have catastrophic occurrences like this- simplifying the argument down to beta just doesnt cut it man.
