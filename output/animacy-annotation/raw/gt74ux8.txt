No, It wouldn't be. Destiny 2 has been launched and legally licensed. Changing the definition of something simply to suit your needs doesn't change the definition for the rest of the world.  


If this game is licensed as a Beta Test and legally recognized as such, regardless of what you think a Beta SHOULD be, it's still in beta. Saying they don't get to raise money for development during the process is just closed minded and ignorant of how the entire industry works.  


People... unsurprisingly, do-not-work-for-free. Charging money during a Beta test is not RARE, it's not UNCOMMON, it's not UNHEARD OF. It's actually very much so normal.

If everyone in the industry changed how things work to suit what you claim it should be, we'd likely be getting Maaaaybe 3 games a year.
