You are correct that the US has a lower immigration rate than those countries that you mentioned (Switzerland, Australia, etc.) but foreign born people make do up 15% of the total population.  Not an insignificant amount.  And given the huge total population of the USA, that makes the most total number of foreign born, by far. 

Check out the report below:

The US has a lot of racists and the US has racist politicians but the US does not have a racist immigration policy.  I'm sorry.  It does not.  It has enclaves of nationals from nearly every country in the world in its larger cities.  Think if LA.  You have Little Tokyo, Little Armenia, Thai Town, Little Bangladesh, Tehrangeles.  Those are just the ones I can think of and I've only been there once.  Those are not refugee camps.  Why do you think so many people from so many parts of the world choose to come and choose to stay?  Because they want to uproot their lives and settle amongst racists?  It just does not add up.  

Lawfulness does attract immigrants.  Some of the most educated and talented people in the world want to come to the US and do come using the immigration system as it exists today.  That's not what is happening in Saudi Arabia.  Some of the most powerful and successful people in all spheres of life are immigrants in the United States.  

No, people are not just going to start bribing doctors if we let in anyone who overstays there visa.  Not immediately anyway.  But it sets a terrible precedent right from the start of arriving in a new country that you can ignore their rules.  And you can use the system the way it works now!  That's the best part!  Sure, it can and should be reformed but every year thousand, hundreds of thousands follow the law, from all over the world!  Where's the racism!?  It's not there.  Where is your evidence that it is?

So, that is that.  Let's talk about Japan.  Not an expert but let's do a thought experiment and imagine why they might want to severely limit immigration.  

Japan has always been rather isolated, yes they have been profoundly influenced by China, but there was not much direct contact with outsiders for much of their history due to their island geography.  They have always been one of the most ethnically heterogenous countries in the world and their culture is very distinct.  

Let's say Japan suddenly switched their policies and let in significant numbers of outsiders.  Don't you think that could be profoundly disruptive to their cultural continuity and character of their country?  Don't you think that it would the beginning of a new version of Japan?  

Not saying that it would be bad.  The US has been very successful as an ethnic amalgam since before independence but we have had much much more experience.  

I'm saying I can relate to the Japanese, I can empathize with their hesitation to allow a lot of newcomers.  And frankly, I think that it is unimaginative and disrespectful to throw pejoratives like "racist" and "bigot" at them.  

What I'm saying is that immigration law and immigration policy are complicated and delicate.  We gain nothing at all by labeling the people that we disagree with and painting them as intolerant and ignorant.  That was the point of my original post and I stand by that view.
