It’s incredibly stupid to expect an entire population to just change a whole language that’s been the way it is for hundreds of years to accommodate to superficial performative activism. I’ll drop the o’s and a’s for e’s and x’s when I see people start actually giving a shit about gendered issues in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Femicide, for starters. LGBTQ violence and discrimination. Among many others. 

I don’t think it’s offensive, but I find it ignorant and selective. I think it’s a very easy way to pretend to give a shit and pretend to do your part in being inclusive when in reality it doesn’t mean or change shit. THATS why Latinos tend to take issue with it. We don’t think it’s inherently offensive in the way racial slurs are. But it’s an empty act of performative wokeness perpetuated by people who don’t even bother to understand how the language works. And it’s so weirdly targeted. Spanish isn’t the only gendered language. No one is saying, “let’s please be respectful and use francaix instead of francais/francaise” the way my white peers and teachers have corrected me when I say I’m Latina.
