Why is it not compelling in your opinion? 

I personally find it extremely gross and ignorant that somebody believes they have the right to tell other people that they cannot do something that harms themselves. 

It’s like me telling somebody that they legally cannot have sex with their partner except in ways that I have declared to be the approved methods. It’s completely arbitrary and ridiculous.
