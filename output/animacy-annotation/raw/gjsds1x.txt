Genuine question though, how many people do you think are walking around undiagnosed and unaware of their issues? I thought that my thoughts, feelings, and emotions were fairly normal for most people but didn't realize at all how bad they were until I was diagnosed and started to work on it. 

Kinda like how victims of abuse may not know they are in an abusive situation if it's all they've known, right?
