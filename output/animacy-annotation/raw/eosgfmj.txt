Thank you! I have thought about it, but haven't yet been in the situation where it was a pressing issue worth undergoing an operation for. My last relationship was 7 (!) years ago; back then I hadn't wanted children but, being young and unaware that "childfree" was a thing, I just grew used to the idea that we would fulfil his "dream" and have them (it would have been a disaster). Nowadays there are reasons why being in a relationship might not be right for me but, if it happened, I would certainly talk to my doctor about sterilisation.
