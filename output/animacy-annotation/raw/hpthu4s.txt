If you found black people unattractive thats fine. And I wouldn't be surprised if one day, race sexualities exist. 

I have comprehension just fine. I've done my research and ive had countless conversations. The bottom line is, I physically can no be sexually attracted i them. It's not my choice. You people don't understand that. It's NOT MY CHOICE. I can see a sexy Instagram model and think she's looking good, and then if I'm told she's trans, I lose all sexual attraction. I'll still think she's attractive, but I will no longer have a sexual attraction. Same thing with men. I can see that men ARE attractive, but don't have a sexual attraction ever. 

The fact that you say I'm transphobic based on this one thing is ignorant and bigoted. You don't know me. You aren't with me going to the pride/equality festivals, you apparently aren't reading my comments where I defend trans rights to be treated as their identity IN super straight subs, you don't care about anything other than the label. Yes the label was/is used by many for transphobic purposes, but some homosexuals are extremely Biphobic, that doesn't mean that ALL of them are. 

You may not try to come off as rude, but you are. You are judging me without taking the time to actually learn the information.
