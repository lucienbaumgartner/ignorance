My sister thinks she's better than our parents lol. She claims to have been in therapy but I reckon only a session or few, definitely not long enough to come to terms with anything. She will make judgements on their parenting all the time, and to be fair, holds valid points because my father was an abusive prick. But my sister is neglectful at best. She uses her kids to get attention and that's about it. Her husband has even threatened to knock their toddler kids teeth out. Sounded just like my father. But they think they're good parents.

The type of people who say this shit are narcissistic and unaware of their own actions.
