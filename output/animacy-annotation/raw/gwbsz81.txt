The bloody internet has a lot to answer for, as has the pornification of culture. Look at how he writes to me above. “MILF” wasn’t a thing when I was growing up. Boys objectifying older women wasn’t a “category”. I’m not anti-porn, but it has fucked with a lot of young, underdeveloped minds, and I think we are seeing that with these scary Child Incels - angry and entitled and unaware that GENERATIONS of teenagers of both genders before them have felt spotty or chubby or awkward or unattractive or insecure, or feared dying as virgins. We just didn’t feel entitled to sex and adulation, nor did we  externalise that blame onto an entire gender!  It boggles the mind.
