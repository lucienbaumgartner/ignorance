Like many have said not only is this a HIPAA violation but she ruined the opportunity for OP/boyfriend to tell her mom/family her way. what if They had plans to do a whole pregnancy surprise reveal or something along those lines. Even though OP already said her mom and family are supportive of the pregnancy The friend was completely ignorant and disrespectful and stripped what could have been an even more special moment between OP boyfriend and her mother. Shame on her she most definitely deserves to be fired
