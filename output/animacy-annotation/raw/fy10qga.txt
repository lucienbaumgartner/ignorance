It's like how nigerian prince scams are stupid on purpose because they only want stupid people to respond to the scam. This isn't polling, this is Trump's campaign using a fake poll to pick out donors. There are people out there that are so dumb and ignorant that they believe all real polls are horrible and biased against Trump, so they get a kick out of these fake polls and pull out their credit card because Trump is "sticking it to the liberal media".
