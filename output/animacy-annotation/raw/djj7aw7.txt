So you're saying "Except that this e-mail doesn't actually show that at all." is Bill Ivey's words? I'm confused on that bit.

To me "creating an unaware and compliant society" seems like brain washing to me. You think our politicians are just dumb and lying and that's the problem? No nefarious plan at all? Really? You even say "dumbing down America", isn't "dumbing down" a form of brain washing? 

Also you just confirmed you're an outsider to the community and have no actual idea of what goes on here and what we actually think and trying to achieve...
