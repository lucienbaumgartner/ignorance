Did you read that article? It confirmed that Dunning and Kruger found that less capable people had *higher* self-evaluations than their actual level of skill. 

&gt;Their results showed that on average the students overestimated themselves and that this was chiefly due to the self-assessments of the lowest scoring quartile, while the highest scoring quartile slightly underestimated their own performance.

I never claimed that OP claimed to know everything, just that they claimed to know more than they do. Unskilled and unaware of it. 

I think youâ€™ve misunderstood my comment and got a bit too trigger-happy on the correction, my friend.
