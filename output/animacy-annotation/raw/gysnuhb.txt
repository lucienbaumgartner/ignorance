I don't know if I'd qualify it as lazy. To me, it seems more carefree and ignorant of the defense â€” a mindset I would assume is beneficial when shooting with defenders draped all over him. A sort of flow-like state that allows him to see past contests and give the sky a proper fucking. It does seem that a lot of his turnovers come when he's hunting his shot and can't get it off. Almost like his mind doesn't come back to reality in time to realize a left-handed whip pass over the top of a defender with 6 inches on him might not be such a great idea.


Or, maybe I'm just overthinking the semantic differences between carefree and careless...
