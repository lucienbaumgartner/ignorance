**Part 2**

&gt;Not sure if that is the perfect explanation for that, but it's a common feature that you find in these groups that they do start out as a social club with some support systems before they show their true colors.

In regards to modern California street gangs that date as far back as the 1940s, what are you basing this belief on?

&gt;Now it's debatable whether it's a transistion from the one to the other or whether the social club thing was a front to begin with to lure in people and avoid the authorities looking to closely into it, but again it's apparently a side that is present in many extremist organizations.

In regards to street criminal organizations in in the United States, be it Bloods, Crips, Hispanic gangs or Cosa Nostra, what examples do you have that they started out as mere social club fronts?

&gt;Whereas the entertainment industry just wants to make money. I mean Disney sells space fascism to little children (stormtrooper plushies) so do you expect that industry to have any moral standards when it comes to making money?

It's clear that most of society expects the entertainment industry to have *some* degree of moral standards which is why Disney doesn't sell KKK or Charles Manson plushies. We don't have porn on network television. Movies have restricted ratings.

&gt;I mean being racist is an aggrevating factor. If you're a criminal you're an asshole to individuals, if you're a racist you're an asshoole to larger groups of people in general. So yeah the impact of being an asshole is bigger.

In my entire life in California, I don't know anyone personally who has been murdered by white racists or white supremacists. Sadly, I personally do know a number of people who have been murdered as a result of gang violence.

You're saying that criminal organizations and gang violence is a lesser impact. What are you basing this on?

&gt;Though showcasing and promiting are two different things. For example you've got the problem of the impossibility to making an anti-war movie without making a pro-war movie...

This analogy doesn't even work and I'm surprised you're using it again, since we're discussing actual gang members who are promoting their gang and gang violence in a positive, and romanticized fashion.

You have people like Cardi B admitting that she still represents her gang in her music, and promoting it in every aspect of her life.

It's pointless that you keep going back to this well, since it's been established several posts ago that the particular performers I'm referring to are not using their medium to merely showcase different life situations.

&gt;And you have a tendency to use bad examples that you think are one but could also be read as the other.

None of the examples I provided are "bad," and the fact that you insist they can be read in a way that's *not* romanticizing their gang seems to be demonstrating an intentional and defiant ignorance,

Anybody that saw the numerous examples provided of Cardi B openly promoting a violent, criminal organization and still walks away arguing she's merely showcasing "life in the ghetto" is intentionally being dishonest. Either that or they are so out-of-touch with reality they must be a danger to themselves. Like, how would someone go through life being *that* naive?

&gt;Protested? Definitely. Condemned? Well unless you want to shoot people you still need to offer them some exit strategy, don't you?

But you seem to be against protesting art based on it being art. Except when it's racist apparently. And we both know that condemning someone's unrepentant actions doesn't involve "shooting" anyone. D.W. Griffith was unrepentant and defiant about pushing forward with this film *Birth of a Nation*. You yourself were claiming he was an associate of the Ku Klux Klan with an agenda. You're not going to make change with these type of people by being soft and sugar coating your words.

**condemn**/kənˈdem/*verb*express complete disapproval of, typically in public;

So for someone against arguing semantics, it seems like you're engaging in it here.

&gt;Yes but apart from that you also have gangs (read groups) of teenagers who aren't in organized crimes but just hang out and annoy the adults and to a conservative audience the two can often be conflated when that couldn't be more wrong.

You're yet again moving the goal post. In the previous posts I was clear in speaking specifically on **gang members** and the severity of their criminal activity and you responded with:

*"You wildly mix teenagers hanging out with other teenagers because they've nothing better to do and who pretend to be tougher then they are to be accepted in a hostile environment with career criminals. The thing is if a few teenagers can form a gang, it's likely not comparable to a Cosa Nostra chapter either...You can't have your cake and eat it too."*

Again, I corrected you on this because you were obviously completely unaware and ignorant to how serious, violent and sophisticated street gangs, including their teenaged members are.

There was no mention made of "groups of teenagers" who buy and wear rappers "merch" and just "hang out" to annoy adults and conservatives. But now you bring that up as a strawman argument.

You seem to be intentionally deflecting at this point.

&gt;No that's not the point. You should absolutely protest it and cancelling celebrities for their real life bullshit is a good thing.

Except, for multiple posts now, you've been going to elaborate lengths to defend and excuse the inexcusable. You haven't given the impression that these particular people should be protested or cancelled.

&gt;Though that's a double edged sword and far too often it's also used to silence people just in general. Then any rapper becomes a gang member and whatnot.

Anything can become used in the wrong way and abused. That goes without saying. We're speaking about a very specific situation of performers openly promoting violent criminal organizations.

Butwhatabout...is not productive in this case.

It's like making the (morally correct) argument that we need to speak out against, protest and boycott prominent YouTubers who are using the platform to blatantly promote white nationalism (ex Lauren Suthern, Miloe, etc) and then someone chiming in with, *yeah, bad people should be called out but lets not be hasty because too often protests and boycotts are used to silence people in general, more than any YouTuber becoming a white nationalist.*

&gt;And the other problem is that, while certainly tempting, arguing against something and generating attention for it might help it more than it hurts it.

While that can be an effect (The Streisand Effect), this is usually a cop out, and an excuse to do nothing. No one argues that speaking out against racism, sexism, rape culture, etc results in popularizing it more. But when it comes to other things, suddenly it's best no to give it more attention?

&gt;So it often makes more sense to do something productive and push the things that you want to see in the world than to push against something else and make that the pressing issue.

I'm curious, why do you continue on insisting that you can only do one thing or the other, never both? It's already been brought up how "society" pushed against something and it resulted in change (Roseanne Barr, Paula Deen, The Dixie Chicks, etc).

So obviously it can result in change. Usually the people who are advocating what you just did, usually do that because they don't want to look unpopular, "old," unhip, prudish, prejudice, etc.
