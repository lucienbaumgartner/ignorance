I often chuckle at the whole "1%" thing. You've got to be really out of touch to not realize that making $32,400 puts you in the global 1%. Yet, if you propose a 90% tax on everyone making over $32,400 so we can ship all that money to the third world, I'd bet my left nut that they'd issue some stammering excuse how that's different.

Totally unaware, and totally hypocritical. To be expected, I suppose, but it's still funny to me.
