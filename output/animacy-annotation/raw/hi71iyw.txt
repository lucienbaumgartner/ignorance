&gt; I would say the men were murdered with an illegally procured firearm transported across state lines.

You could say that.  But only if you want to be wrong and unaware of the facts.

[The firearm in question did NOT cross state lines.](https://jellyfish.news/kyle-rittenhouse-did-not-carry-a-gun-across-state-lines-attorney-l-lin-wood-says/)

And the video makes it very clear that Kyle fired only after one of the men tried to take his firearm, another struck him in the head and tried to take the firearm, and the third attacked him with a firearm in hand.

Clear instances of self-defense.
