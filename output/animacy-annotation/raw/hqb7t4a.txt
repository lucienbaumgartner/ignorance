&gt;As a dog trainer, I see it all the time and it’s incredibly discouraging. Personally, I’ve been bit or close to being bit by more labs, german shepherds, chihuahuas, etc., than pitties. There are not bad breeds—some breeds are more inclined to particular behaviors than others but no breed is prone to “aggression.” I personally stay away from just about 95% of the dog related subs because the comments and posts are ignorant and so misinformed, it impacts my mental health as it feels I can’t seem to escape that even at home, away from my work. I hope this and all the other comments help you to raise your spirits and don’t let other uneducated people dictate your joy, especially with your dog&lt;3
&gt;(FWIW I have a sweet shepherd/pit mix and people love to cross the street to get away from him which I don’t mind in the slightest.)

I think this is a bad way to talk about the hippos with others. They will think a few things without saying anything and then think we are disingenuous. They will think about how pittys are usually the top in lists that record yearly bites and they will think how they are the desired breed for illegal dog fighting.
 
They are a breed that takes more responsibility because they can be very dangerous if mistreated and not both loved and trained.
 
I never deny that a pit can be dangerous when people ask. I also show that they can be the sweetest and kindest. I think we should acknowledge their problematic history because of bad owners who are either disinterested or have bad intentions for the wonderful breed.
 
If we want to change minds, we have to be honest. Then we can show the other side of them. How well they can socialize with other dogs and people, the eagerness to listen, and the love behind big eyes and smiles.
