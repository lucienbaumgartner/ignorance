This is true. Most JWs are just severely mislead and shut out from any other perspectives which would allow them to think for themselves. Albeit they do shun their own children for leaving and teach hateful things about the LGBTQIA community, for instance, but yeah. They're painfully, painfully ignorant and unaware and it's the organization's leadership who have been perpetuating this, fervently, warning against every critical word concerning them being "apostate lies." Even with all the mountains of proof, they are afraid to look at it because they think it's literally from Satan.
