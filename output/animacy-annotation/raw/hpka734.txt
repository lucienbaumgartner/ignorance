I'm not anti black but I've lived in predominantly black areas and there are some serious issues with black culture that don't get called out.

Maybe you personally haven't been harassed but in lower income areas Asian people are often treated like shit. The corner Chinese food owners were always getting screamed at and threatened and called slurs.

I personally as a gay person have been harassed and called f*g and even physically attacked once.

So when they say "for the culture" etc it just shows how ignorant and indulgent they are because most of them have probably never stepped foot in a ghetto. Their idea of the culture is very sanitized.
