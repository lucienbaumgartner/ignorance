I agree with most of what you're saying here and she was refusing to (vigorously) condemn genocide due to an uncommon use of a very common word. I would even go so far as to say people who actually want to genocide Hwhites would watch that and come away thinking that PF shared their position, at least implicitly, because of how absent her pushback was.

But I don't think that it was intentional and I think that she was just irresponsibly uninformed, unaware, and incapable of arguing her own position.
