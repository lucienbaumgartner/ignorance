&gt;She felt like a twat for assuming I was being a bit racist and I felt like a twat for not realising

I wouldn't say they're racist but some are just unaware and genuinely curious. Whenever someone asks me where I'm from I ask them to specify and white people have always usually meant my ethnic background so I always assume that's what they're asking. It makes me really happy to hear that you meant where in England because it means you regard poc as actual Brits, but a lot of the time it holds white people (especially those who are not exposed) back from discussing race and gaining a better understanding of people's backgrounds in an attempt to not come across as racist. I don't think they should feel guilt and feel like a twat but I get what you mean.
