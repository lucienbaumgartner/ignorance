not really he killed his kid by being too poor and ignorant of the situation to be able to save them (he didn't break the window because he couldn't afford a repair.) thats probably its own punishment. It's not like this was done in malice and he's happy the kid is dead.

stupidity and poverty aren't yet criminalized or like 70% of society would be in jail brosephus.
