I get what's he's saying, but a large part of the reason people radicalise is because they don't agree with a governments policies (in this case, the UK's foreign policies, which are on a bit of an imperialist hangover).

The level of political power most people get in the UK, is the power to vote every five years, all the parties are mildly different, and the topics discussed at election are inane when we look at an international political sphere. At the end of the day, most UK citizens are so apathetic and unaware that our political system becomes more of a formality than a platform for change.

This is why radicalisation happens, people can say 'get involved at a local level' and go through the proper democratic channels, but this won't create any real change. Radicals like these want to open up a discussion, and make people aware of problems they probably don't think about much in the daily life. I don't condone terrorism, or think that it works, but I think as a society rather than getting our pitchforks out and saying what's wrong with them, we need to take a look at what we've done to provoke this reaction.
