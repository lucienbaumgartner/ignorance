They're too stupid to function because they can't see that under "free market capitalism" the things they want cannot be. They are so truly incredible stupid and ignorant that they'd even conceive of deviating from neoliberal dogma. Don't these mouth-breathing idiots know any basic facts, that the mechanisms that caused them to lose their jobs are completely logical??
