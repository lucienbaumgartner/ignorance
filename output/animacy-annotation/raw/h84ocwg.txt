Yeah this mom is really freaking weird… especially if the older sibling only sees it as helping and being nurturing. 
How you were raised with your siblings is much more the norm like globally hah. 
My daughter is three and non-reactive to seeing another kid get changed or use the potty. She’s aware that people have different parts sometimes and that’s all really. 

Kids sometimes see other kids naked. The mom being so naive and unaware that her kid has already speaks volumes.
