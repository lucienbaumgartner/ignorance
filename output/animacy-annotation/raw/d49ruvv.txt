I am an old host here.... curious if I turn instabook on, can I ever turn it off again?


I don't blame airbnb....sort of. They needed a way to purge their system of inactive host listings. Lots of hosts set up their account once and never take more than a few bookings. 

By forcing instabook, they make hosts take action by either accepting or delisting. Problem is that it leaves guests out in the cold.

I foresee a LOT of lost guests and pissed off users when they book a trip with instabook be and then arrive at the destination to find a host who is unaware and unwilling to host.
