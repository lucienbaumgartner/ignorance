Ummm... I think that Trump was not supposed to win.  I think that Hillary was supposed to win, but the voters revolted.  I was shocked.  Happy, but shocked.  I don't even like Trump, but I despise Hillary.  

Americans do not like to be told what to do.  We do not like to be told who to vote for, or who not to vote for.  We have a rebellious nature.  I think Trump was voted in as a big "Fuck you!" to the establishment.  

If you are the establishment, what do you do?  You have all of these business dealings going on around the world, and you do not want someone like Trump to come in and ruin everything right?  Plus, you have to keep up the facade of "freedom" and "democracy" so the profane American voters do not realize what is happening.  We are supposed to be kept unaware and uninformed, so we don't revolt.  

What do you do in this situation?  Well, you send in the CIA to make sure that people loyal to The Cabal are surrounding Trump to keep him in line, and to make sure he implements the "correct" policy.  You also have the CIA manipulate the media so, if Trump says something to reveal the true nature of the system, then people will ignore it as being "Trump crazy talk" or "fake news".
