&gt; Like i said, it depends on how you're defining awful. I think most people have said an offcolor joke. There are definitely people who think they've never made a comment that would be cancel worthy even in today's perspective
&gt; 
&gt; 
 
Let's try 100% of adults have said something awful in their lives.  
  

&gt;For me, personally? Only after it was acknowledged, they apologized, and there was a significantly long period of penance. 
  
How much time needs to pass before they are forgiven?   
 
&gt;And because people don't make the assumption that you're making, that everyone does this stuff.

So people are just dumb and unaware of human nature? Sad, really.
