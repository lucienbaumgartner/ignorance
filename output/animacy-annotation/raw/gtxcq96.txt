100% agree. She’ll seem relatable for a scene and I think, “Oh maybe I misread her,” and then she completely proves me wrong with her narcissism. And the way she uses Jabbar as a tool to get what she wants from Crosby? Ugh. Renée is just as bad though she seems to be a bit more ignorant and unaware of people around her, she just believes her way is the best way. Jasmine on the other hand, she’s malicious when she wants something.
