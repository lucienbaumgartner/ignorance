I have no problem criticizing or poking fun at a culture that replaces every vowel with a y. It is not part of the Appalachian accent or AAE. 

Language is culture, and this is an aspect of a toxic culture that is both willfully ignorant and joyfully hateful in its approach to life, diversity, and sexual acceptance. I am here to snark, not to defend the very culture that produces the Duggars.

If you say y’all or drop the g on the end of your present participles, feel free to sit at my table. But if someone replaces every vowel with a y in the names of girls while giving their sons biblical names because the very foundation of their faith relies on the insignificance of women and that even their spelling doesn’t matter or should be aesthetically pleasing, well I don’t give a shit.
