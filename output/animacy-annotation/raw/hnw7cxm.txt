I find that people are becoming more and more unaware and ignorant of home maintenance. I had a tenant asked me to call a plumber to fix the toilet, and I asked what was wrong and they said that it just wouldn’t work and they couldn’t use it and to send over a plumber ASAP. Ended up sending a plumber and the problem turned out to be a loose bolt holding down the toilet seat. Costed me $250
