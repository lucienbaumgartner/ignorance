Yeah, for some reason Warner Bros lately has been inconsistent and ignorant of the fact of multiple languages, and they are inconsistent in accommodating people that speak another language, for example, HBO Max where YJ is on doesn’t have Spanish but Batman the Brave and the Bold does, and Batman Beyond has the first two episodes in Spanish bu the rest of the series isn’t. Most of the DCAMU is dubbed but I have to agree with Freyzi, Season 3 is much more adult in tone and much more violent. Batman the Brave and the Bold is kid friendly and If you have HBOMax then you have it in Latam Spanish.
