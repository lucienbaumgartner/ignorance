I don't think I've ever seen such a boldly ignorant and bad faith interpretation of so many different viewpoints in a single post. Good job. I genuinely can't tell if this is a poor attempt at trolling or you're so deeply caught up in whatever internal LARP you have going on that you can't formulate a single rational argument. My own suspicion is the former over the latter.
