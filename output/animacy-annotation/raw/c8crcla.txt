You think police don't get "the same training as hunters"?!?

And you speak of hot air!?

Hunters, by and large receive the lowest level of "training" in the form of safety courses offered by.. the State.  The same entity which trains the police.  

These courses are pretty easy to sum up "Don't shoot at anything unless you know what it is you are shooting at" and "wear bright colors to avoid being shot at by people who don't follow rule #1"

There is a bit more to it and I am being a bit silly in my description but it certainly does not include rigorous training in the actual use of firearms.   

Finally.. if someone shot at a police officer and killed them, later to admit to doing it but only intending to shoot and not to murder...

How fucking well do you think that'd go over?

This guy was shot 3 times.  Point blank range.  In the chest.

And you honestly believe the intent was not to kill?

If so you are likely one of the most naive people I've come across on the Internet.

You talk about revolting because "that's just too much" for cops to kill citizens.  Have you been under a rock for the last 50 or so years?  This shit happens all the time, all over the world.  

The CIA and FBI were implicated in many missing persons and murder investigations during the civil rights movement.  Our government is currently discussing the concept of assassinating US citizens without due process and without clear indications of when such an action might be called for.  

Yeah, you're right we should revolt.  Unfortunately most people are like you and refuse to believe what is happening right in front of them.  Trying to get any support for a revolution is like talking to a brick wall.

Their intention was to shoot him in the chest 3 times.. but not to kill him..just to shoot him because they were obviously not trained and unaware that shooting someone in the chest may result in that person's death.

Give me a fucking break.
