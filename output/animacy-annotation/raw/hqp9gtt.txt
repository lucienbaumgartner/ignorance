&gt;Christians also say, “all people are made in the image of god.” What does this mean? Some people lack any moral sense at all, and act purely out of their own self-interest, how are they made in the image of God? 

Adam was made in the image of God and was subsequently corrupted by sin. We are born into this world in the likeness of Adam therefore we are fallen like him. Since a divided house cannot stand, it is inevitable that we will lose our life. That's why Jesus said whosoever tries to save their life will lose it. If we don't try to save our life, but instead lay it down like Jesus did, we can pick it up again by the same Spirit that resurrected Jesus Christ. Once that happens, death has no more sting. We can no longer be corrupted. The seed of God is in us and keeps us as His own. Anyone who receives His Spirit receives the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. 

Given all this, we don't hate the sinner who is ignorant and fallen. Jesus died so that these might have an opportunity to obtain salvation from their corrupted state - a state that each of us once experienced.
