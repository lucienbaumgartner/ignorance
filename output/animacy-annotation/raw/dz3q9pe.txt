Not a third grader. A grown adult who is in denial about their part in not having developed a work ethic as a teenager, who are grown enough to realize that having a work ethic is important... especially if they're gifted. You can't tell me that gifted High School students are blind to the fact that this is an important skill to have in life. Denying their need to have one maybe, but not completely unaware, and therefore responsible for not having made an effort to develop one.
