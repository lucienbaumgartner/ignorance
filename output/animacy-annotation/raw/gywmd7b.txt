Why did he have to guess my perspective when I clearly mentioned "unanimously and internationally recognized territory"? How much more explicit can you get? If he is oblivious and unaware of the simple fact of the territory's renowned recognition status then why is he asking such a provocative question about a sensitive conflict in the first place?
