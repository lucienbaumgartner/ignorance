What was that like? Lol. I feel I'm usually more along the realist and even pessimistic side most times. It comes with the territory, right?  
 
I'd bet those who are most accomplished are more self critical than we think. You'd have to be riding a serious wave of luck at all times if you're overly confident and unaware. That typically leads to the inability to realize your own faults. At least being hypercritical sets us on paths to work on improving ourselves and finding ways to become better or more successful people.
 
It is all about balance. We all struggle with it whether we are too harsh or not harsh enough on our internal selves. At least that's what I tell myself.
