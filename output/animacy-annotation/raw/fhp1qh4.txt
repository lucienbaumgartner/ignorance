Well, they all are good and useful

WP/DOK - is musthave in the any party. Awesome group heals, very good group utility, but kinda lack of strong single target heals and resource management can be tough for newbies

RP/Zealot - insane single target heals, very good group utility, kinda musthave #2, pretty similar to classic healers in the other MMOs

AM/Sham - very good single target heals, not bad group utility. If you didn't have RP/Zealot, they can be an option too. Shaman has insane survivability, AM didn't, but has stronger single target heals. Both are musthave if your group need strong morale pump.

All healers can have DPS specs too. They are not welcomed in this state anywhere, but only in small-scaled parties, that are know very well that they are doing.

WP/DOk - melee-dps, pretty strong tho.

AM/Sham - range magic DPS, kite style of gameplay, very strong either.

RP/Zealot - easiest to gear (healing and offensive gear for them are the same), but weakest dps among other healers. Still able to kill some unaware and unhealed poor guy :D
