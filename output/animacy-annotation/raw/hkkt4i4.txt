Yes, my argument is that you and the others like you are so vengeful and ignorant that you would deny kids their rights to their father and deny their father rights to his kids because he talked to a woman while he's married to someone else. You are going against Islamic principles and even secular ones that are supposed to be worse. Like I said, no wonder this generation is so messed up.
