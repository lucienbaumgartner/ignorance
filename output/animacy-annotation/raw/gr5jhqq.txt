Seeing the sheer amount of people so unaware and willing to do mental gymnastics to wave away what North Korea does is scary. 

These people vote and make decisions that impact all of us, this stuff has repercussions for the future. They also spread the propaganda willingly which attracts more nuts. But what can we do about it? If we ask the government/big tech to censor these people we're barely better than North Korea in that regard. Not to mention banning people just makes them more rabid in their beliefs. I'm at a loss on what we do about this.
