What a bizarre statement to make. "All" of the people who clearly see his disrespectful, misogynistic, and inappropriate behavior toward his daughter are "idiots" and "teenagers?" That's interesting; I suppose I'm the oldest, most intelligent teenager here as a 52-year-old mother of two teens since I agree with their assessments. If he wants to "protect" his daughter, he should be talking to her about safe sex and how to maintain her own bodily autonomy. Instead, he thought he was entrusting her to a teenage boy to safeguard her chastity. It would be hilarious if it wasn't so incredibly misguided, ignorant, and chauvinistic. And now she has "betrayed" her own father by being intimate with her boyfriend? That's beyond creepy; it's disgusting, frankly. But hey, let's take it even further by withholding her college education over it, too. OP has created the perfect situation for losing his daughter for good. This is a perfect primer on why a child goes NC with their parent. 

OP, YTA, absolutely guaranteed.
