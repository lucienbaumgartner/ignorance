Thanks for your feedback. And one thing I’ve found out more recently is that the incidence of all types of bipolar disorder in the community is estimated to be one person in fifty. Therefore, we’ve probably all met at least one person with bipolar disorder of some kind in the past year, and probably don’t even know they have it. 

Even when completely unaware and untreated, a bipolar sufferer doesn’t exhibit symptoms every day of their life, and even when acutely suffering, mania or hypomania is only part of the cycle of mood issues. That’s why it’s quite difficult to watch both Kanye and Elon right now, because to people who’ve had a little bit of experience with the disease can see that they are clearly suffering mania or hypomania at the moment, though both of them personally probably feel pretty great right now. This is the hardest part of bipolar for the outsider looking in - the sufferer is feeling wonderful, happy to not feel depressed right now, etc, but they might be saying or doing things that make them seem ‘crazy’, ‘mean’, ‘arrogant’, or ‘stupid’. This can ruin the persons reputation if people are not compassionate and/or do not understand bipolar. Kanye and Elon are clearly very talented and intelligent men, and I’m speaking out about these generalised symptoms of bipolar in the hope that people can understand that these behaviours are part of untreated illness, and that we shouldn’t mock or dismiss them, we should instead try to encourage them to get some treatment and not to make potentially damaging decisions in the moment.
