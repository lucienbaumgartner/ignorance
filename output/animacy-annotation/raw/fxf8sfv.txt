It’s all for nothing though. I live in CA and I went to Trader Joe’s, where there is at least 6 signs or pictures out front asking customers to wear masks, and wouldn’t you know there is always 3-4 mother fuckers in there who won’t do it. Putting us at risk because they wanna make a stand. Just because some mayor says to wear masks, police have to enforce. What’s the consequence for not wearing? Usually nothing, unless you make a big deal and get fired like that twat from Costco in Florida. I wish Americans were more patriotic, but we’ve all become fat, unaware, and uneducated in the important sciences. This is why we have fallen so far behind
