Brother. It is not wrong to mingle as long as youre direct and precise with your actions and intentions. 

Not to string some girl along for a sad story to tell later down the road. 

You're a man. Take charge. Mostly in your own life. There's hundreds of thousands upon billions of fish in this sea.....

Have standards. Principles. Goals and maintain your path. 

You do not need a woman. You want a woman. And you will always be the most important thing in your life. So take care of you first. 

If you want experience with women. Get on TikTok and look at a modern-day woman and get the experience needed without the damage being done to you. They're trash. 

No modern man will want to pick up the slop from other men running through them while women just want to have fun. 

Your "experience" could cost you a long miserable life catching some dumb std. 

Honestly. You don't need experience. You just need confidence in yourself and if you overflow with good confidence and not ignorant and arrogant confidence. Women will naturally be drawn to you. Even if you're of a lower scale and they're on an upper scale. 

Also. Women want what they can't have. You see this time and time again. Especially on TikTok now that they showcase who they really are. 

Showing you they'll reject every single guy except the one they can't have. 

As much as women want equality. They aren't. That's why we become a team. So we even ourselves out. You have a place. So does she. Whatever that maybe in your relationship. 

Don't waste your youth chasing tail that's gonna break your heart. Just focus on you bro. When time comes. You'll either meet her in your own way or she will come to you. Not saying don't expose yourself to public to Not allow this opportunity. 

Just don't actively seek for it. Wasting your time and monies. 

Invest in cryptocurrency. Become independent. Learn. Grow. Educate yourself. 

Knowledge is power and power draws women to you.
