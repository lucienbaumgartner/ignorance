Alright, so I'm 17m, I'm from sweden and me and my family live in Norway atm. But we always go back to sweden in the summer to meet up with friends and such. I always live at friends houses and they usually live at my father's sister's house. But this year his sister is having a baby and they cant stay there since there's already alot of other family staying there. So they got the idea to borrow a camping trailer. Although they borrowed it from one of my friends parents. The thing is that we have quite alot of money. We own 3 houses and 2 cars. So I just dont understand why they would have to borrow my friends camping trailer. The answer I got was that they'll save money by doing that instead of getting an hotel or air bnb. How fucking cheap is it allowed to be? I dont think it's ok for them to borrow my friends parents trailer without even asking me what I thought of it. I find it disrespectful and ignorant that they didn't ask me first. So when they told me I got really angry and tried to understand why they'd so that. But they didn't give a good answer so I started cussing and  I'm sleeping at a friends house tonight since I cant stand them for being so obnoxious. 
Now, they just called me and said they'll take away my monthly allowance for being such an "bad kid". AITA? Or was my reaction understandable and acceptable?.
