Me! I was raised Mormon, and the toxic combination of church culture and unrealistic Disney expectations on top of guilt and a strong message of CompHet has messed with me, and buried my attraction to women for YEARS! 

I got married at 18... during the middle of my senior year due in no small part to guilt with my sexual relationship with my ex husband. We got divorced at 20. 

I got remarried at 24, and I definitely pushed that agenda hard core as well. Not from guilt, but from the toxic combination of church expectations and my own stress to settle down ASAP. Now I’m sort of in limbo with regard to what to do since I didn’t realize I was into women until I fell for my straight married best friend (while I was also married and unaware of my attraction to women).
