I've spent literally my entire life avoiding being this dick. I have well off parents, who are business owners, and I couldn't fucking *imagine* being this spoiled and ignorant of privilege. How the fuck do you sleep at night knowing you haven't worked for ANYTHING you own? How can you stand riding off of other people and acting like it was allllll you? He has to be a total narcissist to not absolutely hate himself, like get a real job holy shit.

At the very least once his boomer parents croak (could be soon, we can just assume they're antivaxx/antimask conservative bastards) he'll blow the inheritance because he never learned to manage money and die penniless, then he can see how far "just don't go out drinking!" gets you.
