OMFG!!! You just solved a big strange mystery of my life that has been bothering me off late. I had similar crystals accidentally growing at home all throughout the pandemic , just under the stand for my salt crystal ball I had bought from 1.5 years ago from Colombia. Being highly unaware and ignorant about how such crystals may start to form, to this date , me and my house help wonder what are these glass chips and where do they belong and who kept them here while no one else has been at home in years ever since covid.. THIS IS SUCH A STRANGE FEELING. I am overwhelmed. Thank you OP.
