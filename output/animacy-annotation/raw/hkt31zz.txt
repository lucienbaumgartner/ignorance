Naked children being exposed to other naked children doesn't lead to mental health problems. The only reason you feel that way is because you were raised to think like that, a result of your socialization as a human being is that you obtain the values of the society you live in. There's nothing wrong with having values, just don't confuse delicate sensibilities with reality.  The real concerns should be bullying and sexual assault which is why there should be lockable stalls for people to get changed in or take a shower. Not to mention that it's just basic decency that everyone has the right to privacy. 

So you can recognize this is a problem without fearmongering about "the innocent and unaware children being MENTALLY BROKEN". It's precisely because they're innocent and unaware that this doesn't pose that type of problem. It changes as they grow older though as they become more socialized and become like you. This would be far more of a mental health problem for post-elementary kids.
