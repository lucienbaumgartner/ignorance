Right but the counter problem is that there *really isn't a safe way to be responsible with guns in a major city* 

There are just too many people, too many issues, too many chances. 

I'm okey with *long guns* and was unaware and disappointed there are no firing ranges.  But at some point you gotta say, having guns in my little shitty apartment is irresponsible.  My landlord could waltz in with an angle grinder, steal my guns, and have someone killed. 

Most major cities on the planet have firearm bans, usually be responding to gun incidents with overwhelming (excessive!) force.  The only country that cannot work for is the USA due to the 2nd amendment being baked in.
