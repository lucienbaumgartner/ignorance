Yeah sam stinks but you can't blame him. Jim is so lazy and unaware that sam is forced to be the dominant part of the show. This show wouldn't be so bad if Jim just gave a cursory scroll on what was trending on Twitter it's not like they talk about else anyways. We get it manifest stinks...how about give an actual opinion on the seder v crowder thing?
