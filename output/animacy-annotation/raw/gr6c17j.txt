&gt;Yes, some people are sexist, but not the average male gamer, or even close to that amount.

And nobody said they were? I've never argued the average male gamer is sexist. Why are you making up fake arguments like this?

"The video is anonymous because it's paid actors saying those lines"

I'm not talking about the guys. Obviously they're actors. The video is called "Just a gamer." It doesn't even mention Jisoo's name in the title, or in the text description, or in the start of the video (hence why I said "the start"). Your argument that it's purely a hype video for a "partnered content creator who happens to be a female" (your words) was ridiculous and I was explaining why. 

"And do you honestly think that those people, who hate women, will get  their minds changed because a video showed that there are good female  players?"

That's not how discrimination works. I've never said people perpetrating discrimination "hate women". It's not just about hatred. Mostly it's just men who are lazy and ignorant of the fact that women can be good at things like video games. I don't think anyone who "hates women" will have their minds changed, no, but I do think awareness raising can help cure ignorance, yes.
