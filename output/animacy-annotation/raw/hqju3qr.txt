The planet is on fire (it is fucking \*80 DEGREES in DECEMBER in the fucking MOUNTAINS), tens of millions of species are slated to go extinct in the next decade, no one can afford their rent/buying a home anymore, wages are beyond stagnant, the clowns we keep voting for are clearly all frauds serving the same masters and only "distinguishing" themselves among the masses by elementary-school-shit color-coding, and innocent people are dropping like flies due to the idiocy of the willfully ignorant and stupid, and I am being overworked to the point that even my fucking dreams are stress dreams about work (and STILL underpaid to boot). You bet your fucking ass I'm bitter.
