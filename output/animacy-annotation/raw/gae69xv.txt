The number of times I see that comment and the downvote brigade in this thread is so annoying. People really don't know how the US Federal Government works, nor do they know how the US Government overall is supposed to work.

To quote Bill Ivey in his email to John Podesta:

&gt;Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I’m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
