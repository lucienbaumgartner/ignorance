There's a bigger underlying issue you just pointed out: people are so uneducated and ignorant that they let the government dictate that type of behavior and the people then bring it to an extreme. If the majority of Americans were truly intelligent they would be pushing harder against state government for reopening, and pushing the federal gov to get it's fucking shit together.
