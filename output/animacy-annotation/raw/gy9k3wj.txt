I agree.  I'll bet most cases are due to attraction, as sad as that is.  You would hope people marry who they're attracted to, but in my experience 2 years out from my own divorce I have learned that it is possible to be with someone even if you aren't attracted to them because of other good traits. 

 However, after a certain age I think most people are wiser about attraction and how it can drive you to be with someone or the lack of it and you consciously live with it.  When you're young and unaware of it you may be able to trick yourself into thinking it will occur over time.  Or you come across somebody else for the first time ever that gives you those feelings.  

not excusing cheating though, just want to add some things I've learned post divorce.
