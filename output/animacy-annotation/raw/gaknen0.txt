I mean, she has different values and used different approaches than the Federation, but she’s dedicated her life to the order, stability, and unity of her Empire. She’s not necessarily inherently against utopia for idealistic reasons, like she just hates happiness. I’m sure she sought to preserve the happiness, safety, and prosperity of the people within her empire who were the favored class. So when she finds herself in a universe with a polity of similar size and scope to her empure, but which is–to her eyes–deeply vulnerable and unaware of its own weakness, seeking to preserve it makes sense to me. It’s more like if Hirohito found himself in modern Japan, without the option of becoming emperor again. He might plausible seek to undermine threats to Japanese dominance by joining an elite fighting force which eliminates enemies of the state and economy of Japan in secret without disturbing the peace of the citizenry.  He might even wish he had had the tools to do effectively protect and advance the Japanese cause without undermining their home-life in his own time. I don’t think Georgiou just loved being evil for its own sake, she sought to use power to advance the Empire, secure her own continued rule, and enjoyed the the benefits of power and the joy of destroying ones enemies.
