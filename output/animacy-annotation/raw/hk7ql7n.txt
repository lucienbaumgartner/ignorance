It’s truly the worst feeling in the world when you realize your partner cares more about what’s going on with them and not very much about your situation . if the roles were reversed you’d make her feel as comfortable as humanly possible , this is simply “treat others as you’d want to be treated” .. I always wondered if  my partner was selfish or just plain dumb and unaware of how this looks/ makes me feel. All I can say is that’s not a partner you want to lean on for the rest of life. Maybe talking and therapy helps her see she’s an idiot but all I know about life is it only gets harder if you don’t have a solid person to work with.
