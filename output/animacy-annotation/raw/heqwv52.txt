This is morbid, this guy has been heavily involved in the show. 

(I wonder if he came in to replace J. Michael Mendel? to be sure he's definitely not the right choice for a producer for Rick and Morty, he's obviously done more damage to it than any of the new staff members, but he seems completely blind and ignorant of it? is no one on the team seeing the problem?)
