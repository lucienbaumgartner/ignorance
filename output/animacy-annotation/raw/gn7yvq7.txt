1. The US Dollar has lost over 95% of its purchasing power since 1913. How's that for volatile.
2. This point is very dumb and betrays your lack of understanding of elementary division and divisibility.
3. Also very dumb. In 10+ years, Bitcoin has had zero competition from altcoins. They are merely dead weight and attempts to part money from fools in the form of buzz words and trash talk.
4. Bitcoin is not the same as gold. False and dumb.
5. Also totally false and ignorant of how people use bitcoin.
6. Invalid point. Early investors are rewarded for taking on risk when few others would. That's why early investors in Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, etc., have all been so successful. This is not unfair.
7. Not everybody is holding instead of spending. But there are many who think that Bitcoin is still very undervalued, hence there are very few products that offer enough value to persuade them to exchange for their bitcoin. This is how supply and demand works.

You made 7 outdated, inaccurate and/or outright false points. Literally nothing you said is accurate. Of course, nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin. You can continue to sit on the sidelines and pretend it isn't happening, but I would encourage you to do more research into why Bitcoin is attracting vast amounts of capital.
