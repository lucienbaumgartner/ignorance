When I was young and ignorant of the world around me, I would hear the word STEREOTYPE. Due to the context of when and how the word was used (my male parent was a racist asshole) I assumed they were referring to people of color, because what’s happening in this picture was something the racist asshole would always mock and subsequently go into a rage over. 

Please understand that I’m pointing out my own silly ignorance in this matter, not making a joke. 

Being brought up by people like that pissed me off because in my early teens I had the good sense and enough friends to understand that all of the racist shit I was exposed to was wrong. I was in a navy family and I dare not speak out about things I KNEW were untrue or wrong because it was a sure way to get my ass beat. Then we ended up stationed in Biloxi, Mississippi in 1972. The things I saw happen there and in other parts of the south seriously fucked me up early on.
