It depends on the guy.

I bartended at a pub and we would use this trick all of the time. 

Some guys maybe didn't really think the comment through and cave at explaining what they *really* meant, or are just too shy to put it into explicit words. Sometimes it gives them a chance to think over whether they really should have said it to begin with, which was our main reason for using it. Almost like they had a "do-over", and they could take the comment back by refusing to explain it. Made our lives easier if they did.

Some men also don't feel bad being sexually inappropriate to somebody they feel is slutty, so if you act innocent and unaware of basic innuendo they suddenly develop a conscience. 

But... yeah sometimes guys will just straight up explain it to you in blunt sex-ed terms.
