The Italian fascists saw themselves as above other races and themselves as the noble descendants of Rome. The Nazis allying with them recognized their heritage and assigned them a high "aryan" share or whatever (Nazi race science is so fucking stupid), but they ultimatly saw the nordic people as the purest.

Fascism isn´t inherently antisemetic, because it is inherently a made up bullshit ideology. It´s about assigning worth to humans based on whatever the ingroup deems important, and then promote the belief that society shold be structured along those lines.

Now hirachy alone doesn´t qualify something as fascist. As I said above. What makes fascism distinct is, that they assign that worth of humans to immutable qualities of people. The color of your skin, the form of your skull, the sexuality, disabilities, whatever. And of course anti-communism.

One could say tankies have quite often been anti-communist and reactionary in that way, but even the homophobia they did display was not rooted in something they deemed inherent. They thought it was a "disease" that could be "treated" by work, while Nazis thought it was a taint that needed to be eradicated. Both terrible and wrong, but one is fascist and one just horribly ignorant and stupid.

Then you can of course also bring up other individual examples of shitty Tankies that were racist or anti-semetic, but it´s as inherent to the ideology as Bakunins antisemitism is to Anarchism.
