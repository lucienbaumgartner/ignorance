you keep answering to your own assumption (strawman): i never even spoke about this cop brutality case: we all know the USA are policed by a kind of free-lancing militia which can shoot you if you are not nice to them. that happens all the time. this one case does NOT justify country-wide RIOTs and the "racism" outrage. your presumed pity with this one criminal is embarrassing given the fact you keep ignoring my mention of the hundreds and thousands of VICTIMS of you looters and pillagers who are just waiting in ambush all your life for any opportunity to attack society and bring us all down -- mr. trotsky.

as for trotsky, you have no opinion on what this guy was up to. it begins with all the decisions still made when he was in the soviet union, first the brutal murder of the tsar family. you don't seem to have much pity with them. but you should read the detailed account how the children slowly died from the gunshots. just to mention a very popular story.

with your distorted choice of heroes, from trotsky to floyd, you expose that you are unethical and don't even know how to judge good and bad. 

my compassion encompasses trotsky and floyd as well, or you, or the brutal cops, the victims of the looters, and the looters themselves -- but that does not mean these people also have my sympathies. these people are deluded in their own ways and dance the dance of samsara with each other, fighting each other over ridiculous matters, instead of trying to be constructive with each other in that situation we are in -- on this planet full of cruelty, misery, pain and death. while doing so, many like to boast about their moral superiority which is nothing but the annoying side of their delusions ...

you are abusing a murder of some idiot by some idiots as pretext to suspend public order. you are dangerous to other people. and your political views are stupid and ignorant. that is bad for you and for the rest of us.
