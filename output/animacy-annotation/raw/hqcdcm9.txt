Is that fr ur reply thinking u have the moral high ground coz ur older and i shortened my text that just says it all tbh, our oil is gone thanks to england, that oil could have been put to good use but naw england had to fuck it all up again and are u actually still stuck on the spanish veto? that was literally cleared up well ago and the eu even want to fast track an independent scotland to rejoining as they have stated. we will not lose the NHS we pay tax that goes to it countries like denmark have a very similar population and economy yet they can afford well much more than england can for its people. You honestly think because im young i have no knowledge of what is happening in politics then u are  ignorant and embarrassing age means shit your country has proved that.
