I cannot personally see any situation in which a relationship would be better off without being told. This is a matter of opinion, not fact. I will never accept that a relationship can be any better or stronger by lying about cheating, even if it means the one being cheated on goes blissfully unaware and happy. Therefore, it is in MY OPINION that it would be in everyone's best interest to be told. If your idea of a better relationship is one partner being cheated on and unaware, that is your opinion. It is not mine. In terms of "meant to be" I did not mean that there is some magical fate of two people being together, I meant that there are situations in which a relationship can survive cheating and there are some that aren't. I think that either way the truth should be disclosed. I have said *multiple* times that perhaps some people would rather be blissfully unaware but that in my opinion no relationship would be stronger because of it and so I believe that disclosure is the best option. 

As for your first question - it would matter because I would not want to be in a relationship where someone lied to me about that, end of story. I don't care if not a soul found out and there were no outside repercussions - at the end of the day I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who lies to me about cheating. So I guess we can just agree to disagree because we're running in circles at this point.
