This is one of my biggest issues with desi culture as a medical student who will be going into ob-gyn in the next year! I absolutely hate how our culture teaches young girls to be shameful and ignorant of their own bodies. I overheard an auntie of mine proudly say she had no idea sex existed before her wedding night. 

My own mom shamed me for having breasts by claiming it was due to "all the hormones in the meat." She shamed me for getting UTIs, suggesting I was whoring around. Meanwhile, it was really due to my undiagnosed interstitial cystitis. 

As a fourth year medical student, I can definitively say any doctor should absolutely know female anatomy and any misunderstanding on her part is due to willful ignorance.
