Well, I'm sure there's this approach I could take about how people feel a psychological need to have some sort of impact on their surroundings, to leave things for the better or the worse, because having an impact on the world deters existential crises like "Oh my glob, if i died no one would ever notice!" or something along that line of thought.  As though a lasting change in the environment has any more real world weight than say a memory of a event.  

but that sort of seems like its legitimizes douche behavior, which it doesn't at all.  Its a egocentric and selfish reaction to a common psychological issue.  

So let's say that its because they're selfish and egocentric and unaware that their decision can negatively impact others.
