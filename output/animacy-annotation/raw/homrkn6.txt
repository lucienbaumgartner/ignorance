OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 &gt; 1. I told my dad that his logic is unreasonable, and complained that I wanted to choose my own Christmas gift. 2. My dad called me ungrateful and unaware of the family's current money situation and that I should just take what I get.

 Help keep the sub engaging!
