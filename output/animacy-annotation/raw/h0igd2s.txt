The bible is essentially three very different religions crammed into one book. The Abrahamic traditions, the words of Jesus, and the doctrines of Paul. You could argue that being gay was misinterpreted in each time period. As "lust", as rebellion against marriage and having children, etc. There wasn't a very clear understanding of science and nature back then. Were bible writers homophobic - and or closeted? Very possible, the story of David and Jonathan comes to mind.

But to be far, Christianity in general and the 20th century of humankind were also very homophobic and ignorant of science. The way our own society, our governments, (outside of JWs) treated LBGTQ for so long was shameful. Thankfully, people are wising up and some parts of Christianity are opening their minds to science.
