Religion created the normative analysis that allows you to understand that N. Korea is a bad place.  There are modern philosophers that try and remake the ‘right versus wrong’ framework (Rawls being a famous one) but ultimately it all came from Religion.  To assume a well constructed two thousand year old religion can’t give us answers on how to deal with an easy situation like N Korea is both simplistic and ignorant of what it has to offer.  So while Christianity may give people free will to be bad…it also gives people free will to stand up to and fight against tyrants
