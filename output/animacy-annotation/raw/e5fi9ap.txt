&gt; Gun depression determines where you can go on the map

That is true. So what happens when the two tanks you compare have the **same** gun depression?

&gt; every bump to accuracy and dispersion is important because time spent aiming is time spent under red guns.

Your accuracy and gun handling also dictates your distance to enemy. Does the 100mm allow you to play your IS further back and still be effective? Now kindly read what I wrote again.

&gt; If youâ€™re playing the IS as a camo resetting sniper..... god help you.

What makes you think resetting camo only applies to sniper? Do you need God's help for being so blissfully unaware and rude at the same time?
