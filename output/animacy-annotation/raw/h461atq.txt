Pretty arrogant and ignorant of you to think that I would need to pick on some stranger's wording to feel better about my own beliefs, especially since I've never met the stranger in my life. 

Regarding the entire thing about my argument being in shambles, I have to say that you'd have to take it one step at a time. First, you say that "not a shred of evidence has surfaced" and "we have zero evidence for the events in the bible". 

First step to my argument is to get you to admit that what you said is wrong and there are indeed evidence available. Then we'll go on from there.


Also, I must say that generalising all Christians really ain't helping you at all, especially right after you claimed that the other party's argument is in shambles.

Lastly, my bad for the ambiguity but the "fact" I was tryna debunk with your argument is actually the big bang theory.
