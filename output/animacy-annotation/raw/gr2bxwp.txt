My family is like your mother is too, just very... sheltered and ignorant of the world. My mom especially. 

My dad meanwhile, has the "fear" thing you mentioned. He's too scared to ever leave the USA in his lifetime, because he thinks the plane will be hijacked, or he'll get food poisoning, or end up getting robbed, or who knows. 

My reason for not leaving... money.
