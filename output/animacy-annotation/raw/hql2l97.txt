First, who is going to see the 1,000 ships? The troops that aren't guarding that section of the line, because it was specifically chosen because nobody was there?

Second, let's say for arguments sake a small screen of outposts are manning some bunkers of lightly defended beach and an observer spots 1,000 ships and report it up the chain on phones or radios to higher HQ. Then what? Is the inland reserve going to race to the beach to get their in time to stop the landing? How are they going to stop themselves from being interdicted by naval gunfire and air strikes? Are defenders from other sectors going to abandon their positions to move to the other one with the ships? 

What happens if it's a trick, and only a bunch of ships with no landing craft that are there as part of a deception plan, trying to get the enemy to divert their reserve or shift their defense to the wrong spot. 

You're a simpleton discussing a subject you clearly have no clue about. You can keep replying and I can have the fun of embarrassing you with every reply while entertaining and educating those reading our exchange, or you can do the rational thing and stop now, delete these posts so people reading your post history won't have obvious evidence you're both ignorant and argumentative, and save my valuable time.
