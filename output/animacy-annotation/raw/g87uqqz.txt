I get what you’re saying completely, there are lots of posts on this sub that don’t get political at all so it is possible to “escape”. My initial comment was definitely said in a joking way bc it’s the UO thread, but I still stand by my reasoning. From my POV, it’s satisfying that White people are finally feeling at least SOME negative feelings and negative impacts because of their racism or realizing that yes race impacts all parts of life. BIPOC have been feeling this (along with actual violence) for centuries, so no I’m not going to “chill out” because some people want life to go back to normal (re: ignorant and unaware of their racism)
