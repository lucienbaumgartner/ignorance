Aww thank you! I include all our kids in most financial choices and whatnot. They know what things cost. How long it takes to save. Etc. We keep few financial things from them so they're not sheltered and unaware that "those $60 shoes didn't pop out of a magic shoe tree". 

I encourage others to do so. While some parents hide things, we're honest. We expect them to work for the things they want and to be smart about their financial decisions. So far ao good. Good luck!
