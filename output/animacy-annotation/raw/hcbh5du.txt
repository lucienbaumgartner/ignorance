As a note I'm 28, healthy and unaware of any underlying health conditions. I wasn't sure what subredit to post this, but I'm writing this hoping it'll distract me and help a bit. it's 12:40am in australia and I've been trying to sleep for the past hour. I've been having what I feel like is a panic attack since about 6pm (I don't think I've ever had one before, I mean I get anxiety a lot but never a panic attack). I don't know what triggered it but honestly I feel like I'm dying, I keep checking my pulse thinking my heart is going to stop. I don't know why, I mean my heart rate isn't high or anything and I have no pain, it physically seems irrational. I really just want to try and sleep it off but I keep getting up and pacing because It's causing me to feel jittery. I feel anxious and on edge, I'm getting cold sweats and overall it's making me feel really sick I don't know what to do. What do you guys do to cope and distract you?
