Tell these people off and please report any posts about condoning violence against innocent people. I saw your comment about someone posting killing police officer's families. Please report, screenshot it and email facebook to get them remove from facebook they deserve to be deplatform and no right to endorse violence against women and children. Which ironic since police officers are POC so they saying it's okay to kill POC women and children if they are family members of a police officer smh. You should point out to this person how racist and ignorant that is.
