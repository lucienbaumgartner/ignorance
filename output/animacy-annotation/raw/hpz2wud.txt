Dude are you blind or just really that ignorant and pretentious? The comment I replied to didn't mention anything about numbness in his genetialia. My reply had nothing to do directly with this thread, it was a response to a comment that contained "so many symptoms are the same for high and low e2", which is correct, there is overlap, so what would you do to have a definite answer: bloodwork.
