Nonverbal toddlers don’t decide what life skills their parents “force” upon them ya dingus.

Your sons made a choice about investing themselves about learning Korean and you instantly shut that down because not only are you racist trash you’re also ridiculously illogical and ignorant that you contradict your own bullshit justifications. 

&gt; And yes, I will continue to live happily as I was before.

No one’s buying that babe. You came onto the internet because your sister and your nieces will have no relationship with their bigot auntie. Meanwhile, we will continue to enjoy the love and support of our families because we aren’t racist. But I’m glad you’re doubling down maybe all that ignorance and bitterness will make you feel as nice as a hug and kiss from your nieces.
