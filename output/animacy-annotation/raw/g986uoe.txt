I'm not saying that they were directly used as a response to ADHD, I shoud make that much clear.

Reading statistics about violence, substance abuse, employment etc. etc. experienced by people with ADHD I see the kind of men who would often seek out or find themselves on the frontline. In this general sense stimulant medication would arguably have been a kind of unintended mass treatment of ADHD. 

Sort of like the way caffeine likely works today for both those aware and unaware of them having the disorder.
