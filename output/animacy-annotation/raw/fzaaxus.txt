well i definitely find people attractive, i go out of my way to look at porn/hot women when i want to get off, I've had mild crushes. 

Which is why I'm so unaware and confused of what I am and what I want.

I've just never felt a feeling of needing/wanting to have sex, though I have thought a lot about why that is. maybe my brain shuts those feelings off because I'm so insecure and unattractive and I know I'm so far away from getting laid. Maybe it's my depression, maybe i'm fucking stupid
