Wow, you're a nasty person. And I doubt you are truly here to debate in good faith.

Clearly you must be aware that people are losing their jobs over vaccine mandates. They are losing their right to participate in society. They are being denied entry to restaurants, to bars, to gyms, and to sporting events - and that's just from the one source I gave you.

Which I doubt you read, because if you had, then I wouldn't have had to list them. 

Providing people with all the answers they ask for takes time. Sometimes a source is just a simple way to refute a position - which I prefer because I dislike arguments without a good source. But hey, I guess I'm ignorant and illiterate, right? 

Or maybe I just don't like wasting time typing out responses to fools all the time.
