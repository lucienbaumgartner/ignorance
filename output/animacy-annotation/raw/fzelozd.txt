The sole purpose of government is to protect the rights of the individual not tell you what to do....

Lets consider the consequence of government (read: taxpayer) funded healthcare. Wouldn't want to be a fat old diabetic smoker now would you? Leaching off the healthcare system. Government might need to trim the fat and get rid of the leeches...start telling you what to eat, what to drink, when to exercise, when to have children, if you can have children, when you die. Do you not get it? The government needs to fuck right off. Or else you risk losing ALL your freedoms and ALL your liberties.


We as a country have become so limp, comfortable, and ignorant that so many clamor for the nanny state to take care of us and absolve us of all personal responsibility. Fucking disgusting.
