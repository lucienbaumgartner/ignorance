Literally I’ve had guys get SO pissed when I refuse to “admit” that I’m giving fake compliments. Like no Daniel, I don’t only show women kindness when I want something—that’s your thing. I’ve never in my life give a compliment I didn’t mean it’s so weirdly misogynistic and ignorant that men think women are so fake. Maybe it’s because they interpret “friendzoning” as fake kindness? SMH either way it’s entitled and egotistical asf.
