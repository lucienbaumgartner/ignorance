I would whole heartily recommend you listen to the full series of Milton william cooper's mystery babylon which can be found here https://archive.org/details/MysteryBabylonSeries-WilliamCoopertranscriptIncl   it cover the cosmic conspiracy of the ages of that a secret select group of people have been planning and guiding humanities fate since the dawn of time and that may sound silly or insane to some but I challenge all to listen and do the research themselves. Because of his predictions and info he exposed he was killed. I would also take conspiracy hunting with a grain of salt and understand that not all information is good informative and some information might just be straight up disinformation,to completely devote yourself to one side of the coin will leave you unsure,unknowing and unaware that the other side even exists, keep and open mind to everything and remember, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. God bless
