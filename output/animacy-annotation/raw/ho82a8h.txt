Holocaust is bad, while hundreds of years of colonisation is "Me, it happened". We aren't unaware of Hitler's actions. It is just enemy of enemy is friend. So please don't say 
that we are ignorant and unaware of history. When colonists are reviled like Hitler, we will consider further discussions. 

If I post a picture of a starving family during colonial period, you all will still discuss how Holocaust was bad and whether Holocaust victims were as emaciated. So don't pretend that you all care so much. Unfortunately, most people who died were in pathetic condition. We don't have rings, suitcases, shoes etc to make museums to touch the hearts of people.
