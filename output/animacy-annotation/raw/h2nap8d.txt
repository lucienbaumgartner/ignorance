A combined arms EC mode without enemy red markers, sure, why not? Arguably Naval EC could be used as a base for such a mode to be developed on. Ships deploy landing craft waves which hit beacheads and deploy tank assaults, that then need to push inland. Aircraft duking it out overhead and softening stuff up. Tanks secure coastal towns, spawn convoys that act as mobile spawn points, moving EC's front line mechanics in the process. *If such a mode is good enough, the old stale deathmatch modes can be stripped down or removed entirely.*

Most of the problems of the game modes come from the attempts to make them into quick deathmatches. 

I am angry first at the portion of the tank playerbase who would rather scream bloody murder repeatedly than *actually attempt to do something* about their situation, *because that screaming provokes overkill nerfs from the dev team.* 

Hence I blame the tank whiners first and Gaijin second, not the other way around. I *do* have a vendetta against such people for very good reason - and want their ability to legitimately whine curtailed so that whining stops damaging the game as a whole. 

I *do* want the "tank-only whiners" to be as useless as they made the things I once enjoyed. Not *suffering* outright, but appropriate karma hitting said people for their prior actions.

And I want certainty that their whining will never be listened to again - because it ultimately helps *nobody.* Tank mains proceed to get *lazy and ignorant* of the air when weapons get nerfed significantly, expecting some ankle-high obstruction to eat whole 5000kg bomb blasts like was happening for quite some time, only to whine when the nerfed stuff still manages to kill them. Those nerfs render Air AI targets that need bombs or rockets to kill basically unkillable, and did several times in years past. As a result of those nerfs, a third to half of every nation's air tree becomes pointless to play in every single game mode.
