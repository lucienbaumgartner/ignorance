You want me to go back through five years of fair work trials and give you a tally?

Plenty were good workers.  Plenty were bad workers.  That's all you need to know, to know that you're wrong.  For your view to be true, there would have to be thousands of cases where incompetent judges ruled against companies just to save "shit workers".  Have a sit in your armchair and think about that for a bit.  Think about how stupid and ignorant that makes you sound.  You're the same cartoon caricature you're criticising, just on the other side.
