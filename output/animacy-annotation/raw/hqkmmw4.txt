Hope your mother gets better and is okay 🙏🏻. That being said you need help. You obviously are misinformed and scared and that’s understandable but to be so willfully ignorant and hateful is just not okay. It’s just as likely your mother got a breakthrough case from a fellow unvaccinated person as an unvaccinated person. And seeing you are in New Jersey the vast majority of the state is vaccinated and boosted. Prayers for your mother but you’re a momo
