I don’t know what you’re not getting: most of the people I know—my neighbors, my family, coworkers—are not what you say they are. As much as you think you know about the people here, you’re wrong. Everywhere I’ve been and lived have had horrible, bigoted people. That is not unique to SEKY. Every time you repeat the lie that everyone here is a backwards, bigoted hillbilly, you diminish the work of the good people who are trying to improve life here and empower idiots like the TWP to think they’re welcome to march in our streets. 

Anytime I see people perpetuating lies about Kentucky, I will call it out. Who in this exchange is being ignorant and hateful?
