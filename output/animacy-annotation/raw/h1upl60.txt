Bud she’s only 19. That means she likely only graduated last year. Probably little job experience. Little to no credit. This whole “youre an adult the second you’re 18, pull yourself up from the boot straps and DEAL WITH IT” attitude is so fuckin toxic and ignorant of what society/the economy looks like rn. Especially after what the past year looked like. It’s not that easy and this is coming from someone who DID leave the house at 19 and figured it out

you’re also doubling down and saying the affair partner is innocent?? Didn’t you see the part where OP said that she knowingly participated in the affair? That she continued to be the cheating partner when he pursued another woman?

Her father should do some growing up and soul searching, not OP. Get your head out of your ass and see that she’s the victim of her fathers problem and has been since her parents divorced.

Edit: spelling
