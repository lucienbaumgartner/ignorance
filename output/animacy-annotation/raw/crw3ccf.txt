I understand. Looking back on it, I didn't even know much about her, either. You're right. Your complaints are legit and have a standing ground. I'm sorry. It just hurts when I think back on it. I shouldn't have directed that towards you. Thank you for understanding. I am trying to let this experience make me become stronger and more aware. I have actually been to therapy for it because I was so young and unaware that people do these things. I respect your point of view. Thank you.
