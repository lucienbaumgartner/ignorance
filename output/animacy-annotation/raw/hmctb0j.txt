It almost certainly does but it's important for us to temper our expectations as to exactly how large scale the this stuff is. Epstein was a pedophile but he was also just a very rich and therefor very well connected guy.

I'm certain there are lots of people who he worked with for years who were completely innocent and ignorant of all the super evil shit. I don't mean like, the people who went to the island. I'm sure just about all of those people, even if they didn't "know" know at least suspected that some shady shit was up. But the meme of "this person was photographed with Epstein/Maxwell at some charity event in 2004 so they *must* be a pedophile" is nonsense.

It's frustrating to get something like this where there is lots of very real evidence and a strong response by conventional power structures and then have every discussion of it get polluted by pizzagate idiots and other American partisan bullshit. I mean of course that was going to happen but it's frustrating.
