I think art that the audience likes deserves to be overanalyzed so I will do exactly that. I think the meaning of this piece isnâ€™t about lgbt being painful but about the circumstances around it. i think the piece speaks to how so many people will hate you and want to... not have you around for the relationships that you will have in your life. The guy is blind and unaware of this, and it comes from where he least expects it, his roots (yes overdramatic but the piece kinda is too).
