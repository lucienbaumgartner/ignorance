No two things that are bad are ever bad in the same way.  The issue is that they are initially sold as good in the same ways. The solution is recognizing they are bad and do something about it.


First you created a false equivalence.  Why I am not sure, but you avoided the point of ethics.  Facebook will use its platform to target children for profit and who knows what else.  They are not concerned with the children, so yes the ethics is the same to gain from mostly unaware and impressionable.   It is no different than being a child molester or abuser.  The ethics and tactics are comparable.  I personally see no difference.
