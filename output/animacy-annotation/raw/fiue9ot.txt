The sad thing is that being trans is not a decision but sometimes they are so bigoted and ignorant that they don't want to learn that and stick it in their head
That it is and the funny thing is the quote that "God made your body perfect" is a really bad argument since when you look at people with disabilities are you sure he made our body perfect. And yeah I does feel like talking to a brick wall I couldn't make my own argument from the fear that he might get mad and trust me no wants to see him get mad so I had to pass it off as if he converted me back which sucks
