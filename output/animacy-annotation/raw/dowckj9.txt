Yeah nah dosing someone with LSD while they are unable to consciously make the decision of dosing is not right. I get the sentiment, but without substantial scientific evidence that it would indeed wake them up, it's not what should be done.

People are in comas for all sorts of reasons, it's not as simple as being asleep and unaware that you aren't conscious.
