&gt; How can anyone defend this? It's fucking ridiculous. Work is for work.

Because not everyone is a vitriolic, child free individual like the majority of reddit. And a lot of us live in reality or are at the very least, aware of it. "Work is for work" is a reductivist sentiment. Can you work properly when you have mental stressors looming over you? A child is incredibly stressful, and I'm sure that she works better knowing her child is safe and secure. FYI, you take a lot of things for granted that promote your ability to work. The fact that you have a roof over your head, food to eat, etc. So no, work isn't just work. It's also the combination of factors outside of work that allow you to work. 

&gt; When you bring in your kid, you disrupt everyone and keep them from getting work done.

Doesn't seem to be the case AT ALL. OP is the only one grumpy and annoyed, all other coworkers seem to be fine with it and even interact with the child. Now what's more likely? That nearly every coworker is unreasonable? Or that one person (OP) is unreasonable. Probably the latter, right? If it was truly disrupting work, more people would take issue with it. 

&gt; The boss should have stepped in long ago to tell her to not bring the kid in again.

Why? Maybe this is allowed in the office policy. I'm sure someone would have stepped in by now if it wasn't. Who are you to say what policy is correct?

&gt; OP mentioning the issue is perfectly reasonable and if anything, he should have been much more assertive. His livelihood is at stake and the kid-bringer is shitting all over him.

This is so blind and ignorant that I actually laughed. OP's livelihood is HARDLY at stake. She can easily function, the kid doesn't even sound disruptive, even by OP's biased account. And also, what about HER livelihood?! OP may at worst be mildly inconvenienced, this woman, on the other hand simply doesn't have other options.
