Homeless people in the US are mostly Drug addicts with a combination of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  They are not simply "houseless". 

Those who are simply financially struggling mostly take advantage of shelters/resources or get help from their family and friends.  They get back on their feet quite rapidly. 

It's so ignorant and malevolent to shoe horn and misinterpret someones struggles for your narcissistic utopian ideology.
