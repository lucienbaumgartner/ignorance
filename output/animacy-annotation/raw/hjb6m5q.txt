&gt;Making the rich richer and keeping the poor, poor has nothing to do with capitalism.    
    
Lol, what other fairy tales did you latch on to?
The entire point of the embracing of market capitalism (and conservatism in particular) was for the aristocracy to retain power via capital instead of birthright after Europe started getting all guillotiney.

The idea that capitalism doesn't benefit those with capital in proportion to that capital, and undermine those without capital in proportion to their lack of access to capital, is so naive and ignorant of actual outcomes that I'm not sure where to start.

Oh wait, you're one of the "you can choose to starve therefore work is voluntary" idiots. That explains it.
