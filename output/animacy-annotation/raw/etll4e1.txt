&gt; I'm not sure what not caring about freedom intrinsically means.

It's what you just said: "I would consider freedom a good thing." Why? There's nothing *intrinsically good* about freedom. In absolute freedom, I could just kill you because I felt like it. Is that good?

We should only care about freedom when freedom provides benefits to us. I shouldn't have the freedom to murder you, right? Clearly not.

&gt; I would say that the putting parents in jail is unnecessary and the education of the child could be enforced by the state without putting the parent in jail.

That's just dodging the question: what if it can't? Harris' policy exists because, despite all the policies to help parents, some just can't get their kids to school.

What do you care about more: the parent's autonomy or the child's education?

&gt; The slurs is a case where he is restricting his own actions rather than the state.

Yes, but this is a position he *advocates* for. It's not just a personal one. And he believes that companies *should* enforce these practices.

But actually, he's in favor laws like C16 and protected classes, so yes, he thinks insulting language ought to be restricted by the state too.

&gt; If you are locked in jail but drugged so that you are perpetually happy and unaware that you are locked up is that a good thing?

I think he might. I might too. If it's perpetual, and you never know you're locked up, then yeah. It's basically if the matrix was a utopia.

&gt;  I don't get the impression from destiny that he is pro utopian communism.

Then you don't understand why he doesn't like communism. He doesn't argue against it because he's dogmatically against the idea, he argues against it because he doesn't think it'll work. If it was proven that it *can* work and produce positive outcomes, then of course he would go with it.

There's just not a single communist who's made a compelling case.
