You're this ignorant and immature and you have a son?

Oooooof.  

&gt;Do I have to ask you again where the only place is my credit card works?

Did you mean where it doesn't work?  In that case, yeah, it's the place(s) where you filled out your billing address incorrectly.


Merry Christmas dude. Continue blaming others for your own ignorance. I'm sure that sets great examples.
