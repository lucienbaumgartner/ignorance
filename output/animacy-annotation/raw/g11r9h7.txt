Here is the eye of a patient of mine who had LASIK 15 years ago.  She is completely asymptomatic and unaware that she has this.  You can see that the location of these epithelial nests are located next to an area of irregular corneal flap healing.  Epithelial cells have migrated from the surface of the cornea into the space between the flap and stroma.  No treatment is indicated.
