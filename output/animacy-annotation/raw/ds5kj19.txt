So you went from ethical non-monogamy to unethical non-monogamy. 

You two negotiated and you agreed to something you aren’t comfortable with. So instead of renegotiating, you cheat. And you do so without protection and place your health at risk (which is your choice) but then also pass that risk to your unaware and non consenting husband. 

Sounds not cool. 

Do you think he knows you’re cheating and is ok with it as long as he can pretend you’re not with a “don’t ask, don’t tell” situation?  

Or do you think he believes he was honest and communicated a boundary that he thinks his partner who loves him is respecting?  

I wonder what he would do if you were honest and said monogamy isn’t working for you. That you need to hotwife or have the marriage open or you can’t stay married. I mean, he lived with it before. And at least you would be an honest slut.
