&gt; By all accounts, they're still happy together.

... so far. The old saw is true that "if they cheat *with* you they'll cheat *on* you". Or an classier, older version of the same sentiment: "when a man marries his mistress he creates a vacancy".

&gt; But I still want to know why he chose her over me.

Consider the possibility that she's just more gullible than you.

You spotted his sketchy behaviour, and called him out on it, even if you did it in a caring, supportive way.

She's so naive and ignorant that *even knowing* he cheated on you with her, she still thinks she can trust him, and is building her entire life around him (quit her job, left her family and friends, moved to a different country with no support network, etc).

As soon as he gets bored of her and goes looking for a bit of foreign strange, she'll be in the same boat as you, but ten times more fucked because she was dumb enough to put herself in a fast worse position even knowing what a lying cheater he was.
