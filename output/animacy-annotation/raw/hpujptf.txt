I see you're trying to help, so I apologize again for being ignorant and stupid.But I still don't follow. 

Defeat the first 3 bosses for the Wounds. -&gt; Go find Perpetva's tomb before fighting Esdras. -&gt; DEFEAT ESDRAS.

...again. Am I missing some key information, here? Like...you DON'T fight Esdras if you find Perpetva's tomb, maybe? Does the fight get replaced by a conversation or something? Cause I suppose that would explain it, but so far nobody has mentioned it to me.
