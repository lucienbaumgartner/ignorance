This is so true and I say this all the time. I’m younger than you but I’ve done some work with the public and working with the public makes you realize how ignorant the average person is. I’m not saying I’m wise or smarter than thou by any means but my point is that common sense is truly not common for many people. I think if people possessed the ability to critically think better, we’d be in a much better place as a society.

&gt; An overwhelming number of people are just so disconnected and unaware of their surroundings

I live in a big city and I see this all the time. People completely oblivious and making themselves a target.
