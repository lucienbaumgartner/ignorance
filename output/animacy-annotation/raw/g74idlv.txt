I still to this day don't understand what Kelley did wrong? She's privileged and rich and unaware of the world, and dated Peter suspiciously soon after all the Hannah Ann and Madi stuff, but who cares? I could say the same about lots of BN people, like Lauren Luyendyk?

Hannah Ann was doing just fine after the season and Madi was busy thirsting for Lori K and Selena Gomez, so let's not pretend they were heartbroken!
