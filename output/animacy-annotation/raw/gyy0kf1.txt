Yeah, I definitely think it sent that message to many Danish people. I checked out some Danish comments under the non-qualifying news on Facebook, and most of them were blaming it on the Danish language. Lots of people were mad that Fyr og Flamme were so adamant to sing in Danish, and pretty much concluded that "it ruined our chances, we should only send songs in English from now on".

I also heard this opinion a lot in Norway when Tix won with the English version of the song. I mentioned to my family, friends and colleagues (all non-Eurovision fans) that I wished he had kept it in Norwegian, and *every single one* responded that "No, then we would have no chance! The song is a lot better in English." I think most Scandinavians recognize (and over-criticize) cringy lyrics in our native language, but are more forgiving and ignorant of bad lyrics in English.
