You're right, I'm not teaching a 4th-grade class on morality, I'm apparently teaching to adults who understand potentially less than those 4th-graders.

That's the problem.

If you have an issue with what I said for some kind of reason other than "you're pretentious" or "but I like flirting with xenophobia" then say it. Explain which part of what I said was wrong. Show me the value of standing at the edge of the cliff. Demonstrate to me the virtue of your position. Convince me that there is *anything* useful to be gained from being so stubborn and ignorant that you're unwilling to just call it something else.

If you are somehow offended by the *idea of trying not to offend people* then you're hopelessly lost, and I hope time never forgets you and others like you.
