There are 3 basic damage types: Blunt, Slash, and Pierce. Skeletons, for example, are resistant to pierce but vulnerable to blunt. Looking at a weapon's stats will show you what damage type(s) it does. There are a few more types like fire and spirit, but they tend to have more specialised purposes.

The right mouse button has three damage mitigation functions. Blocking, where you reduce incoming damage by some amount based on your equipped weapon and shield. Dodge rolling, where you get a moment of damage invulnerability in exchange for some stamina. And parrying, which is a semi-hidden mechanic. Parrying can't be done with tower shields, but all weapons and round shields can do it. If you start a block at the moment an attack is about to hit, you will parry the attack. The damage reduction for parries is higher than the block damage reduction and the enemy will be staggered for a few moments.

When you hit an enemy it has a chance to stagger them. The more damage a strike does relative to their health and the higher your weapon's knockback seem to increase this chance. Enemies are also always staggered when you parry their attacks, including ranged attacks. Attacking a staggered enemy will do significantly more damage, indicated by yellow damage numbers and a sound of clashing metal.

Finally, attacking an unaware enemy does bonus damage. This is listed on the weapon's stat-block as "Backstab multiplier" and is highest for bows and knives. Enemy awareness has 3 states: Unaware, searching which is noted by a yellow icon over the enemy, and aware which is noted by a red exclamation mark. Unaware and searching are both considered unaware for the purpose of applying backstab bonus.
