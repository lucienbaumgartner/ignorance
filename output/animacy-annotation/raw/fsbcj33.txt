When Trump got elected a cousin of mine figured out that we could get citizenship to an EU country through our ancestry. It took two years to get it done, but now me and my family can get the fuck out of here if he is reelected, and live and work in the EU. I'm learning the language, culture and the metric system. I'm not hanging around to witness, powerless, the death of my country.

It is so deeply saddening, and utterly infuriating, that tens of millions of us are so stupid and ignorant that the powerful few can weaponize their ignorance and stupidity to fuck over the rest of us so thoroughly. 

Fuck the GOP, fuck Pat Toomey, fuck Kavanaugh, Barr, McConnell, Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich, Rush, Hannity, DeSantis, Kevin McCarthy, Roger Stone, Assange, Trump, his kids, Kushner, Susan Collins, Flake, The Bushes, Reagan, the NRA, Sessions, Rosenstein, DeVos, Mnuchin, Jordan, Walker, Brian Kemp, the Kochs, Ailes, Murdoch, Bannon, holy shit I can think of another thirty names off the top of my head without trying - people who have FUCKED this country, cheered on by brainwashed morons. Not to mention Putin. 

These are evil people. This is like two steps down from max evil - these people would have been the leaders of the Nazi party if this was 30's Germany, no fucking doubt. The only reason they are holding back from 'cleansing' us is that black and brown people buy shit too, and they like the color green just a bit more than the color white. This is good vs. evil. 

I will not be here if Trump wins again, I will not subject my family to being a part of the Republican experiment of sociopathic  corruption, max greed, and complete disregard for the law and the people of the nation. Fuck that.
