Imagine being so hateful and ignorant that you cant respect someone for their political stance. Behold the tollerant Left. 

Im not even ftom the south dude. I just hate how people like you have normalized calling people "Nazis". Its not right. At all. 

Its amazing that your side constantly says they're progressive and accepting yet here you are bashing me just because I like Trump. 

He's literally one of the best president's we've had in an economic sense, plus with that horseshit Impeachment trial he had, it exposed the Democratic Party for what they were: Crooks.
