The whole concept is stupid. What made the original Witches creepy was that you couldn't really tell who was a witch or not. You'd see an old creepy lady at the park? She could be a witch! Now? Does she have giant visible scars on her cheeks? No? Then everything's cool.

I'm curious to see how the film handles this. Are all the characters going to be painfully dumb and unaware of the scars on their cheeks while the audience can see them clear as day? Or will it be obvious to everyone that they are witches? Like its a world where witches are real and everyone knows about them. Either way, very odd creative choice.
