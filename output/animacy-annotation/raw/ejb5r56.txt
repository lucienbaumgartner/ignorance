I'm not convinced either. How have so many people surrounding him been indicted for campaign related crimes, but he somehow is clean? I refuse to believe that somehow, out of all of those people doing shady shit, he was completely unaware and uninvolved. This very well could mean four more years of a sociopath with budding dementia in office and that's kind of scary.
