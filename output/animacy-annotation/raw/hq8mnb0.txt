Nope. Thatâ€™s never what pua was intended for.  Does anyone actually take five minutes to use their internet to look up this basic information? Regular unemployment requires taxes and previous work history. PUA was for everyone else badly affected who were entering the work force at the time of the lockdown. Very ignorant and privileged to assume only those working in 2019 were entitled to government assistance when they shut down the entire country. Every single store, office, etc was closed. Schools and day cares as wellâ€¦.meaning those who were looking for work when the pandemic started, had to stay home with kids. I had to homeschool and had to survive on PUA because daycares and the companies that offered me work CLOSED.  TurboTax wouldnâ€™t even let me proceed with only $150 in cash. thereâ€™s a minimum for filing. I never worked in 2019 as I was a stay at home mom with two kids and a dependent on someone else taxes. EDD asked for proof of me searching for work from sept 2019-March 2020 WHICH I DID. I had two job offers,
Do send of interviews and a week of unpaid job training as well as a career training I paid $2k for in 2019. 2020 taxes, even if I was able to file for a measles $150, wouldnâ€™t have been sufficient anyway. ðŸ˜‘
