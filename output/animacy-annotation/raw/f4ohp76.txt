Oh yes, that was a shocking moment for me. I couldn't believe it when she said that.

Bill Clinton was my president while I was growing up and I remember the Republican outrage against universal health care proposals Hillary especially wanted to pass. Hillary was the original medicare for all proponent. When universal health care wasn't going to pass as a bill, Hillary and Bill worked with some Republican lawmakers to formulate the children's health care insurance plan. It was attractive to the Republicans at that time because it concerned *kids health* and they still had a soft spot for that. Passing CHIP was a great thing to do and indeed Sanders voted against it because he felt at the 11th hour that it didn't go far enough. So basically doing some good wasn't good to him because it wasn't perfect. As AOC said yesterday....as a kid she depended on CHIP. That thing that *Hillary* helped get passed and that Sanders voted against. All the accolades she was trying to associate with Sanders were actually unjust. In reality they are accolades for Hillary's passion for universal healthcare turning into pragmatism when there was no way a Republican Senate would pass it. Instead of throwing up her arms, she went and got something done. Like Obama has said, "better IS good". Sometimes baby steps are what's needed for a better world. 

Hillary is the president that we all need, but sadly don't deserve. 

This is to say that I found it disrespectful and ignorant that AOC talked about CHIP and then Sanders...with her trying to connect him to that important bill in the 90s.
