Haha I am the same I can be so clumsy and unaware and unobservant lol. Yeah, I think we definitely all have guides as well as angels and spirit guides, and ancestors looking over us and loved ones in spirit. Ive had experiences with all the different ETâ€™s but mostly Sirian, and the few experiences I had with tall grays were amazing, like the ones I saw were so unconditionally loving I could feel it all around me, I got such a good feeling and they helped to heal me and balance my energies or something
