Over the last 10 years I've regularly taken trips to part of the US/Canada that are frequented by Chinese tourists. 

I can say that 10 year ago, it was mostly older people who could be really rude and unaware that what they are doing isn't okay. Would routinely push people out of the way, not respect queues/lines, yell at the top of their lungs, etc. 

At first I thought they were just really rude, then I realized that a lot of first time, middle-aged, American tourists do the same thing (while wearing white tennis shoes) 

As time has gone by, I've noticed a shift towards younger and much more aware Chinese tourists. They've obviously grew up with some money and are used to some cultural norms of politeness, both at home and abroad. 

So, yes, there's a cultural aspect going on, but there's definitely an aspect of "first time middle aged tourists" that spans the globe I think
