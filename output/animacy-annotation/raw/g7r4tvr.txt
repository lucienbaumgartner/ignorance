Whats even more amazing is not Trump being an ass. 

All presidents can act stupid but...it’s never done with the intention of it being a political move. A moment caught on camera “backstage” like Bush’s middle finger. Or a gaffe, a hot mic, inappropriate joke, etc. 

Trump, acted like a total ass, deliberately, a total an utter ass at the podium, in front a large crowd, and before national television. 

How fucking unprofessional, mentally unstable, and unaware of yourself do you have to be, to do exactly what he did?

He looked...like a total ass. ...before the world. 

__AND__, and what kind of person do you have to be vote for him after such a display?

I think...his cult of supporters is so enamored with him, that he feels no need to be self conscious of what he says or does. He’s at total and utter ease with them as to express himself in anyway he likes. 

He could literally assault someone and they’d only like him more for it. 

Jesus, what the hell has America come to?
