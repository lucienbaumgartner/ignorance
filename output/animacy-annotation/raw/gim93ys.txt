So the dozens of videos from various cities around the country showing law enforcement shooting pepper balls and rubber bullets indiscriminately at reporters and protesters are dismissed because of your subjective personal experience in one area of one city? 

You brought up Seattle then connected to Olympia and I feel like that’s a straw man because I never said what you’re accusing me of being short sighted and ignorant of. The violence in Seattle was initiated because of a standoff between protesters and law enforcement and started in mid 2020. The violence in Olympia was initiated because of two opposing groups of protesters, Trump supporters and ANTIFA, and happened in late 2020 around election time. Maybe I have my time frames wrong but I don’t see those two things make your point. 


Every one looks back at the Civil Rights movement with rosy tented glasses but seem to forget that there were dozens or riots during that decade. There were over 100 riots after the death of MLK. So context really matters. 

Damage- what’s more destructive? Burning a city block or destroying the Democratic institutions of this country in favor of embracing authoritarianism. Again context matters. 
One group is literally pushing back against authoritarianism. Even Right wing conservative Amon Bundy agrees that Him and BLM are fighting the same fight. 
While the other group is actively fighting FOR authoritarianism, wanting to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator. Yes sir context is important.
