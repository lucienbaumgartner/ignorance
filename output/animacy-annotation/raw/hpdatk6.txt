To make a proper decision on the current course of action you need to take into consideration what got the democratic party where it is today.

Polling on issues indicates a ton of popularity for progressive ideas across the country, beyond democratic and republican lines. Florida voted for Trump, but also voted for a 15$ an hour minimum wage. Oregon decriminalized the possession of small amounts of ALL drugs, an issue that I think you could say neither party supports at all...

The Democrats have been claiming to be the good guys for a long time, but in truth they're not. They're the bad guys, willfully ignoring the demands of their citizens. And don't tell me the Republicans are worse, we all know that, and it's sadly irrelevant. It's a case of the pot calling the kettle black.

Now, the democrats are likely going to lose big in the midterms and after that they'll lose the presidency. So how is your supported strategy working out? It's not working. The narrow win Biden got should actually be telling you the democrats must make MASSIVE changes to how they do business, not that they should double down on their current strategy. I can't even begin to tell you how ignorant and blind that train of thought it... It's incredible really, that anyone would think that continuing on in the present course could ever lead to anything more than the slim hope of an election win (which would be followed with more corporate democrats and mainstream media talking about how they should stay the course).

The people of America will respond positively to truth, or in Trump's case the appearance of truth (buoyed by the fact that Trump was from the beginning reviled by both parties). Staying the current course is going to lead to a meltdown, and every election where extreme action is not taken, it becomes even more difficult to change the direction.

Wake up.
