In fact, people say “oh my god” all the time religious or not. You must not get out and talk to people in real life much huh? Not surprising if you communicate the same way IRL as you do anonymously in Reddit threads😂 no offense but you come across as extremely ignorant and unintelligent. Hope that’s not how you are irl
