Uh babe noo... preference is one thing but white supremacy is real. Guys "put black girls at the bottom of preferences" because white supremacy, period. Idk where you live that it's normalized but I'm guessing it's some red state shit. There is nothing less gorgeous about black women when you subtract white supremacy. Im also concerned about the racist POS guys you're hanging out w who are so unashamed and unaware  of what trash they are that they describe it openly to your face without embarrasment
