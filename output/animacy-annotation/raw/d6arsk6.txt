Marijuana gets you high, it's quite a step ahead of potato chips. It's addictive that's just the truth and saying otherwise is quite harmful for those who are unaware and prone to habit forming. It is also a disservice to those who are struggling with marijuana addictions. Like this isn't my opinion this is a fact. Someone already pointed out that it's in the DSM V. Weed addiction and withdrawal has been observed many times. You can read many accounts from people here on reddit. This isn't up for debate, you are simply choosing to ignore the facts.
