The evidence that having had Covid gives you just as strong of a protection against covid. Both vaxed or those who have had Covid have about a 1 percent chance of infection. You will ignore that fact though as it doesn’t fit with your beliefs. 

Good luck being intellectually dishonest and ignorant of any other possibilities in life except what you believe.
