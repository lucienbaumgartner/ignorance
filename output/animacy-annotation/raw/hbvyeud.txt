I’m pointing out that the “life support” hypothetical makes absolutely no sense in the whole abortion argument because it negates the fact that unlike those who are in a coma or are in brain-dead states, a fetus is certain to come off of “life support” within nine months. 

If a doctor *knew* for a fact that a patient was going to wake up in nine months of time, and it is proven to be true, then the prospect of taking said patient off life support is completely negated. This hypothetical is ridiculous, and ignorant of what makes aborting a fetus so controversial; Is that you’re ending a life that is assured to come to fruition. Without outside interference, that fetus *will* develop and form into a human being. Killing it now, or killing it at 8 months in will result in the same *exact* outcome; One less life that was already in the process of beginning. You are, in effect, killing an individual.

The *time* at which a fetus is aborted is up in the air for me. That is a portion of this debate that I am still on the fence about. But I’d rather it go to one extreme than the other, despite me not agreeing with how Texas is doing this.
