That was so inaccurate it’s laughable. You might as well have said “You Americans are getting dominated by China because their magical unicorn army will grant them good fortune in the coming year!” So preposterous and ignorant that it’s not even worth replying to. It’s like saying buying something worth $100 from a homeless dude for a penny is going to elevate that homeless dude to king of the world. 

That’s not even taking into account how Mao caused an entire generation of Chinese to become completely broken, helpless, and ignorant or how the Chinese child policy caused and is still causing massive problems for them. 

I’m more worried about aliens coming down and trying to scam people by claiming they are Nigerian princes than I am of China ever being a threat. 

And the trade war is still ongoing, what are you talking about?

Also as for your slaves not being paid part, slaves cost money to buy, and its about the same price to hire Chinese to work for you as it was to buy, clothes, feed, and house a slave for its whole life. Chinese people are just slaves that are too dumb to know it.
