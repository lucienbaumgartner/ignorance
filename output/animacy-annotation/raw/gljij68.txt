Not to be all Fran Lebowitz "pretend it's a city!", but neighbors please:  "Slow Streets" doesn't equal "one can safely be totally oblivious and ignorant of their surroundings".  Have fun out there and enjoy it!  But don't (and don't let your kids) step/bike into traffic (bikes, runners, peds) without looking first; cut across all of Lake St from the far right to the far left at a 90ยบ angle cutting off all traffic in both directions without looking.  Stuff like that.  A pity to see an ambulance on Lake St. during Slow Streets.

And don't jaywalk the red light at 25th/Lake! :)

Have fun, be safe, let's look out for each other.
