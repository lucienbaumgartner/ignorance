I automatically think is internet atheist which I find 99.8 percent ignorant and stupid—and I wish most of them were actually dumb which may be an ironic cure. I think of teenagers that overestimate their intelligence along their education level which is given more credit because it helped them to reach atheism. Rarely have I ever met an internet atheist who has the mental power to study or even know how to study.  Most don’t read anything outside of whatever material they’ve been given within the school system and gives them a grade. Most aren’t that studied on the sciences or history just like your average person. Atheist tend to be the most uninformed because they mistake agreeing with people smarter than them as being informed. 

Though most of the atheist in my real-life circles tend to be very intelligent, introspective, and retrospective. Some of the perspectives they give you will rarely find on the internet anI can have great discussions with them for hours and build. There was a book I read that summed up my view of atheist - and this atheistic society - very succinctly. 

&gt;Cram them full of non-combustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely `brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide-rule, measure, and equate the universe, which just won't be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely. I know, I've tried it; to hell with it.—Fahrenheit 451, pg 58

My only contention being where the melancholy lies. If you know you know.
