I just feel that we are far too ashamed of the bad, but shamelessly partake in the good when we are around family. 

I have had several examples over the past few years where the desis will easily be proud on the wins (older folks acting all knowing about Indian food, Bollywood dance steps, yoga, Indian ceos, spelling bee championship wins) and all ignorant and American when get asked about caste system, women problems, inherent poverty etc.
Somehow, the first generation desi movers here do a very good job of shielding their kids from the downsides and yet wanting their kids to be more “desi”.
