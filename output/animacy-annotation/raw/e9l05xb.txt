Why is the dad on TV making bullshit accusations like this when he is one of the few people who can actually verify whether or not this was a legit registration (of course it was, but hey)?

Fuck this conspiracy theory horse shit, honestly. And fuck this guy. The truth matters.

I don't have any sympathy for this guy or any of his family if they are so dumb and ignorant that they can't accept the reality of what happened, and who their son is.
