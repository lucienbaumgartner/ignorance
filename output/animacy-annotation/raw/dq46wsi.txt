&gt;As for Monokuma, he either didn't know what Tsumugi did until Shuichi found out in the final case

Dude, Tsumugi used Motherkuma and the Nanokubs to cheat. Of course Monokuma knew.

&gt;or he is under such a tight contract by TDR that he has to cooperate with "Junko Enoshima" or he just didn't want to lose his job so he fabricated Rantaro's death to keep the killing game going.

He's just an AI created to replicate Junko Enoshima's Monokuma personality and keep the game entertaining. I doubt he was forced to do anything, it's far more likely that he didn't really care about the rules and that the course of action he took was the one that would lead to the most entertainment.

&gt;Yes exactly. Amami's video and his presence in the prologue contradics Shuichi's audition video.
 Amami knows his own name in the prologue and it's the same as during the killing game, and why would he strip himself of his own memory of Danganronpa 52, change his clothing, abandon his talent and remain completely unaware and calm when he supposedly ended up in another killing game in perhaps the same location.

Shuichi in the prologue gave his own name as well. I do believe the audition tapes could have been faked, however I don't see what Rantaro's presence in prologue proves that beyond the fact that he was familiar with the situation.

It's possible that the kubs fucked it up and gave the group wrong memories before putting them into the locker too.
