His normal meter is probably broken. A person can go their whole lives without realizing that about themselves.

Don’t suppress your feelings about either him or her. And don’t ignore your inner voice. You are not wrong or crazy. You are feeling justifiably nervous about having to deal with both of them for the rest of your life, and wondering if the situation will ever improve. If he is so immature and ignorant that he would ignore professional psychological opinions, I’d say chance of improvement is less than 5%. And if he does see the light some day, oh how painful it will be. 

I wonder what he expects in a marriage and a partner? Would he model your relationship on the one shown to him by his parents? Is his father still around? What is he like? How does his mother act with his father? 

Honestly. You aren’t married or living together. This is the best behaviour you can ever expect. It’s all downhill once you don’t have the ability to make decisions without having to consider a spouse. I know that’s harsh, and I’m sorry for that.
