Alright. I asked because

&gt;In the past I have attached quickly and then found out things that I don't like, and continued pushing through anyway in spite of it. Even getting into relationships. Then later I worry because we're not aligned meanwhile they're happy and unaware that something is bothering me even when I express it.

&gt;But I've grown a lot since then and concluded that it's better to just be upfront about the things that are important to me rather than just read between the lines all the time whilst people pleasing.

This is an issue of boundries and I'm glad to hear that you've worked on it. Stating your needs and/or what bothers you is good! 

But there is a difference between being upfront and going too fast. Asking someone 1. why they're dating (are they looking for something casual or long term?) and saying you're looking for a more long term relationship is different than 2. stating WHAT you'd like long term. Even assuming she's not dating casually, you don't even know if she likes you like that yet! And that is a conversation you have to wait to have until you've gotten a good rythmn down, and know you both like each other. And definitely should have sober. 

I mean that advice in general. My suggestion about not taking things for granted applies to that (not assuming what people want from their future, or that they'd be in your future at all). When we take things for granted we rush to do what we want/think instead of remembering to ask for and consider other people's needs  

With this specific person, yeah I'd say to leave her alone unless she changes her mind ðŸ˜… but good luck next time!
