&gt;It's an objective fact that religion is a human invention

saying its an objective fact does not make it objective fact  
i can say about any nonsense that its objective fact that does not make it  


*&gt; "explain the unknown through spitritual explanations"*   
and who said all religions are explaining the existing of God through spiritual explanations  
that's only prove how ignorant and uneducated you are  
have you read the book "Return of the God Hypothesis " #1 Best Seller , written by stephen.c.meyer who presented the claim with evidence-based scientific theory

*&gt; and you saying "exert control over people"*   
that's your conspiracies phobia , you still didn't present any evidence
