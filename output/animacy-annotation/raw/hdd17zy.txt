Its definitely is wrong and isn’t how it should work, but unfortunately it is. It’s not just a white thing either, it’s in everyone. The “good” people of every group is seen as responsible and accountable for the “bad” people of the group. 

For example: In the anti-racism movement of the last few years it’s dictated that the non-racist whites hold a responsibility for the racist whites, which is true. But saying that these group dynamic exists in one situation but not in another is a bit hypocritical and ignorant of reality.

In my opinion, the only thing that gets past this is frequent and deep interaction between groups. When a group (whites) don’t have frequent and deep interaction with another group (blacks), they don’t have the knowledge/experience to differentiate between the “good” and “bad” of the other group, so they resort to seeing the other group as being represented by the “bad” because it gets the most attention. Once groups start interacting with each other on more than just a surface level they start seeing and being able to make the distinction between the differences of individuals of the other group. This isn’t just a white  people and black people or white people and &lt;insert POC group&gt; either, it’s a truth of all groups interacting with each other. It’s just more important to break this group dynamic with white people because of the societal power dynamic in the west. 

It’s fucking stupid that this how it works, and it shouldn’t work that way. Unfortunately though it’s the framework we have to work in until find someway to get humans to handle group dynamics another way.
