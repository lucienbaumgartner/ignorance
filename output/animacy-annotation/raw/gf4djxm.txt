The thing about having a seizure is that there's often a moment or two when you're pretty sure  it's about to happen.  The world may start to spin out of focus, or you say see lights or have other odd sensations.  If you've never had a seizure before, in the the time it takes you to wonder WTF is happening, you're basically done and hopefully when you wake up you haven't hurt yourself.  After you've had a couple and know what to expect, at least you have some time to "prepare" yourself, which in my case just meant wishing really hard that I wasn't about to have another seizure.  Also, sometimes right after the seizure, especially a not great one, you may be semi-conscious and unaware of your surroundings.  I apparently fought tooth and nail with the paramedics who took me to the hospital after my first seizure which happened at a park, so I woke up in restraints in the ER not knowing what in the fuck was happening.  So...I guess I just wish that people wouldn't send content intended to induce seizures in other people.  That's a real shitty thing.
