People always question how a Nazi can go from a normal citizen to raiding, raping, murdering, burning and gassing people. This is how. This is the early steps of that. People grab onto something and become so diluted and ignorant that they believe everything they are told. Think how many trump supporters react to racism right now. Imagine in 2 years Trump in a second term (showing his loyal fans he is won a rigged election and is divine in his rule) starts a campaign that blacks are ruining america and that the riots and destruction and further spread of covid is because of them. Then footage is released of black people fighting whites and is shown as why they are hostile and primitive and need to be "dealt with justly and powerfully." I'm not saying it will happen or I want it to happen, but this is exactly how unjust rulers become dictators and create unjust wars that we see as so primitive today. "This is how democracy dies... with thunderous applause."
