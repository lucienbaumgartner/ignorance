I don't think I've ever met someone else who had that happen. My scenario is a bit different though. 

I was 20, I was dating this girl casually (we had sex a handful of times but we weren't serious) and we took a night trip up to Niagara Falls,  CA where I could drink legally (she was 26 at the time).   Idk how drunk she was but I was black out.  Last thing I remember is a snapshot of getting back to the hotel room and falling on the bed with all my clothes on. 

I woke up butt naked in the morning and I asked her what happened and she was so proud of what she did she actually took pictures and showed me.  There I was,  completely unconsious with her riding me and what not.   At first I was pissed but then i figured I probably... nay... Definitely, would have slept with her if I wasn't so drunk anyway so I just shrugged it off and moved on.   

I still think it's pretty weird though and occasionally I reflect on that experience and feel a bit uneasy.  Not that I feel like I was raped necessarily,  but just the idea that someone did what they wanted with me while I was 100% unaware and unable to do anything about it.  Strange...
