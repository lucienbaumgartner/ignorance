"Hey, man... This has been bugging me and I want to clear the air. The other day you accused me of being selfish and unaware of others when I didn't put a taco on the grill for you. But then you turned around and ate all the cooked food and I had to figure out something else to eat. It seems kind of hypocritical. Can we talk about that?"
