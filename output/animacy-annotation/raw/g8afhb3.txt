The thing is, with just about anyone else in charge of the show I'd have figured it's a doe deal - I mean that the whole family thing between those three isn't going to be part of the show. But Hissirch and her team have proven so arrogant and unaware of what their product comes across like, I think it's entirely possible they believe they can pull it off just fine despite all the logic to the contrary.
