I saw a clip of the main prosecutor use the fact he plays call of duty to make him look bad. He is so stupid and ignorant that he hasnt known this has been debunked so many times for a little over half a decade if not more at this point. Oh and didnt bother to do research to boot. Kyle a 17 year old made this "man" look like a complete fool. Because unlike him kyle can distinguish reality from fiction like a sane human being. when i saw that clip i thought i had a aneurysm because of how surprised i was. The amount of stupidity is just astonishing. truly a spectacular display of retardation. if kyle doesnt come out of this innocent im moving to mars with elon.
