This maybe not ease your concerns, but for this case all dogs should be considered dangerous, as they all are animals and have teeth. Rottweilers are protective but also gentle giants. Can I guarantee nothing will happen if one of the kids pulls a dogs ears? No, no one can. However, if you are scared of everything (for them), your kids will grow up very sheltered and unaware of risks or unable to learn and thrive. Just my two cents.
