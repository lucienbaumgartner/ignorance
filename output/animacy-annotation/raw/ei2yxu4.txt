Why are we not taught about the Empire in school?. I mean we learn next to nothing. Outside of the Alantic slave trade, the British Empire is simply taught in schools. Most Brits remain completely unaware and quite ignorant of this period.


Some 400+ years of history that's left a huge legacy and still effects the world around us today, its the reason the world is the way it is etc... Yet its for the most part its literally ignored and swept under the rug. We dont learn or get taught anything about it. And i have to ask why??, Why is that?, Its clearly intentional...
