This one time a friend, his parents and I, went to the beach.  On the way back, his mum handed us a chocolate bar each.  I opened the wrapper, and my friend’s dog, Foy, decided to pester me for a piece, by poking his nose through the dog guard.  Being 6 years old, and unaware that chocolate is toxic to dogs, I gave Foy a single piece and went back to munching on the bar.
About 15 minutes later, I smelt one of the worst things I have ever smelt: a strong, pungent smell of diarrhea.  Even worse, the boot (‘trunk’ for those of you from the U.S.) had a fresh coat of brown dog-paint.  The funniest part was watching my friends mum cleaning up the dog diarrhea with really, REALLY cheap picnic napkins (which kept bursting, resulting in her hands contacting with the poo).  After receiving a scolding, we got back to their house where my mum was waiting to pick me up, and take me home.  

I sat in the car as my mum, and my friends mum spoke, nodded and made very animated body motions.  I was never a bad kid, but I knew that if I was in trouble, I was really for it.  My mum returned to the car, and without saying anything, started the car and drove off.  You could cut the tension with a knife.  
Suddenly, she stopped the car, pulled in and continued to stare forward.  
I’ve never seen my mother laugh as hard as she did just then.  I was expecting to get into a huge amount of trouble, but it never happened.

TL;DR: Gave my friend’s dog diarrhoea while in the car, on a trip, expecting hell from mother when I got back, she found it hilarious.
