This is my biggest fear. I’ve toned it down a lot and let a lot of cars just pass by me or be the dicks they are without getting confrontational anymore. There’s times even when they do a move where they’re at fault but still perceive I cut them off. When getting triggered and rolling up to me I pretend I’m just dumb and unaware and didn’t realize what happened because I don’t want to mess with a crazy fucker who’s willing to shoot me up because they’re in a bad mood. Shits whack AF.
