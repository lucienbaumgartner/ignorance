you're sure talking like you support one team over another. And something that seems to be a common thread with folks like yourself... you're sitting here spewing bullshit and then get called on it and claim no side. 

maybe when you grow up, get some time under your belt, you wont be led to believe such insane bullshit.

I'll leave it with this... if the left has it so correct, name a major city or state they have had majority control over where the policies they talk so highly of have worked?

18 of the top 20 most violent cities in this country have been and still are democrat run, Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Mephis, Oakland, New Orleans, Chicago... Etc

How about a state that's been implementing all these awesome policies, California... Taxes out of control, crime out of control, infrastructure a fuxing mess, people are leaving the state in droves to get away from it...

ya know why old folks are usually Republican? because you can only listen to the left bullshit the young, nieve, ignorant and inexperienced for so long.

Dont worry, when you grow up, you'll get there too.
