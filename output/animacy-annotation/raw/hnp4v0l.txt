Out of all of our squad, Divock Origi is the one man who truly amazes me. He seems to be unphased about his surroundings and always plays like he's still in the schoolyard, completely carefree and unaware of the present. His social media feed is legitimately therapeutic, he is just out there always vibin. Yet somehow, he manages to break club records, getting match winners at the dying moments of any given match, assuring Champions League trophies, and sometimes I wonder if he's even aware of how much he's done for this football club.
