Peace be upon you (Islam greeting)!

Your teacher is incredibly ignorant and hateful, because Islam is not at all as she described.

The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “You will not enter Paradise until you have faith and you will not have faith until you love each other. Shall I show you something that, if you did, you would love each other? Spread peace between yourselves.”

Quran God mentioned that: “He who kills a soul unless it be (in legal punishment) for murder or for causing disorder and corruption on the earth will be as if he had killed all humankind, and he who saves a life will be as if he had saved the lives of all humankind.” (Quran 5:32)
