Here’s a list of jokes at men’s’ expense. Nobody cares that they exist or are said. Make yourself feel better. 

This is a joke... an obvious joke, so obviously untrue and ignorant that it is funny. But explaining humor to virtue signaling redditor is like explaining space travel to a goldfish. 

If you go through life being so easily offended and demanding censorship on anything that offends you in the slightest... good luck in life. Maybe don’t read jokes until you lower your neuroticism and develop your sense of humor. Then you can scroll past this type of joke without calling anyone who didn’t downvote the joke a sexist.
