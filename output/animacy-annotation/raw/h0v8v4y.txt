Raised Catholic. My parents, bless their hearts, were very devout but not very knowledgeable. Inevitably I became, as my mother comically put it, a “Roaming” Catholic instead of a Roman Catholic. I fell into the overtly prideful new atheist trap. Had a harrowing purgation that subdued my pride enough for me to look past my self. Was still ashamed and ignorant of Catholicism so I studied Theravada Buddhism for about 4 years, then Zen for about a year and a half, then various esoteric occult practices. Finally, after reading lots of books, I realized it was Catholicism that I was searching for this whole time. It’s like that story from GK Chesterton about the explorer who set sail to find new and unique distant lands only to accidentally arrive back on the shores of his homeland without even realizing it.
