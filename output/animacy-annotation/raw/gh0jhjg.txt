my husband, who has been acting strange lately, (erratic sleep schedule, doing lots of organizing, obsessively washing the dishes), rushed through present opening with the kids so he could "go back to sleep." 

when I went back into the bedroom he wasn't in bed, he was in the bathroom. He slammed something shut and came out of the bathroom quickly. I asked what he was doing and he started yelling about how I'm "always getting into his business." long story short, he's been using cocaine for two weeks and gaslighting me when I question his behavior or ask if he's on drugs. he is a recovering addict and had mental health problems. it's a hot mess and I'm really just trying to make it through today to keep me kids happy and unaware of what's really going on. Merry fucking Christmas, y'all.
