Pretty much any time they own up to not knowing enough about any given topic to make a counterpoint. Can't stand the type of idiot that fabricates information and claims proof in the form of facts they just made up to back up their absurd statement. 

There is a fine line between dumb and unaware and dumb but smart enough to know it.

To add to this, the same thing plagues smart people. Since they are brought up being told they are smart,  they think their conclusion has more weight than other people's and thus they are harder to convince if they are actually wrong because they're overconfident, just like their idiot counterparts.

True wisdom is measured by knowledge, cognitive thought process and a willingness to accept new information sustained by proven facts/ideas even if it goes against what they thought they knew.
