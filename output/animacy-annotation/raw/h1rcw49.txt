**Gang name:** "Ol'timers" or "Oldies".

**Description**: Ol'timers is somewhat an elusive gang consisting primarily of ex (and presently employed) military and law enforcement veterans (whatever the "law" is represented by) of all races and all nationalities. Gang is providing protection and specializes in controlling "clean" medical and recreational businesses with extensive illegal backstage operation (unlicensed rigger docks, organ trafficking, unlicensed drug production etc) . It is possible that it can be tied to other bigger criminal organizations such as Yakuza or cartels, but then it is not clear if it is tied by business or simply has members infiltrated those entities.

**Recruitment:** There are always not enough money in your retirement fund, post-deployment consequences not covered by your medical, or  something you said somewhere what prevents you moving higher than a lieutenant.  What if I tell you that there is an organization which will help you acquire financial stability and support of people who understand you like no others? You probably don't even need to quit your current job. Call this number and you will get the feeling of your military brotherhood back. Just like back in the jungle when everything was easy and you knew where to shoot and who to trust. 

The only real requirement to become an Ol'timer is law enforcement or military experience (more the better) and passing the unofficial background check by gang's "intelligence department" (none likes snitches or people who pretend they are a vets). 

"Benefit package" include medical treatment and implants for those needing them (at gang's illegal clinics), monthly monetary wage for every member, field operation bonuses, and support during incarceration. You may think that you are working for a small corporation. Just without rating and employees list. 

**Gang symbols:** An unusual (for a street gang) thing about Ol'timers is that they are trying to fly under the radar as much as possible and blend into the crowd in order to make their competitors paranoid and unaware of possible danger (or absence of such). Members of the gang most times wear plain clothes with weaponry and armor hidden underneath. 

There is one thing which Ol'timers use to identify their presence: lollipops (the ones you can find at doctor's office). Whenever they execute a successful hit or dispose a trespasser, they leave a single lollipop candy on each corpse. Jars of lollipops at the front desk of a business usually identify that a given establishment is under protection of Ol'timers. It is pretty obvious, that the choice of such "business card" format is not for saying anything about Ol'timers but rather identifying what they think about their competitors. 

**Philosophy:**  Ol'timers are basically an embodiment of unofficial inner "clubs" forming inside of the military and law enforcement organizations. People who look after each other, support each other, don't trust the official command, establish their own unwritten rules and codes of conduct. Only this time those people are organized in a network, have extensive cross-department cooperation and sources of an independent financing. 

**Modus operandi:** There is no base, no central location, no single place for meetups. All gang members are living their normal lives (possibly even working their jobs) to the moment they contacted by previously assigned intelligence officer who will tell them where to go and what to do. If the equipment they  have at their place is not enough, they will be directed to a drop-off container on their way to the target.  What will be the target? Anything. From a new recruit or a business owner asking for protection to a rally point for a raid to competitor's territory. 

Control over the protected business is established via Matrix monitoring and members of the gang residing close to the location (relocating or switching houses with other gang member if necessary).

Deep rooting of Ol'timers in law enforcement provide them significant advantage of extensive knowledge of what, how and when local cops will be doing and how to use it with benefit to the gang. There are quiet a few moles who siphon information to this gang. 

**Organization:** On top of Ol'dies' hierarchy is the "committee of five" or "five heads". Head of the accounting (responsible for monetary resources, paying benefits to gang members and money laundering), head of intelligence (background checks, acquiring information about competing gangs, monitoring protected businesses, counterintelligence activity), head of transportation (providing vehicles for the missions, delivering equipment and resources, making drop-offs), head of research (managing day-to-day operations of illegal facilities and providing medical care for gang members), and head of operations (planning and execution of in-the-field operations).

Then there are field officers and intelligence officers. Field officers are in charge of any face-to-face command during the in-the-field operations, while intelligence officers are in charge of delivering messages and communicating outside of in-the-field operations. Officers in charge are presented to their subordinates beforehand and it is strictly prohibited to follow orders from any other person even if they will call themselves higher ups of the Ol'timers gang.  

**Combat doctrine:** Ol'timers heavily rely on ambush tactics. They will blend with the crowd, use low-key vehicles and camouflage themselves to get maximum surprise effect. Sniping, explosives and drone ambushes are also popular. Open combat is very much not their style. The fact that they don't have a known number of members also means that if the competing gang will decide to attack someone who they consider an undercover Ol'timer, they need to constantly worry about possible attack from the rear or a retaliation which may strike at the worst moment possible. It is simply cheaper not to have any bad blood with Ol'timers, unless you are completely not valuing your people's blood an time.
