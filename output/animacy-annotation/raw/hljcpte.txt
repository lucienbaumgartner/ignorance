". I mean Devastation of Baal is pretty ridiculous. Imagine trying to portray the Tyranids as utterly uncaring and unaware and only interested in survival but then we get "by the way it just really hates the Blood Angels"

This is why I personally head-cannon Devestation of Baal out of existence. Haley is such a bad writer, at least when it comes to this.
