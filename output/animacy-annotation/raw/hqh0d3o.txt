It is the responsibility of the citizen to know the law. It is not merely in their best interest. I am not saying that every citizen should know every possible law - that would be impossible. I am saying that every citizen has a responsibility to know the laws that could potentially affect them. This includes laws about being arrested/detained and your rights (every citizen should know these), laws about gun ownership and use if you are a gun owner, laws about driving if you have a license, etc. Ignorance of the law plays into the hands of those who would deny you your rights as a citizen. 

&gt;*“It is only when the People become ignorant and corrupt, when they degenerate into a populace, that they are incapable of exercising their sovereignty. Let us, by all wise and constitutional measures, promote intelligence among the People, as the best means of preserving our liberties.”* \-James Monroe
