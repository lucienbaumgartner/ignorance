Dany wasn't torturing enemies though. Plus Jaime and Cersei are already aware that she's been liberating cities in Essos and sticking it to the slave masters.

I don't think there was any symbology. His men were on fire and the enemy leader was unaware and preoccupied to notice him so he thought he could kill her and maybe save his people.
