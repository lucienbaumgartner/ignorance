I'm too triggered? What have I done that shows anger or denial? Nothing. Meanwhile you've insulted me and made specious claims with zero evidence to support your opinions.

You're literally claiming you don't need proof for you opinions. Think about that. How absolutely absurdly ridiculous and ignorant that statement is. Then you have no respect for me, simply for disagreeing with you?

I have no respect for you either. And trust me, I won't forget.
