Sure.
The character started out as tiefling pyromancer. I just liked the idea of it being a sentient golem that was created by this mad wizard looking to create an army, it's kind of like warforged only I forgot they existed.
So upon creation she killed him and fled into the night, crazy and unaware of anything and everything.

She knew sign language cause another player as we were making them decided to be mute, I sensing a roleplay opportunity decided to do a shared backstory.
So that player had their character be a bounty Hunter and was sent after mine due to the fact that I was killing all kinds of wizards and needed to be stopped. But upon ambushing me I burnt the vocal cords and realised they were young, so I decided to help them out and continue murdering wizards on the side.

I also made my character a walking Barbie doll, flat and no sexual characteristics nor sexual desire (mainly to avoid erp potential and cause I just wanted to have her grow through experience. Which she did).

She eventually started a town over campaigns and ended up becoming a God after creating a cult and pissing off everything.
So I included her as a potential God for worship along with the others she led to godhood for my new campaign
