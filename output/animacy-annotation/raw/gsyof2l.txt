But why did they do it in the first place? It wasn't for fun, it was to appease/thank some supernatural entity working through the bodies of geese for saving their city. When you don't have a great understanding of how the world works you're going to do some crazy shit. Did people have fun doing it? Probably. Was the fun a necessary component? No. 

Less than 100 years ago 12 million people were murdered in concentration camps, many of those were children who, like your animals, were quite naive and ignorant of the world around them. Your argument seems to be if every party knows and understands the situation which will lead to their demise then it's all right. I understand war, my death as a bystander in a war is less fucked up than some dog tied to a cross because I could understand it? 

When all is said and done, a child dying in a death camp and a dog being crucified are both as fucked up as each other. Some may argue the child dying is worse since we are more evolutionary and socially connected, but to say it's one of the most vile things ever.... yeah no.
