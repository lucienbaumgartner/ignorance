&gt;Not a "filler word".

Not true, it's absolutely a filler word, similar to "like" in The US.

I lived in Taiwan for five years and China for five years and speak fluent Chinese.

&gt;The 'i' is prounced with a long 'ē' sound, as in "tea". The 'e' is prounced as you might hear in "the".

Only in a few places does it sound like that due to their dialect.

In standard Mandarin 那个 is pronounced "nah guh", meaning "that". Sometimes you can say 那一个, pronounced "nah ee guh" but when pronounced it blends into "naeguh"

But it doesn't really matter because, like you said, 

&gt;which can probably upset some American English speakers that are hypersensitive and unaware that other languages exist.
