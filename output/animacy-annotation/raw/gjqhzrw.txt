Is it a coup if they weren't attempting a coup at all? They (meaning the vast majority, not 100%) were just trying to do the same as the protesters in 2018 (harass Senators in their offices) or in 2011 in Wisconsin (occupy the Capitol for an extended period of time in protest). I totally condemn them, but the histrionics are insane and ignorant of the last decade of leftist protesting. The vandals and barbarians should see the inside of a jail cell, but can we quit with the hyperbole?
