B's not a control freak as one other commentator claims, but rather inconsiderate and ignorant of his own feelings and would've rather have you decide for yourself, that you do not pursue S, despite not clearly communicating that he would not be okay with you doing that.

B failed communication and you did nothing wrong.

Edit: Also suppressed emotions, possibly seeing S as a threat to your friendship, since becoming intimate with S means you have less time for B or so he thinks. Doesn't necessarily mean B is in love with you, but he's definitely jealous.
