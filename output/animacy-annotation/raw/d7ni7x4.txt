&gt; This may seem to be a rather naive question, but I'm still "new to this" and don't understand the dynamic between spirits and people.

ahh ***we*** are spirits?? were just having *a experience* in physical with physical bodies we created??

&gt; This may seem to be a rather naive question, but I'm still "new to this" and don't understand the dynamic between spirits and people.

what dynamic..? non-physical is home!! were all **from** there.. this is just a game of physical.. (physical exists.. because we created it *from* non-physical) you make it seem more complicated then it is.. I guess, because your missing a education on this.. so now consider yourself educated! (if you choose too!?)

&gt; he question stems from something I read (maybe here on Reddit) that claimed that there are no "dangerous" spirits or spirits intending on passing ill will.

No there are dangerous spirits.. ones that play "trickster" so see we created evil, we created trickster, we created deception/lies it's all us.. it's all from us.. if your not aware of a basic fact.. oneness is the truth of it; we are all the same energy (but different configurations that makes you *unique*) we are all creator.. or as bashar likes to put it :) "the one are the all, the all are the one" so yes even trickster is us/you/whatever.

&gt; What could be their motivation to help a shamanic practitioner, or someone aspiring to be a shamanic practitioner, in the first place?

in non-physical we all have a lot of friends or even to say a it a lot of aspects that like to "help out" but at the same time physical is a experience/a journey so they won't help out in the parts where your SOUL wants to gain experience in this/that (whatever it planned) so umm yah you can say they don't all help in non-physical.. they honor the game/the journey/mission of exploring everything we are.. that's *the point* of the game! in the first place..

Humans may be stupid and unaware.. that they are spirit, that they are in a physical game/environment they chose **very** much! But that doesn't really change things.. to the soul any experience is a ***great*** experience/piece of data.

Ahh when you get down to it.. you think *too* 3rd dimensionally.. with this question :P
