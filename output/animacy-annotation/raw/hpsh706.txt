feel free to browse my post history to confirm i am infact not a fucking pinko. 

The Left of center is no the enemy. neither is the right of center. 

The enemy is anyone who plays these identity politics bullshit games. Enthonationalists and racial supremicists are not the real issue, they are the fucking smoke screen those in power are using to hide from us the real axis that keeps the average american down. Money. 

You don't need to be advocating the redistribution of wealth to see these coastal elite pricks are using their money to push their political agendas. 

We don't need to hammer down the rich, we need to uplift the poor. and step one is realizing they are using racism and woke shit and fear mongering to get us to stay divided and ignorant of the real issues.
