Yeah there's a difference between "not shaking hands" and "refusing to acknowledge". We can think about devout muslims not wanting to shake hands with women all we want but it's on a very different level than looking in the air staring past a woman standing in front of you. It's also quite racist and ignorant of the culture down there tbh.
