The days of Vanilla WoW...

I was in the eighth grade and I had purchased the game with my cousin to take my first step into an MMO. With a computer sitting at 248mb of RAM (don't ask, I don't know how) and with our home telephones at our ears we set off on our first adventure as Night Elves. 

Some hours passed and we saw ourselves on our first boat ride. The boat was taking us to Auberdine. As we stood waiting for the boat to finish its trip we noticed a pink haired gnome standing at the edge of the boat. Us being naive and unaware that there was no collision detection, my cousin proposed that we push the gnome off of the boat. I agreed that this was a good idea. My cousin ran at the gnome and as soon as my cousin's character ran into his space, the gnome jumped off of the boat. The deed was done.

We couldn't believe it. What have we done? We pushed a guy off of the boat and into the water. Did he die? Would he report us? We were in tears laughing and 100% convinced that we had pushed this gnome into the water. 

A few years and many WoW boat trips later I had obviously caught on to the fact that players jump off of the boat early to get to shore faster than the boats could dock in certain zones. 

Impeccable timing, 248mb of RAM, and naivety: My first night in WoW.
