So many comments concerned about how this guy could be a rapist, that's just jumping to a pretty extreme conclusion.

I think he's just explaining himself pretty poorly, and/or doesn't understand the weight of what he is saying.

Yes rape happens in nature. It's common for ducks to gang rape, it's a fact of life. It doesn't serve as an excuse, it just serves as a reality of nature like your bf was (probably) trying to say.

Rape has also been extremely common in pretty much all of human history when it comes to war and women being considered the spoils of war. Again, this is probably where your bf was trying to loosely associate the 'natural' or 'genetic code' aspect of rape in human beings.

Since he's a big weightlifter, of course rape is not something he is even **remotely** concerned about. He probably doesn't realize how stupid his remarks are because he can't sympathize with women who fear it or have gone through it, so he makes flippant jokes about it like rape isn't a big deal.

I don't think you're dealing with a rapist, just someone whose really dumb and unaware of the weight of his remarks.
