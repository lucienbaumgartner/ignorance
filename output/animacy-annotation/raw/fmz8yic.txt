Oh, you mean how special legislation was passed by the banks to once again circumvent capitalism and disallow students being able to default on student loan debts via bankruptcy? Creating yet another situation where the banks, thanks to government, loan money that wouldn't get loaned in a free market? Then all this cheap loan money artificially inflates the cost of higher education for everyone? 

Also, the public school system is PUBLICLY funded, including much of higher education. Not only does this extract resources from the public by the force that is government, it crowds out private options from the market.

As for race, you make a valid point that more money is wasted through the school system on minorities. Though you have no sense of proportion it's a retarded and irrelevant point, since you fail to understand that arguing the degree of socialism of a country would INCLUDE socialist spending on minorities, obviously. Saying it has "zero to do with socialism" shows you aren't even grasping the most fundamental questions we have been discussing. 

In any case, your response was so tortured and ignorant that you only confirm everything I've said about you in prior posts. There's really no need to continue. I can't take any more horse farts.
