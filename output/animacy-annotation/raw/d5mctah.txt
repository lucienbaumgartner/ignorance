I ended up trying the Vintorez and Val merely because I *didn't* before. I kept pushing myself. (Pistols only was fun. Shotguns only was horrible).

Anyway, I agree, the Val just isn't that great.

The Vintorez was radically different and I greatly enjoyed using it primarily. I wouldn't say it's superior to any of the other guns, though.

The big thing was: the additional challenge of the insane bullet drop, and the sheer joy of picking off a group of bandits silently without any of them realizing I was there.

Once I practiced a bit and found a good range to shoot from, I was taking down enemies in single headshots that left the other enemies blissfully unaware and open to be sniped next.

Downsides I can't possibly justify? The ammo, both weight and rarity. And if you aren't nailing headshots then the ammo you waste is horrible, compared to the number of shots you'd used with a Russian or NATO gun instead. It's not really a pleasant gun to use against mutants (sans zombies).
