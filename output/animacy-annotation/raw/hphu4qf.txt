Generously, 3 out of your 5 points aren't really relevant to this conversation. Going point by point here:

1) you're right. Most professors don't have a TA. That doesn't mean it's okay to be dirisive towards students who need accommodations.

2) the most abusive cases of what? People using the accommodations they've been granted by the office? Students being abusive towards their professors? Going to need a bit more context here.

3) you're mostly right, here, too. Many professors do "approve" most cases (odd language here, but I get what you're saying), I'd object to the bit where you say that they're "happy to do so." There are many threads on this subreddit alone talking about how inconvenient accommodations are, about how the students "don't *really* need them" and are rather "taking advantage of the system" based on completely unfounded tensions.

4) most profs are the ones putting their names on the line. Okay? And? How is this remotely relevant to this conversation? How is a professor granting a request for an accomodation at all a risk to their name? In what world would you be at a conference and one of your colleagues turns to you and whispers "did you hear? Dr. FakeName let a student with ADHD take extra time on their exam. I can't believe they did that!"?

5) a bit of a generalization, but also generally self-evident. They also have a wider support network, a wider and deeper archive from which they can pull assignments, and more experience adjusting those assignments as necessary for students with disabilities. 


It isn't unheard of for grad students to see systemic issues within the academy, particularly when there's a growing field of scholarship on how disabilities work, how they can/should be accommodated, and how important it is for these students **to** have their disabilities accommodated for. These fields are not perfect, and ignoring people pointing out the flaws because they're grad students is elitist, ignorant, and short-sighted.
