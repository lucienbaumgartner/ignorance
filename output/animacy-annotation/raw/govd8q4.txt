&gt;the shipment of weapons to moderate rebels

Do people still believe this "moderate rebels" bullshit? 

&gt;but when said shipments were found to have been confiscated by more extremist factions,

Who could have ever seen this coming 


&gt;vetted, moderate rebels,

Yes and Osama bin Laden was a freedom fighter

&gt;If we're going to use this logic as an argument for the US arming jihadis, then we must also blame the Syrian regime and its backers whose battlefield arms were taken over by these same jihadis

Where did I say I don't blame  the Syrian regime? They emptied their prisons full of jihadists 

&gt;And let's not forget that Saudi Arabia and Qatar continued to arm the opposition well after the emergence of ISIS.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar would not do anything significant without the (even tacit) consent of the US. Also, where do SA and Qatar get their weapons from? Ah the US ?

&gt;So there is certainly a distinction here between direct intent to arm extremist jihadis and arms indirectly falling into their possession.

I'm sure the CIA never envisioned the possibility of such weapons falling in the hands of extremists, the CIA would never arm or support extremist groups fighting against their enemy. That has never happen and will never happen, right?

How can you possibly be so naive and ignorant of the past (and present)?
