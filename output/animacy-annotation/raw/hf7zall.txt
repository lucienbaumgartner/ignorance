Yup, I agree with what you said on all points. 

I have a question for you, I’m assuming you’re a woman. Is it not insulting when so many people act like a 21 year old adult female is so dumb and ignorant that she must’ve just fell into the arms of a man 10 years her senior with no agency? The female mind matures quicker than men on top of it. I’m not saying this dude isn’t super immature and maybe even a total shitbag, I’m not even necessarily talking about just this situation. I see it all the time around here. What is the deal with infantilizing younger women? My experience has been that women are super fucking bright and capable at that age.
