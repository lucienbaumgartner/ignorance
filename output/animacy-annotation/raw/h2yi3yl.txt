Okay again I see you need some help understanding some things you're clearly not willing to understand. So let me try again...

* No one has diminished your right to freedom of speech I any regard. People downvoting you is again NOT in any way shape or form your freedom of speech being attacked. When you use your freedom of speech to say moronic and wilfully ignorant things we are allowed to disagree both vocally and on this platform with downvotes. No one is taking away your right to say stupid shit, we're all just letting you know how insanely stupid it is. My freedom of speech allows me to tell you that your arguments are so anemic and ignorant that I worry you might be a troll. People disagreeing with you is not anti free speech, it's anti morning statement.

* On the sheep thing, just because a majority of people think you are saying something idiotic and therefore downvote it is not them being "sheep" it's them seeing a willfully ignorant, idiotic statement and letting you know how dumb it was. It's not that we are sheep, we can all just see how stupid your message actually is. If I said "I love the way white chocolate taste" and 295 people disliked my comment or disagreed, that doesn't mean I don't have freedom of speech or that they are sheep, it just means people think white chocolate sucks. 

Oh and if I sounded preachy it's because I'm honestly really tired to debating christians who have zero understanding of their own word of god.
