I’m sorry your offended by what I said. 

Personally i find the Jewish people of Israel having a day to commemorate people lost during the Holocaust (for what they believed) while being so unaware and insensitive to the people currently being displaced and killed based off their religion in Israel completely hypocritical. People turning a blind eye is a huge reason why the Holocaust turned into what it did. 

I think a lot of people learn about the Holocaust and blindly support the idea of Israel without doing any research or educating themselves about the entirety of Israel. I think it’s important for us, as American Jewish people, to try to help others fully understand what they are supporting when they blindly support Israel at its current state. 

Again, I am sorry that I offended you but I do find it necessary to speak up about the atrocities Israel is committing at any time I can. 

Let’s try to keep history from repeating itself.
