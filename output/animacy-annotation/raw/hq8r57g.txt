Jesus… Educated white people thinking they can somehow “end” a social phenomena as old and complex as racism by “unpacking whiteness and rejecting racial privilege” is just so insanely pretentious and ignorant that it might as well be a high end brand of white supremacy.

Like the rednecks get canned white supremacy at Wal-Mart and the SJW’s buy the non-gmo vegan option at Whole Foods
