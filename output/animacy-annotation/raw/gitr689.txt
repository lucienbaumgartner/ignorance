This is gonna sound stupid, but what you're describing is addiction, I have gone through the same thing lots of times and the last few I just realized that is how dependence works, you feel down if you're off weed/smokes/booze, and it seems as if only being on it makes you feel numb and unaware of the bad things. I'd recommend you try to give it a week without weed or alcohol and use that time for better things like seeing how you can improve very little things that may be bothering you, like household things you're uncomfortable with and such. It's not going to solve all your problems, but coming from someone who's been high everyday since mid-december, a couple days after stopping I started to feel a little better. Still, everything sucks and bad thoughts don't just leave, but it's easier putting them aside and trying to occupy my mind with other stuff. Please don't do anything rash until you've cleared your head for a little while, then try to see if you can find any kind of solutions. I sincerely hope you get better.
