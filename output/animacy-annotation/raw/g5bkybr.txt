As a parent, I wouldn't have just left my kids in a roommate's room without telling them.  What if the kid had gotten hurt or something while you were asleep and unaware of being left responsible for him/her?  She could have woken you up, apologized and explained the situation.  You could have said no and then told her you knew someone you could bring in but she didn't give you the opportunity.   She knew you weren't ok with baby sitting which is why she just left.  It wasn't about not wanting to wake you but instead about not wanting to deal with you saying no.  Super selfish and irresponsible of her.
