I’m having a difficult time understanding your reasoning. Who knows how long JB and Michelle knew about the molestation and covered it up before the older girl (the “tattletale”) reported it to the police, or before enough Duggars knew about it that they could no longer hide it. For all we know, Josh could have been molesting his siblings for years. We can safely assume that JB’s primary interest was damage control for the family’s reputation and the survival of their TV show. His primary concern was not for the mental health of his daughters. He deliberately tried to minimize and normalize Josh’s behavior, chalking it up to normal sexual curiosity which was not uncommon in families. That right there is a crock of bullshit. A total lie. He tried to further minimize it by saying two of the girls were supposedly sleeping. That is also very likely  a crock of bullshit. I seriously doubt the two girls were always asleep and unaware that they were being sexually molested every time it happened, and we know it happened more than once. The girls were clearly coached to say they were asleep for all the reasons numerous posters have already suggested on this thread. Have you read the entire thread? JB is a straight up liar, and I hope God  judges him as harshly as JB judges others. JB judges women for wearing pants, people who dance or drink alcohol, people who are gay—he is so busy trying to take the splinter out of other peoples’ eyes that he doesn’t see the mote in his own. Fucking hypocrite
