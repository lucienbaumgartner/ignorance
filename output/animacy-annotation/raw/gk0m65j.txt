.... probably is simply there because there is no way to verify that claim without polling everyone, which I am not going to do because that would be incredibly unreasonable. You tell me to not parrot facts I do not know even though large portions of veritable media are suggesting what I am saying is true. I say something likely true I do not know for sure under the banner of probability, you say it is laughable that I would say something I am unsure of. Though first hand experience, your understanding of the game is very limited and ignorant, and mine is ignorant in that it is not first hand, but when the community consensus from general users and reviewers (both personalities and not) is fairly consistent in that the games are rushed and buggy especially on console, I think it’s pretty safe of me to say that the game is rushed and buggy, especially on console, and ignorant of you to brush off everything as bandwagoning rage.

I’m not saying you can’t enjoy the game or that you didn’t have a good experience, I am saying this game is absolutely comparable to fallout 76.
