First of all "I'm a solo please come kill me" is not a thing.  I sail solo *most* of the time, and it's rare that anyone comes near me.

"I'm unaware and unskilled please come kill me" *is* a thing.  And all of these other ships are watching you bumble and stumble around, unaware of their presence and activities, until they're like "this dude's an easy target, let's go pop this guy".

You're being marked because you're sailing and acting like a mark.
