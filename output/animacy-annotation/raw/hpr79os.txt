I would have been more successful materially but I would be far more ignorant and narrow-minded if I had not met opiates. I would probably not have been able to have any intimate relationships with other people because of my totally inability to socialize and major depression. 

I am very very happy not to be addicted today but I have zero regrets about my 12-year affair with heroin. For me it was a step up.
