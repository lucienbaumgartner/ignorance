Couldn't disagree more. Buying my first house had me going into it completely blind and unaware of just how much paperwork and how many steps are involved. I nearly missed deadlines and forgot so many things, but Debbie made sure that everything was smooth. 

Sure, the whole part of walking you through a house and pointing to rooms and saying what they are thing is pretty useless, but everything beyond that is a legitimate job.
