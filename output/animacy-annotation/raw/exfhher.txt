&gt;Just so I understand your argument here - are you saying that someone else who purchased a game with their money shouldn't be allowed to have fun when it doesn't negatively impact your competitive rank just because it's less convenient for everyone to lose a ten minute game?

Nah that is a *really* lazy strawman so let me explain how selfish and ignorant that assumption of what i said (because you clearly skimmed it once) is. 

First, this "purchased this with money" argument is scrapping the bottom of the barrel if I were to be that generous. *Yes* money can be used to buy goods and services but *like everything* there are rules associated with it and you can't do whatever the fuck you want just because you slapped 40 dollars on the table. Trying to excuse this by calling it "just having fun" is as petty as you can get in regards to a defense my dude and here's why.

What about *other people who spent money on the game* who find that they *have fun* by winning and how at the end of the day **OVERWATCH IS A TEAM BASED GAME** so that being blatantly pointed out, suggests that to play you have an obligation to not treat it as a single player game *especially* when that is literally a reportable offense. Im sorry but if your "fun" involves selfishly doing whatever the fuck you want and not giving a damn about your team *go play a different game* because overwatch just isn't for you and hiding behind "WELL I PAYED FOR THIS GAME" is just pathetic to say the least.
