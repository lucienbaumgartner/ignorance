What does this have to do with "rape" you fçk weirdo?? Is this REALLY how your brain works. I have repeatedly said if you see someone suspicious report it to concierge or management, they will do the investigating. Detaining people and asking them for their personal items is not "looking out" for anything, it Ms illegal and intrusive. You incompetent Hillbillies LOVE trying to take the law into your own hands trying to act like a wannabe cop. File a report like a normal person, and keep your Bootlicking to your own apartment.

You literally responded to me first, now you're Salty because I have easily proven you are ignorant and slow. Stay mad. But thank you for admitting I was right👌🏾
