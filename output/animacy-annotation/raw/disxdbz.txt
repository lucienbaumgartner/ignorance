They tried to tell me I couldn't patch a hole caused by nail in the center of a tire with a slow leak.  They said because my was AWD, I needed to replace all 4 tires, since the uneven tread of one new tire would cause issues with the AWD system.  They said the best replacement for my Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06 was some garbage no-name.  

Second time, I asked them to check for a bent rim, and after telling me there were none, said I needed a balance and alignment.  When I came to pick up my car, they backed it into something (or backed something into it).  Big chunk missing from the bumper under the clear bra.  They ended up charging me for work they never did (they only did a rear wheel alignment).  Both the local branch and corporate ignored my requests.  But once I hit them with a chargeback, they harassed me day and night with phone calls (literally).  

Stay away from these places, they prey on unaware and uninformed people.
