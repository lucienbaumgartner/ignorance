There’s no need to be cruel with your comments.

No one enters this world a relationship expert. 

She has a concern and posted it online to get information and advice. Isn’t that a healthy response to a concern? She went out of her way to get information before addressing it with him.

Different people have different boundaries. 

Love begins with attention. 

If he had communicated with her over the phone, “hey by the way, I’m going to be doing some stuff online while we chat,” that would have been different. It’s a way to show courtesy and respect to someone you care for.

If she was giving him her undivided attention, it’s not unreasonable for her to want reciprocation.

This can easily be resolved with communication, but not everyone knows that. How can you know something unless you haven’t learned it yet?

Comments like yours discourage people from being vulnerable and seeking information from other people. 

Is it worse to be ignorant and do no research, or is it better to be ignorant and willing to learn?

A relationship is built in steps, and she is taking steps to learn and grow with her relationship.

I think that kind of an attitude should be celebrated instead of criticized.
