If I was cured by a player who sent a zombie to kill me I would not be “grateful” for it. Why assume villagers are stupid and unaware of the scheme? The correct interpretation of the villagers mind is the one that doesn’t belittle their intelligence. Why not assume they are grateful for the entire experience?
