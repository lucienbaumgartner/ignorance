That it does, if the government becomes tyrannical and oppressive. This was just a shit load of butt-hurt losers who didn't agree with the democratic process that said their loser lost. The left didn't storm the capital when cheeto man won, we just realized that half the nation are so gullible and ignorant that they'd elect a dictator and we would need to get more people to turn out the next time to prevent it from happening again, like you are supposed to do. If there was any time to take to the streets and fight with the government, it was each and every time that they would send out the national guards to beatup mostly peaceful protesters and the grandmas who support not killing black people for walking while black. trump wanted the military to use lethal force on civilians, that's a cause for an uprising, not when someone loses an election legitimately.
