Thanks for that info . I did a lot of stripping and then staining and finishing over a few weeks time . Nothing like the black hole of thinking you poisoned yourself because you were stupid and unaware of the possibility of really messing your health up . I really think your post is important as I am more aware of what to do and much more respectful of the chemicals involved if I ever put my hand to finishing and stripping .
