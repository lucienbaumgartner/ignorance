He did- i just rewatched the finale and i guess im mad at the editors in a way bc, while i totally understand WHY erika won and was the correct choice, i cant help but feel like it should have been xander, he was edited in SUCH a likable and good/smart strategist big player who made lots of moves and earned it way. And it comes across as if the wokeness is the reason he lost.  I honestly dont think thats true and that erika won fair and square but by not undermining xander enough, showing the edit and game from his perspective where his moves are explained to us as logical and smart for the most part, it just makes u feel robbed that he lost.   I wish they gave erika a better edit and still gave xander the entertainment content but gave him more of a bad edit gameplay wise like they did with deshawn.  Its so conflicting bc if u look from xanders perspective he really did play a phenomenal game with 1-2 weaknesses (which everyone has a weakness) and couple misreads at the end, but if u look at it from the jurys perspective of him coming across as non threatening and socially unaware and you combine that with how well erika played and is perceived. You see why she won and how.  I credit erika bc she got the jury on her side but its hard to ignore how good xander played despite the flaws in his game bc they edited him so well
