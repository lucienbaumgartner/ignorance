youre strawmanning white privilege like getting beat up is a daily occurance. diversity training exists because comments like these are so hateful and ignorant that people dont even realize what hate they are spewing, and with the training accept the enfranchisement of POC co-workers. The asian community has been continuously beaten upon following Covid, and those are hate crimes, but it bears no significance to this situation, in which a young white boy is attacked and has his bike stolen. White Privilege exists, and the ideas of White Supremacy are rampant.
