Leo has realized some things about the nature of reality that I see nowhere else. His ideas and videos have helped me through some tough times and I have gotten real actual positive results from them. But at the same time I completely agree with you. 

1 that the content is very dangerous 

and 

2 that the guy is delusional.

The content is so dangerous because it aims to destroy your ego aka. Your identity. Which can be dangerous if you are unaware and unprepared. In a certain sense, that is suicide. In my case that was perfect because I had already brought myself there and with his ideas and videos I could find Love and Truth which, at rock bottom, is a pretty cool thing to look at and aspire to. Infact I would say that the love I've discovered through his work is some of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. 

And the guy is delusional. That doesnt make his ideas bad. If they work for you and you are strong enough and smart enough to resist the bandwaggon then it wont matter. The reason why I dont care so much about his delusions is because he knows how deluted he is and he even warns people about it. Most of the time he is not conscious of it but that's just how a fallable human is. He has a long way to go obviously. 

If you can be open and critical about his content then it wont matter that he is a human who is wrong most of the time. The things that are true resonate with you and can make your life bigger and better. They can also make your life worse. It is up to you.
