People tend to be ignorant and uneducated, not malicious. Our system is built on keeping people brain-dead: billionaire tycoons making you slave for them 12 hours a day for an hourly wage so you don't have time to think about what is right, media conglomerates brainwashing the working class against itself, politicians convincing people that brown people and immigration are to blame for decades-long wage stagnation rather than an unfair economic system.

Obviously I don't think righties are friendly to queer folx. I'm personally very active in the struggle for trans rights. But we can't bundle every single issue in the world in one messy lump and hope to get people to our side all at once. Class warfare and identity politics are related: by helping people realize that it's not immigrants but economic policy that's responsible for their miserable work experience, we are also fighting racism.

One movement, one focused message at a time.
