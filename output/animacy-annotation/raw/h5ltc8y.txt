Agreed. I was a dumbass in my early 20s. Didn't do stupid shit, but I was emotionally immature and unaware of how my words affected others. People holding a young Manny to a higher standard need to get off their high horse and see the person he is now. There is no one I would rather have in our clubhouse than Manny. A real stand up dude.
