You can close eyes and plug your ears while saying “no, no,no “ all you want, but what I posted was the truth. Yes I went 3-26. it’s funny because during that losing streak I literally did everything you mentioned. Didn’t help. The system is set up to make you fail. It’s my fault tho, I screwed up my MMR by winning too much. I should have purposely lost more games to prevent it.

I believe my kda was on the higher end of 3.8ish as well. The skill level between gold 2 and high gold 1 is the exact same. If I could climb out of gold 2 and gold 1 with ease, high end gold and low plat has the same skill level. So saying I have “hit my plateau” is VERY wrong and ignorant of you to say so.

Also your wrong one the matchmaking. If your entire season MMR is high, riot places you with others who are high MMR. Whereas if you just have a high MMR streak, like I did, the system gives you low MMR players to balance out the game. What I said is the truth regardless if you want to accept it
