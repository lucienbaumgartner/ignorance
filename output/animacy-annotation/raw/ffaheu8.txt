the only way that would happen is with a complete Revolution. We can't trust our government because they're in the pockets of corporations, who are just fine with the government only working for them - basically it's pro quo between these two and us common folk get to sit and watch and get fucked over by it all, and there's nothing we can do about it ... short of revolting completely. And half of us are so brainwashed and ignorant that they'd never revolt, so we lose majority at that point.

we need a leader that isn't selfish
