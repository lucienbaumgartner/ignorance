It's like you can't realize all these mandates and precautions are literally just to keep society from collapsing covid isn't that bad if you are vaccinated at all basically a cold, but my area has a 50% vaccination rate and the hospital has been ridiculously overcrowded for 90% of the pandemic because of fuckwits like you, I mean I hope one day 100 years from now kids are looking at your comments as examples of people who were so shitty and ignorant that didn't care about their fellow man, much like we look at the anti maskers of the Spanish Flu times, except now it will be saved and searchable for pretty much all time, unlike for them we just knew they existed they didn't have a place to espouse their stupid beliefs that would be saved for all times
