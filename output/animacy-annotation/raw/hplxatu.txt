Problem with this is punishment and proof. For example what severity of punishment is reasonable? The outcome of their stupidity isn’t like people are losing a bit of money in damages . No, due to the actions of ignorant and selfish people, other people are dying or getting seriously Ill from which they may take a long time to recover or never full recover. What punishment do you give for that? Life imprisonment? Capital punishment? If it isn’t going to be that severe what does it really do?slapping a big fine might hurt them but it doesn’t do justice for the family who just lost a loved one cause some idiot didn’t want to wear a mask. The flip side if punishments are that severe and you’re dishing out such serious consequences how do you prove beyond a doubt that particular individual is responsible?
