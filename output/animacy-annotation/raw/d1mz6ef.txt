Seriously, it's like when children accidentally say some sexual innuendo, having no idea what it means, and you're silently laughing at their innocence.

And then you remember that these are COLLEGE STUDENTS and ADULTS, then that humor turns to despair as you wonder why students and faculty can be so unaware and ignorant.

This religion really does infantilize its members.
