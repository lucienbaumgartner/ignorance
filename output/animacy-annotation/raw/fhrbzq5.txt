That's not good, please share this info on why

We need everyone to understand how we got here, or the mistakes can't be fixed.

The DNC is afraid you'll read about Hillary Clinton promoting Trump's campaign to distract from the rise in Sander's popularity and her email investigation. (It's from April 2015 - two weeks after she announced running for president, not "after she was mathematically the winner")

By covering Trump they also limited airtime covering any of the 3 email scandals (Benghazi server, Podesta leak, DNC leak) further conflating &amp; confusing people's understanding of each scandal. Let's mention [outright lying to their audience about where to get informed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTiAf8fp8)

Trump coverage = less coverage of Hillary &amp; her primary opponents. I elaborate more within my links here.

There is an active effort on reddit &amp; this thread to discredit the messengers of information about the DNC 2016 primary election corruption, to steer people away from their own investigation of the facts, &amp; scapegoat the reasons which gave us President Trump.

"[Here is one of those supposed unimportant emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120) And it's not illegal to look at, despite what CNN says

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

&gt; [I told Bernie I had found Hillary’s Joint Fundraising Agreement. I explained that the cancer was that she had exerted this control of the party long before she became its nominee.

Tim: [I was DNC chair and resigned](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0405/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz-A-good-fit-to-replace-Tim-Kaine-at-DNC) so Hillary's [losing '08 campaign co-chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz#2008)  Debbie Wasserman Schultz can take over the DNC to rig it [in exchange for VP nomination](https://thinkprogress.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-tim-kaine-hillary-clintons-vice-president-pick-832de5b910a0#.5ad2lazel).

[The Democrat campaign chairman **John Podesta's lobbying group worked with the Republican campaign manager Paul Manafort in Ukraine** towards Pro-Russian efforts.](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/paul-manafort-lobbying-ukraine-podesta-group-237163) 

&gt; The AP obtained emails showing that **Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, directed the work of the Podesta Group and another lobbying firm, Mercury.**

&gt; Lobbying powerhouse the Podesta Group filed paperwork with the Justice Department today acknowledging that its work years ago

&gt; [The Podesta Group is a lobbying and public affairs firm based in Washington, D.C.. It was **founded in 1988 by brothers John Podesta** and Tony Podesta.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_Group)

&gt; It "has close ties to the Democratic Party and the Obama administration"[5] although **its CEO, Kimberley Fritts, is identified by the group as "a fixture in Republican politics," having worked for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.[6]**

&gt; They also received revenue of $900,000 in 2011/12 from the "European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a Brussels-based **organization sympathetic to Viktor Yanukovych** and his political party".[13]


&gt; They also represent (as of 2016) the interests of **Russia's largest financial institution Sberbank of Russia, which controls approximately 30 percent of Russian banking assets.**

[A different email where it is explained to Podesta (Hillary's campaign manager)](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

&gt; And as I've mentioned, **we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.** The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."
