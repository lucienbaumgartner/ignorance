There is a definite ever-present feeling that a lot people (mostly women) view you as some kind monster (or at least that you are potentially dangerous and should be treated with caution) out in society.  I understand the reasons why and sexual assault is a very real, widespread issue that, to the benefit of society, has come into focus in the past few years.  But it still sucks for those of us dudes who are not monsters, do treat all people including women with respect, and have never sexually assaulted someone to be treated poorly just because of our gender.

Especially with respect to kids.  I get comments made to me or see mom's steering their children away somewhere else or people will ask my kids if they know me when I play with them at the playground.  It's incredibly rude and ignorant of those women to assume the worst about me when it's pretty obvious if they actually use their skills of perception at all that the kids saying "push me higher daddy" on the swing are in fact my children and I'm not their to creep on some other peoples' kids.

If I didn't take them to the park, the same women would say I'm an absent father like all the rest and only mothers do anything to raise the kids.

Can't win as a regular standup guy these days.
