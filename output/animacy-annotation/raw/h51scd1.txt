A man-made death-causing virus that spreads all over the world comes out of one country that somehow, unprepared and unaware of it's make-up, was able to pull up their socks at random and defeat it and save their country nearly a year before everyone else. It's a communist regime and countries are offering them millions per year to help fund "infrastructure" and then anti-democracy sentiments come out like this. Are we are honestly so stupid.
