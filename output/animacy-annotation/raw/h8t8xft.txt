I got that.   word for word. 

then I will up that one with &gt;

"My context is as important as your context!"

And then double the bet with "  I think that my thoughts are real and that they are really happening!"   

then I will go all in with what just might be my favorite:  
" why can't I use the stuff I make up to justify the things that I do and say!"

You couldn't make this shit up as absolutely no one would believe it. 

AS it appears to the non-involved and unaware ( of borderline personality ) that YOU MUST BE MAKING IT UP as what we are describing to them seems to them to be a person who has lost contact with reality, COMPLETELY DELUSIONAL AND MIGHT NEED to be put in the hospital for observation. 

And it doesn't help it at all if the women/ man is attractive.  As for whatever reason, they will say " well, he/she doesn't seem that way to me, s/he looks normal or " she is so pretty!"
