One; they knew Cinder could drain Maiden powers already, as was discussed when Oz revealed Amber half-dead to Pyrrha back in V3. So they knew the drain mechanism was a thing even back then.

Two: They didn't even know if Penny qualified, it was a shock to everyone in and out of the show. And why would Winter mention Penny in the first place? The point was for Atlas' best soldier to get an upgrade. Why would she sabotage orders that she was under from a general that (at the time) had complete faith in? They needed control over the Maiden powers to prevent the Vault from being opened and the Staff removed, because, you know, if it was activated Atlas would collapse and wipe out both cities.

And Fria, frankly, wasn't in a position to truly choose, due to the above stakes set. It was either the disciplined soldier who was already prepared to use those powers, or maybe some other random woman across the planet unprepared and unaware of the dangers.

With all these reasons set, can you name an actual, functioning alternative that Ironwood and his men had to the Fria situation? Do not say Penny because that wasn't something they even knew was possible, and they didn't know Team RWBY were coming. Are you saying we could trust *Harriet* with those powers, the competition freak who holds perpetual disdain for almost everyone else? Or maybe *Elm*, who has the mental capacity of a toddler huffing paint?
