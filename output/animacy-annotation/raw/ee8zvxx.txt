You chose the wrong wife. External pressures helped you make that choice, but you made the choice. Don't play the victim.

Here's the real question; did your wife marry the wrong man? Does she also feel like she's been short-shifted or is she clueless and happy? If she's also unhappy, divorce and split assets so you can both be happier. If she is blissfully unaware and happy, you get to choose if you can set yourself aside to play house with a pretty woman who is a decent mom.

*PS, there are a lot of men who would trade their shot at "better" for what you have right now.*
