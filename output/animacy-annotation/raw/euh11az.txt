Elhokar wasn’t indifferent. He was incompetent and ignorant. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t trying. Near the end of WoR, he confesses to Kaladin that he was trying, but no matter what he did, he failed. He wanted to do the right things, but he didn’t know how. Moash had only one goal: vengeance. Elhokar wanted unity and to rule as effectively as Gavilar, but wasn’t good enough at it. By OB, we see that he is finally figuring it out. That’s why his death was so tragic. Moash hates himself bc he knows that he is in the wrong, but it’s been his life’s focus for so long that he doesn’t know what else to do
