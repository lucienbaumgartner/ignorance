Ahhh wishing people a slow painful death isn’t hateful. How delusional and ignorant of *you*. This sub is not *full* of hate. Most the hate here comes from Muslims 😶. Everyone on this sub has differing opinion because unlike Islam and many Muslim we actually allow that. Have a look at r/Islam and look at the differing opinions on there. There aren’t any. 

Most the time “disrespect” is happening on this sub is criticism of Islam and the Muslims who hold ridiculous views and practice harmful things.
