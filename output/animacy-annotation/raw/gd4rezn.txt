&gt;Except they don't go to the same schools, schools in wealthier suburban areas are almost across the board better performing than in poorer areas.

And what differences are there in the curriculum that lead to "keep the working class ignorant and unaware of how to best advance their own interests." exactly?

&gt;Poor people also often don't have the time to better themselves between jobs they need to pay rent.

Got any numbers to back that claim up?

Do you really believe there is a conspiracy by the rich to keep the working class from learning lest there be a literal class war? Maybe in times gone by, but right now, nearly every person in the UK from school age onwards has access to the internet and a mountain of information.
