You guys might think this is odd, given it's a past gen meta, but I fully agree with this decision. I am the user "Storm Eagle" on the forums, and the one specifically referenced in that post. I have advocated for Species Clause (although Forme Clause got added here) for quite a while. I have [gotten suspect test requirements](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/sm-bh-suspect-11-shell-smash.3691259/post-8997261) for the recent Shell Smash suspect. I have actively been laddering on the Gen 7 ladder for the past two months since that vote happened. 

If you want to see just how god damn ridiculous species spam is, take a look at these replays that I provided.

So I'm going to bring a bit of unrelated drama here. There is a user called "mastermewtwo" on the Smogon forums who specifically spams Mewtwo on the ladder. Both Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Mewtwo Y, and recently he proved that even base form Mewtwo is workable on ladder. He always runs 6 Mewtwos. Well, he was absent up until this recent Suspect Test, and his actions caused the Gen 7 meta to be worse through his DNB vote on Shell Smash.

For those not aware, Shell Smash is an extremely powerful setup move that resulted in Prankster being mandatory as Moongeist Beam, Sunsteel Strike, and Photon Geyser could ignore Unaware and other defensive abilities, as well as Stored Power and Power Trip having high enough base powers to remove them as well.

If you check that Suspect Test req post above, you'll see me responding to this user. He brings up the absolute fucking *nonsense* suggestion of banning Focus Sash, and he thinks that Shell Smash isn't banworthy as a result. He causes the result to go DNB, and it's clear he wasn't good at the meta as he required over a hundred games to get his reqs. I shredded him because of the stupid points he brought up, then I suggested a Species/Forme Clause addition as that was the next best thing since his teams were way more effective than they should have been.

Well, over the next month mastermewtwo ladders and peaks ladder multiple times with a team that uses 6 Mewtwos, as he learns that makes an extremely effective HO team. This user is [extremely toxic on ladder](https://imgur.com/a/4puK3dd). He ends up beating a lot of high profile BH players solely because his team was nearly impossible to keep up with. Well, other ***actually good*** players catch wind of this HO archetype, then USUM BH becomes a HO hellscape as other players constantly one-up each other with different implementations of said team. Eventually MMX got &gt;200% usage as seen in the post, and the council agreed to vote on Forme Clause.

That user ain't reaching Top 500 again without his beloved mewtwo spam team. Boo hoo. As for Species/Forme Clause itself, it was discussed a few times during the gen, but up until recently, it wasn't a big problem and was rarely seen except on meme teams. Mastermewtwo caused the usage to jump up to levels which got it looked at and eventually actioned upon.
