No, it doesn’t require intent.  If someone is sleepwalking, gets a gun and aims it, you can defend yourself, even if there is no intent on part of the person aiming the gun. 

I mean..if I am stumbling drunk and unaware that my actions may cause you harm and do not intend to cause you harm, you are still allowed to protect yourself and don’t have to let me injure you just because I am not aware, didn’t mean to, and you were the one who had a keg party in the first place.
