I've specifically asked for you to provide your sources so that I can understand where it is you got your information and make an informed decision for myself. Explain to me how that is "arrogant and ignorant that you refuse to entertain the notion that you may not have all the facts"? Whilst your idea is that anything posted on a left leaning network must be lies? But fox News is truthful? You do realize these are corporations who's interest above anything else is to keep you clicking and watching to sell ads. They are an entertainment network and have no duty to be truthful. As are CNN,MSN any corporate network that does "news" has a bias and an agenda. 

You haven't questioned the narrative you've engaged in at best conspiracy theorist nonsense with tucker Carlson's opinion being your only "source" which is at best a secondary source if not full on hearsay at times.
