Reigen has special attacks, Mob doesn't. 

Reigen has enough social skills and moral bending to mildly fool someone, Mob doesn't. 

Reigen is so blunt and ignorant that he can infiltrate a top secret agency full of kidnapped kids without a sweat, Mob can't do that.

Reigen's character, to me, is just as good as it is because he is absurd. He's, on a surface level, a fucking cheap conman whose rat like behaviour, sausage-water-colored-hair and fraudulent features cause nothing but lack of trust on most of the people around him.

And it's even more absurd that THIS GUY, THIS MFING DUDE is the one that's often the adult in the situation. I think he is the personification of ONE's critics to the shounen genre, that is often so silly. Reigen is not trust worthy, but put him side by side on the scars and he starts seeming mature - even tho, as we see an arc before that, he isn't all that mature, but he is the mature one, in that specific context. 

So I don't think it really matters. I believe that if Reigen had powers, he'd be the same.
