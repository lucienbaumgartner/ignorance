Ever have a nerve cut or damaged? Maybe you’ve had surgery and felt the area of skin or region of your body sting/sore/feel raw like a deeply torn cuticle/electric tingle/numb but stingy pain that lasts for about 3 years five or take before your body readjusts to the damaged signal and waveform sent out?

That’s what we all felt for the first 3-4 years of our lives in the most sensitive area of our entire body before we could speak or communicate it, and while that was going on we had too much to learn and to pay attention to so that we could start to speak.. why which point it becomes an echo of something we know was bad, was done to us, was ilegal and heinous every time we look down at ourselves, all because Jews wanted to make a side buck for celebrity skincare products and to laugh in that we all have been marked as Hebrew slaves/property by what was done to us so they came up with lies like “it increases iq” “men are too stupid and unaware of their penis and won’t be able to look after it or keep it clean so we need to cut off the best parts of it” 

Anyhow, repress repress repress and society denies denies denies and then 30 years later “I don’t want to be reminded of what was done to me” becomes “well I guess his should look like mine” and the cycle restarts. It’s sick.

And all of this is done because of a schizophrenic who tied up lambs before punting them off of a cliff to quell his own insecurities about choices the way a person might flip a coin, got the idea to mutilate himself and all of his slaves/descendant males and here we are today.
