We’ve talked about it plenty of times and do not agree with you at all. It’s not the AKC ruining them. They don’t think the breed is ruined. Most if not all police dogs in my area are GSDs, not mals as you claim. You realize that it’s the individual breed clubs that make up the breed standard, not AKC, right? Which kinda ruins your whole conspiracy theory idea. As I said, your ideas are so silly and ignorant that I can’t take you seriously.
