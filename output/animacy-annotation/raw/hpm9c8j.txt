I'm not a man but I will say that education, knowledge and intelligence are three different things. There are plenty of people with degrees who are unintelligent and ignorant, and plenty of people with poor education who are exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable. 

There are blokes who find it demasculating for their gf to earn more than them, but they're arseholes and are not as common as they used to be. Plenty of decent men exist.

If you personally are not getting a date, it's likely because of what seems to be your really shitty personality and attitude. Not your looks, not your education level, not your financial status. If you're a woman, you seem to be some sort of femcel/nice girl.
