If I believed CIA is after me I would be 100% sure that I have psychosis and need treatment in state of mind I am right now. And actually that's easy to guess symptom of unhealthy mental state, if I'm unaware and delusional, people will notice that but what about more complicated cases? When no one can say for sure it's delusional thought or a real spiritual belief
