&gt; It is stupid and i shouldnâ€™t say this in the internet

I don't think there's many places you should say it. Look, you're probably not homophobic, but you sound hugely immature and unaware of the potential effects of your actions. The joke basically boils down to associating being gay with a negative thing, it can be hurtful. Just cut it out, and don't double down and try to excuse yourself when you're called out for something you know isn't great.
