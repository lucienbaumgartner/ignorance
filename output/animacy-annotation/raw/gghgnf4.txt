I have a similar character, but rather than being a deliberate contract, my character was training to be a Paladin, and went out to meditate on what Oaths he would take, and ended up unintentionally tapping into Dendar the Night Serpent, Eater of Dreams, without whom no one would ever be able to forget their worst nightmares.  
Fortunately Dendar is herself asleep and unaware of his presence, his power draw little more than a tick on a hibernating bear, but the consequences are no less terrible. If you think your own nightmares are bad, imagine how much worse it is when it's the nightmares of any and everything else, and since it's not your dreams, you don't get to wake up from it.  
The solution? Don't sleep. EVER. (Tomelocks can do it just fine) But when you've tapped into that power and try to deny it, bits can still leak through the cracks, and even the waking world starts to feel like a dream.

His spell list is peppered with illusion, enchantment, and transmutation spells that are flavored to be bits of fantasy leaking out and warping reality. For instance even the [Phantom Steed ritual he picks up has it's own disturbing twists](https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/juwf1x/ideas_needed_for_dreamlike_phantom_steed/).
