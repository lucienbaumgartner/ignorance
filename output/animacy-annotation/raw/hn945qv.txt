When my boyfriend had his first major seizure back in January I had called 911 and ambulance came but when my boyfriend was still in that stage of coming back to reality, they kept questioning him and expecting an answer and they kept threatening him that they were going to take him to jail because he was so lost and unaware of his surroundings.
