Such an ignorant and sexist comment.

It doesn’t matter that it’s targeted abuse or not. It doesn’t matter if it’s existed in online gaming for 10+ years. Harassment and bullying is not tolerable in any shape or form.  

Video games are for everybody and to have fun. Multiplayer games offer an opportunity to have fun with your friends/strangers, work together to win, make new friends, etc. However, for most girls if not all, they are literally terrified of using their microphone to communicate or even just say to say hello, without being made fun of, asked inappropriate questions, or told to shut up the second they press their push to talk key. 

It’s disgusting you brush people off who have valid concerns and turn away from that genre of games. So many girls have stopped playing games they enjoy so much. But keep thinking there’s no issue and that terms are being used “too loosely.”

Who raised you..?  Loser.
