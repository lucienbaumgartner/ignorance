The Catholic Church has advanced "science" more than any institution on earth.  The father of genetics, Catholic,  Big Bang, catholic, founder of Astrophysics, Catholic plus an insane amount of contribution to physics, Galileo, eyc.  because they approach science as it really is, the study of the mechanisms of Gods creation and how this  incredibly powerful and loving being that we have the honor and privilege to call him Father, created all that there is , and the journey these people took with God as a loving teacher guiding them to awes and wonders and discoveries that bring hope that we are not alone, just willful blindness by some and ego to be "god".  Hijacking science and trying to take it from God and man into the realm of atheism.  "Science" isn't oh well, it just happened, there is no God is so simple and ignorant that they sold to ever speak of science because they have no clue.  That they can't see it because they don't want to accept whatever fallacies they have in their brain of what it means and the implications, so they remove the creator from creation.
