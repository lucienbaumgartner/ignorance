That’s so selfish and ignorant of her to say that. Animals are part of families, too. Even if she’s not an animal person (which she clearly isn’t) she could have gave her condolences. Only a cold hearted person would *laugh* at an animal’s suffering like that. Animals aren’t possessions and aren’t just replaceable like she thinks. 

She overstepped s HUGE line and you should have a conversation with her why it’s inappropriate to say things like that, or just go straight to reporting her.  People like this make for a toxic and unfriendly work environment.
