St Lukes? I had to pay their bullshit fees heaps too. They tried fining me $150 in three days because their own shitty machine was broken *again*. Worked there for a year and had to write in a dispute letter every month because of how frequently their machine broke. 

Their customer service was shit too. I'd go in to tell them I needed entry at 5am the next day and they'd say all good. Then I'd show up and they'd refuse to let me in and say it was my fault for not letting them know in advance?? They left me locked outside at 5am for over an hour in winter.


Worse thing is I was young and unaware that my employer should have been paying my parking entry so I wasted hundreds that year.
