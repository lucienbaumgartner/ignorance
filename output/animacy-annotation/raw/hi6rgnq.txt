Tom Cruise. He got those beady little serial killer eyes and a weird ripply face and ugly mole. I think he has always thought he was a catch which is awkward cuz he has exactly 0 redeeming qualities save maybe the fact that he is insane and that works for action movies. nevertheless he is distractingly dorky and unaware of it which makes him the worst part of every movie he’s in. can’t stand him
