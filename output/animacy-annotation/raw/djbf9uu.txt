A copy of your brain in a computer is not "you". You would not experience both realities simultaneously. It will be a new consciousness. 

Removing your consciousness from your body a (1:1 transfer) to a new body or medium may theoretically allow you to "wake up" in a new environment, but what is consciousness? How would new you know if it was the old you? There is no way to prove that you didn't just die, and a new version woke up. A version you are not aware of because the "you" you were before is no longer conscious. "You" are dead. The new you has all your memories and continues on unaware and unable to determine if it is a copy or the original.

There is no physical way (currently) to define what it is, where it is, or how to move it. It's entirely theoretical right now. No one knows.  

The video explains it in more depth than I am but is only slimming the surface. 

It's a great idea and I hope we figure it out, but like death, no one will be able to comes back to tell us other wise. It's entirely probable that the new you won't know the difference and the old you will just be gone.
