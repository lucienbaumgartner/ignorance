No, cults don't die that easily. It probably does mean the end of Candace Owens' career, though.

The lunatic fringe of the Republican Party loves it when they can find the occasional Jew, Homosexual, or African-American who will tell them that they are right about everything, and that the reason why most gays and ethnic minorities don't agree is because they're ignorant or have adopted a victim mentality.

But the lunatic fringe is always suspicious of their token minorities, and will quickly stop supporting them if they become an embarrassment, deviate from orthodoxy, or cross the wrong figure in the fringe movement. There's no way that Owens can survive direct conflict with Trump, and if she were smart she'd be saying things like, "President Trump is entitled to his opinion", rather than things like, "Trump is ignorant and too old to use the Internet". But of course, she's not smart, so she hasn't made the smart choice.
