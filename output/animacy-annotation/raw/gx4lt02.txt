That's exactly what Machiavelli said.
The prince must have people to fear him, but he must not be hated by them. Therefore the prince (just like any person with power) must not dramatically assert dominance (unless it's extremely needed), but just make sure he is feared at the right extent.

Also, Machiavelly says the prince must hide his real intent (just ad you said "can be nice"), and make the mass (and the others in power, other princes ect) think he is religious and benevolent, while basically being prepared to stab anyone in the back when he has the opportunity.

He makes the example of Cesare "Valentino" Borgia, who tricked nobles who were plotting against him to believe he was naive and unaware of their treason.
He gathered them in Senigallia and killed them (this is known as "the Senigallia slaughter").
Machiavelli saw the thing as he was with Cesare during that period of time.
