&gt; American bread is also incredibly sweet when compared to the equivalent, supermarket loaf in Europe. This whole post has been informative and mind-boggling. Hovis white bog standard bread has, per 40g slice, 1.4g of sugar. And this is white bread!

That's ... that's a lot more than American bread has.  That's almost 4% by weight.

Sara Lee, the brand being criticized here, a famously low quality brand, [has less than half that](https://saraleebread.com/our-breads/classic-white-bread?gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzM3K1-68uYbwTKCDj5B6NjhbtF-qFJ4LyUhhpk7FpDls1ZIgeZ7uoUaAnrKEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds).

&gt; I've never put sugar in any bread I bake

That's nice.  Bread flour and sugar are nutritionally essentially equivalent; this is like bragging that you don't put any ice in your water.

You're also missing the point that Earthworm Jim (groovy!) was making. 

He didn't say "all bread has extracted sugar compounds added."

He said "wheat as a substance includes sugars, and all flour as a result includes sugars.  No such thing as sugar-free bread exists."

It's like when those people tell you not to put a teaspoon of sugar on your grapefruit for health's sake, apparently unaware that the fruit already has 60+ inside of it.

Silly, and unaware of the basic principles attempting to be lectured about.

&gt; Any idea why bread there is so expensive?

All of our food is famously much cheaper than England's.

You're listening to hipsters argue about which of their $15 candy coffees has less sugar.

San Francisco is Walmart's most expensive market.  There, [a 20oz loaf of bread is eighty three cents](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-White-Round-Top-Bread-Loaf-20-oz-22-Count/10315355?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=2648&amp;&amp;adid=22222222227000000000&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=42423897272&amp;wl4=aud-393207457166:pla-51320962143&amp;wl5=9061270&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=10315355&amp;veh=sem&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzPRCSSJ6hyMGAEDP-T04ynhK4P5lvd8PtKZW28yZhDUBgCGYTwS1zoaAp0qEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds
).

Hovis bread is 400g - 14oz - 1/3 smaller - for twice the price.  It's also lower quality bread.
