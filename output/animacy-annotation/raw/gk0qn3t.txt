Women have always and forever been second thought in Army policy. I would argue that the original “want” was idealistic and ignorant of the impacts and should never have been released, but it was. We are correcting course back to realistic expectations that still address the biggest concern, which is the minimums.

You can be honest about intentions while also not being able to see the whole picture at the start. Not being able to change with new information even when told it will directly harm your force is not the kind of leadership I would respect either.

I don’t fault leadership for having lofty goals and a faulty premise. I would fault them for not adapting.

Being concerned about “honesty from the beginning” seems to be overly focused on the wrong thing with an equally unrealistic expectation of perfect leadership.
