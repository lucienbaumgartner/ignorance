Because it is ludicrous and ignorant of how our society works. If I run a restaurant and wish to have a pipe leak fixed I call a plumber. The plumber comes in and fixes the pipes. That plumber is classified as a contractor under our system and is paid by the restaurant for their service. In OPs world the restaurant would have to hire the plumber and pay them a living wage to fix a pipe now and then. That's ludicrous. This is clearly a case when the plumber should be a contractor. Now let's say I run a factory and that factory needs a plumber about 40 hours a week, but I don't know the first thing about plumbing so I again contract out to a plumbing company that knows what the heck they are doing, trains plumbers, and provides similar services to lots of other factories. This again makes sense in a contractor relationship. This would be problematic though if the factory knows a plumber that works independently and works exclusively at the factory. They are probably an employee. There is definitely an argument to be made to make sure there is a clear and fair line, but the line must still exist. Not everyone can be an employee. Without contractors, there would be no service industry.
