Late to the party, completely agree - though I'm electing to upvote you anyway cause I do think this is an unpopular opinion. 

I have a few mates who like to talk about politics, specifically European politics. Of them only one of them actually seems to enjoy the discussion, the rest are just miserable and angry and vent about it to me. Meanwhile here I am blissfully unaware and ignorant enjoying dumb music and games as the world apparently melts around me. Not that I'll notice mind you.
