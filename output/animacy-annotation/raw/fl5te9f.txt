Yes I'm tired of "well they probably just don't know!" as if that's an excuse. If they're so privileged and ignorant that they haven't seen 1 second of the news, 1 article, shit even just 1 post of social media then that's on them. This information isn't hard to find and if they actually cared about anyone other than themselves they'd find it
