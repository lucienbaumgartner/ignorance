*sigh* yes we DO have timeframe! We even have a giant fucking diorama to go along with said timeframe! With the various stages of the AWE marked on the flipping diorama! The documentation for the Ordinary AWE stages is where the testimonies are found in relation to the stage in which the testimony is about. The other incident in which Jesse talks about what happened is during therapy. The same one that I've referenced previously.  And that is all. 

Jesse didn't escape immediately after the AWE. She was interrogated by law enforcement/Bureau officials, and then she and Dylan showed Trench and Darling where they had hidden the Slide Projector. 

Do you EVER bother looking any of this stuff up to make sure you've got your rubber ducks all in  row? Or are you under the impression that you talking out of your ass is the true gospel and the game files are all wrong?

If you can't be bothered with doing your research on a topic, then maybe you shouldn't engage in debate on that topic either? You are being wilfully ignorant and misleading otherwise.

Go read the Ordinary AWE report and the Ordinary AWE Stages(there are 6 separate documents on this. 1 - 4 + A and B on a couple). 

Have to turn in now, it's almost 5 AM where I'm at. Have a good evening. And thank you for the discussions! &lt;3
