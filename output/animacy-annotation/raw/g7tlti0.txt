Levantine cuisine is not "Arabic food" most of the dishes are part of Turkish cuisine too, language is wast majority Turkish, culture is hybrid.

Wast majority of people in that city speaks ONLY Turkish, they don't eat "Arabic food" it's levantine cuisine and most of the dishes are part of the Turkish cuisine too. Your family is there but you obviously live in a fantasy world where the city is Arabic.

You said that city is Arabic. Which is not true and ignorant. That city was Turkish before and is still Turkish.

You probably think Turkish culture is only the one in Ä°stanbul, can't distinguish if the people speaks Turkish or Arabic and only know the dishes your parents cook so I don't blame you but being ignorant isn't not knowing it is denying your lack of knowledge.

Arabs like your family was minority before the unification and still are minority, your parents might gone nationalistic and said the city is Arabic to you but you have a smartphone in your hand you can research it.

If you wonder why people got angry it is out of your ignorance too. Syria is claiming Hatay.
