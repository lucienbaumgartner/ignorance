Once upon a time, only the rich were able to board a ship to cross the ocean. Once upon a time only the rich were able to afford cars. Once upon a time, only the rich were able to fly to other countries.

At one point only the rich could afford spices, oranges, sugar, glass. When computers first came out, only the rich could afford them, same with phones, the internet and other things.

Saying that something is cost-prohibitive now and assuming that it won't get cheaper if it is actually viable is stupid, short-sighted and ignorant of history.
