i thought he was felt too old for fiona but a better match than any other her other partners outside of jimmy-steve (seriously, she was all over the place with her relationships)

but besides that, i back you up completely. and bare with me bc i'm about to go on a rant about fiona's attitude toward addiction bc it pissed me off so much!

i was disgusted by how she acted in his NA meetings, &amp; i think it showed her true colors, how incapable she was of understanding or empathizing with any problem she didn't have personally. 

IMO the worst thing she ever did in the series was completely disregarding sean's concerns. He told her point-blank that getting involved would jeopardize his sobriety and she literally did not care at all!
sean was incredibly mature by communicating how he felt about that and yet she still tried to persuade him to hook up that night. 

how selfish and ignorant of a person do you have to be to do that? i lost all my respect for her in that moment. 

sorry for the rant but i have no tolerance for someone who puts their wants over what's best for a persons recovery. she of all people should understand that shit is hard enough
