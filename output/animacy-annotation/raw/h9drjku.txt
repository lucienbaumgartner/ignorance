Those are really great points! I was thinking that I'd go a similar route, where Cedric is super sheltered and doesn't see how anyone could be mad at the world. Life is easy for him, and he struggles to fully understand that others can't just change their life circumstances with ease. Basically Harry is upset about a problem, and Cedric responds, "well, why don't you just __?" (for a real world example, say Harry has narcolepsy and is upset about being tired, and Cedric responds, "well have you tried coffee?") Ultimately, Cedric is well-meaning, but horribly naive and unaware of the complexity of some problems. 

Thank you for your reply! It made me actually put my ideas into words which does a lot for me and my writing process!!
