Wait hold up, are you saying your experience of college working at subway for 20 hours a week and going to school is comparable playing a competitive collegiate level sport, going to practice for said sport, maintaining the ability to be competitive in said sport, receiving a stipend, and having the ability to earn $5,000 a month all on top of going to college and earning a degree, 30 FUCKING YEARS AGO?

It’s too bad you never learned (May Ed you did but didn’t understand) correlation does NOT imply causation. 

Not only are you uneducated, you’re ignorant, dumb, unaware, and flat out lazy.
