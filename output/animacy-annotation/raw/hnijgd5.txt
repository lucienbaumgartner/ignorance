We could go on and on, but I see you.

I know why you're here. In conspiracy sub. When your pro vaccine, pro covid agenda.

I know what's going on. I've used long time corresponding with people like you, but I see it's pointless.

You kill peoole with ventilators.
I know many people that got tested positive when they came to hospital, but was never sick. They tested the first day... Negative, then next day test again. Suddenly it was positive.

I know it is like that. It's so unreliable I don't know what to compare with.

Even under European handball 1 day a whole team was negative, the next day 3/4 was positive.
It's so obvious.

And you don't use ivermectin or hydroxyclorocin.

Either you are unaware and very ignorant, or you are paid to be here. Either way you should be ashamed.

We see what's going on. Traitor
