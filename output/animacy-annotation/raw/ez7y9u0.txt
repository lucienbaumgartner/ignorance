How in the world is it ignorant to have an opinion? The guy I responded to acted like Americans don't know that there are different cultures. I do. Doesn't mean that I'm uncultured and ignorant because I think it's weird yelling and trying to intimidate is showing respect. Just like how New Zealanders can understand there's a huge gun culture in America and not agree with it doesn't mean they are uncultured and ignorant. That may not be the best analogy but I hope you see the point.
