“White people can’t accept their part in slavery”. You really don’t see the issue with that? White people today played no part in that shit and it’s stupid to blame them for something their ancestors may or may not have done. I don’t think there’s a single person who hasn’t acknowledged that that has happened in the past. It’s a ignorant and dangerous way of thinking to put the sins of someone from the past onto someone living today. Its a slippery slope, there are countless things we could blame on somebody with that logic.
