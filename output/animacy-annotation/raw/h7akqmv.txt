thanks for sharing.

i wish we would see more of this. seamlessly blending old and new architecture. 

in a perfect world we would have all buildings being built surrounding the ruins and following their architecture (but with modern techniques). so that people can be both aware and unaware of what's really what. but alas...

as a side note i HAET how religion made us move away from public baths because "haram". especially nowadays, it would have been  great with climate change and water shortages. people could have went to refresh and share moments without extravagant fees.

don't forget people: conquerors and invaders want you to forget your  heritage and roots because they're the ones who profit from it the most.
