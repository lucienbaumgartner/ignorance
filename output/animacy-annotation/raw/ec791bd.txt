Increase your map knowledge and flank. Flanking is pretty passive in a sense since you'll be hidden for most of the time. Your points will reflect that as well, since they will be lower than aggressive players. But it's still active since you need to move. But it's more "play smart" than "play passively".

By flanking  you can create situations in your advantage. Can do it pretty easy too with good map knowledge, if you know where to get around the common enemy paths, good sniping spots to get those unaware and juicy side shots.

Doesn't work with every vehicle as slower vehicles cant move around as much, but smart plays make you stay alive.
