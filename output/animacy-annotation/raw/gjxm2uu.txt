OK, he's selfish. **SO FUCKING WHAT?**. Absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish if that means you pay attention to your bloody feelings and don't neglect them. Communication is important and he's opened up communication. I'd like to think if you're at the stage of making and having babies then you should definitely be passed the stage of being open with your partner. This is a rather important thing for him to mention NOW for the current situation and his own mental health. 

Or did you somehow think it would be better for him to keep these thoughts to himself indefinitely? That's 
a bad idea on a magnitudinal level.

You're aren't on some fantasy realm when pregnant. You're still in reality and eating the bitterness of that fruit. Just because you're pregnant doesn't change the world's axis to you and give you listen to give zero shit about your partners issues or not wanting to be aware and ignorant. That, unfortunately, just makes you shit partner and selfish.
