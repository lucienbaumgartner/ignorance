I am so sorry this happened to you. I had a similar experience with my first OBGYN and have been scared to see another one ever since. I told her I had never had anything in there before and that I had a lot of pain trying. This was when I was young and unaware that vaginismus existed. she switched to the smaller tool and said it would be no big deal. It hurt a lot, so I kept backing away from her. I tried so hard. Ultimately she couldn't get anywhere near being able to examine me and she got very frustrated. She told me if I didn't want to let her examine me then she couldn't help me and to come back when I was ready to let her do her job. I was so embarrassed. When she left the room to let me get dressed, I stood up and almost passed out I was so stressed. When my mom and I sat down in the car I just started bawling. I never went back and am still scared to see another doctor in fear of the same or worse outcome.
