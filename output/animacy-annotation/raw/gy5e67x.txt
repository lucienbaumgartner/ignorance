I found Americans in general to be lovely, accomodating and friendly.

Even the one couple I met on a plane who turned out to be horribly racist seemed completely lovely and unaware of there own racisim (well the husband, the wife had some awareness) it was such a strange contrast.

But in general U.S people have been lovely to me in my travels there.
