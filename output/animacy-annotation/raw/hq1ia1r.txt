i- dude i have bro.. i played them back in the day too, i can confidently say games are just as enjoyable now as they were back when, i understand its different and such but you have to understand that a lot of people like modern games and that style (not saying i do) and that calling people who like modern games braindead and 8 years old (not saying you do) is kind of ignorant and hypocritical. thats all, but i agree it would be nice if they made games like they used to but you just have to get used to it i guess.
