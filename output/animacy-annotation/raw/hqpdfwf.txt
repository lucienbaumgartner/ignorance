I’ve only seen a few episodes — and as I noted previously it’s not a show I like, so I’m not about to ready my tombstone on this particular hill — but I don’t think a sound argument can be made that EiP is insulting. It’s certainly leaning on several stereotypes, but I think stereotypes can be fun/funny (not to mention true). The show creators clearly hold Paris in high regard so it’s tough to argue that these are deliberately negative, inconsiderate or unsympathetic stereotypes.  I’m from Latin America and nearly every day i hear a joke poking fun at some cliché aspect of my culture; I find that the lighthearted ones are often funny.  This of course does not absolve every joke — some are ignorant and meanspirited, and those can be hurtful to individuals and cause social harm to underrepresented groups. But I’m not sure anyone can confidently make that case about a Netflix show with an American girl earing baguettes at the jardins des Tuilieries. 

So, to answer your question: yes, I allow myself to be amused when others  take silly things too seriously.
