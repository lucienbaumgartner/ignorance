So hang on a minute. I’ve had the vaccine, but this whole thing doesn’t make sense. If most of the health organisations around the world state that everyone can transmit the virus (whether vaccinated or not), surely the unvaccinated taking daily or weekly PCR tests are generally much safer to the public than the unaware and untested vaccinated people, right? What do you guys reckon?
