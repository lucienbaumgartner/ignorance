&gt; Which they fully admitted they were ignorant and wrong about and made an episode in opposition to the first as an apology.

First off I do not believe they ever said they were ignorant or wrong. They made an episode about manbearpig being real **12 years later**, but Stone and Parker did not personally say anything.

&gt; I think it's an incredibly nuanced point and you shouldn't base your stance on it off a comedy movie made entirely of puppets.

Which is it? Is it incredibly nuanced or should I go easy on it because it has puppets? You're arguing out of both sides of your mouth.

At the same time they were denying global warming (well two years before that), they made a movie about the War on Terror. Do you think the guys who deny global warming are going to have a nuanced take on foreign policy?
