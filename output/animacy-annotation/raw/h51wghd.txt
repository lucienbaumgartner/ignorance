To steal a phrase from TRP, if you want to know how to catch a fish, ask a fisherman.

The opposite sex is usually solipsistic and ignorant of what the other wants out of a relationship. We give advice that will make the relationship good for *us* but might not necessarily serve the other party's interests. This isn't always done out of malice but just pure short sightedness and ignorance of the other perspective.

The best advice comes from people who have accomplished what you want to accomplish. For women that means getting advice from successful women, and likewise for men.
