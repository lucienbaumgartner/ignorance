&gt;the old and New Testament are a piñata of “How can we blame women for being inherently less and wicked ?” 

The entire first chapter of Luke is spent with men silent/silenced while women literally sing about the glory of God and how God with toss the mighty and proud from their thrones and uplift the poor and down trodden. The first people to witness the resurrection were women. A large amount of Jesus’s ministry was done by and funded through women. The primary Roman Christian communities were women and slaves for centuries. 

As for the Old Testament 

Rachel is clever enough to steal Laban’s gods 
Tamar tricks and then humbles Judah 
Deborah the Woman of the Torches is a Judge who leads armies.
Jericho doesn’t fall without Rahab, who not only is a woman, a foreigner, but also a whore.
Tziporah defends Moses when God tries to kill him. 
Miriam is a leader among her people. 
Ruth and Naomi are foundational in their People’s faith. 

In short, your interpretation is both ignorant and antisemitic and this overshadows any merit your criticisms might possess
