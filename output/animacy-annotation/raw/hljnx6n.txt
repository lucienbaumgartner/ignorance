It was frustrating seeing non-WashU people brigade social media during the 9/11 incident, because they were so disconnected and unaware of the reality, and added to the discussion in ways that were of zero or negative value. In light of that, I think it's acceptable that nothing is said at all, WashU admin has nothing to do with Rittenhouse or Wisconsin, and will likely add nothing of value by putting out a statement to an already polarized topic.
