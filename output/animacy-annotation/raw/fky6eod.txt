I just wanna see someone point out the weird and blatantly cynical rewrites of Renfri and Yennnefer to make them more feminist, ruining the stronger original feminist message of each character in the process.

With Renfri, the point was anyone, including a rape victim can be an irredeemable piece of shit even if it's not their fault they are like that, but then she becomes a forced sympathetic character and sexual conquest.

With Yennnefer, they took the tragedy of the fact magic made it possible for a hunchback to be beautiful but it meant she was born sterile, to making a conscious decision and then whining about it in a very unaware and obnoxious manner.

Still enjoyed the show but as a silly nonsensical fantasy romp more than anything dark or compelling like the books and games.
