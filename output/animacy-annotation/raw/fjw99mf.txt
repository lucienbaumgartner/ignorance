All I feel towards them is pure hatred and anger. That’s all. I hate the fact that I feel this but I just can’t just help it. Whenever I’m around them, I ALWAy feel negative and anger. So, I think cutting contact with them will allow me to focus on myself and love myself even more because in the kind of house I live in, I’m constantly emotionally neglected every single day while waiting for my parents to see that I’m ‘depressed’ but they are so close minded and ignorant that they can’t see it. For the past 5 years, they haven’t changed plus whenever I talked the things they did to me, they always put the blame on me instead of taking responsibility. So yeah, I think cutting contact is the best option
