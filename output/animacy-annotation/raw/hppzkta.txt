So big box stores that don't have the same footprint issues that small retailers do?

If a big box has to expand their footprint to have space for games in glass display cases, or Plexi sealed cases, they increase the departmental footprint during the next reset.  It doesn't cost them anything but space in another department.

If a small boutique retailer like GameStop has to do the same, they have to increase their overall store size for all of their nearly 5000 stores which means a considerable increase in their lease expenses.  That's to say nothing of the fact that each retailer you listed has dedicated on site loss prevention staff which GS does not.

If you think BB, Walmart, or Target are at all comparable to GS, you've lost the plot. Of note, I also worked in the electronics department of Target.

But hey, tell me more about how pompous and unaware of these things I am.  You definitely understand how these retailers compare and contrast.
