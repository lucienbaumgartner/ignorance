Back in the 70s my country had a wee bit of troubble in Uslter. A group known as the IRA were fighting for a fully united independant Ireland. They killed a lot of civilians so one day 1 Para (British Army) decide to get a bit of pay back and make the Irish pay. The event is known as Bloody Sunday and on that Sunday Eve the IRA had their biggest recruitment ever more than they had in 1916 following the leaders execution. More than they had in 1920s after they beat the British Empire. This led to more death.
