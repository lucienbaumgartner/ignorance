Whether you believe it or not, I have read up on several different viewpoints. So please don't decide that I have no clue, and that I'd deliberately do something to harm my cat or dogs. I didn't plan on giving ONLY dog food out, I did make sure to have dry and wet cat food, as well as treat cat food, to provide him with a varied diet. I figured that since he prefers different textures and tastes, that he'd be happy with a portion of dog food for him (so he would hopefully not steal as much from the dogs), as well as a regular portion of dry cat food. Whether you feel that's a good idea or not, don't assume that I'd ever do anything that I felt would go against the wellbeing of my critters. Or that I'm ignorant and unaware of the dietary needs of cats and dogs.
