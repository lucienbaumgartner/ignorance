Weird. I live in Mexico, and I'm fairly white*, but I hardly ever get sunburnt. I used to play volleyball outside in 35Â°C heat, no shade, just sun, 2 hours a day, five days a week, and I never got sunburnt, just tan. (back then I didn't wear sunscreen cause I was young and naive and ignorant of the dangerous sunlight) 

*I don't know enough about American politics seeing as race is a bit blurry when it comes to Mexico, but I meant "fairly white" as in, not paper white, but probably nowhere near dark enough to count as brown either 
(edit: should maybe mention my dad is very white (turns RED in the sun) and my mom is right in the middle between very light brown and the darker shades of white (she doesn't burn either) )
