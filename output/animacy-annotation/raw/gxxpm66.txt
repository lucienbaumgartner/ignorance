True, my wording was slightly off. I should have said "my heavy use of MDMA certainly did me no favours". 

Any drug is merely a substance, therefore cannot be held responsible for any harm that may result from its use.

Thank you for bringing me to task for this regrettable oversight.

Please accept my sincere apologies for slandering MDMA in this despicable way. As you rightly point out, it surely does countless people incalculable favours. 

I also much appreciate your diligence in hunting down my two-month-old comment to put matters right.

I agree that education is the way to go. I was totally naive and unaware of the risks of ecstasy overuse.

The only drug education I recall receiving, back in my school days, was of the "Drugs Are Bad. Just Say no" variety. The only things I'd heard about ecstasy were media reports of people suddenly dropping dead after taking it.

Of course, when I first tried ecstasy and felt amazing, I disregarded everything I'd previously heard. 

If I'd been provided with a more informative, balanced explanation, no doubt I could have avoided such an unfortunate experience.
