Well, absent of documented consent instructing otherwise, being unconscious and unaware of your own existence *does* give your next of kin the option to intentionally remove you from the devices that are sustaining your life. But that's not really the issue here. 

When abortion occurs, the fetus is unaware of its own existence, and at no point prior has it ever been aware of its own existence. It is not yet sentient, so I don't see how eliminating it's ability to eventually develop sentience before it ever occurs is fundamentally different than preventing the sentience from occurring by not having a child or using contraception.
