My boyfriend’s stepmom has RA. She has been getting delays on this medicine and it’s heartbreaking. I feel so helpless and I want to make everything better for her and I wish people could stop to think about how it’s affecting others. People wear masks and gloves because they think they’re helping the world around them but when they panic and stock this medicine, it hurts the people with compromised immune systems and are severely at risk for COVID-19. People are sadly so panicked and ignorant that they can’t think for the people who are really going to suffer form this.
