This is so spectacularly dumb, I'm legitimately surprised to find out that this is literally even an opinion that exists.

It is most definitely not even remotely a disputed or uncertain fact that the modern US military is the most powerful military in the planet's history. There's certainly arguments to be made about just how large the gap is to the next strongest, and what the ranking after #1 is, but to suggest that there is "no way to know" that is breathtakingly naive and ignorant of reality, lmao.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised to find people completely disconnected from reality on a UFO subreddit, rofl
