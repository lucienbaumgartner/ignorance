I weep for Hindu religion that it has someone as arrogant and foolish like you to 'defend' the religion. I weep from the bottom of my heart.

Let me get something straight:

1. I talked facts about how Hindu term came into being when Arabs called those who live beyond Sindhu as Hindu because they called Sindhu Al-Hind. and somehow you managed to join it to babur. I don't understand how dense you must be? can't you fucking google 'origins of the name Hindu'?  are you so arrogant and ignorant that you chose not to search for facts?

2. &gt;So by your first logic that in any country its majority community is never under any threat, so I want to ask you about some countries I hope you answer me about countries like Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Israel etc but if you can't don't worry i will understand it completely

you are a total moron because I said no religion has thread IN INDIA. I suppose that you have trouble reading

so let me get this straight

1. you don't research things, you just assume things based on your half baked knowledge and based on the shit you read on poop India and Swarajya magazine
2. you can't read english.
3. you don't know the origin of the name Hindu.

I weep for the religion which has an absolute moron like you to 'defend' it. I am sure that if you are the last person to 'defend' Hindu religion then the hindu religion will fucking DIE.
