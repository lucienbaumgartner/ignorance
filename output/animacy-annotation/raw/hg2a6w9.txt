This same exact post gets made every couple hours. Nobody, or hardly anybody, is proud of being obese and unaware that it’s unhealthy. Nobody is harder on obese people or shaming than more than obese people themselves. It’s completely tone deaf to pretend unsolicited comments and judgement have any positive value. The people who advocate for this type of treatment and communication come across least like to have the tact, empathy, and persuasion to engage in the type of productive conversation that might motivate a loved one to make some healthy changes.

You’re completely misinterpreting and strawmanning the body positivity movement with an argument that gets posted here ad nauseam.
