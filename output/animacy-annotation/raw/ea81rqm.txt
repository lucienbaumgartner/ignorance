If you are unaware and interested, there is a high end horse spawn north of st denis that can spawn all three arabians as well as other sought after horses like the missori and the turkoman. Just search youtube for a video on where to go and how to reload the save file until you find the horse youâ€™re looking for. 
Also if you do not know the difference between the 3 arabians, they all have the same speed stats but the rose grey has the highest health and stamina followed by the black, leaving the white as the lowest. 
Good luck.
