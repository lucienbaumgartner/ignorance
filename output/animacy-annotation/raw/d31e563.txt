Morality and ethics is a hard thing to pin down. Really, in order for something to be evil, you pretty much have to know what you are doing is wrong. Or at least be able to recognize the consequences of what you are doing as being wrong. To an ork, it would be immoral NOT to fight. You would be doing your enemy a disservice. They are completely unaware, and unable to comprehend, that other races don't see war in the same positive light nor do they see the consequences of war as being anything but fantastic for all concerned.
