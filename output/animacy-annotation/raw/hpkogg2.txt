When you keep on insisting I think before I comment,, it just makes you look ignorant and defensive.

Ovechkin scores the majority of his goals in a few set ways. Gretzky scores every way possible.

Its far more exciting and impressive to see gretzky deke and outwait defenders and goalies at point blank range than to watch ovi one time it at the ovi spot time and time again.
