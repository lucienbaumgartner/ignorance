I do get that as well, there were designated mista fights, or bucciarati fights, that’s something I love about JoJo, is that they pin specific opponents against each other with unique abilities to make the most of every stand shown. Hell, sticky fingers vs. oasis was great, and things like the Grateful Dead limit who is able to fight, so that it isn’t a constant 5/6 v 1, by disabling part of the protagonist group, or keeping them unaware and uninvolved. Part 4 did the same stuff though, but in a different way. Even the baby was used to win a fight, as seen in the most dramatic game of rock paper scissors ever. Koichi had some defining main fights, and it seemed that in each one his stand evolved, in response to what new ability was needed. I don’t mind that many of the fights in part 4 only end in semi-stalemates, like with harvest, where Shigechi lost his motive, and learned a lesson, or with non-death, like Hazamada, and others. Each fight still makes for a great experience, and in part 4, each character has great personalities that you get to see more than just something like Ghiaccio, “I am mad”, not to say that all characters in part 5 are that bland, but the fact that almost every single one died made it hard to see what they were like, or develop them.
