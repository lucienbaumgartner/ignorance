&gt;Iâ€™m adding in this nuance in agreement that Baldwin is probably the least responsible person on that set for the accident, 

I agree he is certainly not the most responsible person. The armorer has serious questions to answer there.

However, as I understand it, Baldwin is (a) producer of this movie. I realize sometimes there are big names listed as producer who just throw money at it- or a pool of many producers- and I don't know how much actual"producing" Baldwin was doing, but he may be a controlling producer. 

If a bunch of rumors and conjecture are true- then Baldwin may have a large amount of responsibility for hiring and using a non union armorer who (possibly) turned out to be grossly negligent and unaware of basic safety. Granted- that's not responsibility as the actor holding/ firing the gun on set. But still may have been Baldwin's responsibility as producer.

Guess we will find out more as public available facts become clearer
