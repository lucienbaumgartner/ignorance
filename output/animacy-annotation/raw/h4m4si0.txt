The General paused. Well that hadn't gone as planned. He had sent a platoon of his best 10 knights into rid himself of these pesky orcs. He had the steel-wrapped warriors, honestly the best of their generation, on their plate-maille barded destriers ride at full charge at the orc village. Their armour and swords the finest that money could buy, their experience had been bought in blood and their courage was priceless. But that had been before the smiling old orc had stepped out behind the purple tree. A few words whispered and the tree began to spark like it had been hit by lightning, then the lightning arced forward and his men and their horses fell. The General had never seen anything like it. The men were gone, their armour charred and black, their horses lifeless and from out of the village tents came a chant: Ungumrt! Ungumrt! Ungumrt! The old, toothless orc smiled again as he walked forward, unarmed and yet deadly. Small and frail and yet powerful. The chanting continued and as the small orc continued slowly forward, hobbling towards the General, the orcs of the village started congregating on ridge overlooking the pair. The chanting continued until the old orc reached the mounted commander and raised a single, gnarled finger. "They were good men." The general snarled at him, like a cornered dog. "They are better now. Less killing doing now." replied the happy orc. "You go now, there is mourning to be done in your tent. We will let your dead take with you." The General stared with hatred. The chanting had started again. "You will regret this!" he spat angrily. The old orc smiled again. "You welcome in our village. Bring more clanky men. Ungumrt make more better men for you." The general pulled his horse away in a curse. And the Orc smiled. In the village, a group of confused orcs stumbled from the tent behind the Ungumrt tree. 10 of them in total, they stood naked and unaware of who or what they were. The 10 of them blinked in the bright daylight and looked around dazed. "What happened?" they asked. The old orc beamed at them. "You better men now."
