I’m so sorry you felt insulted by me sharing my experience with my body and the fashion industry...🙄

It’s not a “backhanded compliment”, it’s a statement of a fact. Women under a DD can participate in trends that require going braless. Women like me cannot. I look like I’ve breastfed three kids when I go braless, and I’m only 19. It’s you who is being ignorant, you are clearly completely unaware and unwilling to accept the experience of anyone who isn’t you and take anyone daring to share their experience as a personal attack. 

I also don’t get angered if a shop sells camis. But acknowledged that women with large busts are excluding in the fashion industry really doesn’t take that much effort.
