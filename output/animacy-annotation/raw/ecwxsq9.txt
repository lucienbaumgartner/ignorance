&gt;Says don't pull heritage card

&gt;Pulls heritage card.

You claimed I had never met a native person in my life, you were being fucking ignorant.

 "Have you ever met a white person or been off the reservation in your life? Because it seems like you have no fucking clue what the rest of Canada, what real cities and real society is like?" (See how dumb and ignorant that sounds?)

Did you notice that the person I originally replied to was saying that the **reservation system was a "carrot and stick" approach to abandon their culture**? And then I actually **disagreed** with that?

I'm not saying the reservation system should be abandoned, I am saying that the reservation system is the only way that **will** work. The only way you can keep a culture alive when it is incompatible with "modern society" is to keep it out of "modern society". Modern society = functional government. Function goverment = collecting tax from **all** citizens, and distributing services to **all** citizens. That is not the reservation system, thus, it has to be kept separate and distinct. 

But what I'm **also** saying is that I don't see a ton of historical examples where **separating people by race is good**. Do you have any? There are *tons* of examples where creating two classes of citizens has resulted in the most horrible things humanity has ever done, but not the other way around. I don't have a solution - but you will not convince me that treating someone differently because of their race is the way *forward*. ***That is fucking racism***.
