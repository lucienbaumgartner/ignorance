Okay let me ask you this, what actual problem would this fix? People complain about spawn peeking and rushing, but it is almost entirely low skill players getting caught for being unaware and careless. Most of what this would do is prevent smart rotates and it wouldn't help for people taking 1 step out a door and shooting you. If you are trying to rotate using outside it is going to take a couple seconds usually and they will have time to look around and find your position which makes your rotate useless. If you take one step out a door and shoot they won't have time to figure out where you are exactly. This doesn't actually help anything and just ruins so interesting rotates and things like that.
