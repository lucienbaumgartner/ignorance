I didn't even mention the fanbase once in my replies to you. How do any of my comments to you show that I am "smug, unaware, and arrogant". Of course, the Packers are going to have a group that thinks that the team is best and always will be. Every team has those fans. Like last year when the Vikings were 5-0 and fans were comparing them to the 85 Bears... We all saw how that ended.
