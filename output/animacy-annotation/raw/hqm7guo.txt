What he’s saying = suffer now and later when you look back at your memories you have to scrape the barrel for good ones. As if the rare good memories (maybe one from a merrier time in life full of blissful ignorance) outweigh the outnumbering bad ones.

I seriously don’t understand people who view life as something happy and joyful. Life is inherent suffering and when one views it’s in a good light ones perception is extremely ignorant and delusional.

At the end of the day it’s no use trying to change such a persons illusory perception of life because they will forever continue scraping the barrel for optimistic arguments because they prefer living in a comfortable fantasy.
