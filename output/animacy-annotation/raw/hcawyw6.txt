I can't claim to know you personally, but for sure the last one is true. And as I was reading some of your previous posts, I noticed how you basically quoted Katie in a comment, saying "People love suffering". The way you write is an indication this goes for you as well. You seem to be simalteneously aware and unaware, and choosing misery. 

Not to say I am any better, otherwise I would have come a longer way.
