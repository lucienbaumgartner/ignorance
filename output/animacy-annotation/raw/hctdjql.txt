Oh, I absolutely hated this film.

As someone who works in healthcare with older adults, it went above and beyond my suspension of disbelief. Yes, this sort of shit surely happens, ON A MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller scale, but this film takes the idea of it to such an illogical extreme.

How in the hell does she control the life rights of some many adults simultaneously? I can see maybe one or two, but at a certain point she’s literally in control of dozens. Nobody sees a problem with this, and although theres this one judge who seems stupid and ignorant of the issue at hand, and clearly biased (refusing to take a witness because of his personal relationship to them???) Or, better yet, move the case up to a higher court with a different judge. It boggles the mind how stupid it all is.

It wouldn’t be a problem, but the film doesn’t really try to explain how stupid and illegal this all is. There’s no investigation, and the old “The world is corrupt as shit and you’re not seeing the big picture” is complete BS. There’s reason to believe that tons of people complain d about what she was doing, but NO ONE ever saw a problem?

Like, come on. “It’s not supposed to be realistic” isn’t an excuse because it plays itself as being realistic.

Plus, the main protagonist is full of shit and is an abhorrent person. I literally had no sympathy for her, and the film, I guess, tries to use the fact that she’s a lesbian to be her main reason you should root for her? Well, I just saw her as a normal person that happens to be completely unlikable.

The fact that she literally makes a business out of it in the end is just laughable. The fact that the villain teams up with her despite everything is so fucking stupid. I fucking applauded when she got shot at the end of the film. Best part of the damn movie.
