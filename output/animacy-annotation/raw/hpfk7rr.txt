" The greatest achievement of the devil is that he made believe of his non existence ". Bible doesn't call him the great deceiver for nothing... The rituals that you see nowadays are his disciples worshipping him in plain sight(cult) and peoples are blind to it because they don't recognize the symbolism behind it thinking that it doesn't mean nothing.

Statue of liberty in NYC is a good example of how ignorant and blind peoples are nowadays and this is barely the tip of the iceberg
