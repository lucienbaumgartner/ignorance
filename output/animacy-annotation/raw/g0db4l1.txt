&gt; YOU Recommended it. Then praise the song of "AUTO"! 

Sorry that you can't read.

I told him to take it off auto:  you are not understanding that, SakkoShit?

&gt; And if it's 11 then why did you defend AUTO for the neighbors so vehemently.

Dude, I did not defend auto, or his neighbors, and I am sorry you are losing it.  "Professor".

&gt;Even then... if only ONE other router is on channel 11 and it's throwing a bunch of garbage on the channel then literally ANY other channel is a better option.

So channel 10 is better?  Channel 9?  For fuck's sake, what do you "teach"?  Anime studies?

&gt;Proof please? I never brought this up, and neither did you originally

The proof is what you just said that "any other channel is better".  That's so stupid and ignorant that it is sad.

&gt; I've seen ISP routers AUTO choose channels like 8 and 10 before. Poisoning both 6 and 11.

Correct.  

#So what is your solution?

If OP goes on 11, the "auto" routers should move to other channels.  

&gt;GET MORE INFORMATION.

But you didn't.  You just made your "consumer routers are shit" comment, and still have NOT made one practical suggestion.

I notice you SHUT THE FUCK UP about your "professorship':  you're not.  At best your a junior, and most likely a contract worker.

&gt;MAKE SURE THAT A ROUTER UPGRADE WILL LITERALLY FIX IT BEFORE TELLING THEM TO SPEND MONEY.

If you don't think upgrading to a router with gig LAN ports versus 10/100 ports will make a difference with a 500/50 connection, then you are even more stupider than I thought.

And money?  $75?  For a consumer router?  

#again, what do you suggest?  

#Cat7 cables for the Airport Express?

#you are literally stupid enough and ignorant enough to think that would help.
