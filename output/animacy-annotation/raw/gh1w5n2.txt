Hell no. Just as a real adult now (31) I realize I things are expensive. Car maintenance, couches lol, and many other things. Me and my wife becoming first time homeowners earlier this year and upkeeping a home is expensive. 
My point about the couch was it isn't too pricey per se. Before I bought my couches I had no clue that on average that run at least $600 new for one that seats more than 2ppl. Just being new and unaware of how costly they can be.
