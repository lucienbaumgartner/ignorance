Dude, I minored in Philosophy (Logic is philosophy) and graduated with Honors. I know contradictions. 

No you didn’t. I’ve never heard such bullshit in my life. You don’t know contradictions. You’re about as brain dead as a zombie. Don’t bullshit me and say you minored in Philosophy. And no, logic ≠ philosophy. There’s something called the Philosophy of Logic, but logic itself isn’t philosophy. Try again

&gt;You are so incredibly stupid and ignorant that I cant believe Im talking to anyone above the age of 13 or possibly a highschool drop out

You’re still using this shitty insult if I’m a dropout or incredibly young? Do you even read the shit you write? Nothing you’ve said is coherent, correct or non-contradictory. And no, you have to bullshit again by saying “I minored in Philosophy”. Nobody with as little intelligence as you is going to minor in Philosophy. 

&gt;There hasnt been a single contradiction. Just your inability to understand what has been said

No, again, I’m perfectly capable of reading all the bullshit you wrote, and here’s a list of all your contradictions. 

&gt;The game sold over 5 million in June

&gt;The game sold over 4 million in June

&gt;The game sold over 4 million but less than 5 million in June

&gt;I don’t use Gamstat figures

&gt;The game has sold over 5 million by the end of June, a flat out fact

-

&gt;I didn’t say that sold through is direct to consumer sales. Here’s a list of three articles that prove me wrong

&gt;Sold through = Sold to consumers

-

&gt;NPD are a reliable source that track digital sales and POS Sales

&gt;Lmao, let me just send a link that completely invalidates my entire argument and let me not do any research into the fact that NPD track consumer trends

-

&gt;I minored in Philosophy and understand logic and I don’t contradict myself

&gt;Let me contradict myself multiple times throughout the ordeal
