I don't think anyone cares. We know that the typical age to graduate law school is mid 20s. Some of us took longer routes. I'm on the opposite side of this, the mid/seniors are often younger than me. Doesn't seem to matter. Just do the work.

If anything, your comment that it "felt like an old men's club..." seems a tad ageist and condescending. We can't help being old and ignorant of your ticky tocky world.
