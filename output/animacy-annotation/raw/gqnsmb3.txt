I have heard this several time but haven't played EO since the insurance system was in placed.  Can you elaborate why the EO system is terrible (ISK for ISK)?  I am truly curious and ignorant of this, and not defending it in any way.    


Is it because it's easy to scam?  Doesn't truly cover losses?  Still destroy the economy?  Or something else entirely?
