I do believe it is a chronic illness that is treatable for some people but not necessarily curable for everyone.

And I'm happy that we have a place to post even the ignorant and pessimistic posts because that is our truth.   And it is feels good to know we aren't alone.   And good people like yourself can respond with positive encouragement, education, and suggestions for getting help.
