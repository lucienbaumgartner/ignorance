The practice of lying to ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF AGE during interrogations must by legislated into extinction, or ruled to be unconstitutional by the courts. I have seen a number of adults give false confessions after being lied to during interrogations. 

Some years ago Great Britain banned the practice of lying to suspects during interrogations, and the police in that company complained just like this sheriff is. But the result is that Great Britain actually saw a drastic decrease in false confession cases, and actually saw a greater conviction rate in murder cases. 

So the evidence Great Britain strongly suggests that this sheriff and the other cops complaining about this new law are not misinformed, they are absolutely wrong and ignorant of the facts.
