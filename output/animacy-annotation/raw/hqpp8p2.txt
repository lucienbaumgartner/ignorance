&gt;Fine, let's use double plus ungood, but, since it's easier to say wrong, so I'll stick with that.

Just saving this for the syntactical fucktangle you vomited into the conversation. 

&gt;I say work towards a solution. You say that I'm misguided, ignorant and simplistic, then go on to accuse me of being a libertarian.

You don't have to self-identify as a libertarian to mindlessly parrot their talking points and ideology. The whole idea of "well if *you* have a problem then *you* should deal with it" only works for small, easy problems without a bunch of stakeholders. The rest of us are dealing with problems on the scale of out planet or society, so we need to solve them collectively. Opting out just makes you a selfish cunt, better known as a libertarian. 

"Wages are low because people take shitty jobs" is a deeply stupid thing to say, but the fact that you said it implies that the path to explain to you why it's wrong starts so far back that you're not worth the time to educate. Mocking you, however, is much more rewarding.
