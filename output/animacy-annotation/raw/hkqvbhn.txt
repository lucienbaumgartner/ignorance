Because the US brainwashes young people into believing that “pulling themselves up by their bootstraps” and just accepting all kinds of abuse is the only way to succeed in life, and if you complain about it, you’re a snowflake who doesn’t deserve to survive. This sort of thing is considered normal by many people. It takes a lot to get rid of that logic when it’s been pounded into you since birth, and not everybody has the courage to stand up for themselves to begin with, especially if they’ve already dealt with abuse in their own homes. Plus some just flat out cannot find a better job and have no choice but to stay at their jobs if they want to keep paying their bills, and we all know how easy it is for an employer to get off scot-free and retaliate if there’s no paper trail. Corporations love to keep their workers as afraid and unaware of their rights as possible.
