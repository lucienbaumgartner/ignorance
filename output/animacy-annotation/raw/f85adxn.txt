&gt; How do you measure a genocide? 

Is that not what you are trying to achieve by comparing the Holocaust to other genocides? One does not negate the importance of another - so no genocide should be downplayed.


And that's exactly the problem here. It is offensive and ignorant that Hallam suggests that all genocides are comparable and intentionally or not comes across as downplaying the Holocaust.


Not only that but the whole point he makes that "German culture is traumatized" in context of the Holocaust just echoes far right nationalist talking points.
