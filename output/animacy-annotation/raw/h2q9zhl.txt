I think she probably values the experience of her new work environment over her current one and is probably willing to take a pay/benefits cut. I am surprised that she didn't know her salary upon accepting the job but I've definitely had HR people pressure me to consider an offer without having the paperwork and full benefits in front of me. It can be awkward to navigate, especially when you're younger and unaware of proper protocol.
