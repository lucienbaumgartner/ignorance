And for that matter, what about black artists who were exploited by other blacks in the mainstream industry? For example, would this "double negative logic" therefore mean that it's OK to sample TLC's tracks all we want, because they got massively burned by Pebbles, Babyface, and LA Reid collectively? Or how about the many Motown artists who got yanked around during their time with Berry Gordy?

Oh, and can we sample black artists who were under the aegis of black-owned music companies that treated them decently, made sure they got paid (and paid correctly) and publicized, and brought them out onto the world stage? How about black artists who own their own production houses, like Juan Atkins? Is that OK?

What if I want to cut up Wilson Pickett's "Land of 1000 Dances" or "Mustang Sally"? Since these were cut in Muscle Shoals with white backup musicians (and, for that matter, some of the best and most prolific in R&amp;B, which further mangles OM's arguments here), would I have to vocal-eliminate Wilson Pickett and only use the backing tracks? Would that then be "fair" to Wilson Pickett? Or how would I deal with something on Stax, where the house band (one of the most legendary in R&amp;B and Soul) was pretty much a 50/50 split, racially, between black and white? Can I keep Booker T. and Duck Dunn's parts, but remove the rest of the players?

These are yet more examples of holes in OM's logic that are big enough to fly an Airbus A380 through. Basically, it makes _no_ sense, ultimately. I agree; this is _pretending_ to care, in a way that is so hamfisted and ignorant that it actually has the potential to make race relations _worse!_ The whole notion that he's "helping" here is incredibly poorly thought-out.
