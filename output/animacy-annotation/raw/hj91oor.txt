Kids are fucking stupid.  Don't spend any of your energy worrying about their bullshit opinions.  They can't know better yet, and you should feel free to tell them that they don't get it because they're too young and ignorant.

That usually sets kids like that off like fireworks.  Walk away from the fire and let them do the stressing.

Enjoy your Animal Crossing.
