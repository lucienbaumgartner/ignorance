Dommes and only fans model are two different things just checking where your information of Dommes come from xause it sounds more like porn than reality. And I say that as someone who has a fansly so while I understand there is a certain way Dommes must appear for popular consumption , thats not realistic and I think checkong with real Dommes on places like r/bdsmadvice would give you a more realistic feeling of what that entails.

The part where "I" would get hundreds ls men is so insulting and ignorant that it's beyond misoginistic if you're assumong that having a vagina is what would give me that edge. It's incel talk and if that's the "philosophy" youre going along with I have been wasting to giving rhe benefit of the doubt.

Not that I'm goinf to talk about my life or past but it's actually so personally insulting that you'd reduce a woman to someone who can get hundreds of people to want her just because, it's incorrect and problematically ignorant to say and that I think is where we end this.

In my experience as a Domme, your convoluted ideas about domination and value are wrong.

You can insist on having them because it's what you believe but I'm not quite sure why one would defend willful ignorance in the fact of actual experience.
