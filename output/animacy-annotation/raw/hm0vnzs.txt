That's harsh and a nasty reality check, man. I'm sorry for your loss. 
If this makes you decide not to ride again, it would be totally understandable. If you start feeling anxiety or panic when you ride again, it's perfectly acceptable to talk to a therapist and maybe have EMDR therapy, as someone here already suggested. You should never ride in panic mode. 

However, a little of that fear is a good thing. It reminds you that you are extremely vulnerable on a bike. 
I would suggest you take safety riding classes, if you haven't already done so. Develop traffic awareness, know where you are and where everybody else is. Consider all other traffic participants to be stupid and unaware of the rules and you. Ride not according to the traffic rules, but for your own safety, as though only you know the rules. Ride defensively. Its okay to yield, even though you had the right of way. Its okay to break the speed limit for a moment if that gets you out of a dangerous situation. You're fast, you're nimble and you can stop on a dime. Use those things to your advantage and to get you out of trouble. Don't use those things to get into trouble. 

Good luck, man.
