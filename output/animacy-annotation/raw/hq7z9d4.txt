I would say a couple. I believe that the universe has a set path. Not in a religious way but just that everything has an action and reaction, and all those actions are just reactions to a different reaction, and so on so forth until you get to the big bang. I also believe that if you or anyone else is being oppressed, it is your and everyone's responsibility to fight to change so. Also, knowledge is power. You should always strive to know the truth, even if it hurts. I hate how ignorant and content people can be. That about sums it up besides like being kind to each other and the usual stuff.
