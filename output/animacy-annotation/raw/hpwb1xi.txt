It was unbelievably hard for us while he was gone and my Mom went from being a full-time housewife to working a grueling full-time factory job at nights and taking care of us on her own. He left in large part to protect us and couldn't contact her directly for the same reason, so she didn't know most of the time if he was alive or dead. So ton of anxiety and resentment built up on her part. 

I'm sure they both new nothing would be the same, but he worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week almost the rest of his life trying to make it up to her at least in a financial way, and she let him. Eventually they figured out the best thing for him would be to live elsewhere, but she refused to divorce him. 

It affected me in that he was back but I still never really saw him, and when I did, they were constantly fighting. When he moved out, the only time I saw him was she'd drive me every week to his work and she'd send me in and get the money he'd give her. I absolutely hated being used like that, but just seeing him for that brief time was everything to me, then I'd have to go back to the car and act like I wasn't happy to see him. 

My biggest regret is not asking my Dad more about his childhood and stuff like that. Actually it's more like deep shame, because when he was dying he wanted to tell me, he literally said he did, and I was in absolute denial that he was dying and somehow I wouldn't let him tell me because I thought if he did then I was accepting he actually was that close to death. I was a complete ignorant and selfish kid for doing that and I let him die a couple days later without telling me his story and there was nobody else alive on his side of family even get history from either. I would give anything to hear him tell me about his life, or just to hear him talk. I don't even have a recording of his voice or video, and only 2 or 3 pictures of us together, so mainly just memories in my head.
