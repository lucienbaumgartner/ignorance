There's no truth to what you're saying it all. You're calling Demi mentally ill because of their gender, pretty hateful and ignorant of you.

Theyre not trying to erase women, just like theyre not trying to erase men. Short hair, not a housewife, dress edgy, lol, does that mean you think butch lesbians are also erasing women? You know, the women who LOVE women? Get a clue. 

As a woman, the only thing that insults me is your awful, hateful comments. I suggest you research gender and identity so you actually get an understanding on all of this.
