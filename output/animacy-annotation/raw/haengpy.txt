Well if he scored on that Schwarber hit instead of stopping at 3rd, game would've ended in the 9th? Could he have scored? Well maybe if he was running on contact as there were 2 outs!!!! 

Losing is one thing but to lose making mistakes like that, makes the team look unprepared and unaware of situational baseball.
