The way TJMaxx preys on the ignorant and shoppaholics disgusts me. Most people understand how the card works. They are responsible. They pick one day to spend $400, they open the card for the discount, get the 10% and then close their card. Only to repeat it the following year. 

Then there's the people who are truly ignorant and clueless. They don't understand that attempting to open a card hurts their credit score temporarily. They rack up a bunch of debt for gifts with absolutely no intention of paying off the credit card.

It's truly disgusting. 

If a customer says no, and you keep begging them to open a card, they're doing it against their will. The same example can be applied to rape. If your partner asks you for sex, you say no because you're not in the mood, and they continue to pester you for sex until you cave out of guilt and finally say yes. This is not consent. This is rape.
