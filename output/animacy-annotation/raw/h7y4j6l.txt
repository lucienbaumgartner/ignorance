Not a child a soldier and not bad but irresponsible reckless and uncaring. Manipulative even. 

Dumbledore is the person responsible for Harry's placement at the Dursleys and the person responsible for Harry's utter ignorance and frankly naive and sheltered upbringing. 

Even if Dumbledore taught Harry how to defend himself from an early age it still wouldn't make him an equal to a Dark Lord it would on the other hand increase his chances at surviving. 

Harry being aware of the fact that not only a Dark Lord but his followers are after him. That because of his status as Savior he also has groupies and people that would do anything to get close to him and thus needs at least needs a modicum of awareness.

Harry's never going to be "just Harry" and he is unprepared for everything, I mean honestly he didn't even know the Dark Lord was a Parselmouth, he didn't know the Dark Lord's name, he didn't know his parents names, he didn't know what his parents looked like, he didn't know this and that and it's mind-boggling. 

Harry's woefully unprepared politically. Harry's unprepared and ignorant of laws, customs, lordships, unaware of the dangers in the Wizarding World (cursed objects) Harry's is ignorant of the most mundane facts of the magical world. How is he supposed to defend himself when he does not know how not to offend people who are rich, influential and politically active ? 

Dumbledore is the Headmaster of the school and thus the person responsible for the faculty so the ridiculous DADA teachers parade is his responsibility too.
