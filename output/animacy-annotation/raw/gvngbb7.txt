Sure, if you are completely unaware that the Palestinians have repeatedly tried to genocide the Jews in 1948, 1967, and 1973. Or that Israel only exists because the Arabs rounded up a million Jews and forced them to move there. Including stealing massive amounts of land measuring in millions of square miles. 

The Jews have repeatedly tried to make peace, but the Palestinians violated the agreements each and every time. 

The idea that the Jews are the attackers and the Palestinians are the defenders is completely illiterate and ignorant of reality.
