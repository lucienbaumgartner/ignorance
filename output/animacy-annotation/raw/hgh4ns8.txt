Why are you mad because someone knows “acronyms and jargon” that you don’t? 

You clearly have no clue what badasses clinical pharmacists are. We are not talking about counting pills and pointing you and your fellow Dunnings and Krugers to the toothpaste aisle. These folks know all the infections, what drugs cover which, the dosages, and the appropriate schedules for them. They provide expertise that literally no one else in the hospital can. 

Your attack on this guy is as out of line as it is ignorant but go off. Reveal more of yourself. 

If you ever end up in a hospital with any infection you’ll be glad he is there and not at a CVS showing you where the incontinence pads and toothpaste are. You’re coming off like you are either super young and don’t know what you don’t know or like an unaware and insecure chode who would argue with a wall if that wall in any way offended his delicate sensitivities. 

Simply not being exposed to, knowing, or understanding something is no reason to attack those who do. Perhaps appreciate what they bring and try to learn something to fill in the gaps you’ve chosen to show us all exist in your knowledge of the subject. 

Fucking Reddit.
