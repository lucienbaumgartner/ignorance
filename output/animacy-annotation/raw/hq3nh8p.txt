No no, I see where you're coming from now. Ever since I found out reddit is ran by Winnie the Pooh minions, it's hard to trust anything on this site. And if they won't let you post a specific question it's more proof to me that they want to keep all users as vague, ignorant and stupid as they can.  Hope ppl sees this before it gets removed
