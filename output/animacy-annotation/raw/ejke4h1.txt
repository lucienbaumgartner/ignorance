Breitshart and their followers, like my mother,  have been sharing the "Mueller Report cost the tax payers $25 million as of September 2018" picture on Facebook.  They also don't like learning that the September 2018 cutoff date is because that's when an estimated $42-46 million in civil asset forfeiture from Manafort came into US posession (pending sale).  They are so polluted by Breibart and ignorant that even normal Republicans have forgotten that Mueller and the entire DOJ are Republicans.  The caption to that picture villainizes Democrats and "the establishment" (real Republicans).

Seriously, it's worrisome how much Breitshart is radicalizing previously tame Republicans who believed the party should follow their grandfatherly idea of Reagan.
