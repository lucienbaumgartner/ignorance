Yeah. You know what they say, birds of a feather... 

It was clear that Nichol's cagy disposition and general weirdness was because she was scrambling to hide the fact that she was pressurizing Chris to fast-track the separation process, she knew not wanting to have kids coupled with the affair doesn't paint her in the best of lights, she was doing everything in her power to deflect while pretentiously being insightful.

Honestly she seems more ignorant and arrogant to boot rather than outright evil. The way she spoke of her friend with the dead dad speaks volumes about her. She's probably as emotionally vapid as Chris. 

This case isn't tough, I feel there are no twist ending here. Chris was a passive man who didn't give vent to his emotions, he didn't communicate well enough with Shan'ann to have my semblance a mature relationship, and he ultimately had a breakdown in the worst way possible due to the pressure cooker situation. 

Kessinger is not to blame, whether she's a catalyst is also debatable, Chris's issues with Shan'ann were mounting over the years until they exploded in a tragic way. Nichol had the dubious distinction of being there when it happened. And for that, she paid with her very identity.
