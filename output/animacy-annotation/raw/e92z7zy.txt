Sometimes people leave early, it doesn't make them less of a fan like I used to think.  I used to ask people why they were leaving All Blacks games early by saying something like "youre not a real kiwi" but I realise now how rude and ignorant that is.

Sometimes people have been watching games for 20 years now, sometimes traffic, who really knows.
