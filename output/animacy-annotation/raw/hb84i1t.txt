Thank you for staying level-headed through this. 

My wife and I are pretty unsure about when we’ll have kids for the same reasons. And she’s a teacher so, she has experienced remote learning, staggered schedules, and everything in between. 

Of course normal, in-person learning is best but there’s an active pandemic to consider. 

We’re lucky to live in a state (NJ) where schools are mandated to wear masks and teachers are mandated to be vaccinated or test negative. 

But my sister lives in Iowa where mask mandates are banned and contract tracing has been stopped as well. 

Within 2 days, they had positive cases amongst students. But since there’s no contact tracing, we have no idea who got it and it’s entirely up to the parents to handle it from there. 

I wish politicians would stop playing games. It’s incredibly frustrating and ignorant that this “masks are against my freedom” narrative has continued. It’s so completely petty and overblown. 

I miss when Americans banded together through things like this but maybe I was wrong all along and it’s always been this way. 

Keep going - I know this feels like forever but this pandemic won’t last forever.
