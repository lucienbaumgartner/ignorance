[This build](https://mugenmonkey.com/darksouls3/122610) is a stealth build for invasions. Basically, with this ringset, you become nearly indistinguishable from a ghost you see walking around the world. The obscuring ring makes you appear out of thin air, the hidden body and untrue white ring make you look like a ghost, and the slumbering dragon ring makes it so you make no noise at all (and, it hides your buff auras). Very few players will realize your game until it's too late. Take some swings at thin air to make the player think you're just a ghost, then roar with the dragon stone and one shot them (you want to go to low health with the bloodlust for the Morion blade offhand effect, then enter dragon form to roar for another damage increase that can also break their shields).

Now [this](https://mugenmonkey.com/darksouls3/119271) is another stealth build, but it's geared towards non-1v1 arena play. You want to backstab unaware and low health players with Gundyr's Halberd or initiate the fight with WA, then finish them off with the Washing Pole. This build is untested, I need to see if players will see me easily due to the self damage of power within or not.
