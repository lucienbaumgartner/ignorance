That seems incredibly short sighted and ignorant of what we have achieved so far in space, what we've gained from it, and everything else yet to come.

The vast majority is not billionaires and tourism, and it's especially not its main goal. 

Much of the technology you depend upon would not be possible without decades of space exploration and innovation.

Without pushing our technological capabilities to their extreme, we will not deal with climate change or the destruction of biodiversity globally.
