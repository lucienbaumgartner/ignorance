&gt;So at first you started arguing that the numbers are wrong, then you go into the idea that redlining, population density, etc leads to crime.

I never changed the argument. The numbers are correct for the data sources used. The data sources are significantly flawed. If you still don't understand that then this conversation is over because I have provided mountains of evidence showing you exactly that.

Redlining, etc, is illustrating another nuance. Another *contributing factor* to a broad and complicated issue that you seem only able to selectively curate through a racist lense.

&gt;You act like it’s mind blowing that more African Americans are getting accused of crime, then you defend that they actually might be committing more crime by saying other factors like population density play in.

**It can be both**. Multiple things contribute to the issue. I understand that needing to read and consider a bit more than a confirmation bias is difficult, but if you want to have your opinion taken seriously you'll need to do less repeating of racist dogwhistles and more actual analysis.

&gt;It has nothing to do with racism

[It literally has a page on the Anti Defamation League.](https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/1352-1390) You responded to a general statement about police being largely unconstitutional on an institutional basis with a very specific racist dogwhistle. Either you are ignorant and unaware of the sort of messaging you are repeating, or you think others like me are too ignorant to recognize it.

&gt;They’re not dumb enough to give the data about who is doing the crime, that would be racist.

You've got the racism in this thread covered well enough. Otherwise, what is the contextual value of your response? In what possible way is the 13/50 stat even **possibly** relevant to my well-supported claim about the unlawful behavior of police in the USA?

&gt;It’s gang violence.

So you are going to point to organized crime, committing crimes, against other criminal organizations? And then amplify that to mean that all black people are criminal? You really don't have a head for nuance or critical thinking.

Imagine if I pointed out to the most criminal parts of the Mafia's past. Oh, look, those white people are *so violent* and criminal.

Or, heck, look back from the 50s-90s. What skin color was al Capone? Most Mafiosos? How many bodies were being left in the streets? Oh, right, these are issues of organied crime, in major population centers with extreme population densities. But nah, lets forget nuance. The Mafia and Al Capone are proof positive that white people are all violent.

And a few hotspots in Mexico where there is gang activity? Yeah. All the mexicans are violent too.

Well golly gee, by your criteria every race everywhere is violent. 

Are you starting to understand how insultingly pathetic your argument is?

&gt; But In The current state of society, they do commit more crime

I thougt you just said that it wasn't african american people, but established criminal organizations working in major cities?

Also, **none** of this has anything to do with my claim. I provided mountains of evidence from an objective source, the DOJ, that shows every single time an LEA in the USA has been investigated it has been found to be violating constitutional rights of citizens in regular, systemic, pattern. LEAs are statistically far more likely to be an organized criminal organization than some random black neighborhood, since there are plenty of black neighborhoods that don't have gang/crime problems, but we have yet to take a close look at an LEA and find they *actually obey the law*. 

This has been a nice racist distraction, but the point stands. Police in the USA have been found to be criminals every single time they have been examined.
