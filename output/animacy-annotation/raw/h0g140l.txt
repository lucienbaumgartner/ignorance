&gt;He was the director only. To blame the current state of the series entirely on him seems short sighted and ignorant of the system by which movies and series are made.

He came in to make a Star Wars movie and essentially wholesale plagiarized A New Hope. He had no plan, no major plot beats etc... That is called being an idiot.

The movie alt take needs to be done when there is a take. A good Superman has yet to be done, when that happens we can talk about Injustice League and all that other crap.
