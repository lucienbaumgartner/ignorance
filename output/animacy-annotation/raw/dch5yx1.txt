I'm well aware that no health coverage alone will save anyone from a catastrophic health event.  Now, of the almost 10,000 readers here, I suspect that many may be young and unaware that Obamacare does not cover a lot, and that the anecdotes provided may put a lot into perspective.  Some of us "members" may be "reawakened."   Now, correct me if I have gotten your ending points wrong, but you think that Obamacare should be dropped completely (because of the expense to the government and the fact that it is overpriced) because it just allows the R's and D's to ride things out.  In particular the D's are allowed to waste time with silly "stop Trump" activities instead of getting busy with serious party reforms.  Is that correct?  If so, I have a hard time getting my mind around this conflation of things, combined with a "necessity" of having a lot of Americans lose all health coverage (regardless of how petty the coverage may be).  I seriously do not believe it should take years to  develop a plan for health coverage.  Certainly we have plenty of guidance already.  And, how does this connect with Democratic Party reform such that it would take years to hammer out?
