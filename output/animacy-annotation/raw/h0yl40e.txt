my brothers(INTJ) wife(INFP) and i don't mix very well ... she's easily offended and calls my comments out as sexist, biggoted, etc... 

... but then she wears feminist clothing.  

....completely unaware and hypocritical. never makes eye contact or engages in conversation. 

ive got 2 INFP female neighbors who mean mug and grumpy-gus about everything... its rough man... lol!
