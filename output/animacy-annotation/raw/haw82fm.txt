&gt; Well you keep saying sanda is kung fu

Because that's a well-established fact.  It's not that I'm "saying" it, it's that it *is*.

&gt; I'll keep posting actual footage

Footage that doesn't support any of your claims, claims it should be noted, that have been shown to be both dishonest and ignorant of fact.

Also, in a humorous bit of irony, footage that shows Kung Fu being used effectively in competition.

&gt; and historical information

Where have you ever done this?  You posted *a single link* in this thread that actually *disproved* your contentions.
