You’re saying a living human being isn’t alive?  

Or are you saying that a living human being who is denied personhood isn’t currently a person?

The former is objectively false and ignorant of scientific fact.  If that is your claim you are divorced from reality.

The latter gets the same reply: no reason why every human being shouldn’t be a legal person outside of pure, unreasonable prejudice.
