I mean how obtuse do you have to be to not realize the damage you are doing? His post game comments made it even worse. He’s so unaware and stubborn. He said taking them out in the second half was “pre-meditated” and that it was so they could practice today and they deserved it bc their play was embarrassing. Sorry what exactly was embarrassing three minutes into the second half??? That logic is so fucked. He literally doubled down by saying letting the starters play would be a “double loss”. It fucking blows my mind that a grown man be so boneheaded
