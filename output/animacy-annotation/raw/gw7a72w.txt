Fuck off with that gaslighting bullshit. Nestle are evil, obviously, and some people NEED a job to survive, thanks to the monstrous capitalist system we live under. If you can only get a job at Nestle, you'll take a job at Nestle. I don't know them, but I do know that they'll be finding it very difficult to get money and feed their kids, and it's extremely arrogant and ignorant of you to pretend otherwise.

Cutting these jobs to move elsewhere is unethical, same as everything else Nestle does. They're not doing it because they're in financial trouble, they're just doing it on a whim because of Brexit. To reiterate and elucidate: you're a selfish cunt.
