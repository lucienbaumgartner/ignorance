&gt;If someone is loud during sex (ie: enjoying it with all the "oh yes" "oh fuck yes" or whatever words they choose to use) then my assumption is that it's consensual.

Totally agree.

People completely lost track of the reason why it is said that a drunk person can not consent. It doesn't mean that if you're tipsy, you can't have sex. Very honestly - people often drink in order to lower their inhibitions, and to be able to do what they're craving to do. 

It's meant to cover the case where someone is so wasted that they are apathic and unaware of what is going on, and typically, they might end up having sex with someone they didn't know before the moment they were drunk. This is a case that requires protection.

I've had several cases of hookups ringing at my door late in the evening, after having had a few drinks, and throwing themselves at me. If either of us had to feel 'raped' it was me... 

In this case, if the girl was loud and enthusiastic, it doesn't make any sense to doubt how 'consensual' it is.
