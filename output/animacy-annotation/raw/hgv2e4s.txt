Some people are rude.  I’ve had similar things happen in the past and over time because it was so frequent I started putting up a wall with even casual friends… 
  There are things I never comment on because I already know it won’t be well received and it would be a waste of my effort and thought, however I empathize with how that felt to you as I have been through almost the exact same thing as well. 
I would get excited about a really good song I heard and try to share it and I couldn’t even get anyone to listen- made me feel similarly, people always ignore my music suggestions so I just kinda stopped suggesting anything.  
  I hope your friend can learn from what she did but I doubt she’s even aware of how rude and ignorant that was.  Even if you tell her she probably won’t get it.
