There's a certain level that isn't generational in terms of caring about others, but at the same time there is that type of worldview that is common for boomers that I think comes from a mix of coming up in a rare time that the state actually did/funded things (yet they rarely recognise it that way)  and the fact that they have been the most propagandised over time.  

Plus there's a level of complacency where alot of people think history just ended after the 60s.  

But yeah I think the ones that are comfortable are just content with the status quo.  Whereas the comfortable millennials are a different type of ignorant and annoying.
