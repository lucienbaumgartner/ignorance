NTA. You are so opposite of an asshole. If I went out to a fancy tea and a 3 and 5 year old disrupted the experience by being too energetic I would be livid towards the parent for NOT giving them wiggle breaks. That is much more rude than getting up from the table more than average.

You did the absolute right thing and your mom is being completely absurd and unaware of how children work. I hope she was better with you when you were both younger.
