We would have an "American Spring" of sorts on our hands if the citizenry wasn't primarily comprised of low information voters. The establishment leaders will do everything in their power to make sure that voters remain "low information."

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."
