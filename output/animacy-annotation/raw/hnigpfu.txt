I think it depends on the situation to some extent, but I would let any "directly affected" parties know, which would include the AP's spouse or the AP if they are single and unaware that your STBX was dating or married to you. Think you should defer to a lawyer on this though. As for others,  I wouldn't recommend doing it for "revenge". If it helps, go for it. But the way I see it, doing so just prolongs the amount of time the cheater is in your life which doesn't help with healing at all. Not to mention it is never a good idea to give a bad person some deluded reason to hate you, especially if you want them out of your life.
