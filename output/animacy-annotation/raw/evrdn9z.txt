ALL insurance companies are for profit companies.  Their sole business model is to make money from everyone.  Insurance is pretty much a scam that prays on peace of mind.  It's also a socialized program because it also is effectively group pay in to pay out to the bottom end of the group (assuming the insurance company just doesn't deny and drop the customer).  I'm amazed that no one complains about socialism when it comes to insurance.  That's probably because most of the money just goes to the rich shareholders, so it's also theft...that we all buy into.  How much theft?  Oh...about $7,000,000,000...for just 8 companies, out of the insurance pool and into the pockets of investors.  Neat.

GOOD insurance will be federally run and non-profit.  It will perform JUST the task it needs to perform, no more, no less.  Insurance should be a safety net for the unlucky, unfortunate, and ignorant that find themselves in need.  We all pay in.  No one profits.  Everyone is given a chance at a long, healthy life with safety.  This is the ideal form.
