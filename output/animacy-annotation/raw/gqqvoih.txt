 Last night I went on to the sex offender registry 👅 and went through the list of names to find the most vulnerable one 🚪😕 I found one after around 2 hours 😅 It was a 32 year old man 130 pounds 🙃🌝 and had diabetes 🙃🤕 I knew that he would put up little resistance since he was weak and legally not allowed to own a gun 😒 That night I drove over to his house and scouted out a couple of potential entry points 🚪🔨🤯 I finally decided to push in the hall fan in one of the 1st story windows 😀😬 and I waited until all the lights in the neighborhood were out before doing so 🙃 Once I got inside the house I looked around for any potential animals 🐑🦍 I had completely forgotten to check if he had any dogs 🐾 but luckily I didn't see any 😐 I started down the hall way and went up the stairs 🚪 I stepped on the edge of each step so as not to make any noise 🥁🎻🎹 Once I came to the bedroom 🚪 I saw that his door was wide open and that I could see him laying there quiet and unaware of the fate that was to befall him 🚪👄😡 I pulled out my knife and stepped quietly into the room 🚪👄😬 I walked right up to him and reached over holding the knife to his throat 😡 By this point he was awake 😴💤 but he and I both knew that if he screamed I would cut out his vocal cords 🔫😟😐 I sat there for a while feeling him quiver under my arm 😔😭😩 but then I knew what I had to do 😐 I raised up the knife and stabbed him as much as I physically could 😑😒 After around the 12th time I knew he was dead 😵 but part of me wouldn't let the other part stop 🛑 so I kept stabbing into his chest with all my might 🔫🚪 By the time I was out of breath and exhausted I had stabbed him 54 times 😪 and I was covered head to toe in his blood 🩸 All the blood and gore gave me a boner the size of the Eifel tower 🩸🚬 and I proceeded to fuck the body 👅😋 Ever since then I've been fantasizing every night about my next kill 🙃🥴
