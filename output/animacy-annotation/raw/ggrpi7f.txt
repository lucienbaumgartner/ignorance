So, all I got is that IH is associated with sleeping very excessive amounts of hours (like 12+) semi regularly, where as with Type I Narcolepsy (maybe more than Type II, as Type II is still more unknown, like IH) a tetrad symptom is 'Fragmented/Disrupted Sleep' which is essentially, the flip of being unable to stay awake during the day, but being unable to stay asleep during the night (too).

When I was around 20 I could sleep a 10-12 hour night easily, but at the same time, I was also super active and unaware of the condition I had for what it was, every day I was exhausting myself a lot.  Am 40 now and I literally can not achieve a solid 6 hours of sleep, I might be able to achieve 2 or 3 hours of sleep, over 4 to 5 hours of being in bed, but to achieve 6 hours of sleep I am in bed close to 8 hours.  My sleep is super fragmented and disrupted, it is a very troubling symptom.

Regarding Cataplexy, it is rarely dx'd outside of with Narcolepsy, it is strange your doctor is choosing this, yet it may just be the test (assuming you took an MSLT) results point more towards IH and/or they.
