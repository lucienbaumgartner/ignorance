You are so full of it!!
  

  
Your name in front of a communist dictator's human hybrid testing is the worst argument you could have possibly come up with in this whole discussion.
  

  
Your argument, and your ignorance in this subject, is about as silly as the 'if only Hitler knew' stuff.
  

  
It is an ignorant, and stupid, assumption to claim Stalin didn't know about it.
  

  
"There were those who claimed that Stalin didn't know of what was being done. "
  

  
What do you mean by that, exactly? Were there people claiming Stalin wasn't aware of it? Or that he was aware of it and had the capability of carrying it out? The former doesn't make any sense.
  

  
What makes people think Stalin just turned a blind eye towards all this stuff?
