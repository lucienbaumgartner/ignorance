*so obviously not true*

Oh really, it’s just axiomatic? I think his definition of “work out” should be framed as a significant improvement to the status quo. The status quo being a very powerful state that extracts wealth from its population, and uses it to both inefficiently deliver mostly low quality goods and services, and drop bombs on innocents halfway across the world. Point being, it’s not *working out* at the moment, and there’s a need for building an alternative.

To your last point, it’s popular to believe that the state uses its power to counteract monopoly, but much more common is state power that either grants monopoly or enforces it de facto by entrenching powerful players in banking, telecom, energy, pharma, etc. I think a view that dangerous monopolies occur out of nowhere and the state must be there to break them up, is narrow and ignorant of historical events.
