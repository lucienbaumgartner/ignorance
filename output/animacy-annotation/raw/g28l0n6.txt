Honestly, the vilification of science in this franchise has always bothered me. It is not the fault of genetics that people looking to get rich by opening an unregulated zoo for the most dangerous animals to exist cut corners and sacrificed safety. There are some individual characters who are scientists that suck, but the message pushed, especially by Malcolm, that genetic engineering is evil has always struck me (someone who has worked with CRISPR) as misinformed and ignorant. 

That said, its a lot of fun to watch giant lizards chase people around in the jungle and I still think a lot of the story is really great, I just took away a more anti-capitalist message from the story.
