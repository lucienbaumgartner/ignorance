None of this was your fault. I just want to start off by saying that. Men like that are simply depraved and ignorant of other's feelings. Whenever I'm out alone, I try to ignore men who approach me randomly like this. When they ask me something, I quickly reply with "I don't know" and continue on with my business. That's just what I do though.  I'm not sure how helpful it would have been in your situation.
