Each of your points is wrong. 

Germany is more dominant than the UK.

Only 53% of the UK is Protestant with 40% being non-religious. That isn’t dominance.

Your point about Spain is insultingly incorrect and ignorant of history. 

Spain is indeed considered part of the West. 

I asked for a source to support your very narrow definition of the west and you’ve yet to provide it.

In terms of content, I’ve clearly laid out countries and organizations that have committed equivalent crimes as America and the UK. Please address Tojo, Mao, Hirohito, the Khmer Rouge, the Young Turks, the LRA, etc. 

English speaking nations are not clear of committing the atrocities you’ve mentioned but neither are other nations.

Edit: can you explain why you feel English speaking countries are uniquely bad?
