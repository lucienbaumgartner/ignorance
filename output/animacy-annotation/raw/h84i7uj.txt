I think there is a real problem with this disease being demonised. I think a lot of people probably feel ashamed. We all get so angry about people who do the wrong thing (NSW removalists, people escaping quarantine etc) people are afraid of being blamed for spreading the infection, even if they were unaware and symptomatic. This is probably magnified if they know they have done the wrong thing. Itâ€™s stupid, but sort of understandable.
