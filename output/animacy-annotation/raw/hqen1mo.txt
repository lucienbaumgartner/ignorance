My experience with religion has been fairly positive i have seen the negative sides that made me agnostic but in the end think to yourself a lot of scriptures were passed down by the method of peer to peer rather than in writing and if it was written they were translated with bias i understand why aethiests exist but simply equating all religion as a rigged design to marginalize and subjugate is beyond ignorant and disrespectful on many levels
