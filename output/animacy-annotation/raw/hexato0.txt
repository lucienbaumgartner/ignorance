thats the talk of someone who is aggressive and does not let people merge, which then causes traffic to stop in the merge lane which then causes major traffic delays. stopped traffic in a merge lane also increases the chance of an accident. in this case the car swerved into the other car, if it really felt that way then it should have let the truck hit it and not run into the car next to it. the car was aggressive and unaware of its surroundings.

it is suppose to let it merge......
