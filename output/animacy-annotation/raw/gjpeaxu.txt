Hey, sorry I didn't respond sooner but first thank for answering, despite this post being like a hundred years old, and I wanted to say that you're right or i atleast agree with you.                                            Some people can really jumb to stupid judgements but I think it's most of the time because they are either young and ignorant of the subject or really protective of it, like we can't deny that lumity is a gigantic step for Disney and representation in animation on general, so some people can be really sensitive to criticism being thrown at it, i'm not defending those people action i'm just saying why I think they act that way.       
Sorry for the long post and the probably broken English, but anyway thank for answering and giving your perspective on the subject 
And I honestly hope not many people on the fandom try to call you a homophobe just for not liking a ship, I know where they are coming from but I can't defend it
