Listening and hearing the similar posts like this makes me really sad, and it's a testament to how bad a course can be structured for which there's no requirement. It is how it is. 
Anyways I feel people who give advise of not giving up is absolutely ignorant and insensitive to a person's problems and often very easy to give. 
Very easy doesn't mean it's always right. 
I always believe working smartly over hard is gonna get you further in life. 

Well coming to your problem. I am in the same boat as you brother. And I have made reasonably good exit strategy myself. Make sure you have that aswell you have time you're 25+ still have time. 
You already have the knowledge the ca final find a course which would utilise those knowledge. Do your research carefully, do plan your way out meanwhile you attempt your final exams. 

Just food thought, don't blindly stick to one place only on the belief that it's the ultimate. Do make option for yourself in life! 

Goodluck to you!
