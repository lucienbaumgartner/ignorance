Because they're unaware and too stupid to vote in their self-interest. /s. But really I think a lot of it has to do with the whole realism vs idealism debate. For many minorities, all the issues that are talked about are emergencies. They have it much worse, so they need things done ASAP.  "Getting things done" is how the media and Hillary's campaign have branded her, and for good reason. When the situation is this dire, they don't care about fancy ideals or goals, they just want bread on the table. On the flip side, Bernie's supporters, primarily young white well-off college males, don't have these same worries. They're more or less taken care of in those regards, so they can focus their efforts on things other than their own survival, like taking on the rich or fighting climate change. If nothing got done and things stayed the same, they would be relatively happy. The same can't be said for many minorities.
