Watanagashi Day 5 &amp; 6

[](#mindmelt)

I'm without words. What a trainwreck. Oh and I'm confused again.

[Watanagashi](/s "Mion and Shion must've been real this time. Meaning none of the club members (except maybe Rika) can differentiate the two.")

[Watanagashi](/s "I'm still confident that Mion must've played Shion before. Otherwise she wouldn't have been neither that flustered nor probably that elated, and the bento would've been strange as well. Of course Mion also said she'd just forget about the past few days, which also implies she was indeed Shion back then.")

[Watanagashi](/s "However, Mion was unaware and shocked that Shion and Keiichi would hang out. So she definitely had no hand in this, and Shion planned everything with vile intentions to hurt her sister. In that case... how did Shion learn all the details about the past couple days? Maybe Mion specifically requested Shion to cover for her during the dessert event, and at that opportunity told her everything about Keiichi? Even about the doll? That sounds possible, but a bit far-fetched.")

The dessert event was pretty great. Especially the other waitress encouraging Satoko to do her thing. And the tactical Meeep too. [Watanagashi](/s "Keiichi getting out of tight spots by employing the help of others seems a bit of a theme this arc.")
