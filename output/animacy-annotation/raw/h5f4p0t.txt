Yeah, people over here just don't care. That's the main issue. NI is either an oddity that's interesting to chat about or a nuisance people don't know about, that's all it is to the English at least. I think Scots have a better understanding of it, but let's be honest nobody really asks anyone not based in Southern England so who knows?

I didn't personally do it, but Irish history was quite a big thing for our school in A2 history. I failed AS history so couldn't take it, which my mates found hilarious when I told them I got into Ulster, but it was quite in-depth from what I heard. Don't think it went into the details of NI as it is now, or some 7 year ago I should say, but the big things like the Easter Rising and of course the Troubles were spoken of. It's sad how useful it was having a mate back home that could explain *my* situation to people was, because on occasion we'd chat about me living in NI and there'd need to be a full lesson taught to explain the bloody country I was in.

Other unionist parties are pretty similar to the DUP from what I can tell, for what it's worth. The UUP, Ulster Unionist Party, is essentially the unionist equivalent of the SDLP in that they're the other big name for their side that used to be the popular ones. The rest are either DUP-lite or devout para supporters. 

Unionists are pretty fucked, because the only real allies they have are people who support Sammy *"I think it's good these boys are thinking of a Catholic genocide, it shows forward thinking"* Wilson and setting fire to Catholic paraphenalia in bonfires taller than buildings. And on the other side is Britain, an island that's so apathetic and unaware of Northern Ireland that it may as well be some micro-state in the Balkans for all people know about it.

I tell a lie. I think I've met more people who know about Kosovo than they do Antrim.
