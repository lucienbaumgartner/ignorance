I’m glad that those things helped you. But there is such a thing as “toxic positivity.” If you want to run your ideas past a struggling single mother who’s working just to keep the electricity on and her children in daycare because she has no family, and a father who won’t pay child support, she will find you insulting and ignorant of the reality of her world. 

The things you’re talking about here become toxic when people are in situations where, in practice, in the  immediate future, they cannot “will” themselves to create more money by imagining themselves with more money, and certainly not by giving their water bill to charity, or thinking about what they are grateful for. These are people who are wondering how they are going to feed their children *today* 

What you are suggesting is insulting.
