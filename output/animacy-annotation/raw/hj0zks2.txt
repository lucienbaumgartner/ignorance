That’s my stance in the majority of car “accidents”. Sure sometimes the situational variables change where a genuine accident is hard to avoid, but usually there is one or two idiots negligently at fault.

One quick example is the street I’m near has a 25 mph speed limit, and a blind corner. Too often do I hear honking from someone clearly speeding like an asshat at someone else who couldn’t see them or account for their overspeed in time, yet the person speeding honks like their in the right. People are so damn stupid and ignorant of their own faults.
