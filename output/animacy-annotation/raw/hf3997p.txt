Location and time - Russian resort circa 2010. 
Flag - photoshopped. 
Black guys - pose with Russians in photos for some cash.
Russians in 2010 - probably have never seen a black person before, and of course are extremely detached and unaware of any US poc problems and controversies, therefore totally unaware of how this pic really looks with all the background that we’re aware of. Keep in mind it’s 2010, most Russians didn’t even use internet very often back then. So I really don’t think this guy is a racist or has any ill intentions or anything, he’s just an ignorant little bloke from russian rural area.
