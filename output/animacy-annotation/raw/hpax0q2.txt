&gt;Few argue that the rich pay no taxes, those that do... well, people are gullible.

No, actually there are vast numbers of people out there who think the rich pay no taxes. 

There are people out there who will argue that Jeff Bezos pays no taxes ever because they read it in the news. There are people who will argue that some billionaire only pays 1% or whatever because they saw something in the news that calculated tax rate based on the value of their stock holdings in their company. These people aren't uncommon. 

"Gullible" is an understatement -- completely, willfully ignorant and flat out unwilling to accept that their information is completely false and then expressing political opinions and voting based on how ignorant they are.
