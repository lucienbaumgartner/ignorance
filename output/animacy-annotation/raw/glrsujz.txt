&gt; "He just had a knife, they shouldn't have tasered him" it makes you think that a lot of people are ignorant to how dangerous a really knife is.

I think this is more of a conversation about the situation, not the weapon. The police were completely unprepared and unaware of the attacker until it was too late. This situation cannot be compared to the many examples of police using excessive force as the first means of response before any attempts at deescalation. Of course, if it wasn't completely obvious, I'm strictly speaking of scenarios where police go into the situation with the full knowledge that someone is armed with a knife, not when they pop-out from behind the door during an unrelated call, as in, this was initially a missing persons call; not a weapons call.
