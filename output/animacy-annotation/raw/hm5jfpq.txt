Only when nobody's looking, and I wipe my arse with the nearest woodland animal /s


For real though giving out free food to people in need is a good thing. It's so unbelievably pious and ignorant of these people to call it out like that. If he was giving turkeys to vegetarian or vegan families then I can see how that would be unacceptable, but he's literally giving Thanksgiving meals to regular families who are struggling and wouldn't be able to have one otherwise.  

I get that certain meat farming industries and institutions are unethical but nobody is going to convince me that an animal life takes precedent over a human life.
