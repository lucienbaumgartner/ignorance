Everyone explores their spiritually differently. At some point we were all "asleep and unaware" of the Big Beyond. We can chose to laugh at the 1st grader who sucks at drawing  Pikachu, or rejoice that he's drawing Pikachu instead of burning ants with a magnifying glass. Perhaps even encourage him. 

It takes away nothing from any of us.
