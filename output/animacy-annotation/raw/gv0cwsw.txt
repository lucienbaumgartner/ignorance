I hope you all enjoy your covid prison. Even with a vaccine, you’re all nut cases. Stay home and stitch your masks to your faces. Covid  rains from the sky and is contagious  in your car while driving alone. Right?  Omg!  You can’t even respond rationally.   Uneducated and ignorant of science or facts. Do NOT come on here and whine about adverse reactions to the covid vaccines. Ever!!! That means 10 years.  Ciao  🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
