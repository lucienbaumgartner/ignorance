I find that when you travel you learn just how different other cultures’ awareness and consideration for other people is. For example, in Latin America consideration for noise and traffic rules/safe driving is often lacking from the perspective of a North American. In Asia personal space and physical awareness is the difficult issue. All over the world there are cultural differences than can be interpreted as rudeness but really stem from different cultural norms. 

However, this does not always explain away the rudeness of fellow tourists and travelers. It’s true that we can sometimes be unaware and rude because we are totally in the moment and our own headspace while traveling.
