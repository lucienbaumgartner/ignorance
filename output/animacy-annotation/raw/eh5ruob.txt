It is entirely anecdotal, but in my personal experience there has been a reasonable overlap in “people who have and tolerate/excuse unruly dogs” and “people who give repeated unwanted physical attention.”

It is not that what they do is terribly atypical, it is just a tick “above”, what is considered tasteful for the environment. It is the co-worker who touches your forearm, or the aunt that gets offended and never stops when you don’t want a hug or kiss and make it clear, etc. They’d even tend to agree with blanket statements or political viewpoints that support body-autonomy. They are just woefully self-unaware and defensive when it comes to their own behavior, or their animals behavior.

In my extended and in-law families it is almost 100% consistent between the groups. 

What is most telling is that those I’d consider “physically respectful” either don’t have a dog or have a well behaved one, with one exception. Of the disrespectful ones, each one has consistently and serially had unruly dog(s).

In the workplace (now retired), it was not as profound but it was at least &gt;50% that the people I considered uncomfortably “touchy” and/or overly personal for work made it known they had a dog at some point of working together. In the general US population 35-40% of households have dog(s).
