Also, not defending the blind thing, but in evangelical Christianity, the wife IS supposed to be stupid and ignorant of how her man provides for the home. My dad did everything. He had the job, filed the taxes, did the bills, managed the 401k, and told my mom who to vote for.  

The wife is not supposed to know how the world functions and a lot of them really fall into that role.
