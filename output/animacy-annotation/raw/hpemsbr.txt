The problem is you can explain until you're blue in the face that the risk is beyond deaths from covid and extends to things like damage to the economy when infected people have to isolate or dont die but have long lasting effects or people infected with covid take up beds and resources in hospitals that other people need...but fucking idiots like Tucker and the NPCs that actually watch him for reasons other than laughing at him, just have to continue to pretend they dont already know that and say stupid shit like this. 

Its shocking that its more acceptable to appear completely ignorant and stupid and unable to grasp basic notions than it is to appear to believe covid is real. The right wing is just an utter joke and has shed all dignity at this point.
