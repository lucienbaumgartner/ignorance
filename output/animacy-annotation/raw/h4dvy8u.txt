It’s pretty arrogant and ignorant of you to say these logistics and finance concepts are bullshit. Tesla would have to take a hit every quarter because their deliveries grow every quarter so the pipeline would have to grow as well. It would probably be something like 10-15% hit to sales in 1 quarter and then a several percent every quarter thereafter to remove the end of quarter push. That’s just not an acceptable loss to Tesla considering their most important KPI is vehicles delivered.

Instead they will solve the problem with localized factories to reduce the transit times and cut down on the end of quarter push significantly without impacting deliveries or cash
