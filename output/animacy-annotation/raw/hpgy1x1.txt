Yeah the solution to Wildy revitalization is not to bring in more players who don't want to be there.

PvPers just need to realize that they are an ever shrinking part of the player base through no fault of their own. The combat and gear system is old and new players generally don't feel like learning, especially when learning entails fighting other players or tick perfect LMS bots.

I don't know what the solution is, but Jagex isn't going to make us 12 years old and ignorant of game mechanics again. Pandora's box has been opened.
