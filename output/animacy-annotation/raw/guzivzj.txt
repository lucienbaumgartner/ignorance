Hinduism allows atheism. I am an atheist Hindu. I do not believe that praying to some god will help me attain moksha. However I do believe in dharma - kama - artha - moksha. It's typical of hindus to be ignorant and unaware of dharma and hence when you say " I'm atheist" they do not understand what it means. I doubt they know the meaning of the shlokas they read out during festivals. I am saying it again- the goal of hinduism is to attain moksha. It has got nothing to do with the existence of god. God is just one of the many paths that people take to attain moksha.
