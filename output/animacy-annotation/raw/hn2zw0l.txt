My dislike of him has intensified over this.

* Owns the production company making the film.
* Knows costs are being cut by hiring inexperienced crew and a very inexperienced armorer.
* Knows there is live ammo on set, in violation of film making regulations.  Does not one fucking thing.  Question:  Did he plink at cans too or was that just the 'other people' on set?  I'd like to point out here that as much as I also dislike Tom Cruise, he would have eaten someone's lunch over this.
* Pulling the gun AND firing it wasn't scripted.  Why tf did he do it? Was he going for the impulse but badass ad lib moment that sometimes makes it into a film?  Who fucking knows.
* Blames everything and everyone, from outlandish bullshit to simply shrugging off the blame.
* Walks off and leaves the dying woman on the ground for 45 minutes to an hour because IDK... blanks that actually hurt someone have entrance and exit wounds the size of a baby elephant?  Is he really going to try to convince us that he can't tell the difference between the real deal wounding, and the chaos and screaming around it, and a wound from a paper wad?  His claim that he walked off does NOTHING to help his case.  In fact, it's pretty damning.
* Whining about how his career is over - how fucking unaware and tasteless can you possibly be?  Ego much?
* Wanting police to be hired to police weapons on set while hollering DEFUND THE POLICE.  Listen,  THAT IS WHAT AN EXPERIENCED ARMORER IS FOR YOU SHIT HEAD.
* Spends years fighting against responsible gun ownership, makes movies glorifying gun violence.

So. In summary:  He's a massive toolhead.
