I mean there's plenty of upvotes which suggest people agree with me too. I'm sorry that I don't think a primal fear automatically is cosmic horror. I actually don't understand why the Nid hivemind is considered so terrifying when it's typically shown to be... kind of petty. I mean Devastation of Basl is pretty ridiculous. Imagine trying to portray the Tyranids as utterly uncaring and unaware and only interested in survival but then we get "by the way it just really hates the Blood Angels. Also it keeps making the same bioform that gets slapped around."

 Iyanna looks into its mind, gets over her fear of it, decides its pretty and notes it feels anger and malice.

The Hive Mind got stabbed with a spear and cried out in agony.

It briefly died when the Rift opened.

Once synpase creatures are removed, the Hive Mind loses all control over its bioforms.

I get that its a war game, of course, but the Hive Mind is ultimately very mortal and easy to understand.


You are free to have your opinion of course. I'm just saying that you don't NEED to say Tyranids are cosmic horror in order to justify them being scary and a threat. 

I'd argue most people here who say that Tyranids are cosmic horror are taking my words as an insult, they think the only way for something to be scary is for it yo be classified as cosmic horror so it stands out from all the other horrors in 40k. But Nids don't need to. They already fill the primal fear niche just fine without having to insist they are more eldritch and more special than Chaos.
