Yeah, big, howling tears about it. I'm informing people that a deadly and increasingly contagious disease has been spreading at a location where they get their food.

How's this for multidimensional "bitchassness:" there is no timeline, no reality, no extreme end of any probability curve that could have ever been in which you aren't weak, ignorant, and cowardly. You would cap the totality of human achievement at what your own half-baked, incurious, and underperforming jello mold between your ears can wrap itself around. Your pseudo-bravado and dismissal of this reality isn't a sign of strength or power or control, it's proof positive that you are too dull and ignorant to grasp the magnitude of things. You're like livestock. Your brain has hooves. Don't contradict the ones with thumbs with your stupid jackass braying.
