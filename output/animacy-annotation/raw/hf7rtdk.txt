My experience tells me that is a frustrating path to explore.  In my state the children’s protective services isn’t likely to do that unless they substantiate the allegation. And then all hell breaks loose, usually starting with removing (most likely) the girl for her safety placing her in foster care for a year or three.  It punishes the girl. The alleged offender gets counseling with a contract licensed counselor, who may or may not put in the work in exchange for that steady government check.  Then either  the division’s favorite parents get treated like royalty or all parents are bullied and forced to go to team meetings, undergo random drug tests, and basically crawl through flaming hoops across broken glass to satisfy a division worker who is frequently poorly trained and ignorant of the law. The ones in my state are so bad that they were recently exposed for knowingly sending foster kids to rape camps and hiding evidence. Even the system director told reporters that turnover was so high that they had to lower their standards and take people they wouldn’t otherwise consider.
