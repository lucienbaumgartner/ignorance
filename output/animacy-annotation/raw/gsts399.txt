I'd like to do a roleplay with an element of coercion. I will be vapid, oblivious, and amenable. You will get me to bend to your will through gentle insistence, manipulation, brute force, a Scooby Do style trap, or however you'd like. What your intentions are for me, I'll leave up to you to decide. 

Maybe you are gentle and kind, helping me out by showing me the right way of things. Maybe you are adamant on calling in the favors I owe you for accepting your help. Perhaps I am just naive and unaware that this is just what's expected of me. Or you aren't very patient and decide to show me what's best without waiting for me to understand.

I enjoy roleplay with extreme power dynamics. I'd like to be me, the 29 year old stanger whose post you're reading, but I am down to take on roles involving an imbalance of power like boss/employee or blackmail.
