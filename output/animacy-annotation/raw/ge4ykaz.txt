Yikes. Just yikes. What you’re advocating for is the exact reason why women who’ve done nothing to cause their miscarriage have faced criminal charges and prison sentences for manslaughter or even murder. 

This is beyond despicable. I hope you’re just trolling because that is so ridiculously evil and ignorant that there’s just no reasoning emeritus someone who thinks like that. I’m not arguing about this. No one should face charges for something that happens in their own body. This is disgusting. I’m not going to argue about this, so this will be my last comment to you. Bye.
