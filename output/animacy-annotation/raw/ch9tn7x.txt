Suicide, in most cases, happens when people who are clinically depressed decide that it in order to stop their internal pain, they should end their lives. Depression is a psychological illness that makes you feel so horrible inside that it makes you want to kill yourself. You very rarely find cases of people committing suicide unless they have been diagnosed with depression. People (mainly teenagers or college students) who kill themselves because people bully them in school or post nude pictures of them on the internet are ignorant and unaware that there is still a world around them worth living in. These are the biggest drama queens in the world. Big fucking whoop, you're being bullied, find a way to solve the problem. Tell an adult or something like that, don't waste the life you were given and hurt the loved ones around you just because you're too ignorant and lazy to even consider trying to resolve the situation. They teach you in school that bullying, in person or on the internet, is bad and then tell you stories of kids who kill themselves because of it, and these kids are the kind of people that don't know how to see the good in life, or at least hadn't learned yet.

If you have a mental disorder, there isn't anything wrong with feeling it or even doing it considering that it's a natural feeling under those circumstances. If you are just a dumb kid who's unhappy with his/her current life situation, it's a horrible, horrible thing to do to kill yourself, because you are not only harming yourself, you're harming the people around you who still remain alive. This kind of suicide really angers me.
