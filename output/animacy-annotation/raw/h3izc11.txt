That is the deleted comment I was referencing yes.  The first issue with it is the intentional conflation of gender and sex.  The two are not the same, and while sex is more complicated than she also liked to pretend earlier when she blatantly overlooked the existence of intersex people, what was more aggravating about her post was her acting as though a claim was being staked that Omega belonged to the trans community when the original meme was pointing out the mental gymnastics fans and creators are willing to come up with to explain a perfect genetic clone of Jango being a girl, when a perfectly simple, perfectly reasonable explanation already exists, but just isn’t “acceptable for the children.”  What infuriated me the most, however was her acting as if all this only amounted to trouble for people like her, when advocating for the acknowledgement of trans people is literally at the heart of it.  It’s clear that helping the trans community is not on her priority list, which is exactly why I mentioned Crenshaw, the woman who literally coined the term intersectionality because white women couldn’t be bothered to care about there struggles of black people and black men couldn’t be bothered to care about the struggles of women, and black women were left at the cross roads - the intersections - and that it is vital minorities advocate for each other, not be pitted against one another.

I know there’ve been a lot of confrontational people in this comment section, and I wish those advocating for trans people were more patient, but many of us are not having our best day.  Like you we face struggles and tire of the harassment from the other side, and it is very easy to want to lash out.  I just hope you can understand why this woman was being both disrespectful and ignorant of trans issues, and the effects of her comments on those that read them.
