OP’s sister here. I remember the conversation with my stepmother very well. She also mentioned that the first time was by water (flood) and the second would be by fire. 

She truly believes that “so-called” global warming is caused by God... and it’s a sign of the end times and Jeebus returning. She’s so delusional and ignorant that she truly doesn’t believe it’s even avoidable or preventable - because god has set the ball rolling for the return of his son.
