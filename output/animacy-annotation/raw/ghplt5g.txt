Komodo dragons have venom in their saliva. This helps kill their prey faster by weakening it. This means that the deer probably feels nauseous and unaware of whatâ€™s happening to it (combination of adrenaline and the venom). It is supposedly a mildly painless death. 

Please correct me if I am wrong
