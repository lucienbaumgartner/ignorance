&gt;and then that child probably harassed or raped in temporary care facility. thats happened before also

So leaving the toddler who probably hasn't uttered their first words to fend for themselves while Mongolians simply walk by, utterly helpless and ignorant of the next responsible action to take.

Will you take the chance of reaching out to the toddler and securing a safe, trusted place where the toddler can rest mentally and eat OR complain about potential harassment and rape (where?). I simply do not understand the logic of how an isolated case can be used to rationalize leaving out a toddler to the wolves. If not for the state, whoever was passing by and took the pic should step up and soothe the toddler \*at least\* while the passed out drunkard sleeps away his fatherhood.
