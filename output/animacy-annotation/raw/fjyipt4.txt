But think of the movie thematically

The man in the basement represents the poorest of the poor. Steeped in debt. Unlike the poor family who lives in a half basement, he lives in a full basement. The scariest thing that the rich kid could see was this man. Remember, he represents the lower class. They say he’s like a ghost 

When the storm hits, you see the torment it caused the lower classes living in the city, then it cuts to the rich family peacefully waking up and calling the poor family, totally unaware and ignorant to what has occurred to those less fortunate than themselves

Edit: the dad of the rich family also works at a virtual reality company. Supposed to point to the fact that they’re in a kind of fabricated reality
