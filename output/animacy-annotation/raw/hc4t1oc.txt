Saying you don't like movies after watching a handful of movies you dislike is like saying you don't like food after eating a week's worth of bad meals.

Not all films feature standard studio pacing, nor do they need to last two hours. Ever heard of shorts? 
Movies are incredibly broad and varied. There's plenty out there that's suited to everyone's liking, just like music. It's all a matter of discovering what's right for you and establishing your personal taste.

If you're young, I'll give you a pass, but that statement, along with your other commentary, is mighty stupid. Objectively. You sound very limited and unaware of how amateur-pseudointellectual you come off.
