&gt; Your last sentence is so arrogant and ignorant that I don't even want to bother educating you.

Do you not realize the irony behind this sentence?

Anyway, I never asked for your "education". All that really says to me is that you can't refute my points, so you're gonna make a quick edgy oneliner to try and shut me down. Who are you again, and why should I even consider your highly prestigious "education"?

&gt;Doing whatever their contract says is their job.

Sure, play the semantics game. Ultimately, at the end of the day, their job is to play Counter-Strike. That's why they're here. When they play less of it because they wanted more money, that's a slap in the face to their fans and anyone who enjoys the game.

&gt;They don't owe you jack shit.

Never said they did. Regardless, actually, they kind of do. Without fans, they wouldn't have millions of dollars, companies flying them all over the world, and practically anything they want if it wasn't for the people that make having these large events possible. So, yes, the fans matter *a lot*, and if you sign a deal that spits in the face of those fans, I think that's pretty shitty. Saying otherwise just makes you an annoying contrarian.

Even without that, though, it's about having ethics. It's about realizing the consequences of your actions, and how your decision can end up hurting the CS:GO community as a whole (viewership could potentially drop with less top teams in attendance), which, again, goes back to the fans.

&gt;If some billionaire bought rfrsh and gave device 100 mln to bar him from only playing in his events, that's what he should fucking do. Don't act like you're not going to do that lmao

Nice strawman.
