Prologue

Let's start right off the bat by addressing the elephant in the room. You saw the title and most likely

the first thought that came to your mind was "Is this a joke? Or is this person seriously delusional

enough that they actually think they can end the world?"

Writing this book was far from the first time that I've threatened to end the world and you're far from

the first person to give me that kind of attitude. Well, it's understandable I suppose; it's not every day

that you encounter the ruler of the planet.

You wanna know my response to your thoughts?

Consider this, who's the one who wrote the book and who's the one who's attempting to trivially

dismiss its significance before they even read the first page of it?

You're most likely a "normal" person who lives a "normal" life. Either that, or you're a psychopath

criminal that might be a serial killer or part of a gang. Whoever you are, I already know from your

highly reactive and dismissive thought process that you're not an individual with refined pure

bidirectional apprehension as your core value. I already know that there's a considerable chance

your core value isn't even a bidirectional apprehension variant. I know you're probably just like most

other people.

As a result, I already know you're most likely considerably delusional and driven by active ego.

Perhaps not so much so that it's to the detriment of your capability to generally function sufficiently

within society (although it might be), but then again, that's how most people are. Naturally, my

greatness triggers a combination of your active ego and your delusions. The end result is you see a

god as a nutcase.

I already know it's highly unlikely you're a member of the Shadow Confederation, or if you are, you're

not a high ranking member and certainly not a Permanent Chief like me. I know you're probably so

delusional and ignorant that you entirely deny or trivially dismiss the existence of the Shadow

Confederation and its significance in this world, precisely as the vast majority of its members desire.

I know you're probably considerably sheltered from the true depths of hell that this planet has to

offer. You're probably either extremely pathetic and weak-willed, a considerably arrogant and

pretentious individual that simply suppresses fully expressing themselves honestly in society

because you recognize Miat's socially acceptable and that being a massive douchebag tends not to

be received all that nicely by most people, or a conditional combination of both, simply restraining

yourself from showing your true colors depending on the situation.

This describes most people in today's society.
