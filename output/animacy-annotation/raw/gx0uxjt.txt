"frankly not that much stuff of global importance happens "

There are far tooo many things of local, federal, and global importance going on...the actual challenge is deciding what NOT to spend air time on. Our citizenry is woefully uneducated and unaware of whats going on....Watch five different network news programs, and all you will see is the same 4 stories rehashed over and over, as they compete against each other for what they think most people want to watch or hear. Do we really believe there are only 4-5 important things going on IN THE WORLD?
