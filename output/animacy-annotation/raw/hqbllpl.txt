That wasn't a typo. QOP is just QAnon + GOP.

Nothing partisan about reality. Which is that the GOP, in its current state, is the most dangerous and corrupt political institution in American history. 

They purge voters records, attempt insurrection to prevent election certifications, shoot up black churches, and allow pedophiles and pederasts to run in their party unopposed and we'll funded. 

Democratic corruption is childishly compared the well-oiled GOP machine that coopts the most extreme, ignorant, and malicious demographics into one umbrella of hatred and lies.
