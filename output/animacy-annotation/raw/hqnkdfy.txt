Have you considered that fact that you haven’t removed your one sided opinion from the matter? Those guards have to treat their job as life/death/law, do you know how many dipshit tourists they have to deal with that don’t bother to learn the rules of where they travel to? Regardless of if it was a kid there’s no reason why they should have remained in the guards path, the parent was ignorant and irresponsible and sadly the kid paid the price. Next time they’ll remember the saying of “when in Rome, do as the Roman’s do”.
