The people who defend the feminist, post-modern ideology in the new Star Wars movies frequently argue that the people who won't surrender their critical thinking to the propaganda are only opposed to the presence of women or minorities; that's as if being opposed to a message is only being opposed to the stationary the message is written on.

When I argue with a post-modernist about the propaganda in art like Star Wars, without fail, they feign ignorance. They would claim the elephant in the room is subjective, but they won't even claim its subjectivity outright! They argue for its subjectivity by pretending to not see the elephant.

When pressed to explain their propaganda, it is as if the post-modernist is suddenly struck stupid and unaware that the subject of discussion is not the deeper ideological message being disseminated in the art. Instead, he insists the message isn't real and asserts that a critique of the ideological roots of a piece is an attack on the form of the art. And indeed, post modernists see no difference. "What do you mean"? they cry "Why can't movies have more X? Why can't art be X, Y, Z"? as if the race or sex of the characters were ever an issue.
