So tru. And big same. Platonic dynamics are a lot of fun, and now that I think about it I'd kill to see anyone with Ezran tbh.

Sorry for being rambly but here's a hc. Rayla, being an assassin and all, probably took really tricky and dangerous paths and the dragang probably followed (on their path from Katolis to the breach), so otw back Ezran would take the same dangerous paths bc I mean they didn't die or anything and he's completely capable, but Corvus is just paranoid and unaware of how capable Ezran is and just loses his mind babysitting the new king like YOUR HIGHNESS PLEASE LET'S TAKE THE SAFER ROUTE and MY KING I'M NOT SURE RIDING A BANTHER IS THE SAFEST OPTION, I WILL GLADLY CARRY YOU JUST PLEASE GET OFF THAT THING
