Things I hate about the direction family Guy started heading after so many season. 

1. The rehashing of many many jokes. Repetition can be funny. Not if the joke was half ass in the first place then repeated 4-5 times in slightly different ridiculous ways. 
2. The characters seem to have lost substance and are now only vehicles for Seth's hit and miss comedy (still love the guy). Stevie used to be evil-now he's gay. Chris used to be dumb and unaware that he is disgusting and dumb-now he's super weird and has weird sexual scenarios. I'm not talking average young boy things either. Brian went from book smart alcoholic to pretentious cunt. Peter went from well meaning but simple father to verbally/physically abusive, alcoholic idiot amongst other things. Lois idek what she does other than yell at Peter. Oh and Meg just gets weird then normal then weird. 

3. I assume every episode is written all in one go based on a one to two sentence phrase Seth McFarlane scribbles on a receipt he found in his pocket while taking a shit. Ex: Peter relieves a whip in the mail. Hilarity ensues when he runs around town whipping people and making whip puns. At the end he learns you shouldn't do something but in the next episode he clearly does that thing again.
