Fuck out of here with that logic. That's frankly stupid and ignorant. That mentality is going to fuck over a lot of people just because some are having a hissyfit. If bernie doesnt get the nomination then vote for the next candidate that most closely aligns with what you want. Sometimes the system sucks, but the alternative to not voting is letting the other side win. If you're honestly the kind of person that's going to not vote out of spite just because your candidate didn't get the nomination then I don't believe for a moment you give a damn about what happens to the country.
