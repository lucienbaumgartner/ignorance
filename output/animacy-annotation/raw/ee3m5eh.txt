Yea I realized that too. The guy is so insanely arrogant and ignorant that he chooses to be flashy instead of actually listening to his team and trying to win. Like he tried to go in on full health leblanc and kled like it was soloqueue at HALF health. Guy straight up forgot he was in a scrim match against challengers. Like his teammates are sick of his shit at this point, especially Scarra.
