Robert's attitude annoyed me. I felt like he was sometimes dismissive of Laura's thoughtfulness towards the families she was designing for. And, seemed to be obsessed with impractical built-ins. 

&gt;!In season 1 episode 3, when he puts poured concrete benches along the length of the wall with 0 storage in the home of a family with 3 kids, desperately short on space, I felt he came across as entitled and unaware of the issues facing the couple. Plus, who needs 4 sinks in a row? And how do you sell a home with sleeping pods with no clothing storage instead of bedrooms? The design just made no sense. So, I think there are reasons Laura's designs win out so often... !&lt;
