&gt; Yes. It’s all immoral propaganda from the ~~right~~ *left*.

FTFY.  Keep in mind, it is the left that controls the schools, Hollywood, and almost all broadcast media.  They control the propaganda most of the public sees.

&gt; People with more money than anyone has a right to, trying to make a new oligarchy where there is only the privileged class and the mindless slave class. You know. Like all of America’s enemies... ever.

Aside from the fact that everyone has a "right" to whatever money they can legitimately come by, you're not wrong - and this describes the leftist elites.

Remember, they control the schools and media - and this is what they did with them:

&gt;  [And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.  The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) - *Bill Ivey, former Chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts to John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign, March 2016.*

They've done their best to make you ignorant and compliant.

&gt; And the ignorant slaves are eagerly lapping it up. After all, they might be ~~rich~~ *in the inner party* someday, and we gotta protect the rights of rich people to do whatever the fuck they want. 

FTFY.

I don't know if all the recently-exposed massive law-breaking and corruption among our elected officials and members of the bureaucracy has escaped your notice or not - it probably has, since you appear to consume primarily leftist news sources.  You might want to consider poking your head outside the leftist bubble and seeing what else is going on that your news doesn't want you to know.
