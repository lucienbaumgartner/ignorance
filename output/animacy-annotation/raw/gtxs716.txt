That like saying Americans need to change its military policy before we can talk about climate change.

In other words, you sound like an idiot trying to force your biased ideas on people by using a tragic situation to justify your bias. 

Yes black crime is a problem, discussed by the black community and worked on by them more than you (and you’re likely ignorant of due to your bias, but that doesn’t mean you can’t talk about other crimes and injustices like a lack of healthcare or voting rights or racism in workplaces etc. Only an absolute moron would suggest anything like that. Sorry.

What do you even mean by “takes their cries seriously”? What cries? 
Are you really that dumb and ignorant that you don’t even look in to the fact that the black community and organizations work on these issues quite a bit? You act as if no one cares or talks about it, but that just exposes that you’re ignorant and biassed (racist?)
