100% this. Especially if your parents aren't the most financially literate to help guide you or are just outdated and unaware of how this syst works nowadays. 

At 17/18 I looked at the cost of my 4 year education, saw 56K as the expected cost, with annual starting salaries in the 50K's for degrees I was interested in and thought, what a bargain! I can pay those off in no time. 

Allowing children to make massive financial decisions that will follow them for the better part of a decade or more is ludicrous. Those same kids who can't purchase alcohol or nicotine for themselves can ruin the next 20 years of their life unaware that they have done so.
