It is possible and necessary to address both the issues of mental health and COVID. Hundreds of thousands of people have died of COVID. If you think that the COVID cases at the university will not spread beyond the campus community then you are blind (especially with how transmissible omicron is). The OP says that 4 people have died in one day in the county. This is obviously a serious issue. COVID does not only affect the students. It affects everyone. My closest friend from high school has recently lost her grandfather and she lives with stress for her immunocompromised mother. My grandmother suffers from depression and I cannot see her at all despite the fact she lives 30 minutes from campus because of the COVID situation. I am worried for her wellbeing. Online school has a lot of issues that need to be solved to make it better for everyone, but donâ€™t blame people for doing what they think will prevent death. Detracting from COVID does not help your point. It makes you look ignorant and unfeeling. I have lost many people to this disease, and I have lost people to suicide. Both are issues that need our attention and we should do everything in our power to prevent more loss. In person school can and has killed people.
