She has a hungry child but also a phone or computer for Facebook, a house she can afford to live in and also time to go online and tell everyone OP is an asshole? Yeah, something doesnâ€™t add up here. What if she just felt entitled to some free food and tried to use a generic sob story when she got caught? I may be making assumptions here but anyone with a brain would know that breaking property and more laws would mean more fines you have to pay. So either she is extremely stupid and unaware of consequences which would make her an entitled AH or she is selfish enough to not think about her kids when doing this kind of shit which still makes her an AH.
