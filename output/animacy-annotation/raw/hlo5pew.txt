EP 5 Theory

This just popped into my head rn.

Please excuse the bad writing. 

From the teaser of Ep 5 it seems like Pat is confessing his "feelings" to Ink. 

I cannot trust the teaser at all after how deceiving Ep 4 teaser was.

Also, I just can't digest the fact that Pat is dense and unaware of his feelings for Pran (I had the opposite opinion 2 days ago lol but I have my reasons for changing my opinion). Him asking Pran whether Pran thinks Ink likes him seemed like Pat was trying to feed this idea into Pran head that there could be a girl out there who likes him. 

My theory: 

There's one scene in the teaser where Pat and Pran are at the guitar shop again and Pat is looking at Pran. Pran notices it and Pat quickly looks away (you will have to watch that moment at 0.25x speed to notice it). I feel like here he has figured out he likes Pran.
This scene I'm assuming (but I'm also kind of sure about it) is before the Freshy Day.

All of that asking Korn what makes our hearts beat faster could be before the guitar shop scene but definitely before Freshy Day. 

I think on Freshy Day he is FULLY aware of his feelings for Pran and tells Ink about it. Ink encourages Pat to confess his feelings to Pran. Pat tries to show Ink how he'd go about it. His confession seems kind of dull cause he's scared and doesn't know how Pran will react. So Ink, in response, says that that doesn't feel like a love confession. 

I have no clue about the fight scene and the last scene.
