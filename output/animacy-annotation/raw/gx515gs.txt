Personally I think there are two type of religious people: the extremists who take the books for its literal meaning and are ready to kill for it. And the apologetics who deny that the extremists represent the religion. In Morocco most people are unaware and ignorant of their religion, therefore they are easily manipulated to swing both sides.
