I am 38 years old, pre-everything FTM. I’m still in counseling for gender therapy, but I came out to my family a couple months ago. When I came out to my dad (couple months ago, over text message) he instantly felt compelled to tell me that I wasn’t trans and then “refuted” every example I gave him. For example, I asked him if he remembered when I was 5 and I had asked my kindergarten teacher and class to call me by a boy name. He instantly had to “refute” my story and say that lots of kids do that. He is trying to be supportive, but it was a huge shock for him. 

Parents usually want what is in your best interest. Although I have been thinking about being a boy/man for almost my entire life, my parents were completely in the dark and unaware that I struggled with these feelings. So i had a 38 year head start on them. Most cis people have never even heard of gender dysphoria or transgender issues, let alone spent hours reading and learning and pondering them like we have.

Yes, it is fair to expect respect and a good faith effort from them, but like anybody they need time and space to adjust. In my experience, my family just needed time to adjust, to come to terms with shocking news on their own timeline, etc.
