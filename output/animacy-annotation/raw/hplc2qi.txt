I guess that makes me feel less iffy about the accusations but I still think with the current info, she’s ignorant and greedy at worst which is still definitely not a good look.

I’m probably being hardheaded but I’m just not fond of drawing conclusions without any sufficient information and the existences of possible situations that also could’ve happened and this is general thing I do outside of KPop most of the time.

I can’t say anything about that second statement however.

I’m still fine with backlash heavy as it may be as long as it’s warranted.
