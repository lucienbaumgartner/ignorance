I thought RRP was the fed underhandedly removing cash liquidity from the economy. Allowing the fed interest rate at all times lows. Keeping boomers calm and unaware of the huge problems with the economy. All while allowing the congress to keeping pumping out cash programs. Money flows out to banks and banks feed right back to the fed. One giant circle jerk to maintain the illusion that something is being done.

My brain hurts now.
