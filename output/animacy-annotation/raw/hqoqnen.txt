NTA, my brother’s girlfriend thinks it’s fun/ny to trigger my PTSD and my brother doesn’t see an issue with it and now our relationship is almost non-existent because she’s attached to his hip everywhere he goes and he won’t tell her that we need time alone. Her triggering me put me back months of work in therapy, I even had to move out of my Dad’s home where I was raised because she wouldn’t stop doing it anytime she saw me in the house. (Dad understood but didn’t want my brother to think he was choosing me over him, so he indirectly chose my brother over me). All my relationships have suffered. 

AND IF YOUR SON FINDS THIS:
*Holy fuck dude you are such a fucking asshole. You think you deserve to have your ponouns respected but you’re psychologically torturing your own parent for fun? You need fucking therapy. You’re being malicious to the point you could literally cause your parent to kill themselves, because my brother’s girlfriend’s constant triggering of my PTSD caused an attempt that was only stopped by my Dad getting home from work unexpectedly early. I sincerely hope that you’re just short sighted and ignorant of what PTSD AND CPSTD are and can do to the body. Do some reading, and apologize to your parent. If you read this and continue your actions, you’re absolutely fucked as a person, and I really hope you’re not. Home is supposed to be a safe place, not somewhere you have to walk on eggshells protecting yourself from potential traumatic responses. Do fucking better.*
