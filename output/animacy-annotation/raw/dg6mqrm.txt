Are you implying that Russia hacked both the DNC and the RNC, or that both were hacked not by Russia, and only the DNC emails were leaked, presumably by Russia? I've seen no evidence to support this, just more of the "anonymous potential implicated allegations" type editorials around it, but I suppose its possible. 

Wikileaks, like it or not, does have a 100% record and they did outright say Russia had no involvement with the DNC emails. All indications seem to be that it was an insider leak. Also, seeing as Trump has never been in politics before, anything leaked from the RNC would have had little to do with his campaign, so again not sure how much that could have hurt him anyway. 

There is a large pile of evidence at this point that Trump *was* surveilled, whether by Obama directly or not, if they had incriminating evidence on him you can be DAMN sure it would have been given to the press.... 

The wikileaks emails were extremely damning. T_D is like a constant shitstorm of every-second posts so its hard to go back and find relevant info, and its been a while now, but some ones I particularly remember are:

- some official communicating the plan to create an "unaware and compliant citizenry" 
- donna brazile giving questions directly to hillary 
- other journalists from I believe MSNBC and WaPo asking for permission / guidance on how to report on Hillary after their interview so as to make her look best
- hillary's aides saying that "she no longer cares about the common people"
- shows they rigged the DNC primaries to screw Bernie out of winning the nomination
- one of her paid speeches to goldman sachs saying she was "very far removed from the middle class"
- needing a "public and a private position" on issues

There's a lot of them and its hard to go back and find specifics now, but I'll probably dig through some old reddit posts tonight just as a refresher... 

As far as propaganda, who exactly is pushing the propaganda here? You have all of the typical mainstream media outlets, except fox, who were shown through the email leaks as well as their journalism to be blatantly, and I mean *blatantly* pushing for a Clinton win, some even cheating in the process and interfering with the democratic process, all giving the same story. That would be fine if it was a substantiated story - but its been 6 months now and they've provided ZERO cited factual evidence for any claims. These are the same outlets that wrote hit piece after hit piece after 98% poll after 99% poll in the build up to the election - when do you start to question their validity when they're capable of being SO wrong? You have "reputable fact checkers" (lol) like "Snopes" and "Politifact" now being pushed by google and facebook as "arbiters of truth" - those sites couldn't possibly be more biased, and there are plenty of infographics on reddit to prove it - there is certainly a lot of propaganda out there, but unfortunately its not quite coming from where you think it is. 

And thank you for obliging my original somewhat abrasive post with a reasonable response - looks like there's still a bit of hope for spirited fact-based political debate among dissenters
