My God you’re a fucking moron! It has EVERYTHING to do with the vaccine. That’s literally what the law covers big pharma and the federal government for. Saying it’s been the law “forever” is a bald-faced lie. You are a liar and you know it. The law covering Covid is only 15 years old. It does EXACTLY what I said it does in specific regards to the Covid vaccines. 

If you’re not lying again about the risk being “practically insignificant”, and there’s no way you can prove that this soon, then there was no need to invoke the PREP/CICP laws. That logic is unassailable IF what you claim is true. Therefore it was unethical to invoke PREP/CICP, because it directly undermines big pharma and the Administration’s claims. 

You cannot mandate anyone take a vaccine in lieu of irreparable harm, while simultaneously and  preemptively exonerating everyone involved in forcing someone to take said vaccine, of any liability whatsoever. If even a bit of your position is true, then invoking this law is pure evil. Your position here is indefensible and morally bankrupt. Give up because you look worse every time you post on this topic. You’re being willfully ignorant and dishonest at this point. Time for you to move along.
