Well you should understand this basic concept by now with how much it is discussed on reddit.. but since you appear confused and unaware of this I'll explain: the vaccine reduces the danger of the virus and improves the likelihood of someone not getting nearly as sick as if they were unvaccinated.  It does not prevent people from getting or spreading covid.  In fact, most covid measures are still to protect the unvaccinated more then not.  There is a small percentage for whom the vaccine is less effective and may still get quite sick as well.  

Overall the percentage of patients in hospital has shifted to largely the unvaccinated now.  There is still some vaccinated in hospitals but you are selecting from 81% of the population (the vaccinated percentage of canada) so *some* will be those unlucky few where the vaccine is less effective.

The thing is, while omicron is less dangerous it spreads about 10x faster and to a wider reach.  Current data suggests on average every person who gets omicron will share it with 3 more people.  Consider that only a small percentage of the vaccinated would get covid previously.. and of them only a small percentage would be the  unlucky people where the vaccine was less effective.  Now with omicron a much much larger percentage of people who are vaccinated are getting sick.  This will equally raise of the number of people whom the vaccine is less effective for who will end up in the hospital.
