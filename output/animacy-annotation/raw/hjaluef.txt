Your example would have been better if it would have given the categories in an arbitrary order, where meaning is not altered. Such as, "I like red, brown and yellow cars". Here, you're not saying that red is your favourite and yellow is your least favourite. In the same way, "his and her" is arbitrary.

It was also a bit of an unnecessarily racially charged example, where other examples would have avoided this.

I think the issue is the word 'or'. Women are often considered 'other' by societies where sexism is ingrained. For the longest time, "man" referred to all of humankind, and there is a perception that men and male things are standard and women and female things are non-standard.

When you say "his or her" it can be perceived as saying "his (or her)". Including 'her' is almost an aside. The sentence functions without 'her', and including 'her' is just some sort of gracious formality, but 'his' is still the main event.

My example of 'ladies and gentlemen' was meant to illustrate that I do not think these attitudes are really embedded in the language at all. The convention *could* have been "her and his" and if that had happened we might be having an entirely different discussion.

Of course, now 'ladies and gentlemen' isn't exactly inclusive either. And, come to think of it, neither is 'his and her', since both preclude non-binary people. Whatever OP's employer is trying to do, it is seems really misguided and ignorant of language.

Singular 'they' is clearly the way forward. And "Welcome, everyone" would be best way to introduce a show and maintain inclusivity.
