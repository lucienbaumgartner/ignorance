My grades kept going down when I was 15 (I had been a straight A student before) because the abuse at my home had reached its peak. Dad was so delusional and unaware that after I started going selectively mute when he would scream and physically threaten me, he and my mom took me to a therapist (presumably in his mind so that I would learn to take the screaming as motivation, like a good child).... 

Well they accidentally took me to a therapist that was a reasonable person, who was immediately alarmed, yelled at them, and alerted the DCF of the physical abuse. I had endured 15 years of being abused almost every day by both of them and somehow they royally fucked up and got me help, all because I wasn’t reacting the “right way” to their threats! They thought there was something seriously wrong with me for crying instead of doing my math homework and getting better grades, and thought a professional would agree. Ain’t that funny?
