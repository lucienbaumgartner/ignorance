Jesus will provide an escape for His bride - who will NOT receive God's wrath. I believe the foolish virgins are the "Christians" - the people who are not awake - they didn't realize that we are in the last days. They were not awake to the schemes of the devil implementing the #markofthebeast with the so-called "vax". They were deceived into thinking it was just a "normal" vaccine. They were foolish and ignorant of the fact that it was NOT a vaccine - but rather a satanic soup that alters their DNA - thus making them no longer in God's image. Jesus doesn't know them because Jesus died and rose again paying with His blood for humans made in God's image - NOT HYBRIDS. In this context, the verse that states God's people perish for lack of knowledge makes complete sense. I believe the "Christians" who have received the satanic soup have nullified their escape by Jesus through the Rapture. Jesus is coming for His Bride who is pure (100% human keeping their garments clean). These are my thoughts. Take it to the Lord in prayer üôè.
