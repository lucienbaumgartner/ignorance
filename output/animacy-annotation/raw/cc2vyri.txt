I think jobs that require nuanced creative choices would be difficult to automate.  For example, scoring a film (which is  my job).  It's actually pretty easy to automate the music composition process for certain styles of music, but the decisions made about where to put music and what music to put there are based on intangible things that live in the human psyche.

For example, a scene of a woman taking a shower.  That's all that's on the screen.  The composer and the director make a decision about what the unspoken/ unseen content of the film is.  What type of music goes over it?

1) None, so that the audience focuses on her actions and we learn that she's a practical person who just wants to wash her hair and get to work?

2) creepy atonal music, so we know that she's alone, vulnerable, and unaware that evil lurks not far away?

3) the same music that played in the flashback sequence with her mother so that we know that as her mind wanders, she's thinking about that moment, so many years ago that she just can't forgive her mother for.

These are nuanced decisions that are 99% based on the intangible things - a directors desire, a story that needs some help, a gut feeling.  There's not necessarily 1 right answer (but there are loads of wrong answers).

TL;DR: it would be tricky, if not impossible to fully automate creative jobs in which you are manufacturing a product that is meant to resonate and/ or manipulate human emotions.
