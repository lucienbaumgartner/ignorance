&gt;elderly grandparents house and made threats of property removal for some unknown person the next day!

Holy fuck, not sure I'd have given them the warning with that one, just been sat on the doorstep waiting for them with a manic grin on my face

Like all bullies, they don't know what to do when someone steps to them, especially when they're in the wrong because threatening to force entry to a property they have no right to enter is against the law  anyway

It's an unkept secret that a lot of DCAs operate illegally in the first place, threats, intimidation are not allowed at all. They just rely on people being scared and ignorant of the law.

Keep up the good work my friend, the more they come across people who aren't scared of them and Willing to step to, the less they'll resort to illegal intimidation tactics
