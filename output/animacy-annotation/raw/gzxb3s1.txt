Donâ€™t berate nor trash talk men with sweeping generalizations. My mom is a single mom and my dad split when I was 10 and my mom trash talked him so much that for about 2 weeks, I just about resented women until I realized how foolish and ignorant of a thing to do it was.

Treat men and women with equal respect. 

Think with your brain, not your emotions.

Be clean.

Respect people older than you.
