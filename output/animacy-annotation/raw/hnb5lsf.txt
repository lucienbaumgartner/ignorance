My point being it’s not used in my country as far as I’ve ever been aware, hence why I had never heard of the phrase before. If we take the phrase literally, it does mean the opposite of what the speaker intends, thus bringing us full circle here.

And as a side note, I do most of my research using credible sources on Google Scholar, not the general homepage.

I’m not trying to be ‘right’, I couldn’t care less about that - I’m explaining to you what happened, and that if I came across as rude, I see why, and that OP wasn’t the nicest either.

I do consume some American media, but I have never heard of that term. If it makes me dense and ignorant that that phrase had never found it’s way to me yet, fine, you’re right.
