I know what you mean and I get that same need to recharge. But I would cut down on the weed and video games. It just makes it even harder to find energy to go out and do things and it can easily lead to you falling in a deeper rut. Before you know it you'll just end up as a recluse and the scary thing is the change is so gradual you won't even notice it unless it's explicitly pointed out to you.

I don't think there's anything wrong with taking time away from others to take care of ourselves, but weed and video games isn't the way to go. Self medicating is like playing with fire. You have your meds, take them. I've cut out every substance from my life and have been on meds for the past month. The difference is like night and day. Also you should discuss this with your partner so they are in the loop and atleast understand where your mind is. The worst aspects of our condition can lead us to come off as selfish and ignorant of others' needs and this can and will push them away eventually. I'm sure you care a lot about your relationship. But relationship is about compromise. You don't need to go out everytime she wants you too, but you can't just stay in everytime either. You'll both have to meet somewhere in the middle. Good luck.
