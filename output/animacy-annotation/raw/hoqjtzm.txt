So that argument I had, I became convinced I was wrong when I went back to how this all started was he was saying he has no ideology and simply supports whatever makes the line go up, and would completely abandon his current ideology the second another one is proven to make the line go up. The instant socialism works, he becomes a socialist. Which makes sense, and certainly sounds more likely than my view: "I'm a dyed in the wool liberal and you will have to put me in a grave before you get me to give that up". But what worries me is, how does he know that? You arne't always going to be right all the time, and your stance can't be "I would simply always be right, and when im wrong, i would be aware that im wrong and change my mind. Guess i'm just built different". That's just not how people work. You won't be aware you're wrong. Every human being thinks that's how they act. Socialists think their policy is evidence based. Fascists think they're evidence based. Everyone thinks they are evidence based. It seems to me more reliable to instead develop a way of thinking that minimizes your chance of being wrong, and maximizes the chance that when you're wrong and unaware of it, you'll be wrong in a forgivable way, and I take the view that using "maximize as many people's power over their own destiny as possible" as your compass is probably the best way to do that. What do I believe? I believe whatever will maximize the number of people and maximize the extent to which those people can control their own fate.

Idk what do people here think? Is an ideological system just a crutch for being unwilling to put in the necessary work of self evaluation? or is it hubris and time consuming to be constantly in a state of self-correction?
