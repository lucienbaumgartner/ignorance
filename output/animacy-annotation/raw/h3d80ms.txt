&gt;clearly mentally ill and unaware of the consequences of their crime.

One could also argue that this should be irrelevant.  If someone is so mentally ill that they do not understand that murdering people is bad and has consequences, it does society no good to keep them alive.   
The death penalty has two purposes.   
1) for the respect of the victims, eye for an eye and all that.   
and 2) Because its been determined that the criminal is irredeemable. If someone is committing crimes to the point that they are irredeemable why bother keeping them alive just because they are mentally ill?
