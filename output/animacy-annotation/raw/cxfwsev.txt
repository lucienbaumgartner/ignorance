*triggered*

edit: truthfully I know, don't think we're all not socially conscious and unaware that there are very real and hurtful things seen, read, or heard that can prompt a traumatic emotional response. I can sympathize with that. But this being reddit and /r/leafs being a space that such warnings are most definitely not needed, and us loving to circlejerk everything, it too is fun to make fun of the growing demographic of millenials (ones I deal with often on my university) who just love to play victim or stigmatize words that otherwise wouldn't be harmful whatsoever, just as we are doing now.
