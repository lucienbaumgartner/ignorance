Depends how you look at it. I know people who are so dumb and ignorant that they can't cook without a microwave, blame the bus driver for being early when they miss it, repeat everything they hear in the hopes they look clever, but end up just repeating nonsense like "this cat needs it's claws removed soon because they are too sharp"


But the real kicker is people that are in way over their heads and don't want to back out. For example, an ex colleague. He was originally from France, 30 years old and as much common sense as a hair dryer.

His daily life motto was "easier the better". He was paying around 5 times more for car insurance than he should because he just let it auto renew, for instance 

But at work he was useless. He was supposed to be an IT technician but teaching him how to do something when he was stuck was like showing a stereotypical parent. He would just clock everything, open stuff in small windows so he had to use horizontal scroll bar... IMO he beats anyone who struggles to read but walks like a pony
