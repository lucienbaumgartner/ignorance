I wouldn't fault anyone for choosing to use a tool/knife that was a gift or heirloom from a loved one. I totally get that.  Items have sentimental value.  That's a great reason to use subpar tools.

But choosing to spend your well-earned dollars on brand new tools merely for aesthetics and then posting them here as if they are actually good, is quite silly and ignorant of the entire hobby.
