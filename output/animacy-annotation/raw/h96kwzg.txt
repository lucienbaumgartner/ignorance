Grew up in Winnipeg, came of age just as the jets were leaving town. Age of seven, parent took me to see the last game at home, April of 96 against the wings. Being young and unaware of the “bandwagon” taboo I started cheering for the wings the rest of the playoffs until the series against the Avs. We all know what happened there. Wings went in to win two straight cups the following seasons. It was damn easy to stick around as a fan of the wings through the next 15 years. Still cheer for the wings first even with the new team in town.
