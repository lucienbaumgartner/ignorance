I dont think most people appreciate how greed, self interest and corruption have  changed voting dynamics in Australia.  I cant get a sense that people dont want change, Australians seem comfortable with their misery. I also tend to feel that many new immigrants still view this  misery as gods paradises for them and their family so think that this less than ideal Australia is better  than shitville despite being crammed in dog boxes with no infrastructure and services.

But the biggest joke in Australia is that people now believe that we have no land and that we all need to live in micro houses that are smaller than  most apartments in SE Asia, and think that this has to be a new norm in massive country like Australia with plenty of land. Sure their are challenges but they can all be fixed.  Aussies have become complacent and ignorant of what is possible because of technology. Do they really understand how modern cities can be built on reclaimed land, in the dessert or in any hostile place and that we all could be living on a 1/4 acre block like the old days. 

What has killed this dream is not availability but politicians with no vision or balls.  But  they take the easy way out hoping that corrupt and incompetent politicians deliver the same recipe of failure for us all while the rest of the world builds miracle cities in countries that is the size of one of our states. The stupid are being conned by their own stupidity and ignorance.
