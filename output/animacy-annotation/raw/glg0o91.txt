Faux means "not real or genuine; made to look like something else that is more valuable."  
I could also say Fox "News." Same meaning - people who watch Fox are documented as being much more misinformed and ignorant of current events than other people.  
If you watch Fox news, you might actually believe in Trump and his tens of thousands of lies. You might think that the government is a problem, not a solution. You are also far, far more likely to be racist.
