That's pretty scary, but at least it's over within minutes or in some cases seconds. Also the asphyxiation and rapid pressure loss would probably leave you confused and unaware of your demise.

Being on a sinking ship like the Titanic would be so much worse in my opinion. You're in the middle of the Atlantic on the only safe land for thousands of miles, when suddenly it hits an iceberg and slowly loses its buoyancy over 3 terrifying hours before sinking straight to the bottom of the ocean leaving the thousands onboard to freeze to death in the icy waters.
