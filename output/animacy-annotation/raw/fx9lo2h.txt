This was very interesting, especially the part where you explain that atheism has no moral values. I’ve never thought of it like that, as a Muslim I’ve had my fair share of getting attacked on the Internet by maniac atheists for simply BEING a Muslim, and now I understand it clearly. The majority of them are just religion-haters, they are so arrogant and ignorant that they do not research but only spit the repetitive trash that we’re all used to hearing. 
They truly do have no moral values. Imagine an atheist world... rape, murder, torture, would all be absolutely okay???
