With all due respect, it is more than you'd think.

***From National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future (NCTAF)***

•	Nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within their first five years.

I think the main reason is that teachers, liked school, they were good at it, they agreed that rules and requirements mattered, they respected the process and their roles within it, and they were surrounded by like-minded people in their high school honors classes and collegiate peers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then  they get into teaching and quickly find out that teachers (and people like that) are NOT the norm.  College grads (4 year grads, not 2 year or "I went to a semester of juco") are less than 25% of the population.  WE are the "weird" ones" Not them.  And that's hard to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of teens are, to be blunt, brutal. They cant wake up on time, deal with "no" very well, dont want to work hard, incredibly selfish and unaware that it's not all about them.   And to go from everyone in your community at college is on board with school, and rules and working hard and all that to 125 students most of which would rather skip meals than be without their Instagram updates or work towards making their families proud, well . . . it's a huge shock. 

&amp;#x200B;

"I didnt go to college to baby-sit teenagers" is a common complaint by new teachers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I teach at a low-level Chicago public high school, so my view may be a bit skewed to the negative, but the turnover in my building has been MASSIVE the past few years. I feel like a stranger in my own building lately.  I barely know any of their names.   

&amp;#x200B;

Teaching is simultaneously the best and toughest job in the world.  For many the toughest part outweighs the best part and they give up on a career they spent four years and $100K earning a degree in.  If that doesnt tell you how hard it is, nothing else really will.  

&amp;#x200B;

What do they do after they figure out that their English/History ed degree will never be used despite paying $100K for it?   IF you have a degree in Math/Science Ed, you have lots of non-teaching options, but all those in non STEM subjects?  I wonder what they do after they leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

So on a macro-view it's the culture shock of going from "ya school!!!" your whole life to a room of "what? huh? oh we're in school? ya right? Do you have a pencil for me?" is tough to accept and get excited about.
