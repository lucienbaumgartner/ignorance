So we know the president’s campaign INTENDED to get ILLEGALLY obtained dirt from the Russians to use against a political opponent to WIN the election. And then lied to us about it claiming it’s about child adoptions. But that’s okay with you cause you know, it’s not like it’s a Democrat seeking help from a foreign government or anything. 

&gt;The campaign was not, one individual was doing it without the support of the campaign.

As I said, there are over 200+ contacts and 33+ meetings between trump campaign and Russia. All of them acting as “individuals” and not with support of the campaign. Some of them lied to the Senate and investigators about these contacts like Sessions, Kushner, Papadopoulos, committing perjury. But that’s okay with you.though. So your argument is that the president is so unintelligent and unaware that he had no idea everyone in his inner circle are criminals?

&gt;That is because the federal government already spent $380 million on election security with the 2018 Help America Vote Act.

Which doesn’t flows into the 2019 fiscal year. This act came from 2002, we didn’t have Russia organizing political rallies, sending disinformation bots, and attempting to hack 33 states to help a candidate win back then. And intelligence believes they’ll do it again. Dont you think we should put a bit more care in?

&gt;Your source there is Michael Cohen's testimony alone, that is not a source.  

Actually it is. See Cohen lies to congress about that project and we know cause it’s in congressional record. And since lying about it wouldn’t benefit Cohen in anyway since it wasn’t directly relevant to any charges he was facing, then that means he was lying to protect Individual 1. Like he always does. And I don’t see why we shouldn’t believe him. Remember when Cohen implicates Trump in those campaign finance felonies with porn star payments Trump claimed he knew nothing nothing about until the FBI raised Cohen’s home and found taped with the 2 discussing those payments?

&gt;Yeah, no.  They are litigating this issue right now.  This is not a new thing with the Trump administration.

Well yeah I know it’s not a knew thing for the Trump Admin to break laws and disregard the constitution but that doesn’t make it okay.
