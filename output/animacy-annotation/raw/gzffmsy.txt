yes, i think you may be overreacting. intent and context is what makes words hurtful. if a baby chatters nonsense and that word manifests out of the mumblings, you should not need to leave the room to collect yourself. 

your coworker was not trying to hurt or offend you. that was not his intent. he was the victim of that word in this instance, not you. 

if you are triggered from the mere utterance of that word, to the point where an entire year later you are posting on reddit and are losing sleep envisaging the horror of the impending reunion, then you should absolutely talk privately with the coworker and explain to him the condition of your fragile virgin ears and emotional sensitivities.... i am just joking. lots of people also call me problematic so i was triggered.

but honestly, i do agree with you that in a workplace environment he should be more professional and avoid those words all together, regardless of the intent or framed context. you mentioned that he has other social quirks and unprofessional behavior, so he may be on the spectrum, and/or not pick up on your unease. you need to be more direct. do not lecture him or shame him, just tell him that that word makes you uncomfortable. 

but most importantly, do not threaten his career by ratting him out to the supervisor before talking with him privately. this man is unaware and ignorant of your sensitivities. you have not expressed any of this to him, so how would he know? you only know what you are taught, and he has clearly never learned this lesson, through no fault of his own. he is not black, maybe he has no black friends, whatever the situation, you need to talk with him privately. if it continues from there... go to the supervisor, because that is now blatant disrespect. 

hope i didnt offend you, and hope everything works out for the better.
