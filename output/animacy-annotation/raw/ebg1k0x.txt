Dude this has happened to me too. I really don't think I'm that attractive at all, but for some reason the 40+ demographic is into me (and has been since I was in my early 20's). Luckily I work in a relatively young field now, but back when I was doing retail I was approached quite a few times. I had a woman that would come in regularly and awkwardly flirt with me. Once she asked me to get cat litter off the top shelves, then proceed to approach me from behind and try to rub my shoulders because "it must be so heavy to pull those big boxes down". Never have a shuddered so hard in my life than when I felt her witch-fingers curl around my shoulders, completely unaware and unbidden.
