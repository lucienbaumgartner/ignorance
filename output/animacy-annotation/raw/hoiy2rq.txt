Yes, there were normal Christians and Christianity was still critiqued all the same(As it was supposed to be). So why should the Muslim religion not be treated the same in show that is all about the poison of religion? I said this in one of my other comments but it just comes off as very selective and ignorant of the message its trying to convey.
