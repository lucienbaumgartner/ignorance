Unbelievable. YTA. So you have a corn snake who is your best friend, who you love very much, who is precious to you, and knowing this still, you thought it was appropriate to ask your EIGHT year old brother who feels the same about his newly dead hamster to let you just feed it to your snake? Your excuse of this being beneficial is at best, insensitive and unaware of otherâ€™s feelings. Your parents are right.
