Well you asked about what might be impacting black people in America today, so why would I talk about the Arab slave trade? Its has no relevance. And we can and should acknowledge the bad things this country has done without saying it is the worst country in the world. I both love this country deeply and acknowledge that it has been privy to some pretty evil shit in its background. A good country doesn't hide from its past mistakes, it deals with them. I believe this country can be the best country and part of that includes deal with the misdeeds of the past.

And there is no population in this country treated as poorly as black people except for native Americans, who are also struggling tremendously. The notion that all the bad times for black people ended in the 1950s is ludicrous and ignorant of history. We have to teach CRT to kids because we cannot have any more people raised thinking the problems for black people ended in the 50s.

The effects of centuries of discrimination still exists today. I have no idea why you think centuries of massive and insidious discrimination and violence have no impact today and would no longer be "a valid excuse", but that's one of the main teachings of CRT: racism, Jim Crow, and slavery aren't simply relics of the past whose effects ended the day that those practices did. While we largely took formal discrimination off the books in the 1960s, racism and its effects still reach into today.

But I take it you are of the opinion that there is somethings inherently wrong with black people such that they tend toward inferior and more criminal cultures, is that fair to say? That white people and asian people lack that inherent inferiority.
