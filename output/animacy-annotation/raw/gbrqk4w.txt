NTA, honestly is SIL knew you were deaf she either wanted to purposely orchestrate an incident so you would look incompetent. Or she is just really stupid and unaware that people with hearing issues need to be communicated with differently. If it's the latter your SIL sounds like the 'I have to blame someone or else it's my fault' type of person to this situation. I feel sorry for your niece to be stuck with that kind of a woman for a mother.
