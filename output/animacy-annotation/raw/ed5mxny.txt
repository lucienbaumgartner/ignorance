&gt;So the best way I used to compare between the 2 religions is by watching debates from the true religious people since they are the best people to symbolize their religion, and I watched debates for sheikh Ahmed deedat and how this guy was single handedly debating queues of Christian people and Christian scientists, and to be be honest this guy just made me hold my religion even more , you can go and watch his debates in YouTube if u doubt me .
&gt;

Thanks, I'll check it out. Although, properly comparing two old religious traditions goes far beyond just watching a single video of YouTube apologetics. I hope you treat your faith with more seriousness than that.

&gt;Another thing I did is traveling to a non Muslim country and see how they live , and this is my experience: people are not as close as Muslims to almighty GOD not even comparable , because as a Muslim I pray 5 times a day in all times and I feel very connected to GOD , something bad happened to me ? I make duaa and I get relieved , meanwhile in non Muslims countries nothing like that happens , maybe u occasionally pray and do some rites but definitely not as close as Muslims .
&gt;

Yeah, the west has become largely secularized. Most of the Islamic world has not - but some of it has. Go visit Central Asia and you will find Muslims as ignorant of their faith as a lapsed Catholic in France. But large pockets of the faith survive, and God willing, will, like Noah's arc, replenish and renew western societies.

&gt;Another thing I noticed that the women isn’t as respected as in my country , even though u think that we treat women like an animal but actually women are a red line in my country and she can never be messed with , and she has to be always prioritized in all aspects of life , while the women there just grind like men and they don’t look at the nature of the women and how god created her differently form the man and it’s not fair for men either to get equal rights like women in legacy for example .
&gt;

Yeah, women are objectified sexually in the west; used in a culture of easy sex, and it's had terrible effects. But, that does not make it ok to deny women basic mobility rights or other fundamental forms of autonomy, or legal equality. That's false logic.

&gt;So I basically figured out that people are just to shallow about my religion and the media doesn’t show us as we are expected to look like rather than that terrorist beast that has to be avoided .
&gt;

It's easy to brush off doubts and concerns raised by others by simply dismissing everyone else as shallow and ignorant. That way, you don't have to do any difficult intellectual work yourself, just sit back, watch some YouTube videos telling you you're right, and judge others. 

&gt;After I came back to my country I just wanna say I’m proud to be a Muslim man ALLAHO AKBAR .
&gt;

Careful with that pride. Too much pride is a sin in Islam too:

*Is there not in Hall an abode for the proud?* (Surah az-zumar 39:60)
