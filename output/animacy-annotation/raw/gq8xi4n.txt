It's not a trick question. You know the answer, and you have written it. Art is in the eye of the beholder. There is no limitation on what can be art, besides on someone's ability to see it as such.  

&gt;That's rather blind and ignorant of you to say.  

We all have blind spots and infinite fields of ignorance. I am no different. I don't consider you pointing this out to be problematic. I agree.  

re:art being pointless.  

You don't have to agree on the point of art, to understand that art has a point. As you so eloquently noted, art is in the eye of the beholder. So the point is that you take some meaning from it. 

Every individual is free to try to live a life without meaning, but even that endeavor itself is assigning value to itself, and paradoxically the intent makes it a meaningful choice.  

&gt;Well... perhaps you should reflect on that

I do enjoy thinking about the importance of art.
