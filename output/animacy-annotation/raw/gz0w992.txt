It does sound like she may be neurodivergent and also have ADHD.  It may also be undiagnosed- which can explain her situation even more. When someone who is now an adult is undiagnosed-or goes throughout most of their life undiagnosed- it can be very hard for them to be aware of their behaviors. (Note this is not all-just some.) She may not be aware in the moment what she is doing- which she may be use to causing issues for herself in the past and then she developed some not so healthy coping methods to handle those situations. Or she may be unaware and willing to have someone point it out to her.

Like another poster has said, it is important to set boundaries no matter what. It will not get better. Even if it does hurt your work relationship, at least the boundary is set and she will eventually adjust (even a little bit) to that boundary. You can be empathetic while also stern. 

Her life may actually be in chaos, which may spark up those sides in her. Thats understandable. Sometime it id as simple as saying " you do not need to explain, Im here to help". "No really, its okay, lets just focus on this". Particularly for those who are neurodivergent or experience mental illness/trauma, they always need to over-explain any mistakes or faults. You can validate her while also setting a boundary and still work as a team.
