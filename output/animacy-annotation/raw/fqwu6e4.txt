\&gt; To be different on this level after you've been bullied and judged all the time, kinda shows how NOT understanding most people can be. 

What? Bullying and judgement have nothing to do with the topic of "acquiring blood via supernatural means". I am a man of science. Science and evidence is how we came to understand the world. Science explains how planes fly, why the sun rises up, why the sea is salty. 

If you could make up a claim then so could I. I could say; I can read people's mind just by looking at them. And I can talk about it. But it doesn't mean it's true. Why? Because there is no evidence. I am offering no proof of my claim, therefore there is no incentive for whoever to believe it. 

Once you throw out the need for proof, anyone can say anything and all of it will be true. See how hypocritical and ignorant that is? Do you understand my view point?
