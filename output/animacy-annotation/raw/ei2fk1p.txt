Oh I also forgot to mention. Regardless of where you play. Disregarding that a game CRASHES A CONSOLE. Is beyond idiotic and ignorant. That. Alone. Allows it to be more broken than the division in any moral sense of the word. Yes. TD1 was rampant with cheaters. Absolutely. Exploits. Yup. Those are in anthem too. Maybe cheaters to a less extent. Something about these devs have infinitely more experience? Something like that. 

But saying. That anthem. A game that crashes consoles. Progression is completely fucked up. Scaling is incorrect and there’s no possible way to min max without a stat page and obviously without scaling or progression being correct. No waypoints. Infinite load screens. There’s too much wrong with anthem. 

TD1 has/had issues. But they don’t compare on a fundamental level to anthem. Especially with the experience that EA and whoever the devs are who’s name is escaping me rn. 

If you want a better comparison. Do anthem to Div2 so Massive has more experience. Then we can see the difference.
