If you have a heart condition of all things you should never have let them through your door (on top of being pregnant).  YOU allowed them into your home, didn't social distance or use masks.  It's frustrating and ignorant of them to not respect your health of course, but you didn't respect yours either.  I truly hope you'll be okay OP, learn from this and prioritize your health over seeing people who don't take this seriously.
