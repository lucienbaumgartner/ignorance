s/h means self harm. so hurting yourself on purpose. I havent found much that can help, but I've noticed that an increase of my ADHD meds (a stimulant) causes me to be more anxious, and unaware that I'm picking. On a day to day basis the best thing I've found is just holding something in my hand like a squishie or another stim toy, and avoid looking at pimples or anything like that on others. Honestly, if if you can being it up with your doctor and if needed, without your parents
