"You can't pick a hamster in a wild and declare it as a pet"

Of course. That's kinda illegal. But that does not change the fact, that we know thousands of cases when feral animals just "adopt themselves" to people to their own safety and comfort. Or cases, when feral animals were rescued and didn't want to leave their caretaker. Every animal. From insects, through reptiles, rodents, to bears or dolphins. It's really easy to leave your narrow worldview and see facts. 

In that manner taming a racoon has no difference to taming feral cat. 

And jumping on people just because "You think that animal behaves like a pet, but I know better than you, even if I have seen this animal once on a reddit picture" is just dumb and ignorant.

Of course, feel free to baricade in you bambi syndrome! But scientific and empiric facts are just with me: nearly every *Vertebrata* can be tamed.
