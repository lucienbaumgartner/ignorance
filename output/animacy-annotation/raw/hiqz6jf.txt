lol oh ok now that you’ve been corrected…

It’s “FedEx’s fault” and “80% of the time” but “probably more” you can count on a package being “at least a day late”? So this is what you’re complaining about in “USPS complaints” subreddit?

Well once again you are wrong… how can 80% of your packages be “at least a day late” when delivery times are estimates? 

Just accept that you’re uninformed and unaware of how the process works instead of trying so hard to find “something else” to complain about. Your package is still sitting at FedEx, now know how to remedy that. Glad we could help and good luck!
