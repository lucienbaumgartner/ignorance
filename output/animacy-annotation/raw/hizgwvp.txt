I can tell by your response you're not on dating apps, because it is abundantly apparent you've not had the pleasure of people matching with you simply to boost their fucking egos. It's way more common than it has any business being. I had no less than 7 of them in the last calendar year, where I'd put almost all the effort into making polite conversation and trying to get to know them a bit before asking them out, only to get virtually no response. Some people simply view this stuff as an ego boost, and it shows with stuff like this. You made several assumptions about this guy based on these two screenshots, talking about his "demands" and whatnot. They could have been talking for weeks on end and he could be trying to put an end to the cat and mouse fuckery, in which case this is understandable (I wouldn't say advisable, given that this is literally a stranger on the Internet who you'll likely never meet). But saying this is "patronizing" without the rest of the context is just short-sighted and ignorant of the realities of these apps.
