Your reading comprehension is lacking. Nowhere did I say all Democrats are child molesters. I said that if they support Biden, they see nothing wrong with it. Joe is on video grabbing an eight year olds breast and pinching her nipple, along with other many other kiddy touching moments. His son is even worse. 

On a serious note, I’m sorry that your education has failed you so much that you can’t grasp basic communication, and I’m also sorry that you’re so sheltered and ignorant that you can’t see how what I’m saying is completely relevant to this election. 

It’s sad that you project an obsession with child abuse upon me, when it’s a legitimate focal point of your presidential candidates moral and sexual deviancy. Deflection and denial won’t help you.
