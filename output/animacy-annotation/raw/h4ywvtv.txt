Nothing like R&amp;M lol Ish and Ice are exactly what Joe wanted to turn R&amp;M into and he couldn’t do it. Lol. Joe learned from the best swindlers on the planet. He’s going to get Everything out of Ish and Ice that he can get and save money while doing it. He will throw them a few dollars to keep them quiet and unaware of any major deals he signs and they will help him based on a friendship that they have with him. Helluva Swindler errrr Businessman 👍🏾👍🏾
