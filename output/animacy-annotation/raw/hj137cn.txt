I never understood why people hate stealth. Are people just that unaware and bad at it? I love stealth games. Metal Gear Solid is one of my favorite series.

I played all of both recent Deus Ex games without ever being detected and without killing anyone (bosses included). Finished both Styx games without ever being detected. Same with Splinter Cell, Sniper Elite, Dishonored, Thief, and many others.

The only time when it gets boring is when the game doesn't set up stealth mechanics very well, cleverly set up a story around it and give you kind of an obstacle course, or options like vents or hidden doors and such. Like in Far Cry, where it's just kind of "don't be seen, but it doesn't really matter" and it's just a race to get headshots as fast as possible.
