&gt; I did, and u (you) still have yet 2 (to) prove how it isn’t.

You’re so stupid and ignorant that you can’t understand that I could refute the data by simply saying, “it was collected two years ago and the variables could demonstrate different behavior in the current year”. The possibility of inaccuracy questions the credibility of the argument. I don’t have to prove anything. Your argument must be full-proof and well constructed and it clearly isn’t. By your own “logic”, any data set could represent any population size of any year because, *”it was only collected x years ago”*. The fact that you overlooked this is once again, representative of your low IQ.

You also haven’t addressed why the source doesn’t reflect the claim. Are you too stupid to do that?
