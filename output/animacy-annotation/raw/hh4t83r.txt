&gt;So God shouldn’t have Free Will? To do everything as He wishes? To make His own choices?

God has a responsibility to the things he’s created to treat them fairly. Unless God intended to create a dollhouse, I suppose, but who wants to watch stories about a dollhouse?

&gt;You are the one who said that they don’t have it.

Because they don’t. I object to the idea of it staying that way and hoped to see the show address that by allowing characters to start diverging from God’s plan, but the show had other plans and decided to settle on a ‚it’s not bad that God has a plan, because he means well’ moral. It then bends itself into a pretzel to claim that God having a plan he actively enforces and free will can exist in the same universe.

&gt;Isn’t he using a power people can’t say no to? 

Yes, Lucifer’s power is a violation of consent and free will, and he probably shouldn’t use it.

&gt;Not waiting for that someone to come to you.

You could do a lot of things, but if you’re as emotionally stunted and unaware of how to take care of people other than yourself as Lucifer is at the start of the series, it makes sense that you wouldn’t know how to. That doesn’t mean you don’t care. It just means you don’t know what to do with that information.

&gt;If I do something that affects someone else in a negative way, doesn’t mean I care about them, just that I feel guilty I’ve done something that brought grief to someone else. 

If you hate bringing grief to someone else, that means you care about that person’s feelings. 

&gt;BTW, how often did he mentioned her after her death?

The fact the show forgets about Delilah to the point it starts claiming Chloe is the first person he ever cared about doesn’t mean that Lucifer isn’t shown to care about Delilah in episode one. The episode exists. You can see him caring in it. It’s a part of canon.
