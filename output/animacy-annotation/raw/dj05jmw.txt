Yuck. Yuck yuck yuck. That's not okay. I take major risks and have done some really dumb things during scenes, but even I would be taken aback by someone going down that line of questioning without warning. I *am* into Daddy/little play and I (typically) *am* a bad girl and I *love* talking about past sexual experiences. 

In my mind, it's not even the questions. It's the timing. Talking about that stuff as foreplay? Super hot. Talking about it when we're already having sex? Now he's putting you in a weird position where no matter what, you lose. Either you answer questions you're not comfortable with (not cool) or you have to explain why you're deliberately choosing not to answer (not cool).

I'd give him the benefit of the doubt that he's new and unaware. And I'd tell him that it was weird and uncomfortable. And then never play with or have sex with him again.
