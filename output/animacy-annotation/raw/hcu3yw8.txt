I only did salvia once, technically twice if you count the two separate hits. First one was just a baby hit (20x) sprinkled on top of weed. That introduced me to the pin pricks. I also felt like the top right corner of the room was almost like a mouth about to bite down on me.

Second hit I just loaded a fatty bowl of only salvia and torched as big of a hit as I could. I was out of my body before I exhaled, no pin pricks or anything. Just lost in a pool of psychedelic visuals, and I had six distinct windows into "reality". Like I was watching six different points of my own life at the exact same time (I didn't realize it was my life at the time, but I did put two and two together once I sobered up).

As the effects started wearing off, the top left window started growing larger and harder to ignore. Eventually I actually sorta climbed through the window, and I was back sitting on the couch I started on, but still completely disoriented and unaware of who exactly I was.

Wild ride. Glad I did it though. Gave me a rock solid appreciation for how ordered and simple life is compared to the pure chaos that is salvia.
