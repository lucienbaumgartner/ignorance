BTW, you'll probably find this little article interesting as well:

Note the last paragraph of that abbreviated article:

&gt;This latest research is not the first to link the infection with prostate cancer. A 2009 study in the Journal of the National **Cancer Institute found that 23% of men with prostate cancer showed signs of trichomoniasis.**

Of course the mainstream medical community "poo poos" that as "not a CLEAR link".  The thing is that not all "prostate cancers" are alike, in fact most of them are such slow-growing things that the best treatment turns out to be "no treatment" -- i.e. you die WITH some (non-malignant, non-metastatic) prostate cancer, not FROM it.  

But there are OTHER kinds of prostate cancer... generally called "aggressive" -- those are the kind that KILL men (i.e. they die -- often fairly young -- FROM the cancer {and/or the  &amp; complications of it, that attempts to eliminate or "cure" it}, not just WITH the cancer).  And interestingly enough -- guess which kind of prostate cancer OTHER research has linked *trichmoniasis* with?  Yup: *["Aggressive Prostate Cancer Linked to Trichomonas"](http://www.medpagetoday.com/urology/prostatecancer/15888).*

Thus that 23% is in fact FAR more meaningful than it seems/sounds at first glance.

Now, note that the infecting agent in this case is **not** a virus, but rather a **parasite (specifically a "protozoan")** that goes by the name *[Trichomonas vaginalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomonas_vaginalis)* and which causes a disease called *[Trichomoniasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomoniasis)*.

Now if from that name (the "vaginalis") you too away a clue that the disease is most NOTABLE in... the vagina; well you'd be right about that.  In fact, it's apparently normally "asymptomatic" in men (i.e. they're infected and don't suffer any "acute" symptoms or disease, no puss discharges, no warts or lesions or even a rash); whereas in women, well... 

Also relevant to that 23% is the fact that it infects women at about TWICE the rate of men. And *in the US,* estimates are that about 5 million people are infected with it each year -- it is in fact THE single most common "protozoa/parasite" infection in western nations.  Consider that 5 million figure across a normal human lifespan (especially the post-pubescent, and the main "sexually active/promiscuous" decades) of about say 30 to 40 years (i.e. age 20 to 50; or age 15 to 55) ... and you end up with a bit more than half of the US population (probably around 60%); 2/3 of that being women, and 1/3 of it being men (i.e. that's how a 2:1 ratio of infection plays out)... now 1/3 of 60% is... ~20% of the MALE population.

**Also of note** is that even though it *is* THE most common "parasitic/protozoan" infection, and it is most definitely a "sexually transmitted" critter...  "trich" (as it is called in the medical industry) is in fact **NOT one of the "standard STD panel" tests** that people usually obtain from "clinics" or family doctors, etc. (The "standard" STD panel is a 5 disease set: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes 2, HIV Antigen/Antibody {aka "Aids"}, and Syphilis\*).  

So if a woman is infected with it (again estimate of 5 million cases in the US each year, about 2/3 of those women) -- well unless she is experiencing some relatively EXTREME symptoms, she will probably remain unaware... unaware AND infectious. *(Mmmmm, going down on some random "Tinderella" chick sounds ever so much more FUN when you realize you might be swallowing some of THOSE little protozoans, doesn't it?  And then say 10 to 30 years later: BAM, aggressive prostate cancer!)*

Now of course if you yourself were not only non-promiscuous, but your SOLE lifetime partner was likewise non-promiscuous (both before meeting you AND becoming your intimate partner) -- then your "risK' would *virtually* zero (i.e. almost but not quite; because there ARE non-sexual ways that such things can be transmitted, including from mother to child).  Thus, once again we return to "ancient" knowledge and practices... and can see why men would have (evolved/adapted) a preference for young/virgins as the best potential wife material.

\* Note that **a lot of OTHER oncogenic (cancer causing) STD's are also notably absent from that standard panel;** including HPV (Human Papilloma Virus -- technically "virsuses" since there are HUNDREDS of "types" of HPV, most of which essentially *cannot* be tested for, and no "general antibody marker" will help, because HPV types also includes things like common hand warts {aka *Veruca Vulgaris*} which just about everyone gets infected with {via handshake or other skin-skin-contact}).

When it comes right down to it, the entire "get tested regularly" bit regarding STD's creates a significantly *dangerous* false picture; the plain truth of the matter is that the vast majority of different KINDS of STD's have no "test" whatsoever -- and of course that is just the infectious agents (bacterial, parasites, viruses) that we KNOW about, and KNOW are transmitted via "sexual" (intimate) contact.  There is quite probably a whole vast array of infectious agents out there -- including many that are likely to be both sexually-transmitted AND "long fuse" -- and yet which (like "trichmoniasis" in men) do not present with any ACUTE disease symptoms, and because of that have been considered *innocuous* and "mostly if not entirely harmless." And of course you will not be given a standard "test" for something that medicine is essentially either entirely "unaware" of, or thinks is of no importance.
