That is weird, but weird isn't necessarily creepy.  Does he have so much disposable income that he's really never going to miss $200?  If so, I would reserve judgement and just take this altruistic act at face value.

If he doesn't have the money to blow, he might just be socially inept and unaware that that's just not really appropriate this early in the relationship.  You may have to spend some time teaching/explaining social norms.  Don't know if that sounds appealing to you or not.
