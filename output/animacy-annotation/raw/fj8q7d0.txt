Imagine being so obsessed with trump that you make up stuff that Trump said and twist his words in order to attack him.

Anyone listen to what Trump said knows he is not saying the epidemic is a hoax.

It’s the reason why you won’t type out the sentence to show what he said.

You’re so willingly blind and ignorant that you refuse the truth even when it’s laid before you. 

I really feel bad for you as a person.  Trying to imagine what your days must be like. I’m sorry for triggering you.
