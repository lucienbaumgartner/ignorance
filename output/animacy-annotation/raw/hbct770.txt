Every person in the comments going “mentor bad. just do your job haha” clearly missed the point of your post, yet again.

It’s right there in the title. If you queue into an EX, without doing your homework, you should have 0 expectations about being able to clear. Often, you are relying on at least some of the 7 other people to know mechanics and be able to teach them. Then, you need at least some of the 7 other people to be able to execute and perform high enough DPS to beat further wipe mechanics or enrages. Mentors who call out people plainly expecting flawless, perfect customer service carries, sprouts who are abusive towards them or otherwise completely arrogant and ignorant of their fight responsibilities, the mentors are somehow the toxic ones???

It really feels like 90% of the replies that are like “mentors should have encyclopedic knowledge of all synced fights and infinite patient because they volunteered” are treating mentors like they should be Benevolent Gamer Gods. Acting outside of that purview, idk maybe because it’s your 14th duty after your third trainwreck Rathalos Ex, means you evidently deserved to be flamed.

Mentors are playing the game. Responding to mentors with a toxic experience should not be justified just because they elected to help for a duty.
