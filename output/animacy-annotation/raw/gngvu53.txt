Used to believe in god.  Then I turned eleven and was finally smart enough to logic out that it was absolute garbage.  And it wasn't that I was a super smart kid, it's just that these beliefs are so fucking idiotic.

How there are fully grown adults that are so pathetic and ignorant that they are still religious means they don't have enough critical thinking skills that can compare to an eleven year old.  It's repulsive.
