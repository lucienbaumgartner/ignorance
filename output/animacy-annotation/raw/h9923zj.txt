I picked for Frodo.  Aragorn saw Frodo’s armor like everyone else, but he didn’t let his closest friends lose hope. He then saw his army outnumbered and pumped them up for a final fight. I believe when sauron tempted to sneak into Aragorn thoughts, I believe that’s when he knew Frodo was still alive and unaware of. Sauron still viewed him as the main threat and still had no clue about Frodo… He turned knowing he was probably going to his death, knew to sacrifice all, just to give Frodo a chance. When he turned and said for Frodo. His eyes and how he said it. Got everyone on the same page. “they are going to the end..for a chance of hope.” When he charged is what did it for me. I can only imagine how the build up to that moment in the books could of been. He really did give Frodo his sword. His life.
