&gt;Your logic is god awful and pathetic.

But it's true. There's literally nothing good about America, its history is wicked and continues to be. 

&gt;. Oh you're a "veteran teenager" - no wonder you don't know a damn thing

Kids and teens can have a whole lotta knowledge and wisdom, you know. You don't just suddenly gain that as soon as you're an adult. You can be blessed with knowledge and wisdom when you're much younger. I would know. You can't say all teens don't know anything, that's just wrong and IGNORANT OF YOU TO SAY. Imagine going through some traumatizing shit and then gaining wisdom from it as you grow out of it. Pain humbles many people, and it sure did for me. So yes, I do have knowledge and understanding, do not assume otherwise especially because you don't know me.
