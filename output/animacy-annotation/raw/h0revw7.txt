A part of me really hopes Kaylee is aware of what bullshit Jill &amp; their cult is. I’d like to imagine her cursing them out and storming off to go be with some handsome, successful young man who treats her like a partner and not property. I’d like to imagine her in a pant suit working at a law firm. I’d like to picture her grabbing drinks with friends after work. I’d like to picture her going on a girls trip to Punta Cana. But I know that realistically, she is most likely very brainwashed and unaware of the outside world. It’s hard for anybody who has been raised by people who drank the kool aid that hard to grasp that their parents are not actually “protecting” them from an evil world. I hope with every fiber in my being that she, as well as all other victims of the cult, find the strength to break free. But I don’t feel hopeful.
