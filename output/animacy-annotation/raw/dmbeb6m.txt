I'm hoping that her involvement is something along the lines of Majima discreetly checking in on her from time to time or something. It the sense that we (and he) get to see how she is, make sure she's okay and safe, but that she remains unaware and uninvolved with the action. Or like, Majima goes and fucks someone up who was going to involve her in dangerous shit for some reason and we see her carrying on blissfully unaware in her normal life.

I think I'd be upset if they ruined her ending by having the Yakuza just drag her back in 20 years later after everything she went through and all that everyone did to ensure she'd have something of a normal life.
