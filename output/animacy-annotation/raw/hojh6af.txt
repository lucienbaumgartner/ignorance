I don’t know why you try anymore either. Your arguments are childish and ignorant of the issue at hand. You actively deafen yourself when it comes to what actually happened on Sunday. Boohoo, the FIA made some bad decisions this year. Not once was there a deviation from the rules. Not once was the FIA sporting code breached. Until Sunday. Max now has a Mickey Mouse championship, and that’s how it will always be. Enjoy it, you child. The integrity of the sport was lost on Sunday and everyone knows it except you kids who don’t have an active brain cell in your head so you keep shouting siLvErStOne until the cows come home.
