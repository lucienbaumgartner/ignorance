I like to think that albrechts intrusion into the void is what woke Wally up. I think the Void and Wally are one and the same. No real distinction, Wally IS the void. Reality IS. The void IS NOT.  He is the mirrored entity to our collective unconscious. Whereas our collective is unaware and composed of many, each with different goals, thoughts, feelings, and states of being... Wally is a singularity composed of one aware being with unknown goals. Eldritch and profane. 

Wally is the equivalent to us, but opposite. And by us I mean literally you and I. Just as we launch warframe the game and get a window into that world, so to does Wally peer into that universe from the outside. He is the antagonist to ourselves, the collective protagonists.

Yeah. That all makes total sense and doesn't make me sound like a rambling mad man at all.
