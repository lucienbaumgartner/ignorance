&gt;Freedom of speech doesnâ€™t mean freedom from consequences

Such a corporate friendly morally bankrupt aphorism.   

Freedom of speech is a principal not just law.  **1st amendment** doesn't protect you from social or private consequences as any grade schooler knows but that's only an aspect of free speech.

An actor fired for criticizing Israel or Christianity would *justifiably* have the same crowd calling for free speech (or some doublespeak equivalent) beyond just 1st amendment rights.  What's appropriate to fire someone over is always going to be arbitrary and hard to figure out but pretending like its a legal issue and not a moral one is both short sighted and ignorant of the past.  

Not to mention for non acting jobs letting people go is often only possible because of the horrendous employment rights in the U.S. where it shouldn't even be a free speech issue.
