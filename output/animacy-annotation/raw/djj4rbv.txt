I think you're being deliberately ignorant at this point.

Nothing about this e-mail says "they want an unaware and compliant citizenry". These are the words of one man trying to convince the Clinton campaign that they're doing things wrong; he's merely accusing them of helping to make voters less-informed. (Like I said, I happen to agree, but this isn't proof of come kind of "brainwashing" conspiracy.)

If you want to take the words at face-value without any attempt to understand them, then you're part of the problem as well.
