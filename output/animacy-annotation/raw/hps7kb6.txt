New earth creation? Yes but evolution? Ehh seems ignorant and dishonest to me. If we can’t to get technical the Theory of evolution states that all life evolved from single felled organisms which is very distinct from the Genesis narrative. Most people who accept the theory of evolution and not just micro evolution say that genesis is allegorical and not meant to be taken literally, I don’t know how you can reconcile that with Jesus lineage supposedly going back to Adam as it says somewhere in the NT. I’m not a Christian
