There are people like the ones you described but there are just as many people, if not more, who are kind and considerate. They may not be as noticeable as the people, who you say, are disconnected and unaware of their surroundings but they are there. And there are plenty of them. I'll have a couple of bad interactions but then I'll meet someone who is simply warm and compassionate, and this fills me with joy. I know that when I feel slighted or jaded I also feel similar to how you feel and I get frustrated with the people around me, but this is my perspective that's influenced by my own personal bias at the moment. And I think it's up to people who are considerate to communicate peacefully to those who do behave rudely or take advantage of others that they should stop doing what they are doing and try and be more considerate of others. This may not always be successful, but at least they try.... Sorry for the long reply. I hope you are doing well and that you have long and happy life!
