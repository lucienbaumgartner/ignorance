&gt; That it's good to listen to cops.

Pretty sure I said that it’s a pragmatic thing to do and that you should do it *almost always*. Which isn’t saying it’s *good* in the sense that you’re using the world (I.e. moral). Finding an example where it isn’t the pragmatic thing to do doesn’t disprove anything. Are you familiar with concepts such as outliers? 

Though it probably is good for society if we listen to cops seeing as we give them the responsibility of enforcing and upholding the law. Or are you saying we shouldn’t listen to cops? Or that listening to cops is bad? 

&gt; Again, the topic is if it's good or bad to listen to cops, and you asserted that it's good.

Clearly you’re misinformed and ignorant. That wasn’t ever the topic. You should improve your reading comprehension skills (that’s not an insult it’s a fact) so you can better read and understand what others write. This is exactly the kind of willful and personal ignorance that destroys valid and important discourse. 

&gt; Yes, obviously you don't care. That's the problem.

Nope. If it’s relevant to the topic at hand (which you appear to be woefully ignorant of - maybe that’s why you seem so confused all the time) explain why. Don’t expect others to do your work for you.
