The onus of proof is on the other side of the argument.

You have made claims against JBP.

If they feel he has been taken out of context, then they can easily show how he has been taken out of context.

Left wingers do this work all the time to debunk right wing lies. It takes seconds because we know the context and can provide it in an instant.

Right wingers yell “you’re taking him out of context” and then can’t provide any of that context. If they know enough to know he’s been taken out of context then they can provide said context.

What they usually mean is “I like this person and have listened to them for hundreds of hours, and what you’re saying doesn’t match the warm fuzzy feeling JBP gives me when he tells me I’m a good special who doesn’t have to work on anything regarding society and that being selfish and ignorant of discrimination is actually a virtue.”

Make them show their work. If they can’t show their work then they can shut their mouths (and they usually do).

Another point is if JBP is such a great communicator then how come no one can decipher the meaning of what he says. Nelson Mandela never had to accuse anyone of taking him out of context because he told clear truths that everyone understood and he was a great communicator. While in comparison JBP is a dishonest grifter who talks out of both sides of his mouth and uses the Motte and Bailey defence any time he’s confronted.
