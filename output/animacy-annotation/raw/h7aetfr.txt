Im not an atheist, but i dont know in what i believe in particular (i was raised as a catholic tho).

More or less a month ago, my mother and I almost died in a fire. 
Lights had gone out, we went to bed. She took a candle (inside an old plastic cup) to read for a while, but fell asleep with it still lit.

Long story short, she felt "someone" waking her up, and when she opened her eyes she saw a huge flame, coming from the charred remains of the cup, made of the lit candlewas and book she was reading, black smoke everywhere.
She sindlehandlely took care of everything and saved us both.

But the important part (to answer your mortality crisis) is that I was completely asleep. Like a rock. I normally dream a lot but that day I didnt remember any dreaming being done: just the blackness of my closed eyelids. 

When she told me all this the next day, and realized we could have died, I noticed I wouldnt have known, had I still been asleep st the moment of my death. I would have died in my sleep. And i noticed I felt nothing back then, I was asleep and unaware of the house almost burning down. I felt at peace in that dreamless sleep, *truly* at peace, and when I think about death being that, I dont fear it.

And about this being the only life I get... if reincarnation is real, I wont be able to remember it... and if a place for the soul to rest exists, then this is still the only life i get. so regardless, I still try to make this one count. I dont think its hard to accept, just a fact of life.
