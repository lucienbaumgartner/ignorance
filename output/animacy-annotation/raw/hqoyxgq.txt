&gt;totalslutalt: What they said was racist. Not violently so, but acting like race and racial slurs aren't issues because the legalized slave trade doesn't exist in America (slavery definitely still does) is wildly ignorant and reductive.
  
Expressing the opinion that POC today are not as oppressed  a people who were literally _enslaved_ isn't very racist in my opinion - a bit insensitive sure, but not racist. We all are of course entitled to our own opinions.
  
Personally, I reserve terms like racist for the Travis McMichaels of the world, the corrupt cops and judges who are biased and cause so much harm and to a far lesser degree the people who curate the signs at the Smithsonian that perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes.
