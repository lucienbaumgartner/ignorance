It's shrinkage. It's in jobs of course the most vulnerable share. Of course value's lost in the broader economy. You get what you pay for and you get $45B less as does the ancillary economy. The global shortage of both nurses and doctors approached by dethroning the US from being the most competitive job market. 

Your value judgements are arbitrary and ignorant. That nonsense was debunked by market basis in the 1870s. The ignorance stems from market basis being the most informed measure of subjective value. Insurance is a way a society sustains risk like bad health and accidents. A product. Is your issue with insurance now? It encompases medicare itself. 

Who says healthcare is makework? It has market proven demand as does its education, equipment, insurance and ancillary services. $45B annually, mostly in salary of healthcare workers because socialists are making arbitrary value judgements.
