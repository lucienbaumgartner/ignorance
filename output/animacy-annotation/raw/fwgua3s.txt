Don’t get me wrong, anyone attempting to argue against mask wearing **in the USA** is likely completely wrong and ignorant.

That florida town hall made me very sad, except for the woman who said she doesn’t wear underwear and tried to use that to argue we shouldn’t wear masks 
That made be laugh.  I think that guy you’re referring to was also wrong about the sizes of things yes.

In reality, The particle size is only important if every particle passes through the mask filter.
With proper PPE usage by medical personal, and an N95, you would have all of the air pass through the mask, many masks do not do this.

The reality of the surgical masks is that the filtration effect only lasts as long as the material is stable, as it breaks down while using it as it becomes wetter, making it less effective, hence why medical personal have to change them often. This decrease in efficiency is not high enough to not wear them, as the public should be limiting their contact with others at all time anyway 

I can’t help but feel that in the USA, mask wearing is being promoted as a stop gap measure because they’re no longer able to lock down properly, and this is the last thing they can do in order to try to limit the spread.
If they had the capacity to properly use other measures, they would be preferable.

It’s a difficult discussion to have because even the most intelligent, progressive people can fall victim to arguments which are not supported by science.
