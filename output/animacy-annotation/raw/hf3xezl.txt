What? That's your take? You do realise that there's also a chance that people who contract the virus will die right? It's a slow and painful death were you literally suffocate to death right?

Besides your "personal" choice affects all of us (see OP's post). Your choice not to get vaccinated means that you're more likely (compared to someone who is vaccinated) to require medical treatment against covid. This means that you're more likely to take up a hospital bed than if you contracted covid as a vaccinated person (you can't argue on this they are facts, not opinions. Proof: the majority of persons in society are vaccinated, but the majority of patients with covid in hospitals are unvaccinated).

Your choice means that the rest of us have to pay for more medical care that could have been prevented had you been vaccinated. Your choice affects all of us. And your choice is, quite frankly, unbelievably selfish and ignorant.

That is what I have to say. I'm not a sheep. I'm not sticking my head in the sand. I've read on this subject. I am well-informed. I'm well-educated. And unfortunately you're none of those.
