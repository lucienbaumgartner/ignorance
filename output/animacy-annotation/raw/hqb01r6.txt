I think there are a lot of conspiracy theories floating around about employers teaming up to hurt employees, conspiring to break your spirit, working behind the scenes to turn you against each other. It's true that this can happen on a small scale between employees and an immediate supervisor.

But in the big picture, the managers are not out to get you. They don't know who you are. They don't care who you are. They read books about management strategies and they read Forbes and Bloomberg and implement whatever policy seems trendy and they don't give a shit who you are or what you want. HR is not involved in some secret machination against workers. They are just simply ignorant and apathetic.
