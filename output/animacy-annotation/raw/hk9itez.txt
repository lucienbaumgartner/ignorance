Care to share the evidence of Kyle threatening them and in any way acting threatening prior to the point when he shot them?

The guy kyle killed, literally said "If I catch you alone, ill kill you". That same guy pushes you to the ground, and then attempts to steal your firearm... If you **don't** shoot that person in that scenario, you have a sick defective brain.

This is like, the text book case of self defense. Im not sure there has **ever** in all of recorded history, been a case with this much evidence, in which someone so properly acted in self defense. This is very likely going to be cited case law for self defense going into the future.

The irony of talking about flairs, while not living up to yours what so ever. How can you be "lib" while supporting the state prosecuting a child, when there is very clear cut evidence, he did no wrongdoing. The only argument is "having an AR15 under the age of 18, because he's 17", which again, if youre lib, could only believe that to be the state oppressing someone. The fact this went to trial **at all* is such a violation of his rights, not only should he get a huge payout from the state (and slanderous media), but its a level of tyranny, that should damn near start a revolution...

You must believe "the right to self defense ends at your doorstep" (which would mean, homeless people have no right to life), or you just don't believe people have the right to defend themselves from others, at all. Or maybe you are extremely naive and ignorant of reality, and believe something completely childish like "you have a right to self defense, but not to end someone elses life in the process". The second amendment exists for the very purpose, of enshrining the right to self defense (using *any* means necessary, including deadly weapons). Its the second amendment, because you have an unalienable right, to protect your life, and the life of your family (and the right of your property, which is actually the major factor between left/right. The right believes property should be considered worth enough to justify ending life to protect, the left does not). The reason it specifically allows the use of firearms, is because those who may wish to end your life, will likely have them. Thus to be equal in ability to defend your own life, you **require** the use of firearms. And the use of firearms, increases the likelyhood loss of life will occur in these situations. (Not that people didnt die from swords/knives when using them for self defense).

Does it suck that life was lost over something like this? Yes. Would the crimes of the perpetrators be considered worthy of the death sentence in a court of law? No. However, when you are acting in self defense, you make a decision (in a split second, no time to think), do you wait until they are half a second from actually ending your life? Do you chance they miss when they try to aim and shoot at you? Do you chance no one comes from behind and  takes your gun? The only way for it to be "equally just" to take someones life, is if they have **already taken a life**. Which is why, when someone seems like they may cause you or others, great bodily harm or death, that's when self defense kicks in. It would be lunacy to suggest you don't have a right to self defense, until you are mortally wounded first. In this case, the threshold for self defense has been long long crossed **AND** to top it off, Kyle showed great trigger restraint numerous times during this whole situation. The only argument is "Kyle should not have been there, if he didn't show up, those 2 men would still be alive" which is easily reversed to "If they didn't show up and commit crimes, they would still be alive". Also, because alternative reality don't actually exist, you have no idea what would have happened, if Kyle was not there. Maybe that gas station blew up, killing 20 people.

You act like Kyle was sitting on his property (or someone he knews property) yelling racial slurs and insults at "PoC", and then when they confront him, and one of them steps 0.5" on his property, he blows them away and claims self defense, when they were unarmed and not even acting all that threatening.
