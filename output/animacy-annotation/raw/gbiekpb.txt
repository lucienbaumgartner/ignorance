Ahh so you're not angry by people who are forgetful or something but rather by people who don't take responsibility for being forgetful.


And yes I do take responsibility, it's not my fault that I have it, but it's also not everyone elses fault and I try to make everyone else as unaware and uneffected by me own issues as much as I can. It's extremely exhausting, but that's life am I right
