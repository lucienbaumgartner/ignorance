How do you know what chromosomes someone has? If you are not their doctor, then it's none of your business. If you are a doctor, then it's time to go back to studying or quit.

There are cis men with XX chromosomes and cis women with XY chromosomes and nobody questions their gender.

Is your mom actually a dream like your username states and you didn't get love that you are so stupid and ignorant that hate people for no reason?

I'm not even gonna bother. Do some googling and don't be an asshole
