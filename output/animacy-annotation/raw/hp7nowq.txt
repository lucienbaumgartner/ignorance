I've dealt with a lot of Americans in my life being Canadian, and I have to say that the majority I've dealt with are both stupid AND ignorant.

That said, all the Americans that I've actually sat down and talked with, learned anything about, etc. were generally good, normal people.

That said, prejudice exists for a reason and so do stereotypes.

The belief that the most vocal people are the ones that represent a given demographic is true, but that only the stupid people are as loud lends more to the fact that the good people will never be heard because they don't want to be.

So, really, this is a failing of ALL people for not advocating more for all the good that they believe in and witness. The vocal majority should be proud, good, kind people... but some would tell you it has been engineered so that doesn't happen. I'd be inclined to agree.

If you believe in the good, spread it everywhere. Don't be quiet. Be louder than the idiots.
