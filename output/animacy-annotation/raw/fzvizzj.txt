Can confirm, my mother leaves her television on fox news most of the time she's home. It's unsettling to show and ask her about how people, mothers and grandmother's, veterans and attacks on the press, even events that fox news has shared and posted and she's completely oblivious and unaware that any of it happened and it's almost like it's background noise and that's it but she's so holds the true political views they share to a core degree and it's really sad
