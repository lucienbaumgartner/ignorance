Big difference in having to take responsibility for someone else’s child and owning up and taking responsibility for the actions that led to you yourself being pregnant. The fact that this woman is actually doing what she can to help the baby/mom shows that she actually cares and stands behind her position.

 Just because you believe that woman don’t have the right to murder infant babies doesn’t mean it’s your responsibility to now take care of all babies of all the people who couldn’t be responsible enough to either keep their legs closed, wear protection or use just one of the many other methods that are available out there to prevent having babies in the first place. It’s not rocket science people. 

If you’re that irresponsible and ignorant that you’re resorting to waiting until you’re pregnant so you can rip your child out piece by piece instead of using one of the many other methods beforehand than you have issues. And calling them a “clump of cells” isn’t fooling anyone but yourself. Confirmation bias. Guaranteed that the same people calling unborn babies a “clump of cells” are the same ones calling bacteria on mars “life”.
