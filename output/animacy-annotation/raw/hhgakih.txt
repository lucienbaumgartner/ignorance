It's impossible, islam explicitly bans it as this rewards you hell. Hinduism being old and unaware of other religion (dharma literally meant justice before) doesn't explicitly bans conversion it's more open and that's why hindus are easy to convert. We(As in common population) think that  all religion teach about peace and love.
