Once while I was living in Nebraska my downstairs neighbor played what sounded like aggressive yodeling music. I was young, and unaware that apartments in Nebraska don't have any soundproofing, of any sort, at all, so I assumed the neighbor was being intentionally loud. I put my speakers face down on the floor and blasted The Beautiful People for maybe ten to fifteen minutes. I am not fucking kidding you: the paramedics came and wheeled the old man who lived below me out on a stretcher. 
So. 
Be ready for that.
