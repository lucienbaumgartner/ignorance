My friend I understand where your anger comes from.  I can’t grasp the depth of it, I’m a 5’11 man who works out regularly so Im not someone people trifle with at night.  That being said I am aware of the privilege I have and that not everyone is offered the same privilege in life.  The people you deal with are uneducated and unaware of the reality of your struggles.  In truth so am I but I believe you when you say you’re scared at night and I wish it didn’t have to be that way.  You deserve to be angry but I would like to offer that the anger you feel while justified is not worth your energy.  You are better than the children on the internet who trivialize the struggles you face. 

 I apologize for the fear you have to deal with and the frustration you have dealt with.
