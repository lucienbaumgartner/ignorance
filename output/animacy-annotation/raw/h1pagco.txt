&gt;	If someone goes to a black person saying they’re not born here without any evidence it’s racist
 
What if they do it to a white person?

&gt;	He only said it to Ted Cruz after the media called out his hypocrisy.

That’s incorrect 

He called out cruz’s legitimacy to be president just the same.

&gt;	Clearly, you are not black 

Clearly how?


&gt;so you don’t know what it’s like to be on the reviving end of racism towards black people. 

But youve yet explwhy it’s racist.  Racism is thr same regardless of race.  

&gt;You have zero credibility. 

Why is that?

&gt;You are obtuse and ignorant of what racism 

Ive repeatedly asked you to explain yourself and you haven’t.

&gt;or dog whistles mean.

So, now its dog whistling?

&gt;	Going to a Black person and saying they’re not American is the equivalent of saying “ go back to your country” 

What if you say it to someone other than black?


&gt;if you don’t recognize that you are an idiot.

Then why can’t you explain why that is?

&gt;	Just because you are too stupid and ignorant to know what racism sounds like doesn’t mean it isn’t racist.

So, how is it racist?

You could simply answer the question.

&gt;	And it isn’t because Obama is just black. 

How do you know it was because he is black?

&gt;It’s called context with American history. 

What context in American history makes it racist?

&gt;Sorry you’re uneducated. 

Then simply answer the question.

&gt;Educate yourself and stop asking stupid ass questions thanks.

So, you’re not going to explain yourself?
