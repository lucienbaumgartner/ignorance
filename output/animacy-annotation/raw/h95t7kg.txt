Nope sorry I absorb zeta-g type 42 atomic particles through the skin, it makes it difficult to be around others or to find work as I have to remain as naked as possible at all times.  


I also don't have the ability to speak in real life, I can only talk with my eye's and generally most humans can't make it past my hunter stare due to their soul reflecting nature. Luckily for me my species reincarnates so there is no need to date in order to reproduce offspring.  
We weren't brought here to comingle or mix with them anyways, I'm simply here to record data to use in further experiments in the other worlds.  


Note to Head Researcher Delta 512, the Lab species on planet Gaia 665 are still under the illusion that they require oxygen for life, It seems that the liquid lubricant on the planet they refer to as Aqua still holds enough of chemical BXT 6071 to keep them all relatively delusional and unaware of their situation.
