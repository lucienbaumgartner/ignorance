lol government broadcast propaganda is whats turning people against American Conservatives? Really? Its their ideas and policies backwards and don't work anymore, also its members/voters who are rude, unempathetic, noncaring, selfish and ignorant that are turning people against them. Not to mention the reality denial about COVID and the Election I know is what turned some of my friends and family to cut communications with the hardcore trumpers in their lives. Them just being themselves is what is making people hate their ideology and persons
