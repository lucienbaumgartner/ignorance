No you are the one putting out misinformation?

Fuck you for your ignorant fat shaming. 

I am going to repeat this simply for you sense you are so ignorant and stupid to grasp basic concepts:

Science has proven, that a obese person who exercises regularly will have a significantly smaller risk of heart problems (which is the best objective measure for "being healthy" since this term in itself is so vague), than a normal weight person who doesn't exercise.

That is science. I'm not going to argue with you, if you can't accept that basic fact.
