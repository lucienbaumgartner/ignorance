Quitting is definitely the path of least resistance but I want to speak to my sensei first. I'm really, really, concerned about the younger girls. I'm comfortable being a bitch. The younger girls are uncomfortable and unaware that they can be mean to an adult and it's okay. I have to stand up for them now.
