I wouldn't necessarily say dumb. Misinformed, uninformed, and unaware of the depth and scope of fields represented in MPH programs is more accurate. If you're attempting to apply for a position where an MPH isn't necessarily the first choice, it may be incumbent on you to sell yourself a little harder in how your work may be applicable.
