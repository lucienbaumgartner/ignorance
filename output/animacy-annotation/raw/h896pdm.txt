I’m not gonna engage with this hypothetical trans animal narrative because there’s no observable or scientific basis for that and it’s frankly incredibly insulting that you’d use that as a comparison to people like myself who struggle with gender dysphoria. Pronouns are used for utility. If I look like a woman, live as a woman, In all facets of life present as a woman, it would be more confusing to be referred to as a “man” when clearly I am not. Genitals are a sign of ones sex, not gender, and even that isn’t always binary. Thats why we dont present birth certificates when using the bathroom. Sex and gender are not the same. Sex is your physical anatomy, gender is a mix of your psychology and cultural roles. 

There’s a common theme I notice among transphobes and transphobic arguments like the ones your attempting to make, that trans people are somehow delusional and unaware of the reality of our condition. It’s in fact the opposite, I’m well aware I was born with a penis and that I was assigned male at birth and everything that goes with it. I’m not so crazy that I ignore all that because I “believe” I’m a woman. I am a woman because that is my gender. The incredible distress I feel because of the misalignment with my gender and my sex is only proof of that. 

At the end of the day nobody can force you to do anything. Just as you can be racist or homophobic if you choose, you can choose to be transphobic and Misgender us for the sake of whatever thinly woven convictions you may wish to have about us. 
But if you choose to open your mind, educate yourself beyond the middle school textbooks definitions of biology, and have an ounce of empathy for the daily struggles we face, you would gender us correctly and go about your business.
