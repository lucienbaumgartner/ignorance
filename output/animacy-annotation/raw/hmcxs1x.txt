My point is, in short, that Lauren was very immature and unaware of the world when she married into the Duggar family. She was still very immature when she started posting about Asa. And she still is, presumably, immature -- we just don't have her documenting it on social media.

Honestly, I'm a bit more lenient of her initial behavior (even though it's undeniably obnoxious) because human brains aren't done developing until mid 20s or early 30s (depending on the scholarly research being done) and everyone shows their ass before they can legally drink. Everyone. I'm glad the internet wasn't as much of a thing when I was being immature.

And, ultimately, I don't think we're disagreeing as much as we think we are -- I definitely think that Lauren was obnoxious and careless when dealing with her miscarriage, especially in relation to Joy's, but I don't think she was malicious. A dipshit, sure.
