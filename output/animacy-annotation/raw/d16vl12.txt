I am saying that remaining tense and rigid when forces such as car wrecks are involved,  is impossible. The state of your muscles when hit by a car is about as big of factor as which way the wind is blowing.  And there can even be a counter argument that being aware and tense in the millisecond before you are hit helps, as adrenaline is released.  Think about situations of lesser force, say a sucker punch. Does being unaware and loose help then? No. Then how is it going to help as we exponentially increase the collision force?
