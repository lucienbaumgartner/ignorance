Not OP, but why do you assume that it is only a difficult choice to abort for women in situations like OP? Abortion can be an extremely difficult choice for any woman, regardless of when it’s performed, and it’s rarely done “for the sake of a bad choice or convenience.” Sparing a child from being raised by someone who isn’t capable of doing it isn’t “convenience.” Choosing to end a pregnancy because you have an abusive partner is t doing it “for the sake of a bad choice.” 

You are wholly misinformed and ignorant of this topic and your blind assumptions don’t add anything positive to the conversation.
