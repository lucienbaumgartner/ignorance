What’s hilarious is that you think this constitutes a rational argument. You are so uneducated and delusional that you really don’t understand what an argument is and how it differs from wild speculation. You feel that you can just casually dismiss an entire major field of science based on a few sentences about pork in legislation. You are so deeply, deeply stupid and ignorant that you simply cannot see how dumb and crazy your views are. It’s really a shame. Like I said, I hope your kids actually get an education.
