What if Ramses IV is still alive, along with some loyal followers, in some sort of isolation/quarentine? You'd be in a situation-reversal in which the living king was buried with his living servants by a kingdom of the eternally undead. 

Perhaps there's some secret/sinister reason this undeath has spread - maybe the Masked are unaware and unintelligent because the new, aware undead are feeding off their energy somehow? Or some sort of pact with whatever being the Masked *had* been in control of, a god of death or the afterlife? Maybe they feed off the energy that would be used for reincarnation?

That would mean ultimately there would be a tipping point where there is too little energy to sustain the aware undead - maybe then they'd have to go out and find more corpses?
