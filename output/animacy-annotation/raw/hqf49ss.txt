As a fan of My Little Pony, TRUST ME that I understand what you're going through. The key thing to remember of course is that the problem lies with them, and not you. You found a toxic community and should name and shame them; though if you can't bring yourself to do so, just write them off. Making ignorant and hateful judgements is the opiate of the small mind. Today, there's very little "brony-hate" because the haters grew up, or they've discovered that they too enjoy one or another form of "children's entertainment" (after all, the hallmark of excellent children's entertainment is that adults can enjoy it too).
