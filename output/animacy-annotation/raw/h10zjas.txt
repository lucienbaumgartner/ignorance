It's hilarious that you claim my argument is "bad", yet you clearly didn't even take the time to fully read it.

I never said open relationships are impossible, only that the knee-jerk reactionary shit about "doing it wrong" to a neglected partner are worthless and ignorant of the practical limitations of relationships.  And that this is something I and others have directly experienced. The fact that open relationships put more time-strain on people than monogamy, all other factors being equal, is undeniable.

And the funniest part is that I heard that "love isn't finite, but time is" concept in alt.poly, the original online hub for the poly community, and it was widely acknowledged as true.
