There are 9 planes, one for each alignment. The central plane, True Neutral, is the Material Plane. Each other plane is united by their alignment, and wants control of the multiverse. In theory, the Material is the easiest to conquer because it's not as united as the other planes are. But every other plane knows this, so they're fighting a proxy war. Whoever claims the material plane, claims the multiverse, and all the major powers know this.

Most humanoids are Unaligned. They have no stake in The War for the Multiverse, and most are unaware that there's anything going on. But each time some adventurers wipe out a cult to Orcus, or a necromancer burns down a village, that's a tiny skirmish that feeds into The War. All wars are just skirmishes and campaigns within The War.

This informs how I do tiers of play. Tier 1 characters are unaligned, and unaware of The War. Tier 2 are aware of good/evil/chaotic/lawful factions vying for power. Tier 3 sees that all of these factions represent the other planes, and are fighting on their behalf in The War. Tier 4 is when players are either *the* representative of their god/plane/alignment, or the party have stayed Neutral and just want to keep all of the other planes out of the Material.

I haven't run a campaign fully 1-20 in this setup yet, but it's a fun idea and helps inform what alignment means to me in my games.
