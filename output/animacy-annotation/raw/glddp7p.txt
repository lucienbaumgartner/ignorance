Different person here, but u/guaukdslkryxsodlnw is actually spot on. It's extremely well established that policy can affect criminal behavior, and I find it very odd to see that so many people here lack such a basic understanding of policy and criminology. 

There's tons of research showing that [states with loose gun laws fuel gun violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993697/) elsewhere in the country. [Plenty of studies](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-policy-and-research/_archive-2019/_pdfs/digtal_update_Webster_Vernick.pdf) have found that stronger gun laws in general [limit the illegal dissemination](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/3/184) and acquisition of firearms, while looser gun laws [supply criminals](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/2021/01000/Firearm_Homicide_Incidence,_Within_state_Firearm.6.aspx) with firearms in other states that they otherwise would've [struggled to obtain](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/19/1/26.abstract). This is also clear in the [official ATF tracing data](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2018) between states and I could link you [many more studies](https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/9000/Firearm_Laws_and_Illegal_Firearm_Flow_between_US.98024.aspx) conducted at both the [regional](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677236) and [state](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.5.4.200) level on how a [variety of policies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704273/) can drive down the trafficking and acquisition of [illegal firearms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40471-019-00199-0) as well as [gun violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29507953) in neighboring states. As [studies of specific areas](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7538&amp;context=jclc) have shown, "transaction costs" of illegal firearms can respond to gun laws that could make it [more difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27758829), risky and expensive for criminals to obtain guns, but surrounding areas with weak laws [counteract these effects](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(20)30317-2/fulltext#seccesectitle0005) even though [consistent regulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462834/) could help address this issue. Add onto that the fact that (Southern) states with generally loose gun laws are directly responsible for a [majority of the hundreds of thousands of stolen guns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367592) that make their way into criminal hands across the country, and I think it you'll get a clear picture of how our loose gun laws do enable criminals to get their hands on guns more easily.

Every single one of those links goes to a peer-reviewed study in a scientific journal or official government reports / statistics, and it's only a portion of what's out there.

The argument that "criminals don't follow laws so gun laws don't work" is so incredibly weak, illogical and ignorant that it really has no place in this debate.
