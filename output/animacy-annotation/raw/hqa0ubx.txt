Lmao you seriously think the Texas post 6 week pregnancy abortion ban is the same as how the taliban treats women? Lmfao that’s literally how I know you live in a fucking echo chamber. it really just shows what a fucking moron you are. Women in Afghanistan aren’t allowed abortions at all they can’t go to a neighbouring state for one lmao the taliban also throws gays off buildings blind folded? Pretty sure that’s not a law in Texas lmfao or how about the fact if a woman is raped she has to catch her rapist and bring him to the police if she doesn’t and reports the rape then she is punished for adultery and that is usually being stoned to death or beheaded in a public setting. If she is to accuse her rapist she needs a man as a witness or two or three women witnesses because they literally view a woman’s word is half that of a mans word. You’re ignorant and dumb as fuck. I mean what? Lmao what world do you live in. Fucking absolute moron.
