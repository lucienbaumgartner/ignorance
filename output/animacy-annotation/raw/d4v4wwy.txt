Oh haha yeah. I thought that was kind of the whole obvious thing of why it's so creepy. That that disparate feeling of our world with these dark cracks, with yellow and pink eyes, as dark as oblivion in the center peering forth. Or like when from the corner of your eye you see him there. A man that isn't a man with something so terribly WRONG about him and then you turn your head to look and... he's gone. And you tell yourself you're being silly. 

And then, worse still, you forget you ever saw him. You're back to your regular life, unaware and undefended from that foulness that creeps just at the corner of your vision, waiting. This isn't some fantasy, after all. You're just a person... you're not important enough for something so grand. 

Besides, there are many between places in this country where everyone passes, but no one lives. I mean, if someone disappeared there, who would know, anyway...
