I know right?

This desire to protect the continuation of a bloodline is just ridiculous to me, you are not descendants of long gone dynasties or regimes or anything notable to begin with so why should the preservation of a bloodline that nobody cares about at all, matter in any context. 

If anything, don't always expect a child to be a willing participant to want to continue this process of procreation.

I'd never subject a child to life all because I want a bloodline to be continued, it is an ignorant and selfish reason in itself.
