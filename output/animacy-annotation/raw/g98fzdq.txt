I’ve been there. Wanted to go straight to the hospital to like take some meds or have doctors deal w that horror heart palpation you get. 

Had my first panic attack out of nowhere when I smoked too much weed. My friends refused to let me go to the hospital and just told me to “chill out” while I could not sit still, my brain was exploding, trembles, etc. I thought it was schizophrenia since I’m predisposed to it(uncle had it and was a pothead and huge psychedelic 70s guy which didn’t help bringing it out), also thought it was psychosis, etc because I had absolutely no idea what a panic attack even was. So horrifying but I’m glad you’re fine.

All in all, not knowing what a panic attack is just makes them wayyyy worse and more scary. There’s legit fear of dying of heart attack, some psychological disorder brought out out of the blue (yes I was young, naive, and unaware of mental disorders).
