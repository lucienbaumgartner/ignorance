Oh. I might take back my ENFP diagnosis and replace it with ENTP, because 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;i don't try to analyze peoples feelings around me i don't really care that much. 

I noticed this in your original post, and concluded it as Fi, but thinking about it? This could be a very weak tertiary Fe, too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; do have a hard time expressing my emotions but mainly because i'm never quite sure what i'm feeling. 

Fi PoLR (Point of least resistance, meaning that it's the function that you're most vulnerable and unaware of how to handle). Indicates ENTP.

&gt;i definitely enjoy having knowledge for the sake of knowledge like i strive to be the person in a story where the hero can go to if they ever need a super rare random piece of knowledge. so like i pride myself on being the noah foster or the randy meeks of the group. 

Woah.. Ti makes sense here.

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought you were ENxP, leaning ENFP because you seemed to have tertiary Te. But - taking a look at this where you go more in-depth with your Fi/Te vs Ti/Fe axis, I think you might actually lean ENTP (just a pretty emotionally turbulent one).
