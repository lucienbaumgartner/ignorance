Just sad, I watched my beloved grandmother die from COPD and straight up, I wouldnt wish difficulty breathing on anyone.

That video of Trump huffing, puffing and wincing is giving me anxiety.  I can still see and hear my grandma struggling to just get out of a chair.

And this fuck is so stubborn and ignorant that he'd put his health behind his image.  What a fool.
