Friend, your enemy is the devil who is using your mother to deliver death to others and she is both unaware and unable to stop him. That's why you should pray for her salvation. 

1 Peter 2:19 For this [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
2:20 For what glory [is it], if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God.

Luke 6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
6:34 And if ye lend [to them] of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of The Highest: for He is kind unto the unthankful and [to] the evil.

David showed love to his enemy (Saul) and God took care of Saul so that David didn't have to. If the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, He will do as much for you too but if you have not the Spirit of the Lord on you, then it is by reason of your own sin that death visits you.
