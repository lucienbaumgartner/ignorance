I just commented with a mod a bit, apparently they ban their fair share of askgaybros users. The issue is that I’m trying to highlight here is that people seem to be ignorant and unaware of what casual transphobia looks like. 

It’s similar to casual homophobia in that it’s not loud and blatant hatred and ignorance, is exclusion and micro aggressions and conversations or turning into the same genitals topic that is extremely prevalent here.
