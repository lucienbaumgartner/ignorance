Definitely interested in seeing what's up. The iPhone has a lot to compete with these days with Android expanding and evolving quickly. In order to remain competitive, I'm assuming Apple will be releasing something kick ass. If I find it to be better than the current Android phones then I will be switching. Clearly most of the /r/Android users are extremely close minded and unaware that the next iPhone can be equal to or better than most Android phones out right now or coming out soon. 

And as far as the retina display goes, just go to the store and compare the two. You WILL notice a difference. Not an Apple fanboy, just trying to approach this objectively.
