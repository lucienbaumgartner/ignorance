Every once in a while you read something so stupid and ignorant that you don't even know where to begin with.

First of all, you don't even understand what is happening here. Nobody is banning Madrid fans shitposting about Barcelona on their own subreddit. The no-trolling/brigading rule applies for "outsiders", or in other words Barcelona fans coming to their sub and vice-versa.

So as far as we are concerned they can ridicule us as much as they want on their own territory, but that's none of our business.

Second of all, these mass trolling and bridages or whatever you want to call them not only will lead to negative consequences long term, but the latter can get our entire subreddit in trouble. This is why mod teams of different football subs often communicate with each other so situations like these can be avoided and discouraged.

Third, just in case it's not common sense already, trolling by itself is just stupid and indecent. Chances are if you're willing to act like a total dickhead towards a certain group of unknown people, on their own subreddit, a supposed safe space for that group of people, then you are probably also an asshole that sooner or later will become toxic on /r/barca as well.

I can go on and on but you get the point already.
