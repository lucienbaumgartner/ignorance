After seeing what just happened in America, yes and no. It'd be great if the checks and balances actually withstood corruption and bullshit. I'd feel better about it if I believed more voters were aware of this, and not so desensitised and unaware that Murdoch is playing the exact same game here. Just with a less ridiculous stooge in charge. Frog slowly boiling in the pot, and all that.

Feels like our checks and balances are strictly "notional" these days
