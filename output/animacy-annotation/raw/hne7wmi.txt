Agreed. It’s contact info. If you’re a rich and powerful person who asks for another rich and powerful persons contact info from a mutual friend you may get it. 

I’m not trying to absolve anyone from blame but there is a high likelihood’s lot of people in this book could be totally innocent and unaware of anything actually going on and still listed in the book. 

That being said those who knew/partook should have the book thrown at them. But it doesn’t mean that anyone listed is guilty
