I actually don't really know, it was a left wing subreddit that got banned so lot of users started going to other subs and shitting them up.

But yeah just for example in a case like this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/lo06na/delia_is_back_and_hes_really_sorry/go5hi2h/

Is that not crossing the line and making the intention clear? If not, what actually is the line?

Because it feels like shitty transparent trolls are being allowed to run rampant on the sub, with only the most paper thin technical excuses. And we have to pretend to be almost autistically dumb and unaware of *anything even happening at all* because the bar for evidence has been set to a totally unrealistic degree and we have to define to a legal standard what the crime of trolling and intentional disruption on the Joe Rogan subreddit means.
