For the most part it’s meaning- tho a little bit of both tbh (like actually u guessed both of those cards correct lmao I’m doing Jason and piper as emperor/empress and Luke as the hanged man)  
But Like for these 3 I did Percy as the fool since it’s him at the beginning of his journey, innocent and unaware of what he’s getting himself into which kinda describes Percy before TLT well IMO. Hazel is the magician bc I kinda focused on her mastering her mist abilities (also- being chosen by the literal goddess of magic, Hecate lmao) as the magician is about being able to manifest everything because you already have the skills to do so. Rachel as the high priestess is more of a “well, duh” one aka using the title of the card lmao bc she’s the Oracle, but I mean like sacred knowledge fits perfectly anyway. I also did try to keep key points of the original cards- like hazel’s hand positions meaning connecting the heavens and the earth, Percy being oblivious to stepping into the ocean as the fool is oblivious to the cliff, and the 2 columns behind Rachel meaning duality. BUT I’m also taking some liberty with the cards and making them my own and making them PJO vibes so some symbols and meanings are new- like the flower in percy’s card is actually calypso’s moonlace- so not only does the white flower symbolize innocence but future sadness and future regret. Or I added Rachel’s blue hairbrush so that she reps confidence and the idea that you shouldn’t be underestimated. Basically I put research into the meanings and study the art of various decks before drawing each card, but also sometimes a card is just gonna be the right vibe.
