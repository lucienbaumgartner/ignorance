It'll still be a 2 party system when the shell leftover of the DNC can't get votes if Bernie starts his own party.

We need everyone to understand how we got here, or the mistakes can't be fixed. 

Feel free to share any of this evolving copy/paste.

They are afraid you'll read about Hillary Clinton promoting Trump's campaign to distract from the rise in Sander's popularity and her email investigation. (It's from April 2015 - two weeks after she announced running for president, not "after she was mathematically the winner")

"[Here is one of those supposed unimportant emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120) And it's not illegal to look at. [Despite what CNN says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A).

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

There is an active effort to contain news about the Podesta emails. It continues to be met w/ ridicule and mocking.

The DNC establishment thinks they can wait out the storm and will not have to change away from failed policies and dirty trick politics.

Go into any current event relating to Trump and see how far you have to go to see the "But her emails...".

They've already sold the meme at this point, and part of the purpose is to confuse you over the fact there are actually *3 separate email stories at play*.

**Email story 1)** Private Server [w/ classified info that was discovered during Benghazi investigation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy) 

FBI ruled 
&gt; [To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system)

**Email story 2)** [DNC email leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) (blamed on Russia, most likely upset staffers from sabotaging Sanders)

The Washington Post reported
&gt; Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. 

**Email story 3)** John Podesta's personal emails [(Hillary's campaign chair who had his account accessed from a phishing scam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails) *These are the most damaging emails which include proof of media collusion, sabotaging Sanders, and more* 

The Podesta emails are also the emails involved in the "Pizzagate" conspiracy, which I suspect is meant to delegitimize the other scandals.

Try correcting anyone who is making inaccurate statements about the primaries, or providing sources to "The Pied Piper strategy" where [Hillary Clinton's campaign strategy was to promote Donald Trump](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/) as a fringe candidate with the *intentional* consequence  that Trump dominating the airtime meant Clinton could continue as the presumptive nominee.

Have you heard about Debbie Wasserman Schultz's employment history w/ Clinton and the DNC, along w/ Tim Kaine? 

[Schultz was Clinton's losing campaign co-chair in 2008 against Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz#2008) while Kaine was DNC chair, but he then [resigned and Schultz became chair](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0405/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz-A-good-fit-to-replace-Tim-Kaine-at-DNC). Schultz had [calls for her resignation in 2014](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/democrats-debbie-wasserman-schultz-111077), but maintained the position to rig the primaries against Sanders and then received [honorary Clinton chair in 2016 after resigning](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/07/24/mission-accomplished-dnc-clinton-hires-wasserman-schultz-top-post). Meanwhile [Kaine was chosen as VP pick](https://thinkprogress.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-tim-kaine-hillary-clintons-vice-president-pick-832de5b910a0#.5ad2lazel)

and [Donna Brazile](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donna-brazile-wikileaks-cnn.html)? She is now sitting head of the DNC.

[Also a reminder Sanders would have won](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/) if Hillary Clinton didn't promote Donald Trump as president.

[And another email where it is explained to Podesta (Hillary's campaign manager)](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

&gt; And as I've mentioned, **we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.** The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

**Who they try to blame besides Hillary &amp; the DNC** 

- Russians

- Jill Stein/Green Party
