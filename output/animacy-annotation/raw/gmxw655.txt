I think you're being particularly naive and unaware of conditions in India. I'm not an expert either but when it comes to certain economic forces you can't just vote the problem away. This issue is a consequence of how  insanely competitive it is in India and that there are much larger problems than unpaid internships. Why would politicians focus on that when there is significantly larger issues like improper waste removal, bad infrastructure and much more. 

But sure, let's say these political candidates do exist, people vote and legislation is passed to ban unpaid internships. That doesn't change the reality to most students that there aren't enough jobs for everyone.
