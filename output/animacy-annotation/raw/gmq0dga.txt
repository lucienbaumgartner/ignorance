For every struggling mentally ill person on their way to recovery that has anxiety with \*sparkles\*, you have one person unwilling to acknowledge their issues who goes on to terribly abuse people, neglects others as a result of their poor mental health, or maybe just ends their own life. The romanticization of mental illness is not just disrespectful and annoying, it's complete fucking bullshit and shows that the people encouraging it are utterly stupid and ignorant of what mental health actually means. Mental illness can only be romantic or pretty if you look away at every point in time at which it inconveniences you.

And recently, PTSD has become the new mental health buzzword, or rather trauma has. People don't know what trauma actually is or feels like, then use it to describe minor inconveniences or negative experiences, shift the goal posts for what people believe it is, and suddenly we have the masses blow up their life experiences to justify their unwellness. Like.. yes, you can be sad for being rejected or failing at something or just because. No, you can't say you are traumatized by something completely natural healthy and not abusive. FUCK OFF.
