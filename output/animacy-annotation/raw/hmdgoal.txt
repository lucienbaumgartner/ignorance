You’re such a gross person that I really don’t wanna engage in a conversation with you. Because I can tell that no matter what I tell you about the damage that sexual assault has on victims and such, your worldview is so skewed and ignorant that I could never say anything that would get you to see the situation differently. It would be a waste of time.
