Then why make that ignorant and childish comment in the first place? You weren't trying to "level the meme to reality". Now you're back peddling try to play the middle ground to try and make me look ridiculous. Now to your original "make up" comment:

Bottom line is, if you KNOW she's wearing make up then... where's the lie? She can't hide it, it's on her face, she put it there. It's obvious. There is NO deception because you know she's doing it.

Can you look at some, just look at them, and tell 100% whether or not their personality is genuine or fake? You can't. As you said, most men don't wear make up so that leads me to the conclusion that personality change is more common among men.

Personality change IS deception. That is harmful. 

Though of course it is done by both men and women and is wrong on both counts and of course you can leave someone for their poor behavior. Obviously. You just tried to pin it all on make up alone, initially.
