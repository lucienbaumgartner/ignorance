I always hate that second one. It's so disrespectful and ignorant of the actual work people in restaurant or other kinds of food service do. 

It's a fucking hard job. You aren't just "flipping burgers," usually you're understaffed and doing the job of two people, picking up and stocking heavy ass boxes, dealing with Karen's, coordinating orders for completion, you're on your feet all day. It's a hard job.
