His whole body bounced when he got hit that was it just a bounce because of the amount of force used in the attack had he been alive you would’ve seen much spasms below the abdomen, legs kicking out, back arching, feet slamming on the floor or shooting out like they’re trying to kick the air, you would’ve seen struggle, at the very least he was in a sedated state or already a vegetable after the first slice. Because there’s no voluntary movement to be seen whatsoever. 

I don’t see any reason why she would argue with you guys against something everyone can see like it’s not even up for debate as soon as the esophagus is cut the pain, fear and resulting trauma alone would make him numb to everything anyway so even if he is alive he’s immobilized and unaware of his surroundings.

Really what even was the counter argument lol

What you said was simply fact no room for opinion
