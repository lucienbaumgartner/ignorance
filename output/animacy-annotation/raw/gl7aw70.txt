The rules:

A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener's position, or (2) make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to stop and/or change direction before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.

Bogut was great at backing up while screening (moving in the same direction as the opponent) in such a way that he obstructed their path a little longer than he would have standing still. He definitely set illegal screens sometimes too, but a lot of the ones people thought should be called because he moved his feet were actually legal.
