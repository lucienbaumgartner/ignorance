My son is only 16 but so far I am very happy with who he is becoming. I have never had any issues at school other than a few low grades due to laziness and not turning in homework in time. He is wise beyond his years and very smart. Good grades come easy to him which was not the case for me. 

My only complaint would be his countless hours playing League of Legends. Sometimes i feel like I have to drag him out of his room. We have dinner together every night and one night a week we leave the house and do something like movies, a walk, beach, etc.  I am a homebody so I guess he gets that from me. He is very shy and unaware that he is a pretty handsome kid. He has a great heart and loves his family. I am a very proud Mom.
