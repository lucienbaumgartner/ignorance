Sold out online. Bummer. I grow peppers and would love to add this to my garden.

OP, when it fruits, can you save me some ripened seeds and dry them out? I'll pay for you to ship them.

(edit)

Downvotes, really? Was unsure the type of pepper since the sight was uninformative and unaware that it wasn't their own cross.
