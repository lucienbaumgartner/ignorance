No, it's fine. I voted for him, proudly, and I too am used to lashing out in defense of myself and my perspectives simply for being a 'Trump supporter', which I don't think is fair, but eh, reddits, right? We're both entitled to our opinions. I respect the fact that you think his decisions and policies are wrong. Personally, I think they're right. The truth? Maybe somewhere inbetween? We'd have to unpack each one and, as I always encourage, look behind the curtain that the main stream media put up, because they manipulate information to push certain narratives, narratives that I believe come with the motive of socially engineering less educated and ill-informed public. Or to quote the Wikileaks emails obtained from the Clinton campaign and DNC, to 'create an unaware and compliant citizenry'. That's a literal quote from their emails. That should terrify anyone who blindly trusts information being disseminated by them or any of their affiliates. Wouldn't you agree?
