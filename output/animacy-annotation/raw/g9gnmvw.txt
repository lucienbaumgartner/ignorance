What does this behaviour look like, out of interest?  I'm not sure I ever think my way is the only way, but usually the best way given the information there and then.  It's just a question of speed, to my mind.  Someone says, 'solve this problem', and you do.  It is A correct solution at that point, and because I don't want to fuck around waiting for others to catch up I push my solution as the one to go with.   Am I describing the less than unbiased approach or are other INTPs adamant and unaware of the bias?
