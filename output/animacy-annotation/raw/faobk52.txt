&gt;What do you think happens when you call millions of people racist and ignorant, that they are going to work for you? 

I think that if they ARE racist and ignorant than exactly what happened in yesterday's vote will happen. 

They will vote in an ignorant racist and carry on being racist but - through their ignorance - never owning it.
