I really dislike people calling well documented humanitarian crimes, fake....And intelligence does not imply mental stability or a lack of bias...in fact at the upper end it tracks closer to mental health issues.  

&gt; aren't smart enough to know the truth as if these 20 year old students at MIT are so stupid and ignorant that they need to be shown the correct way to think. 

Not what I'm saying but nice strawman.  They were raised in such a way that certain things are hard for them to accept.  That doesn't make them stupid, though it can make them ignorant in certain ways.  Also, they very much are at MIT to learn how to think among many, many other disciplines.

It's beyond condescending to make up a strawman about students attending US school, under US democracy, in an attempt to defend the controlling Chinese government that has failed to match the level of higher education the US can provide despite decades of effort.

I'm fine with different opinions...in fact my society values them.  What I'm not fine with are liars, deceivers, and peddlers of ignorance.  Those people are the scum of the earth and will be scorned.  Get back to me when China figured out what happened in 1989 and is teaching it in their schools.  I'll just leave it at that
