So the original data was comparing events that are considered to be terrorist attacks. BLM protests and the associated deaths are not considered terrorist attacks therefore omitted from that data sect. 

I would also like to mention I personally detest white supremacy and I believe it is disgusting and ignorant. 

That being said, you should not lump everyone with differing conservative opinions into that group. 

When I asked where do you think more deaths come from, I meant specifically the BLM organization and specifically Proud Boys.
