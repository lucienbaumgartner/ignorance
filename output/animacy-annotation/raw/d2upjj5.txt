I'm certain the community would have loved this kind of detailed response sooner.  But I for one am happy how it was handled and am glad to see the offenders gone.  Such an exploit can do all that you said and is unfair to the unaware and honest of us in the game.  I have been very critical of a lot of things done (or not done) but this time,  good job.
