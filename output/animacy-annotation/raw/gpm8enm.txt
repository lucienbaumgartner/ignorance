The men in the comments are so afraid of the "brown people" ruining the "western world." They are literally saying feminism is destroying civilization rather than men's destructive, death obsessed, power obsessed nature. They have been shown consistently to be more greedy and apathetic, more willingly to plow over anyone to get their way, to commit more murder, to contribute most of global warming, and start wars, to abuse and gouge the earth for every last resource, the list goes on.

But feminism is ruining society? They blame us for everything. I really can't believe they gloss over all their own problems. Problems they created that have actual, measurable, harmful effects on society. But feminists which has never been shown to have anything but positive effects on a nation.... is the one killing it.

They are so sure of themselves, yet also so unaware and stupid.

Also, men are the ones who have always had kids for the sake of the nation. For their bloodline. They wanted to, and we didn't have a say in the matter. When we do we have less because men don't understand the pain and suffering, and sometimes death that comes along with it. They don't care, they think it's easy or maybe that we're just exaggerating, as usual. It's so easy from their point of view, they don't take ours into consideration because our word has always meant less than theirs, even when about our own experiences. What men say about us seems more correct than what women say about ourselves.

That thing in the Quran that says something about a woman's testimony being half that of a mans? It's like that everywhere. Always has been, always will be.

This ad is still talking to men about our bodies. This was for them, not us. It's our decision, not theirs. You give us incentives and assurances we can count on and need and maybe we'll think about it. But right now, too many of us can even afford to meet our own needs.
