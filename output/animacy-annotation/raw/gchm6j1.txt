It's what we call, a trap. If someone responds with a 5 minute rant it's very telling. To go back to the date comparison, if the responce is "We just were not a good fit." That shows maturity. But if the next 2 hours of the date is them talking about all the things their ex did wrong it's not hard to imagine that the date is brash, impulsive, and unaware that you probobly dont care and was just makeing conversation.
