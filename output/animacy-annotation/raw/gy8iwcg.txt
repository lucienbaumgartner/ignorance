I'd encourage you to read some of the other comments in this thread. You come across as extremely unempathetic, and ignorant of why other people feel the way they do. The fact that your comment is only making fun of trans women when this is something that involves all trans people suggests you have some degree of sexism going on too.

Either you haven't actually read much of this thread or you're too full of yourself to give a shit about where anyone else is coming from.
