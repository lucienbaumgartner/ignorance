It comes off to me as being about a one-sided, possibly emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship with someone excessively proud and ignorant of themself. Also given that there are a few songs on the album about predatory/abusive male relationship behaviors, which is very socially prominent currently. 

Its synth opening is ominous but exciting. The dramatic chord strike right before Alex starts feels like a "back to reality" moment as he sings softly and coercively. He gets more excited but not too angrily when first confrotned during, "Am I gonna to get up? Am I gonna get up? No never!" And the first chorus is stern but not overly aggressive, and "lazy in the evening boy" comes off as if he believes he's just the "work hard, rest hard" type. It continues to build in intensity and noise, and jumps straight to the second bridge which ends aggressively with, "Never! Never! Never!" as the instruments fade off. The second chorus is heavier with bass and Alex sings more adamantly. Adding "lazy in the morning boy" drives in that this is just an abusive person, and how he darkly trails off with "and a lazy boy loves you" closes that.

I'm very possibly reading way too much into their writing haha. But Alex has talked over the years how he tries to write and structure songs very methodically, there's the blunt "you know I hate pop music" from Goodbye Lovers and Friends, and he's lamented about how empty so much music is. Also, the album mixing let Lazy Boy down a lot (Feel the Love Go even more so), and the mood and sound of this song live is tremendously dark and pounding.
