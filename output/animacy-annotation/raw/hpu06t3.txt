NASA has sent two probes into interstellar space and launched multiple planetary and solar probes. Wdym never leave low earth orbit? SpaceX-- I'm not sure, but there's genuine people out there who dedicate their whole lives to discovering more about the cosmos, so it's rather ignorant and narcissistic to come to the conclusion that they're spying on YOU.

You can rent out an observatory and do surveys of the sky for yourself if NASA ("government shills") isn't good enough for you. Go do that, let the world know if you discover something other than what's been told. There's no excuse to NOT do it, because it's available for anyone.

Stop living in your fantasy conspiracy world :)
