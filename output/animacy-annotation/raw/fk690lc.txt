Americans have a very difficult relationship with panic and crisis situations as they are very selfish and ignorant. That breeds fear. It's something I don't think is as prevalent in other countries (I have never been) because I don't believe they feel as entitled as Americans do. I also think that since Asian Americans are typically conservative and quiet, people think they can berate and attack them without reprise. 

Americans, and yes, New Yorkers, can be entitled idiots and that breeds irrational and tribalist behavior that results in disgusting expressions of bigotry. Oppressing entire ethnic groups is what this great city and country were built on, and that is why people think it's okay. I'm very sorry you had to go through this.
