Great of you for realizing this at such a young age. I’m 29 and have spent the past 11 years wasting time on situationships and relationships that were doomed to fail. So many years and wasted time an emotions. And money. I was so scared to be alone and desperate. I think about all that I could’ve accomplished had I been more accepting of being single and focused on me. Plus now I have all this relationship trauma to recover from! 

I still wish I could find him. I’ve only ever been attracted to guys who like flirting with multiple girls. I was so foolish and unaware of what was going on. It’s good that you’re observant of others. Good people are hard to come by. Most young ppl are always trying to flirt with or hook up with someone. I’m trying to find someone who isn’t, but I guess I had to become that person myself first. It’s taken so many fuck ups, heartbreaks, std scares, and drama for me to finally realize that I need to be single now.
