This post is very ignorant and unaware of how the world works I'm sorry to say. People need to have at least 2 children to keep their society alive. People grow old and if there's not enough people to replace their place in society you've got a huge problem.

If we were talking about places with unbelievable populations like China and India or places with booming populations like Nigeria, I fully agree with you that they need to calm down or the rest of the world will suffer. But places like Europe and Japan absolutely not. In fact if people don't start having at least 3 children in these places, they are going to have to deal with some major issues.
