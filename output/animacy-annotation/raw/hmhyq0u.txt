Alright I'm a woman who is pansexual. If ANYONE comes up to me randomly - anywhere at all - and starts a casual conversation for seemingly no reason, I'm gonna be weirded out. I don't care what gender you are, how much money you have, or how hot you are. It makes you seem desperate and unaware of social norms. 

However, that doesn't mean don't socialize while you're out. I often talk to the cashiers who are ringing up my items. I will talk to someone if there is a NATURAL way to start the conversation. E.g. I like your shirt, I love that character too! Or "wow I love your haircut, where did you get it done?" Or "I heard you talking about (x), and i just have to say, (....)" 

Something casual. Something that is not overtly romantic. If you're trying to be my friend "on the way" to being a romantic partner, you were never really a friend. I want people who want to talk to me because they like *me,* not just because they want to date me. Someone who won't ghost me the moment I say I'm not interested, because they want to be friends with me anyway. 

Don't try to create scenarios. Don't just walk up to someone randomly and try to have a conversation. Use an "in." Otherwise, I know you're just talking to me for my looks and I'm not interested. Looks fade. I'm not gonna be young and pretty in 20 years. I want someone who likes me for who I am on the inside.
