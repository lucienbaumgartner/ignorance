As someone with really awful (in similar but different ways) step-parents, I would be partially interested to know how long this guy has been in your life and honestly, knowing more about your entire family dynamics would be helpful but I would only want to know that because I'm a curious person. You wanna know why I know that you are not wrong to feel 'slighted' in some way? Because the socks made you feel bad. Your feelings are always valid.  Those aren't my style but I know my little sister would love them if I gave them to her but she would be fuming mad if other people (like her father/my stepfather) gave them to her. 

But, I want to also give you props for doing a "reality check" on your emotions. Sometimes we [humans] can overreact to our own emotions, even if they are valid and based on facts. And sometimes we can distort facts to fit our feelings. Our brains are funny like that.. but from what you said:

* It sounds like your stepdad and you are not close, emotionally, but 
* he has enough knowledge to know that there is stuff going on in your life that might make words like "crazy" and "psycho" sore spots for you and
* let's also assume that your stepdad is not just very very ignorant and thoughtless. Though, for me, that would be the "best case scenario" with my stepdad but he also isn't unintelligent (in fact, he has a very high intelligence, but he is smart enough to play dumb very well) so I know that there is often some underlying "meaning" behind the thought (or lack of thought) when he gives someone a present, especially people that he is closer to emotionally. 

So, if your stepdad is the type who always gives you a shitty gift because he is just a bad gift buyer (maybe he just saw the pink and thought "oh she likes pink and she likes socks" [obviously, I wasn't there and have no idea if you like pink or whatnot, and I don't know your stepdad; just throwing out an alternative]) then I would say that at the very least you are entitled to feel bad because your stepdad is ignorant and/or unintelligent, seems uncaring and seems to be very thoughtless. 

However, if your stepdad is not just being a daft, bad gift giver, and normally he would or should "know better", even with the info that he has, I would share in your offense. Like I said earlier, I am curious about your family dynamics just because I can totally see my stepdad giving those exact socks to me, my mom or my sister and all 3 of us would be mad if he gave them to us, but that is because he would play it off like he is just being a thoughtless idiot when in reality, it is much more calculated. But that's my stepdad; I've known him nearly 20 years now and he and my mom are very close to finally divorcing (after being separated for over 5 years) and many awful years of fighting and DV but thankfully I have a sister from it.  You and your stepdad could be totally different. 

Just know that it's okay to feel your feelings and whatever coping skills you have, try to utilize them (coming here might be a good one for you; I know it can help me) and also, while your feelings are valid, if you have doubts about whether your reaction is too strong for the "action" you are responding to, it is great that you thought to "check in" and find out other people's thoughts.
