This exactly. 

People are so noble and virtuous here. Everything that could be criticized is now the start of a war and the war enlists these charlatans who dance around and speak as if they are backed by Jesus-fucking-Christ himself. I’m learning to stay out of these big debates because you can’t argue with people who are irrational, and double standards are part of that irrationality. On the one hand, you have someone who is honest and upfront about reality (in this case: people can film, if you dress like this then you should expect it). Then you have your idealists (people saying that this is fundamentally wrong and that it can’t happen and “IT HAS TO STOP NOW” or whatever). Then you have your fence-sitters who probably believe that by being in the middle they are being unbiased. They give up some ground and think that that allows them freedom? (IDK)

Finally you have me, the arrogant ‘Nazi’ asshole ‘white-knight’ who really is arrogant and ignorant about a lot of things. My goal is to either die on a hill or to win whatever war I’m fighting. And after learning how arrogant and ignorant that makes me seem when I am in-fact ignorant, I’ve decided to die sparingly.
