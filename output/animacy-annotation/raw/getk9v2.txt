No, you were not misinterpreting it. In standard English, Trump is saying this, “I know disinfectants also knock out germs. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or a cleaning of the lungs? It would be interesting to check that out.”

Trump is so mind-glowingly stupid and unaware of how medicine works that he really does think it could be possible to inject some kind of disinfectant into the lungs to kill a virus. That’s the truth.
