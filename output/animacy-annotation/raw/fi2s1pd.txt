Make a calendar that the three of you can see and use that to confirm her hours.
Use that for a few weeks.

Tell the nanny you need confirmed hours two weeks in advance.  She needs to see if her job will do this or not.  If they won't, tell her you need the same hours every week then, her other job can define shifts she can do around it.

You may lose the nanny if the job refuses to be reasonable, but she needs it.


Talk to your husband, he is not understanding that you can't just be fine having different hours without notice.  It could be he thinks you aren't working so it's fine, or is not important stuff so you're fine. 
Whatever it is, you don't schedule someone else's day without their knowledge, it's rude and ignorant.  
That will not be a fun conversation,he is in the wrong and may get defensive, say stupid shit like you don't work.
