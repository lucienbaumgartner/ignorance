&gt;  He's right about 90% of the shit he talks about. 

Ah to be young, naive and unaware of the fact he was literally wrong about everything in the 2016 election and what followed it. He literally said we should want a trump presidency (as leftists) and then said trump won't have any negative side effects and will make people realize how broken the system is. Meanwhile we now have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, his whole debate with Sam Seder was shit and he said "well I am just a comedian, what do I know?" How is it public figures always fall back on these types of excuses and if you don't know what your talking about, what the hell are you doing talking about it if you can't recognize your own shortcomings in knowledge and then correct that. Jimmy Dore is such a hack
