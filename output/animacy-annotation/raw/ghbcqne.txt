I'd rather have the people I can vote out have that control than giant corporations. It's hilarious to listen to this subreddit when it's the definition of "unaware and compliant." You plug your ears to any facts you don't like. You get in line and vote no matter how horrific your candidate is. You change your policy views at the drop of a tweet. You cannibalize your own as soon as they say anything that contradicts dear leader.
