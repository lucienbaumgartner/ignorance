I wont say every repub voter. Many repub voters are just extremely uninformed and ignorant of the truth. They are not nut jobs, I know because half my fam is this way. They just believe a false narrative thats spoon fed to them by sources they think to be reputable, but in fact are not. Pity them and try to talk sensibly to them and you can get them thinking about things. However, there is about 25% of repub base that is just batsh%\^ crazy and racists pricks.
