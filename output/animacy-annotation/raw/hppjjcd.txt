You know, I’ve remarked that here in Mississippi, people are so apolitical and ignorant and busy trying to keep food on the table that there are very, very few incidents that I’ve seen or heard of. There are no pickups with crazy stickers covering every inch. People grumble, but they don’t throw tantrums, at least where I am. 

Mississippi is flippable. Not today, not tomorrow, but the possibility is there. The state is almost 40% Black. The people are FURIOUS that the vote for medical marijuana was thrown out by the political “leaders” of this state. I live in the middle of this red state surrounded by weirdos, artists, atheists, liberals, LGBTQ, etc. This state is flippable. We aren’t on anyones radar, but if we had a Stacy Abrams of our own, you’d see the right suddenly take a hard look at us. 

Please don’t condemn me and my oddball friends by sending those people here.
