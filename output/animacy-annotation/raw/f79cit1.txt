By irrelevant I mean, it's all worthy of criticism. A rose by any other name would stink as bad.

&gt;Once you accept that immigrants come in all shapes and sizes you can't gerenalize them all as 1 group, can you?

And yet Cherry just did. That's hwy I mean it doesn't matter whether someone inappropriately labels it racism, or xenophobia, or plain old bigotry.  What he said is exclusionary and ignorant. THAT is what people are criticizing.

Do you really think it's *fine* to say "this group of people can fuck off and assimilate better if they want to live here" because I didn't name a single race? Or a single country?  

Focusing on their particular word usage is pedantic at best and dishonest at worst.
