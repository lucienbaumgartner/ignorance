I'm afraid that's true of many hospitals, especially those operated by religious institutions.

The Abrahamic faiths -- especially Christianity -- consider suicide to be a "sin against god". Some department heads take it upon themselves to put policies in place that subtly punish the "sinner" rather than offer kindness and compassion.

You were exhausted, traumatized and unaware that you could have ended the interrogation at any time by refusing to answer more questions, especially irrelevant nonsense such as "going over my entire family tree" and asking about military service.

You were being hassled for the supposed crime of attempting to end your life. The doctor was doing her best Inquisitioner routine simply to punish you for daring to defy her idea of what her god wants. The Soviets used similar techniques on gulag prisoners and sleep deprivation is a big part of official punishment in North Korea.
