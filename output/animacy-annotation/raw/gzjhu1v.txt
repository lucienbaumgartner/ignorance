You’ll never know... Shiro has what it takes and is leading even Light Novel Readers know that.. Kuro is so stupid and immature that she forcefully hurt her love to recognize her. I hate those kinds of girls and I have a trauma relating to that kind that’s why I’m not forgiving with Kuro. But this image is probably what will happen, Shiro and Momo will win but we know Momo in fact is a winner so we need to know who among Shiro and Kuro will win and it’s definitely going to be Shiro since the title of the show is “The Childhood friend won’t lose.” Meaning Shiro Won and Kuro is just trying to keep winning despite failing time and time again thus causing Haru a scar in his heart. Kuro is too stupid to understand too that men are usually clueless and unaware of subtle details.. poor Kuro and Shiro won already 3 or 4 times.. Kuro only won 2 basing on the anime so it’s obvious who’s in the lead and who Haru will end up with along side Momo ;)) let’s not lose hopeeee
