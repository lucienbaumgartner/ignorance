Comments:

    Author: Hyperwhelmed Body: Next to removed it says - "Intentional or scripted". Bullshit. Obviously everything was scripted, but the cringe wasn't written into it intentionally. The cringe is from how self-unaware and hacky she is, as well as how much constant pandering she was doing. Someone here is censoring differing opinions.

        Author: -churbs Body: Since when did cringe have to be improvised?
