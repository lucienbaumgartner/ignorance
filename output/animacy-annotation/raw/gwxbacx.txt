I'm Canadian and I gotta say I hate how absorbed we are of American culture. Sorry, guys, you're good neighbours but... you're arrogant and ignorant of the rest of the world. Canada used to be the country that got along with everyone. Now we're all just as ignorant. They were throwing Trump rallies in big cities up here. Um hello, you're Canadian? Wrong politician.
