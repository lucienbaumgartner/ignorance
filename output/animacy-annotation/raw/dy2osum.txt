&gt; Kim isnâ€™t crazy.

It depends on your definition of crazy. KJU isn't crazy in the sense he's senile and unaware that his acts have consequences. But he's still totally crazy in the sense that he thinks that human lifes don't matter and that he certainly believes he's some kind of superman (something both him and Trump have in common).
