Im so sick of the "you got shots for school" bs. Work and school aren't the same thing. One is funded by the government one is funded by a private entity. You don't get to vote on what a private entity you're not involved with does with their cash. If it's not illegal, you have no say.

Businesses were strong armed by the government -  threatened with massive fines for not testing unvaccinated employees once a week. Government knows most businesses would go for the easiest logistical route to compliance which is full mandates. Now companies are losing half their work force over the next 1.5 months coming up.

There has never been a nationwide mandate to get a shot just to go to work for a private company. Want to go to PUBLIC school? Government forces you to get shots. Military service for the GOVERNMENT? need to get shots. 

It's not the same as the holocaust. I am half Jewish, know/knew many holocaust survivors and anyone who says that shit is being dramatic and ignorant.

That being said forcing someone to potentially lose their house or their ability to feed their children over a vaccine that only protects one's self is asinine and a pretty obvious violation of human rights.

TL;DR Regardless if you think the shot is the answer or not we need to all agree governmental tyranny is not the way to get that point across. One day it could go right back the other way and force upon you something you don't agree with.
