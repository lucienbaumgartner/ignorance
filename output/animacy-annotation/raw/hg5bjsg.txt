Really? Ecclesiastes 9:5 says that the dead know nothing, they have no memories, no love or hate or jealousy.

If someone is in purgatory (ie: dead) how can they "be" while knowing and feeling nothing?

How about Psalms 115:17  "The dead do not praise Jah; Nor do any who go down into the silence of death."

Psalms 146:4  "His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; On that very day his thoughts perish"

John 11:11  "After he said these things, he added: “Lazʹa·rus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him"

The state of death is often figuratively referred to as "sleep" in the Bible. When you sleep you are unconscious and unaware of the world around you, ie "no knowledge and no memories", similar to have Ecclesiastes 9:5 describes it.
