The important thing is to just go. If you think you want to go, just go. Find the money, get it through your insurance. DO WHATEVER YOU MUST to just fucking make it work to go, because it's literally a matter of life and death in some cases (maybe its fair to say most cases?) and if your arm was chopped off by a chain saw, you would probably go to the ER and get help, right? Same thing. I don't care what ANYBODY says. It's the same fucking risk. So don't pay any mind to those who tell anyone this nonsense that it's worthless. They're just unaware and out dated. Remember when people used to think putting leeches on your body was a good cure for shit like Pneumonia? Yeah, thankfully, I don't...but that was a thing and it turns out, not super effective but we learned better ways to treat those issues and now we don't put fucking leeches on people when they are dying of Pnemonia (looking at you former president William Henry Harrison, that sucked. \*badumtss\*)

Seriously, Everyone can benefit from therapy. Everyone. And everyone, IMHO should get therapy but I am also not a fan of people telling me Jesus Saves and I should join that bandwagon either so, \*shrug\* if it makes sense for you to go to therapy, I encourage it every step of the way.

If it ever makes sense to bring it up in conversation, I tell others that I am in therapy because I want people to know the stigma is unjustified. I have GAD, SAD and sometimes just regular ole' depression, and it just helps me to talk about my anxious and depressing thoughts without fear of judgement. To those I tell who didn't know before I started therapy, I get "WHY!? You seem like you're doing fine!" I respond with, "Yes...that's the **fucking** point." (said in a Gordan Ramsey-like tone) "So why don't you stop?" "...that's **NOT** the FUCKING POINT, you EDIOTT." ....ok not really that. I tell them, I'll just quit when I'm ready. I don't know when that will be but I am sure I'll know when the time comes. :)
