You'll have to refer to my post history comments for my explanations regarding the mini-map. 

The quick version is this: Removing it will force the skilled players to use game sense + the compass to have that awareness. Good players will benefit from this. Bad players will be punished for being unaware and reliant on the map.

As for killstreak wrapping, this is a new one I haven't heard complaints of until recently. In what world is it skillful to be able to get free, no risk involved killstreaks by AFTER YOU ALREADY EARNED THEM with ACTUAL skill? 

Killstreaks are a reward, not meant to be a way to snowball games into a stompfest. Sure, it arguably takes some kind of skill. But that "skill" is comparable to the "skill" that cross-map spawnkilling noobtubes have, for example. The point is, it's just pure nonsense that detracts from the actual game. This is my opinion, but I'm sure I'm not alone in it.
