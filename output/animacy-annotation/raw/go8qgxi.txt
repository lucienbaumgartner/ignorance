Choose to see that the one who becomes unaware is an illusion. Awareness is always aware; consciously remain as the awareness and consciously choose eternally to never identify with any thought, emotion, sensation, perception and experience. Even if it appears as if "I accidentally identified out of habit"; don't identify with that either. The awareness is never identified; what is "identified" is always just a thought; believe that; and it will appear in your experience as if you are aware and then unaware and then aware again. Don't believe these thoughts and you will see you are ever-present, even in the midst of what thought labels "unawareness"; it is as simple as this. Eternally never identify with any thought, emotion, sensation, perception or experience; and know you are already the awareness that is being aware. Never look to the past. To say "I was identified" is false for you are being aware now. The past doesn't exist. "How to always be aware?" is false; for you are already always aware now. Throw away your belief in all concepts, thoughts, emotions, sensations, perceptions and experience. You already are eternally infinite awareness. There is nothing for you to do; but to stop identifying with whatever is happening. When one is not identified with anything; the thing that remains is the Buddha nature or Awareness. You don't even need to remain as the awareness; for it is effortless; when one is not identified with anything; one is choicelessly the awareness.
