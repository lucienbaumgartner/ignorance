I’m not advocating for them. 

I’m pointing out that “the guy on the bottom floor works harder!!!” is untrue and ignorant of different kinds of work and how promotion/salary increases work. 

It’s possible to acknowledge criticize CEO excess (CEOs generally make way too much money and the disparity between executive and worker compensation is out of control) while also criticizing ignorant people who think that the average worker is more important or works harder than the literal head of the company.
