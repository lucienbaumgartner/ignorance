Not sure what you’re on about Australia. In my state we’re concerned that the gov/politicians let everything back to normal for popularity votes, they wanted people to think everything is back to normal so eases all restrictions, no masks no checking right before Xmas and the cases pretty much high the highest number. We had a state premier that’s stupid and ignorant and ignore all the warning from health Medicals 

A lot of us are still wearing masks and try to avoid outings, workplaces still insist on wfh.
