So to recap because you deleted your comments and are passive-aggressively apologizing: you blamed women for men not knowing sex ed, then you doubled down on blaming women because the education system is incompetent and men are also apparently (???) Incapable of learning themselves, and claimed with no proof (?) that 9/10 women don't educate men on what they've done wrong, *on a thread where a woman is doing JUST THAT*. 

And apparently saying that it's not the woman's fault if a man is ignorant and belligerent about it makes me naive? A bad partner? Wtf? Lol

Also  'tween' actually refers to 9-12 year olds who aren't teens yet, not teenagers, but you probably meant that I was ignorant and naive.

I'm 30+ with a partner of over five years. There were things he didn't know, because his previous partner didn't communicate well. And he was honest, asked for advice, and he got answers - some of which was me sending him articles by female sex educators. Now he looks them up on his own if there's something general he needs advice for. 

But it was never my 'job' to fix his ignorance, and I've never blamed his ex for not 'teaching' him. It's not her job.
