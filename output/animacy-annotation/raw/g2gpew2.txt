Because I pointed that those who use the structure "su xxx de él, su xxx de ella" are poor and ignorant. That actually points to a reality in our country/customs we are little bound to self reflexión and we prefer to face consecuences that to accept one's mistakes.

But, the truth is that is so low level slang than saying un English :"His car of him". Utterly nonsense.

One advance Spanish has over other languages is the implicit form: You can say a lot with one or two words in a sentence, provided you were clear with the previous ideas. Example:

"Juan sanó ayer. La semana pasada enfermó. Hoy Jugó futbol. Ganó. Le dieron una beca"

Juan healed yesterday. Last week he got sick. Today he played football. He won. They have him a schoolarship.

As You can see then pronouns became optional after the first use, and if the verb conjugation is clear enough to  distinguish between subjects.
