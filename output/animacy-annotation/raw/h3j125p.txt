I don't really get depressed when thinking of those things even though they pop up in my head pretty often from time to time. I'd ask and search questions on the internet, and try to understand why all that is going on and really think deep into the morals and mindset and such.

The world is just too complex, and we don't quite understand how our body and brain works. I guess this is somewhat part of nature's design and in the end it's really none of our business because it's simply unrealistic to care about all the hurt ones because there are so many and you yourself is the most important person to you after all. It's almost like nature designed us to be kind and emotional animals but to survive we have to be somewhat competitive and ignorant of the sufferings.
