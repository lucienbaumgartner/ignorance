It is what you said, I simply replaced poverty with starvation but they are nearly the same thing in this context. Swap them back if you prefer, the point is unchanged. I also did address this in the 2nd paragraph where I said you are voluntarily entering into that contract with your boss. You can start your own business instead if you'd like to have say over your hours. Calling this coercion is incredibly dishonest and ignorant of history.

That isn't hyperbole, it is the height of affluent arrogance to suggest you having to choose a job you can walk away from at any time and also have the option to work for yourself is coercion. So no, I did not miss the distinction and addressed it. I disagree with you and clearly describe why, if that is a waste of time for you then fine. Find someone you can agree with each other back and forth on things so you don't need to challenge your beliefs.
