I know this sounds very cliche and unaware of the reality, but some sunny place in the US, Australia, maybe even a European country, or just have a job where I can work in an office of a different country a few times in a year, but get the U.K. salary. 

I know that the countries I listed have it’s ups and downs, but the culture is so fucking dreadful. You go anywhere in any different country in Europe and talk to the cashier (man or woman, doesn’t matter) and they’ll actually talk, they just have a positive vibe flowing out if that makes sense. Here? “Y’aar rite matee, faayf pooound fyfty”. 

Once again I may have a skewed opinion for the reasons mentioned in my post, but it’s really unappealing quite often. The weather is demotivating too, the layout of towns/cities, buildings, lack of greenery, beaches where only maybe 10% of which are actually enjoyable to be at. 

Note- obviously not every person falls into this category. I’ve definitely met helpful and nice people, but the negatives will always cover up the positives, especially if they’re not as common
