No one is obligated to get an invasive surgical procedure just because they dont want kids. It strikes me as so entitled and ignorant that strangers on the internet are demanding that from you just because you dont want to be a mom. Like is it supposed to be a punishment?

Whatever you want for yourself is all that matters
