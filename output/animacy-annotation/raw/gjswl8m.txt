Well you’re just making people out to be entitled, naive, idealistic, and ignorant. That can’t *possibly* be right... And on the internet, no less! 


Look, I’m ok with people working hard and learning skills and making good money as long as I can have some of that money. Preferably, I’d like to have the same lifestyle as them without having to have a job. I figure it’s the government’s problem to supply me with the things that I feel like I deserve, beings that I’m alive and such. I’ll even go so far as to vote for the aforementioned free stuff, provided I can do so from home. /s
