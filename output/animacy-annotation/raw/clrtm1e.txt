So there I was.  In college. Junior.  At a bar.  Just failed my English exam for improper use of punctuation.

When this goddess walks up to me and starts talking to me first.  I was confused, scared and unaware that this was a thing that could happen without a large amount of cash upfront.

So I manned up, peed myself a bit and ordered us a drink.

Drinks were drank, things were fondled, shenanigans and karaoke ensued.

Things are going well to the point where I am thinking this is too good to be true.  No cameras no jump scares, no organ snatching, just a girl who actually seemed to enjoy my company.  It was nice.  The bar winds down so we head back to my apartment, no roommates in sight.  sock on door(as you do)  She pulls down my pants as I'm standing there and proceeds to give me the best BJ in the history of BJ's. Slobbery, wet, noisy, like a shop wet vac on overload.

After her protege shake it was time to return the favor.  I kneel down to remove her pants. I unbutton them and her thong down (why waste time?  just grab em both) and a stench that would make a sarlacc pic gag hits me full in the face.

She sees my face.
I see her see my face.
She looks embarrassed and says that she "needs something first."
I ask "what's that?" but am thinking a hazmat hose down might be in order but she leans down and whispers to me.

"I need about tree fiddy." It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!" I yelled as I kicked her out of my dorm room.  She swam away with out her pants.
