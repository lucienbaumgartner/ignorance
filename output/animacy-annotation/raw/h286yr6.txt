Rape? Was OP black out drunk? Did she awaken to her Husband’s cousin on top of her assaulting her? I hadn’t read that part in OP’s husbands posts. Drinking may alter one’s inhibitions but and I do mean BUT, last time I checked (as I’ve been drunk many times) doesn’t impair one’s ability to say “NO”, “Stop”. I’ve been to many parties and saw women that were drunk, tell their BF’s “Stop” when they were getting touchy-feely in public. 

Unless she was black out drunk and unaware of her husband’s cousin, removing her clothes and inserting himself inside of her (twice within the same night) I’m not certain we can use alcohol as an excuse.
