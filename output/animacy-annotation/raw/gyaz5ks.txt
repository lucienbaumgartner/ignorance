I was fairly young and unaware of him when he died. But after a few years (maybe 7 or 8 years ago) I discovered his music and I was awed. The amount of talent and sheer power in his voice marked him as one of the best, at least in my mind. I randomly bumped into Stargazer as a first song... A true lifechanger.
