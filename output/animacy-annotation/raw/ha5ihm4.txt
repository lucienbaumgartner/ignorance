I was a libertarian for a while. There was so much conflict during the period. I was frothing at the mouth with the idea that others wanted to limit my freedoms. I was hooked on the idea that business tycoons were controlling the world. I think I was an anarchist, really, only misinformed. 

Thomas Campbell, My Big TOE was a good read for me. He says the only system is the larger consciousness system (LCS, an ecosystem) and we're all creating the universe with intent and observations as free will awareness units. Our purpose is to grow up and being aware of the feelings and needs of others is a part of growth. Capitalism is greedy and unaware of others, you could almost say capitalism is stupid, but it's adherents are trying their best, too. One day, hopefully, they'll learn, at least before we fuck everything up.
