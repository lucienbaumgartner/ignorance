The past as in before the last 10-20 years, 5 in common use. Yes the term has been used since the 60s but this new definition of it is relatively new and much more expensive than the older common use definition. 

Again I'm not upset, you're just a bit too... uninformed and ignorant of the topic to understand. You also seem to be completely fine with being ignorant about the topic so you can maintain a superiority complex. Perfect example of the dunning Kruger effect. I explained it in a very understandable way that even a 85 IQ middle school student could comprehend so either read what I said again or look it up for yourself rather than comment on things you don't understand. 

I'll try once more in good faith. 

Do you agree that race should not be the primary factor in judging a person's experience? If you say no then in common use definition you are not a racist. In CRT definition you are a racist. 

Do you think the judicial system should take race into consideration when determining sentencing and guilt? If no then common use definition you are not racist. In CRT you are a racist and are supporting systematic racism. 

Do you think that a democracy in which each individual regardless of race should get an equal vote in deciding leadership and laws? If yes then in common use you are not racist. In CRT definitions you are a racist bc minorities groups should each have an equal say in leadership and laws regardless of their population. In addition there should be a proportional number of minorities in positions of power or else it is systematically racist.
