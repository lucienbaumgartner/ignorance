So when it comes to us natives it doesn't count because our past and current encounters with nonhuman beings are nothing more than mythological? I bet you have no awareness of how insulting and ignorant that comment is. I should be used to it by now being that I'm close to 50. I mean, people still call me chief or kimosabee on social media because they're trying to be funny. But this is next level ignorance and insulting.
