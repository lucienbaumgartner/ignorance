thank you for finally saying it. I wonder if you live in my town but it's probably like this all over southern Ontario. The owners are so cheap they exploit the youth international students from their own country and arrive here and are too meek and ignorant of their rights to put up a fight. They scam eachother in a race to the bottom and drive the quality of the place down as well as the cost of labour for locals trying to enter the market since some of them even offer and accept below minimum wage!! Such a cancer
