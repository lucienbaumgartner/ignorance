&gt; And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which **the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction**, as they do the other Scriptures. (2 Peter 3:15â€“6)

- Saint Peter

People who deny Paul are only judaizing cultists who try to enslave people into a world based system of law again, falling away from Christ and drawing a curse upon themselves.
