&gt; The Dunning-Kruger effect is just a retarded buzzword idiots use to  convince themselves that those that call them out for being, well,  idiots -- are idiots themselves. 

And if I had shouted "DUNNIG KRUGER!!!111" into the room without first providing an argument and without being provoked by a needless and uncalled for insult to my intelligence by the person losing the discussion, you would be making a valid point here.

I sense you might just not like the whole "incompetent and unaware of it" concept because, judging by the fact that the ad hominem ratio in your posts seems to be almost 100%, you're often made aware of the possibility that it may apply to you.

Nonetheless, if you're willing to present an argument I'm willing to give it a read.
