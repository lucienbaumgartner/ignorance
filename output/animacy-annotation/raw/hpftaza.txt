"I'm just a voice crying in the wilderness".

My Mom loves to nag me. Loves it like a hobby. Whenever she starts nagging me to do something, she'll end her diatribe by saying something along the lines of "But I'm just a voice crying in the wilderness." This phrase, couple with her tone of voice, implies to me that she believes that if I don't do what she thinks I should do, then I an ignorant and rigid and stubborn.
