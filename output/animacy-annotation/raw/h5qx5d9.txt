A very simple Google search can bring up multiple examples of successful monopolies/cartels where everyone cooperates long enough to hurt the public. The people leading these companies generally aren't morons. They know that cooperating leads to greater profits for themselves. Sometimes they'll just bribe the leadership of smaller companies to play along.

I don't disagree that businesses abuse regulations as a weapon. But to believe that lack of government will stop this behavior is naive and ignorant of history. There is no easy answer to these problems, it certainly isn't "wipe out regulations and trust people not to collude".
