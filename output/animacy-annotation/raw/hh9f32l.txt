Let her go. She is unsupportive and ignorant of current employment issues. 

It once took me 8 months to get a job, sending out resumes every day. My power got shut off. It was terrible. But I finally got a job and it worked out. 

Don't take a shit job that will make it harder to get a good one. Stay on UE, it's your money anyway, and keep looking for a good job.
