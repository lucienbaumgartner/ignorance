This is a terrible take in my opinion.

Firstly, you have the point that most 'left-wing university students' come from a disadvantaged background themselves. I come from a low-income household and I'm disabled. Other left-leaning folk I know tend to be ethnic minorities who come from the UK, some also have a disability, or come from a deprived area or are personally working-class.

Secondly, you haven't considered why internationals are so often right-wing. It's because in their home countries they are typically the social or economic elite. You identified the difference in views between domestic and international students but didn't attribute this to a specific cause. Whereas many ethnic minority groups are shut out of politics in this country due to threats of violence or structural disadvantage, international students can hypothetically go and live back in their home countries with relative social advantage to the rest of the population. In my view, the most indicative point here is how the majority of international students are privately educated.

I'm not an idealist really, I just want to be represented and I want others around me to have their voices heard. What OP is saying is both inaccurate and ignorant of the experiences of others.
