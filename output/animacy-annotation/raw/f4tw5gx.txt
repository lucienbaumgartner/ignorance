But they lost that ground due to their own actions.

I'm sorry that you're so fucking stupid and ignorant that you think that Israel has been going on "expansion" for years.

Israel has expanded settlements within the West Bank for decades.

The government is just taking them out of the West Bank to make the settlers move more.

The government is actively trying to push them back into the West Bank.

Israel's population is not growing up. The population hasn't grown up because Israel has taken the Palestinians and occupied them for years.

The settlers were being lied to by the Palestinian government to move to Israel.

Israel's policies are against the Palestinian people.
