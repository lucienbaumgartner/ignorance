I dunno but I've found them to be quite a bit arrogant in their way of thinking. As in, being convinced their way of thinking is the only correct way. But then again so many types can be, people probably think the same about INTPs. 

But I do think there's a difference. They're dom Ni users and that contributes to the whole "being convinced my method is *the* right one, everyone else is wrong" more than with any other type. 

But yeah on the internet they're probably just some edgy teenagers. And it's like, the more people know about MBTI the more likely they are to act like this. Not how unaware and mature INTJs are like irl.
