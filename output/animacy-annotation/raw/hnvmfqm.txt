I don't think I'm really straw manning him. His argument is that the law shouldn't be used as a mechanism for resolving these conflicts. I.e in terms of law, what is taught should not broadly be governed by it. But it is already. This is already the status quo. So either Kmele's view is heady and idealistic and ignorant of the status quo, or he's not being consistent. 


And his preferred method of addressing this is also unrealistic. Teaching as a profession is almost totally captured by woke ideology at a training and bureaucratic level. It's kind of ridiculous to tell parents to be constantly vigilant and spend their free time attending meetings and battling this perpetually, rather than have elected representatives use the powers available to them to address it. 

School choice is also a red herring. It's basically a call to just do everything differently fundamentally rather than address it within the current system as it exists. There are lots of reasons why "school choice" can be a problem in many other respects, particularly for low income people. Assuming it would solve anything at all, it has all kinds of other problems.
