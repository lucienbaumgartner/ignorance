Inequalities aren't inequities. 

Inequalities would be the rules in the system (special preference based on characteristics). If we have inequalities then we should address them. 

Inequities are when people with certain characteristics don't do as well as others with different characteristics (even if historical injustices lead to some of the inequities today). I believe these discussions are a fundamental disagreement on economics and I believe the push for economic justice based on racial characteristics to clear up inequities are ignorant and harmful. It's a modern day communist movement with different language.
