You are aware that degrade simply means disrespect and I do disrespect that narrative, nor did I use misleading language. I already stated the reasons why I wouldn't find that nature of study worthwhile with you even agreeing that there is a low likelihood of importance from data. I do know that the study concerned itself with cocaine abuse so I'd further argue that the combination of the centuries worth of data we have already obtained AND the comparatively low population of cocaine abusers when held to the general population are enough reason to reject animal testing regardless of what specific was being tested. I only know of the study because I helped fund the care for the primate in question specifically for years. His name was Dewy and he died just last year https://www.primaterescue.org/deweys-journey/  As for your tone shifting into more insulting territory, I'm a professional archaeologist, your not teaching me shit about science. I happen to have a moral stance that I have defended. It why I clrealy stated it was subjective.  You can disagree and label it feels over reals if you like, but if you don't have a similar threshold somewhere even if it allows a bit more than mine then I honestly feel sorry for you. You've thus far insinuated I'm a liar, nonsensical, and ignorant of science etc. Let me insinuate that you're far too much of a condescending asshole for how limited your reading comprehension seems to be.
