They have 2 gay characters and 1 trans character in the entire game. People believe this is a game-ruining thing.

 People also say the story is very boring and one-note about its subject matter of revenge. 

I agreed with everyone about how the game sucked when it first came out, then I actually played the game and realized how many of them are just ignorant and nitpicking.

Now I go and try to spread the truth that TLOU2 is an objectively good game. It's not perfect, but the things these people say are just baffling.
