Here is what my reply was to the other “he can wear a mask”
“He can. And in doing so not spread it to his classmates. And, although it offers him some small protection to him, when his entire class full of anti vaxxers, covididiots, and others that can’t offer society the slightest concern; I.e. “I ain’t wearing a mask no more ‘cause I am fine” are stuck in a trailer class for 7 hours it is sure to be enough. 
Oh. And let’s be sure to forget the much more contagious and deadly variants, South African, delta, Brazilian, or maybe rely on herd immunity which worked out great for the several hundred thousand american dead. 

Or, we can wear a mask because it is the kind, and right thing to do and the least we can do to help others. It really is not that hard.”

I would like to add that if adults are not going to participate then kids will not. That would increase the social pressure with “look at the loser with a mask”. 
It is not up to my kids. I am forced to send him to school (and no I don’t want to discuss home schooling or private unless you want to pay for it). As such they need to take EVERY precaution to keep him safe. 
Not wearing a mask is nothing more than selfish, lazy, and ignorant of the dangers.
