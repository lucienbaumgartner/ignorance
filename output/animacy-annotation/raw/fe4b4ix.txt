&gt;Fuck, I mean no offence but you’re dumb. Or ignorant. Or both; it’s hard to tell. 

It's easy to tell that you are both dumb and ignorant. That doesn't offend you because you also lack self awareness.  


&gt;You don’t care about dangerously rising global temperatures, increased wildfires and the slow death of oceanic ecosystems because the glaciers near your house have been receding for as long as they’ve existed? And thanks for the downvote. 

Lol... no Chicken Little, I don't care about your delusions. 

&gt;I expect you never read through any of those links, naturally — because you don’t want to browse anything challenging or differing from what you’ve been told to think from corporate shills on this issue. You’re not an independent, open-minded thinker if you trust people like Ben Shapiro and Patrick Moore more than what NASA or the USGS have to say, who are far more qualified than them, you, and me.

Ben Shapiro is a little twerp but I certainly trust him more than you.
