It seems like a lot of people here are gathering what limited accountings of the problems there, interpreting them as if they unilateral apply all over SA in every tier of society.  They seem to also be under the impression that apartheid was not a form of institutional corruption that impoverished many, and unaware that some of those that were disadvantaged by the transition to an augmentation to the pool of potential labor.

It seems to me like the existing poor (free-whites) had to split the scraps with the new folks who were just promoted to the bottom rung of society (freed-blacks) and that the well established and wealthy didn't have to suffer similarly to everyone else.  

Apartheid was established (I thought) to make certain labor intensive industries profitable for a select few, and in a post apartheid economy that business model needs must change yet it has done so poorly and with much resistance (to the detriment of the nations social and political transition).

I don't know as much as I would like, and indeed this whole post could all have been nonsense.  If it was, I would hope you could point out my mistakes, ignorances, or projections.
