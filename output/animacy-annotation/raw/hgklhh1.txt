He ABSOLUTELY loves our girls!! There has never been one second of doubt in my mind about that…what’s scary to me (and this piggybacks on your brainwashing comment) is that his deep hatred of the “liberal sheep” who just blindly follow and do whatever the media tells us to do. That that emotion could somehow grow into a feeling greater than his love for his daughter. It’s a very scary thought. My best friends are a lesbian couple that we’ve known and spent so much time with for over 12 years…he hasn’t seen them or been to an event with me in almost 3 years. It’s like the vitriol of anger is literal eating away at him from the insides and he’s so sure he’s right and everyone is wrong and ignorant, that he’s become blind to how it’s affecting the relationships with the people who love him. I appreciate your viewpoint.
