You're so thickheaded and ignorant that it fucking hurts.

1. Actually, no, they don't. I'm assuming you have little to no experience in business or marketing because this is a very basic concept. The MAJORITY of consumers do not make in-depth research prior to making a purchase. This holds true for most industries. Anyone who thinks that most consumers read blogs or even go on Reddit prior to making a purchase decision is an idiot. Additionally, to touch on your other point, Exway has one of the cleanest websites in the ESK8 industry, so you're own comment bit you in the ass there.

2. There isn't? They're world's ahead of most other ESK8 companies. Name one other ESK8 company that designs the majority of their components and manufactures them almost entirely in-house. I'll wait.

3. An "agreement" is only as good as the contract on paper. If he had a legally binding exclusivity contract, he would have been able to take legal action against Exway to prevent them from selling their boards direct in the United States. CLEARLY this wasn't the case because it never played out that way. Once more, I'll say it again, EVEN BRIAN SAID HE COULDN'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE IT WAS A SMART BUSINESS DECISION.

And the Pandemic is an extremely valid excuse in this situation as it's completely and utterly fucked global supply chain across multiple industries, which is directly applicable to what we're talking about. See: Stocking of their new United States based warehouses/service centers.

Also, once more, WHY DO YOU CARE? I'll ask again, did the owner of Exway kick your Dog? Fuck your girlfriend? Shit on your doorstep? You clearly don't own an Exway product, so why the fuck do you care so much?
