I don't think the Jewish people should be oppressed, ostracized, and expunged from other societies in the first place.  


Jewish people have been integral to every other nation's culture and history. Rene Cassin, a Frenchman, drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Kirk Douglas is responsible for some of the greatest American films in history. Albert Einstein is essentially responsible for much of modern astrophysics as we know it. You wouldn't have such a thing as the "Canadian brand" if it weren't for people like William Shatner, Lorne Greene, Eugene Levy, Rick Moranis, Seth Rogan, or David Cronenberg, just as the same for Drake or Jim Carrey. And that's not even without mentioning the impact individuals like Franz Kafka had on literature, folks like Leon Trotsky had on Russian history, or people like Karl Marx had on the whole of the 20th Century.  


I don't see how saying to any group "Go find your own land if you want safety" actually ensures safety, nor do I see how encouraging ethnic cleansing, colonialism, and the theft of someone's land in the pursuit of that is right. The latter is morally wrong, the former is unquestionably prejudiced and ignorant of what society is.  


And in any event, just as Israel exists, so to do the Palestinians that live in it. Do you think those people, who have been disposed and oppressed, do not matter? Do you think that they don't deserve their rights and their access to representation because of the horrors of antisemitism in other countries?
