Ah yes, that's why we run hospitals. Just tell those dying of cancer and suffering from other cruel illnesses that their Body is going to heal itself. 
Heck, even of it's not an illness, broken leg? Just don't do anything, it will fix itself. Twisted neck? Just you do you it will heal itself and you totally don't need to take care of Any movement. Decaying teeth? Again nature gonna grow you some new teef, you're apparently a shark.  A deep cut that bleed profusely? 'Tis nothing but a fleshwound. 

What you said is so stupid, dangerous and ignorant of those who are really ill. 
Be ashamed.
