apart from moving averages that affect algorithmic trading patterns and more advanced strategies, that vast majority of which I am totally unaware and therefore unable to validly critique, it all appears to be garbage - but that’s a function of the high-school drop-out level “technical analysis” vouchsafed to us on these boards and via youtube and not necessarily a fault with true “technical analysis” by charlatans and fools masquerading as experts in between video game sessions from their parents’ basements. 

For greater certainty, my criticism is of the self-proclaimed technical analysts themselves rather than what I assume to be a highly complex mathematical framework to which they have no access and with which they have no experience whatsoever.

It’s like Sarah Palin when she tried her hand at quasi-academic English... fit for SNL and not much more.
