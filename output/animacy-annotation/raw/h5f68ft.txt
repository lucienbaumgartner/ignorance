I hear you. This is a good practice to remind people to check. 

I live in Austin, TX, we have terrible drivers. In some parts of the country, "terrible driver" means they're overly aggressive, they speed excessively or they drive competitively. In Austin, "terrible driver" means that they're aloof and ignorant of traffic laws. People don't look when they're driving 75 mph, let alone when they're getting out of their car.
