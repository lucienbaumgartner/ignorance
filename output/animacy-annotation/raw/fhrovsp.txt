Has anyone watched VelociPastor yet? Saw the trailer tonight and looks fantastic, but itâ€™ll have to do it right on that thin line of knowing itself and not being over the top dumb. Its either gotta be terribly unaware and thus dumb as hell but a cult classic, or stupidly aware and thus a campy cult classic. Worth a watch; a cult classic?
