Okay, so from what I saw, they almost never got into an actual dogfight (in terms of PS2) and just killed players who were unaware and complete beginners, they might as well have had lock-ons  They themselves are still beginners, there is barely any skill here.  This does not look fun.  Is this what you want, the airframe when it was still in its infancy   And I'm not advocating for pure 1v1 Bushido hover duels, there are other facets of the PS2 airframe that offer good dogfighting that aren't hover duels nor lock-on point-and-click adventures.
