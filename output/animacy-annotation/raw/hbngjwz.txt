Nothing so severe.

But it was flattering.

I'm writing an X-over with a Pseud-OC (Insistent terminology - character origin is canon, personality is hand-crafted) and the first character the X-over character meets is a young woman who is yet-to-be but determinedly spoken for.

And from the interaction of these two through the three chapters they get acquainted, my reader/commenter (who is fandom-blind) was already shipping them in his head. Felt kind of bitter-sweet since, yeah, flattering because his personality is of my own design, but also this was a ship that not only is never leaving the harbor, is also one I attempted to torpedo. Mostly because I don't want readers to feel misled (since most are blind and unaware of the history this young woman has with her designated beau), thinking this is a thing that will happen because of the story.

And also because I did not WANT it to happen - she's guy's dude, not my idiot Pseud-OC. And it already sort of happened in a previous version of this story that my characters went behind my back and stealthily built their own ship, which I'm fine with, but did not want it to happen between these two characters at all ever.
