I mean she didn't even stop to make sure it's actually him! She just woke up, saw a man that resembles him (major different hair color) chokes him up in his sleep and forcefully kisses him when the poor guy is gasping for air and is most likely terrified and unaware of what's happening to him.
What disgusts me is the amount of readers thinking this is somehow ok and hot.. This is assault and she's no different than the ex king who forced himself into her. The only way she can redeem herself is if she immediately realizes her mistake and apologizes like crazy, she most likely thinks it's Theo and that he's aware of his past life as well. Still it's no excuse.
