Last Friday, friend and I were texting each other at work. We have known each other for 5 years, very close, and we joke around with each other a LOT.

She was having a bad day and she texted asking me if I could help with her workload, and sent a giphy of someone cracking a whip. I texted back with a smart-a\*\* answer "well that depends on what it is". She then said if I was busy, "no worrieesssss because she's so awesome".

We joke around and throw jabs at each other quite frequently. So I decided to throw a jab of my own by saying "so awesome you missed this morning's meeting?" She said she technically did not miss the ENTIRE meeting followed by a tongue sticking out emoji. 

What I said next is what she has an issue with. I texted back "I think you've got awesome and shi\*\*y mixed up". Turns out she didn't read that in a joking manner and she thought I was actually calling her a shi\*\*y person. She ended up texting back saying "wowww, that wasn't very nice. I don't need this today" And that was the last we texted on Friday.

She didn't text me for the entire weekend which I thought was odd, but maybe she was busy. Turns out I hurt her feelings when I called her shi\*\*y, and she called me "oblivious" and "beyond help" if I didn't understand that what I said crossed the line. The way I see it:

1. She should have known I was joking when I called her shi\*\*y. We've known each other for 5 years and joke around a TON.
2. Everything in the text message hinted at a light-hearted playful/joking tone, from the giphy showing a person cracking a whip (basically saying 'get to work and help me with my workload'), to her texting me "no worrieesssss" with like 5 S's at the end, to the tongue sticking out emoji, to even the "wowww, that wasn't very nice". She has said "wowww" in real life many, many times in a joking manner, so I read it as joking. If she had said "Wow. That wasn't nice" I would have understood she was being serious.  
3. Her stance is that it should have been super obvious that I crossed the line. When I tried to talk it through with her, she refused and said that she didn't feel like going back and forth...that she had "said her piece", and that if I was so oblivious and ignorant that I did not realize I crossed the line, that I am beyond help.
4. She also says I should have known she was having a bad day. But it wasn't obvious that the day was THAT much worse than most other days when she has vented to me.

AITA?
