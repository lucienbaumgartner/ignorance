Keep going. The best relationships involve people who are friends. 

I can be cold and blunt without meaning to be. The best, most helpful thing friends have done for me is to pull me aside and gently let me know that I hurt someone's feelings. I'm usually completely unaware and glad to find out so I can make amends. If she's emotionally healthy, she should be open to gentle feedback.
