The OP is so stupid and unaware that its funny. I say that because of the arrogance displayed despite being a sheeple.

Anyone who can't grasp authority could be wrong is worthless because they're so dumb they forget to factor in a well known factor called....'human error'.

Basically, being a needy/parasitic dog human that can't figure out how independent thought based on logic works, will always try to blend in with popular views like a bandwagoning sports fan taking the team as an extension of their identity....

Normal functioning people only care about what's accurate and there's no way anyone worth anything will not care about vaccines made by idiots and rushed to market without the years of testing other new medicines have.
