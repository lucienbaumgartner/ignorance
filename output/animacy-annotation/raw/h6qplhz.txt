I would say the majority of us as successful, family oriented, happy, fulfilled people. We “hate” on him because he is completely the opposite and so fucking unaware and delusional about it that we just cannot look away. 
I think a lot of us continue to make fun of him because of his reaction and some do it thinking that one day he will realize he was so wrong about everything. But he is delusional and refuses to see what the entire rest of the world sees. This is another reason he has gone all in on the swinging lifestyle. He wants to surround himself with people that are similar to him because it feeds into his delusions.
