ss13 is an automated game  
you literally can't make anything without having some degree of automation, but ss13's "visual aspects" are automated too unlike most other games  


no, my goal is to verify that you're not just spewing a bunch of asspulls

This entire thread was me explaining myself, and you denied it, so now you should explain yourself
