&gt;Does aoc?  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump doesn’t? He seems to say our country needs a wall despite the facts? He seems to say that the tax cuts would help the middle class despite the facts, that businesses receiving tax breaks would pass those on despite the facts, on and on.

Two problems here: 

First, none of these supposed statements deal in moral arguments. The moral argument would be that the state doesn't have any inherent right to seize goods or assets to fund services, and so cannot morally justify imposing taxes on people in the first place. 

As for the economic arguments (which yours are), we just disagree on what claims are more empirically defended, like how higher taxes are demotivating to worker productivity ("The state's just gonna take it anyway, so why bother working for its benefit?"); or how higher taxes limit private-sector expanses against the normal supply and demand of the private market and distorts the proper allocation of resources; or how "taxing the rich" (the people who actually pay most of the taxes) doesn't increase tax revenues (because they have the resources to pay to find and exploit tax loopholes), but instead encourages them to store their money elsewhere. I can cite all of these, if you insist.

&gt;Are you saying that the difference is that aoc is aware of her ignorance yet marches on while trump is unaware and blissfully ignorant and so it’s ok? If not can you dumb your argument down a little bit?

I'm saying that Ocasio-Cortez marches on despite full awareness of her ignorance, while Trump is noncommittal where he is ignorant and marches on when he has firm conclusions. For example, if we all learned tomorrow that the opioid and amphetamine epidemic was coming from Canada instead of Mexico, he'd demand the wall there.
