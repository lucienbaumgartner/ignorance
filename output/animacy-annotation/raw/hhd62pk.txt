Well I already am not a fan of Multiverse stuff and I believe Sony is nothing but greedy and ignorant of what makes Spidey so popular. This film is based on nothing more than a cash grab by manipulating people's nostalgia. 

That said, Loki (show) surprised me and, so far, I am actually intrigued to see how they continue to handle Multiverse stuff going forward. That plus the NWH being focused on Holland's Peter as well as Feige being over the film leaves just the barest minimum of potentiality for them to surprise me with the film. So I decided that I will go into it with as open of a mind as I can muster but honestly it's gonna take almost a miracle for me to like it.
