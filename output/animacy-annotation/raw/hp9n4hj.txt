The derangement you are displaying in this comment is disturbing and irrational. You sound like an addict looking for a fight. 

No, the random people you are masturbating over the graves of have not affected the entire world whatsoever. Outside of their media posts, their actions were probably completely inconsequential to anyone more than five miles away from them.

You think you are on some righteous crusade against some great monster, but you have actually ended up turning into one yourself. 99% of the people posted here have no political power at all, and are unaffiliated with any organization whatsoever. They're just human beings who have chosen not to get vaccinated. They aren't evil, they aren't criminals. They might be ignorant and wrong, but is that a sin worth spitting on their graves? Do you not feel any pity for these people at all?
