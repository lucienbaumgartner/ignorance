That's a movie begging to be made. Zombie apocalypse forces a bunch of frightened city folk out into the unknown Pennsylvania woods.. they stumble upon a quaint little amish village, totally self-sufficient and unaware that their little community is the last functioning quarantine on earth. Turns out the hard working Amish folks are all immune to the contagious kek virus that is ravaging the rest of the country, as it spreads easily via cell phones and mobile devices, often hidden beneath the detection of the subconscious, lurking within the top few layer of pixels in adorable cat videos. Blah nah blah, it practically writes itself!

But do we go with someone like M Night  Shamiliamadingdong, and creep everyone the duck out? Or do we get Adam Sandler and his comedy DudeBros to take this movie to an extremely unfunny level of comedy?!?! Who would play the fake-titted love interest?? PM me your crotchshots/POV selfies and your completed 23andme application to reserve a spot on my casting couch now!

(Sorry, in a goofy/sleep mood.)
