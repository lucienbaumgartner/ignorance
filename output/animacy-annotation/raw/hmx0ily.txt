The mod took my saying something that wasn't an insult as an insult, so that's not my fault. He could ask instead of acting like I did something wrong. The other guy comes at me and decides to act like I'm angry, when I'm not. I'm done dealing with you two. You're boring and rude and unaware of what discussion means. Hopefully you post somewhere else so I can watch the downvotes flood in
