Im obviously not a medical professional but are you sure she didn't have alzheimers? When my grandpa got alzheimers we went from being the most gentle man I've ever known to an angry and hateful person. Either way that is very sad. I'm sorry to hear that. My great uncle has dementia and he's mostly just always confused and unaware of what's going on even though he tries to hide it. It's heart breaking.
