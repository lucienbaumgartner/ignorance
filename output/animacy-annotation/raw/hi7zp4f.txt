&gt; Section III—By Screening

&gt; A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.

&gt; In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be. This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.

Poeltl was sealing Westbrook before anything that could be called a screen, so (1) doesn't apply (Westbrook is aware of Poeltl's position).  Poeltl wasn't setting up in Westbrook's existing direction of motion, so (3) doesn't apply.  So I'm not sure how you are applying the step rule here.  Surely the argument, as the other poster was claiming, is that Poeltl made illegal contact in the course of setting the screen.
