I think what they mean is it's far worse and scarier for the driver. I've done both and agree. No one should drive drunk, I was a young dumbass and regret it but we all make mistakes. The thing with drunk driving, your impaired but somewhat aware and try to drive well enough to not get pulled over. With the micronaps it's like one second you're fine and awake, maybe a little tired then the lights just go out and you wake up startled and unaware of where you are. I was working too much and not getting enough sleep and it caught up to me. Going home at 7 in the morning after my 3rd shift straight double, I fell asleep multiple times while driving, scared the shit out of me. Thankfully it was a holiday and the roads were empty.
