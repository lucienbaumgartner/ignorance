Are you really blaming the mother for this one? 

The father is withholding potentially lifesaving medicine from his child on the wholly incorrect and woo belief that asthma medication in some way... *causes*... ADHD and comorbid behavioral issues? 

It's so stupid and ignorant that I'm having a hard time even processing it. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder where sections of the brain are under-developed and grow slowly and there are corresponding issues with neurotransmitters. 

Children with asthma may also have ADHD as smoking in utero and during childhood may have some effect on the likelihood of causing ADHD and causing lung damage. But puffers don't cause ADHD. 

That's ridiculous, and for the father to keep prescribed medications from his kid based on quack beliefs verges on neglect. He *should* be legally prevented from keeping puffers from his kid, and he should be visited by CPS to be sure he knows how and when to use the puffers properly an when they're warranted.
