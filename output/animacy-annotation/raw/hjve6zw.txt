But what you’ve failed to see here is the reality behind those “flashbacks” that have been dismissed by many for years 

It is a very real reality when taking LSD and other substances if you want to know more and educate yourself on the dangers drugs like LSD can cause take a trip over to r/hppd and talk to some of those people who suffer greatly with this disorder sometimes even after taking the drug once 

Don’t be blind and ignorant of this shit man just because your okay doesn’t mean this kid will be fine 

What if they end up with an horrible case of hppd? People need to stop acting like acid is this weird exception to negative effects 

Many people have thought as you do and felt the reality of negative repercussions of psychedelics
