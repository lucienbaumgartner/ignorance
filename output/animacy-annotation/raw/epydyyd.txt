For a better - if much older - example, look back at *The Beverly Hillbillies* in its portrayals of rural (especially Southern rural) people. Compare and contrast with *The Andy Griffith Show*, which had a broad spectrum of rural Southern characters, instead of the one-dimensional "ignorant hick" stereotypes of *The Beverly Hillbillies*.

As to how these two shows relate to *The Big Bang Theory*? Simple: in-group vs. out-group dynamics. In *The Beverly Hillbillies*, all of the main characters (as in *The Big Bang Theory*) form an in-group that, both as individuals and as a collective, are completely unaware and unable to function in the society around them, versus the out-group members of society, who routinely take advantage of the situation, only to be undone by their *own* actions. The principle characters exist to be laughed AT, rather than WITH, and no character exists within the show as an audience surrogate, so someone watching can put themselves "into the show", imagination making enjoyment of the show deeper and more than just a passive experience. Again, compare this to *The Andy Griffith Show*, where there *is* an audience surrogate (Sherrif Taylor), and while there are certainly characters to be laughed at, and *wildly* stereotypical ones at that - looking at you, Ernest T. Bass! - the laughing was done by both the in- and the out-groups within the show, thus making the characters ones you laugh WITH and not AT, even when you are laughing at the antics of a particular one of the characters. 

As far as *Rosanne* and *Blackish*, the humor in those shows is more in the vein of *The Andy Griffith Show*, in that most of the comedy results from in-group interaction, with brief interaction of in-group vs out-group - but even in the latter, the protagonists of both shows are often equal, if not the winners of any interaction. Contrast this to *The Beverly Hillbillies*, *The Big Bang Theory* or *Two and A Half Men*, the majority of the "humor" derived from what I refer to as "rubber crutch jokes": the main characters, unaware and/or unable to function on the same level of competence as the average person, fall down (in the interpersonal and social sense) repeatedly. Funny stuff - for some folks.
