&gt; As evidenced by your fevered rate of responses.

Im constantly clicking on links,so the mailbox is refreshing(do you not know how reddit works? im guesssing so since you didnt know he was a man), and your response is the same time...project much?

Nah but seriously your a moron with stupid statements like this bc its as applicable to you as well

&gt;but I'm not so deluded and ignorant that I don't recognize that some people, who theoretically according to their weight/height should be able to, can't.

Yeah we covered that when i was talking about able bodied people remember? keep up man

&gt;you should keep using "your" in incorrect places, it lets people know exactly the mental midget that you are.

lol correcting grammar. Thats how you know you lost an argument. lol

I just dont care enough about you or your opinion to take the time to correct them.

&gt;With this in mind, the average untrained man can squat 125 pounds"

is that ability based on you and your inability to do so. Look you think some random internet source is gospel which is your downfall in the whole argument. or attempted argument from what it appears
