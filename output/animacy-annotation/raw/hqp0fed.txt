Stop swearing at me and calling me insulting names.

You used a term that shouldn’t be used in general. Also, you can be disabled and perpetuate ableism, which is what you’re doing when you defend an ableist antivaxxer as simply stigmatizing vaccines out of love for her son.

You seem very ignorant and childish. We will not be having any further discussion. I advise you to stop speaking on matters you do not understand and defending antivaxxers.
