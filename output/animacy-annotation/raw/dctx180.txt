He says nothing of the kind. He says, quote: "TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running."

And the "we all" in that sentence obviously refers to media and America in general (which, again, quote, has been quite happy to "to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry"). You are reading something into it that's not there.

Jesus Christ, what is it with you people? You can't help lying even when there isn't anything at stake, like in this discussion. Is it some genetic condition or something?
