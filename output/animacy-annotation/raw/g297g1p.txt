You are pathetic and you want to be a mother, hence wannamama. We've already covered how you're pathetic and you've stopped arguing about that so hopefully it means you're engaging in some introspection as to how you want to take from society without giving anything back to it.



I was/am offended because your comments were consistently negative towards anyone who doesn't want a child for anything other than financial reasons. I'm offended because you tried to claim a label you have no right to. I'm offended because by claiming that label you damage it. You are the ammunition other people throw in the face of CF people because "Girlygirl said she was CF but now she has kids and is so happy! You'll change your mind too!" when you were *never* CF and *never* changed your mind.


You came into our safe space to attack and belittle us. You made a post here claiming CF people always try and play the victim. Yet your posts and comments in CF show that you see yourself as a victim because you want to have kids but are choosing to delay that decision. You're unhappy with your life and decision to turn down the dude that asked to marry you and make you a SAHM. Why you turned him down idk when you keep saying you want a life like your sisters, with a husband to give you a house and take you travelling and all you have to do is have a couple of kids because you think working is a waste of time.


You came into r/childfree to mock, belittle, and insult. I'm not playing the victim. I'm standing up against a selfish, entitled bully. It's just easy in this case because you're so pathetic and ignorant that you can't even come up with a logical rebuttal. Instead you keep contradicting yourself and ignoring the quotes showing that.
