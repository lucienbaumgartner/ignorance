I see ‘requirements’ quite often really. For some people, bios have become where you ask/demand what you want/need are looking for, instead of a place where you describe yourself. 

There are tons of horribly made bios from a ton of girls who don’t have any self-awareness. Some are average girls, some are not so great women, some are terrible and wicked beasts. But some may be pretty nice girls. Just dumb and unaware, and often young. These all let me know that *I* don’t have any interest in this person. 

I know for me, self-awareness and the *desire* to look inward is pretty important to me in a partner. 

And all-in-all, listing what you want is not inherently a bad thing. 

If the desires are worded well so they don’t come off as demands/requirements, are reasonable things, and even more so if they come with open and valid explanations, then they don’t really bother me and it helps me move on to greener pastures instead of wasting my time saying anything at all. I prefer that to matching with her and getting silence forever. 


Sorry for that wall of text. Little bit of pharmaceutical stimulants plus weed and boredom.... and well.. here I am.
