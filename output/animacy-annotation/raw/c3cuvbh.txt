On the first day of "big school" I ran into the biggest, meanest kid in the school and he threatened to kill me. I was completely naive and unaware that people could be nasty as I grew up in a small village where everyone got along. That was the most any threat has ever affected me, even to this day but it did make me man up somewhat.
