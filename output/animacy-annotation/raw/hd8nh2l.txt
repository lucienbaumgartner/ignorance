If you’re in the area, please leave Brian alone. You aren’t helping by harassing him and his family. To be clear, there’s no chance that Gabby is lost somewhere and Brian holds the vital information to save her within 72 hours. That’s just false. Either she’s dead or she’s safe and unaware of the search for her for whatever reason. Any other precarious wilderness situation is already case 1 by now. 

It’s pretty pointless to insist on asking a murderer where they hid the body or to insist on asking someone who ruthlessly left their spouse to succumb to the elements where they are. And if she died by a genuine freak accident or self harm, and Brian knows this, then giving her family closure might not be worth the legal risk of placing yourself in that incident. If she’s ultimately safe, then you’re just harassing him for no reason. Regardless, antagonizing Brian and his family, directly or indirectly, is not the way to go. The best hope for a positive outcome is to just let LE do its job and to raise awareness/support gabby’s family. 

It literally never turns out well when the public begins to intercede and starts to actively antagonize POIs and their families. Let the police do their job, and please don’t engage any suspects in the case or try to harass them or their poor, poor neighbors. This can easily escalate to a dangerous place and you don’t want to be part of the pitchfork mob that led it there.
