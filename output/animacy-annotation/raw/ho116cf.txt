Absolutely, and I am so horrified that you had to go through that. In my experiences observing my friends, gay men are actually more touchy and ignorant of physical boundaries because they think of themselves as having different permissions or “one of the girls” or something. It’s only fine if you give consent, and I edited my comment to reflect that. 

I hope you are healing now, and wish you all the support and happiness 💕
