its honestly quite tremendous. I've always heard about long waiting times being a thing (from American commentators) and the longest I've ever had to wait to see a doctor was 48 hours, and that's because the ones they offered I couldn't do. And these are in a number of areas, with different doctors + surgeries.

As for surgeries, the NHS saved my life when I was born, had my trachea + food tube fused together when I was born, so was fed and started to choke. Had a operation right there and then to cut it up, had a long stay in hospital, didn't cost my parents anything and I was all fixed up, and have had nothing but solid support since then if any issues arose. 

Since then I've used the NHS lots for a load of things, but the only cost is buying tablets and things from pharmacies, which is about 8 pounds/15 dollars or so per prescription, and doctors will always try and double up and say you need more than you should per prescription when its a repeat. My antacid meds the doctor said he'd put a triple order in, so I get a load for 8 pounds instead of shelling out that for one pack I get 3.

Everything basic is covered up to 18, dentists/opticians etc, and even beyond that its well covered and deducted if you earn under a certain amount/are a student etc. I was so pleased to find out that my dentists appointment didn't cost me a penny because I was unemployed at the time, was totally unaware and dreading to pay out (its not a lot of money, I believe its 20 pounds or so, but still) and then found out I was free as not working. 

Its not all roses though, as with everything it has problems, there are bureaucracy issues slowing it all down, there are certainly problems. But I fucking love it, genuinely would be among the top of my list of "why UK is pretty fucking tremendous"
