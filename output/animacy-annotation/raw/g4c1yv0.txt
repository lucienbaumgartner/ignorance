It literally means "that one". Like if you are pointing something out in a set.

Che ge means "this one".

So, if you are ordering food at a Subway and want to tell them what to prepare, you point at something and say "ni ge" (that one), "he ni ge" (and that one).

Ordering from a menu? You point at specific items and can say "che ge" (this one), " he che ge" (and this one).

The 'i' is prounced with a long 'Ä“' sound, as in "tea". The 'e' is prounced as you might hear in "the".

Ni ge sounds like  nee geh, which can probably upset some American English speakers that are hypersensitive and unaware that other languages exist.
