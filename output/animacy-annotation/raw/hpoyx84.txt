I went into the pharmacy yesterday and I was shocked that I was only one wearing a mask. There’s a big sign on both doors you go through too. The pharmacist was coming out of the room they use to administer the vaccine without one. I don’t like wearing a mask because it can get hard to breathe especially if the place you’re at has the thermostat cranked up to Sahara. But I understand the importance of wearing one and will continue to wear one for a long time. I don’t understand where this selfishness comes from. It used to be that people tried to help others and most did the right thing but now it seems more a badge of honor to be an asshole and to just dismiss those around you because you don’t feel like it. I understand your feelings, I don’t like confrontation at all but I’ve learned to stand my ground. This pandemic has really shown the world just how ignorant and selfish people really are. Honestly, I just want all them all to get Covid so they will finally understand the difference between not being able to breathe with a mask on and having to wear one of the oxygen variety because they can’t breath at all.
