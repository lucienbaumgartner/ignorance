Thanks for responding. I would say that, by it's very definition, there is such a thing as neurotypical. Obviously, there is, as well, an enormous amount of neurological and psychological complexity within the broader population of people who do not experience the traits associated with ADHD or autism, but from what I understand there are observable and quantifiable differences between those who fall into the camps of neurodiverse and neurotypical. 

I liked how you described the mannerisms that you admire as, "things that make her different from everyone else". I feel like someone is at their most attractive in those unaware and uninhibited little moments, where they are acting in a way that is completely unique to them. 

I'm a little confused by your last statement. Are you saying that people who are neurodiverse are creating posts, and stating that their particular conditions are the cause of their DB's? I suppose I could see how that could be the case if certain medications like antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs are involved. I personally don't take either type of medication, but I understand that the side effects can be pretty bad. It would be interesting to know how often those types of medications are prescribed to neurodiverse and neurotypical people, as a proportion of their respective overall populations.
