For my money (not that I have any) the peak of nostalgia in filmmaking has gotta be Mad Men. The pitch Don gives for the Kodak Carousel not only describes nostalgia and why it’s useful for manipulation (and propaganda) but it’s the final moments of the first season finale and essentially acts as a meta commentary are the show and it’s goals. How the past looks sweeter than it was and how nostalgia has everything to do with you being younger, less informed, and unaware of the world around you. That’s what I love about that theme: Nostalgia is so powerful, and it usually has ugly affects on people who want to escape back into a world that never really was.
