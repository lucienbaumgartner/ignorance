I tried Horus Rising when I was completely new and unaware of Warhammer lore and I noped out for a month after that first scene. It also didn't help that Loken rambles off a bunch of names (Sejanus, Torgaddon, the Warmaster) that a newbie has never heard of and has no context for. I understand people going rant mode.
