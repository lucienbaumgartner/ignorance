I am ok. I get on quite well when people are a bit rude to me, so long as they do not cross very real lines that one should not cross. This all is fine. I am not a snowflake, although thank you for reminding people of the meta-thread concept of "Don't downvote a fucking question, or you just look afraid and ignorant of what someone might say when they respond with opinion and/or sources".

Downvoting a question is bad form though. I had no agenda when I asked that question...apparently now my agenda is to slightly explain why it is dangerous to call people "foreign agents" without proof...just because they hold radical(or perhaps even what you perceive as "evil") opinions.
