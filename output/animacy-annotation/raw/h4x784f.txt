Does it matter?   
I stopped reading after your first sentence was wrong. After all, its the entire reason for fitness standards for vehicles and why no business makes cars that fall apart in weeks.   
Frankly, your comments are so inept, arrogant and ignorant of the world at large, that it's not worth my time. It's no skin off my nose if you keep making idiotic, erroneous statements.   
After all, Im not the one showing themselves to be ignorant.
