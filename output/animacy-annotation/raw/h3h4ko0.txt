on the first half of that, DnD is not a competitive game, and doesn't encourage or foster the trashtalk that you might see in a game like league of legends or a fighting game..  


In league you might tell someone they suck at the game, but the context is entirely different and the depth of that insult is, based on the community, to be taken with a grain of salt. In terms of DnD, it's a board game you play, that many people put heart and soul into, and frankly it isn't intended to be competitive in any way.  


Ok so maybe some people are rude because they're socially awkward, i've totally done that before by mistake, and i get that, but why are we tolerating it to just keep happening.  


Personally if i'm being rude and unaware of it I'd rather know so i can stop.
