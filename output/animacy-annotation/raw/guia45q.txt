For every non-essential traveller who is as vigilant as your friend, there are probably 50 who are completely wreckless and ignorant of any measures to reduce transmission.

I've cancelled non-essential travel plans three times already in the past year, even though I would have exercised this level of caution. I've booked a campsite in May but even that might get axed.
