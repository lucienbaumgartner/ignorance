&gt;  I can also think she’s a racist piece of shit.  These aren’t mutually exclusive. 

You can't make any inference about people from what they do or say when drugged out of their gourd or having acute psychosis. Just like you can't look at Usain Bolt with a broken leg and infer that he is a shit runner.


&gt;Calling me an idiot for assuming you had a race problem 

I called you and idiot because you make unjustified inferences based on motivated reasoning. You don't know me. Nothing I said suggested in any way that I had any "race problem". What I have is a "ignorant and callous about mental illness"-problem. *That* you can infer, because I nearly directly said that.

&gt; and jumping into how much better your country is than ours, kinda proves my point.

In this regard, a majority, if not all, developed rich nations are better than the US, which is the country of comparison given the video. I have no idea if that's *your* country. In other respects, the US is better. The quality of US universities is impressive, for example. The socio-economic edifice they've built around them isn't, but that's another issue.
