Anyone who's been to Manhattan's Chinatown and have surveyed its eats will come to know Nom Wah, a famous Dim Sum parlor, a NYC institution dating back eons ago and now fronted by Wilson Tang who's done pretty well for himself. But here's one glaring problem for many successful Asians, there always this white worship syndrome, this yearning to be in proximity to white supremacy which clouds their thought that prevents them from empowering themselves and their fellow Asians. Unlike other ethnic and racial groups who are more collectivist when they are in proximity to white supremacy, East Asians act like single individuals seeking white validation in white spaces. 

An old article about Wilson Tang where he is being interviewed here.

College educated Wilson Tang is an anomaly in the way that he operates successfully in an Asian enclave, but not an anomaly when it comes to using that success to funnel his lifestyle in accordance to white supremacy ideals that a lot of individual Asians aspire to do.

This guy is practically an embodiment of a success story for what many Asian activists envision. You work in your own community and make a good living from it. Unfortunately, he is unwoke and unaware of his surroundings. Chinatown is of course an immigrant neighborhood with a lot of issues including poverty and isolation. Yet this guy talks about his lifestyle living among white people and shopping at their Whole Foods and other amenities that white people like to have around their neighborhoods. He's an unwoke who sees his fellows Asians as poor immigrants who need to climb the socieoeconomic ladder one step at a time instead of providing a leg up for them because he embodies what they should be aspiring to. You work your way up in America to top so you can be adjacent to white supremacy as a single individual and not as a group. In some of the other articles, I'm reading all of his employees live in the Asian enclaves while he lives in expensive white spaces.
