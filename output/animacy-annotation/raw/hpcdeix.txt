Did I mention Adderall? No I didn't, so stop making assumptions. You are the one who is ignorant. Like I said I don't give a fuck what adults do to their own bodies. Obviously it's their body and they can do what they want with it. But they are legal adults and can consent and make informed and independent decisions.  Children cannot. If we use your logic then we should respect any decision a child makes because it's their body? Do you realize how irresponsible and ignorant that is? I guess not. 

Imagine a child wants to drink alcohol or eat nothing but candy. Your logic would say that we have no right to control what children do to their own bodies.

Just stop. You think you are the righteous defender of children but you really really are not. Children are not adults and therefore can't make decisions as adults. 

Now please just leave me alone. We clearly are not going to agree and that's fine. I'm just fine with not agreeing with someone that I think is promoting child abuse.

Goodbye.
