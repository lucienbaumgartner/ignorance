I said you were dumb for claiming America "birthed cronyism", while calling all capitalism cronyism, and just completely ignoring things like American history, or British history, or where the idea of privatization comes from, or any of the EICs of the past, which people like to call government supported, but they were only government supported in that they had permission. So sorry you got offended that I used a light-hearted word to point out exactly how stupid and ignorant that one sentence was, but it was. Now quit being such a snowflake
