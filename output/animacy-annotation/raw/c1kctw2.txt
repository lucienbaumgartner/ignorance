&gt; Arab Muslim Anti-Semitic piece of shit

It's confusing that you would criticize someone for hating a culture, while you spew hatred for a culture.  I'm sure you justify your hateful behavior in your own mind by thinking about how hateful and unaware that other person must be.

&gt; pseudo intellectuals and faux historians

I was taught that society views hateful language as ignorant, foolish, shameful, and embarrassing.  Because you use hateful language with no shame, I assume that you are somewhat ignorant of society.  In your ignorance, you have no place to insult the people here.

And if you are so confident in your beliefs, you should consider the arguments against your case with an open mind.  I'm glad that you are here to have these discussions, and I hope that you will accept that there is no harm in being honest to yourself and realistically evaluating another man's viewpoints without letting anger cut off your thought process.

I hope that you realize you are fighting for a side simply because you were born on it, not because the side is right.  I'm not saying that the Muslim side is "right."  Both sides are probably wrong, and you know that, but you indulge in the darker emotions because it is easy and feels good.  That does not make it right.
