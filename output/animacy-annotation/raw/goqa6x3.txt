Sounds like my boomer father. He started at a cabinet shop in the 70s, at age 16, making 13$/hr. (Almost 30$/hrs adjusted])

He and his junkie friends were mostly able to work menial jobs, and afford a house, or inherit one from their parents. They didn't have perfect lives but the systems were there to support them and not allow them to fall behind, despite their best efforts to fail. 

I was working for a cabinet shop a couple years ago for 14$/hr. Their lives weren't necessarily better,  just much easier to survive and advance. 

He's embarrassingly naive and ignorant of what people go through today,  his only source for fact or opinions come from right wing media. Listening to him defend his beliefs is the saddest shit.  He knows he's ignorant,  just doesn't like to belive it.
