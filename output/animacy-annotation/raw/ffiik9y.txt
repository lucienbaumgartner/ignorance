&gt;You see, you are really uninformed and unaware that those rankings are heavily biased in favor of people who have socialized medicine

"These rankings aren't favourable for the US.... ThEy MuSt Be BiAsEd aGaInSt ThE US"  


&gt; while your own former NIH director died on a waiting list in the UK for a procedure he would have gotten immediately

Not that I'd expect you to know this, but the ruling Conservative party in the UK have been cutting funding to the NHS for the last decade. Staff are overworked and underfunded because of conservative policies, because the Conservatives want, and have been saying so for years, that they want to switch the country to private healthcare. The NHS isn't perfect, but at least we don't have people saying "don't call me an Ambulance" "But you've been stabbed" "yeah, but I can't afford an ambulance".  


&gt;I am not a rich man because I spent half my life believing stuff like you seem to believe: the system is rigged and hopeless and there is no chance in trying to be successful.

Ah, I see. So you think that I'm not going to be well off?   
I'm an aerospace engineering bachelor student who is doing pretty damn well for themselves at the moment. I have a lot of options after I graduate - but not everyone is cut out to be an aerospace engineer.  
That shouldn't be an excuse for people not getting a decent job and not getting decent healthcare.   
The US has way too many people below the poverty line, and honestly, I think you have no idea what the jobs market is like these days. I think you're a middle aged guy who lucked out into a decent job and has no clue what it is like trying to find employment in the current climate, but you insist on telling younger generations that it is their fault.  
But by all means, keep fooling yourself that the US is only filled with lazy people who don't want to work. I hope for your family's sake that you don't end up finding out what the real world is like.
