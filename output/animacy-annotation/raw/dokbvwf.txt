Is it just me or is the mom/teacher (also in most others with similar setups) just so cringey with the acting? The "kids" are doing so well in acting pretty blank and unaware and ready to learn but the moms just go

"Ok this is sex, and there's definitely \*wink wink\* nothing wrong with what's happening right now, and you have to do it this way"

then at some point the mom's going to just steal the show, ignore the girl and fuck the hot young man in front of her

It feels more like the woman paid these two to play out an incest-tutor than actually taking time to think how to carry out this otherwise interesting niche artfully wow im such a critic

Can't you just let them enjoy, supervise? Have them learn with your guidance and not just spoonfeed everything in almost every stage of the process? Does every young person have to learn sex from someone waaay older like it's some math equation?

That or she's just a terrible teacher
