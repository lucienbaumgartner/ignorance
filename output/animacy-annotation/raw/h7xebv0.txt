Name one? I can name *hundreds*. The number of pogroms committed against Jews by feudal regimes is horrific and nigh uncountable. Half the castles and cathedrals in Europe were built with stolen Jewish money. 

It was a monarchy that tore apart the New World for gold and God. The Spain that eradicated the Aztec peoples was ruled by a king. 

It was a succession of monarchies that ripped open Africa and created the most monstrous slave trade in world history, all the way into the industrial era. The Belgium that devoured the Congo was ruled by a king. 

Protestant monarchies spent centuries burning Catholics at the stake, and Catholic monarchies spent centuries burning Protestants at the stake. They both spent centuries burning Muslims, Jews, and outspoken women at the stake. 

The crusades, wars intended to destroy a religious ideology, were initiated and carried out by monarchies.

I could go on but hopefully the point is becoming clear. You are either extremely young and ignorant of history, or a troll. No sensible adult honestly believes that monarchy is a just and bloodless system of government.

By the way, the Russian monarchy was dissolved in the 20th century so get this 3000bc bullshit out of my face. Monarchies ruled most of Europe well into the 1700s and beyond.
