OP lacks emotional IQ, maturity, social skills. Seems arrogant and ignorant of his own issues and is stubborn.  This likely bleeds into his work. If I was in senior management I'd see these as personality and leadership defects and give the promotion to someone else. 

Wake up OP and humble your shit.
