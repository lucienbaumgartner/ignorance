This is how she is going to be throughout your marriage .   You two need to rethink the wedding and her expectations.   It sounds like you are being the adult in the relationship and she is resentful and unaware of what you have to do to make up for her spending.  This will get worse over time and not get better until she is on her own having to deal with day to day bills and living in her own.   You two may need to take a break or break up until she can resolve her spending issues.   And trust me the work situation will get worse until she either asks for a divorce or cheats on you because she feels you donâ€™t care about her.
