New Zealand has no land boarders and is not a major transport hub. 
Most of New Zealandâ€™s early cases came from people who transported from or through USA. 
It would have been easy to keep New Zealand free of the illness. 
Places like Europe and America would be not so easy. 
Your comparison is ignorant to those facts. 
USA Is like a large group of states that are like countries and has substantial land boarders and transport hubs. 
You are obviously very confused and ignorant that Jacinda had a very easy job to do and managed 
to do a very mediocre job of it.

Another country that closed its borders early had zero deaths so your make no difference is wrong as to the regards of the people who lost their lives.
