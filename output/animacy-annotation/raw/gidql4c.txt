It is regressive people like you exist; people who hold on to the hindu ideals of guru shirsha where the teacher is revered to the point of worship. I doubt that teacher has great knowledge like most teachers in Bangladesh. Most are oblivious and ignorant of teaching delivery methods and often rely on sarcastic jabs and when possible physical violence.  

Imagine calling a prof in Bangladesh by his first name.
