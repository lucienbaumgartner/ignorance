Yes, I share your perspective as well.
I've done a lot of personal research about neuroscience and all the latest discoveries in regards to the human brain and it's components and functionality.


I did this mostly out of necessity ever since I began to develope a lot of psychological issues that made me very vigilant of how to better handle my emotional volatility and cognitive  impairments and some of the things I learned completely changed my general outlook on our human nature and our conscience experiences.

 I recently reached a point where I feel as though I have completely mastered my ability to regulate emotions and enhance my cognition through different mental practices such as meditation, active discipline techniques akin to forced cold exposure, breathing exercises, brain games and so on.

My own insights and revelations guided by the scientific knowledge I have gained have done wonders and I cant even imagine how much the benefits of new medical procedures alongside the self imposed lifestyle changes will have in the future.
However, another one of my concerns is that I notice all to much how little the general populace actually care about educating themselves about the scientific aspects of the reality they live in, especially in regards to their own biology and physiology and how they can essentially hack those factors that may seem initially impossible to change.

Although, I do understand apart of that problem is due to the neglected parts of the public educational institutions that the governments infrastructure has set up that makes people almost despise learning because they make it so tedious and forced.
But if people cared just a fraction more about learning and being informed the world would be exponentially a better place but their is no initiative to learn things other than financial motive to not be in debt or homeless and that's not how it should be whatsoever.

Personally I also believe that there are ways to better distribute resources to scientific fields of interest to improve the acceleration rate of progress even further but Im also realistically minded in the sense that I understand that it would probably be impossible to employ because most people won't band together to put too much of a emphasis on the STEM fields because they care too much about living a leisurely life and just enjoying the entertainment aspects of society not realizing that if they boy cot certain industries and corporations in favor of allocating more resources to scientific and technological developments that their capacity to "enjoy life to the fullest" will be much more accessible and the notion that in order to be happy you have to retire in your late 60s after years of pain staking labor and sacrifices and the occasional weekend shenanigans that are entirely too superficial anyways. 

But people are way to short sighted and that once again loops back to the fact that they are so completely uneducated and unaware of the true reality of their lives.

Basically after this rambling I'm just trying to say if the more influencial people could find a better way to motivate the younger generation of kids to focus on self education rather than just following the publicly accepted template of traditional brick and mortar schooling programs then they would find  success not only for themselves but for the rest of society as well because they will eventually have preferential  satisfaction in finding the answers to lifes toughest questions rather than trying to impress people with their style, rap skills, basketball skills and etc. 

I understand that not everyone will have my exact perspective but I only say this because I used to be like all the other kids who looked up to athletes, actors, musicians for my inspirations  in life but after doing some real critical thinking after not being tought in school I realized how little those types of people actually contributed to society and that's when I realized the true value of STEM. 

I just think people's priorities are really misaligned with what they say their motives are for helping and contributing to society as a whole and I blame it mostly on the combination of governmental ordinances, medias influence and the perpetual reinforcement of traditional morals and direction of lifestyle choices from previous generations that couldn't see far enough into the future and the potential it holds just through some short term sacrifices and proper motivations.
