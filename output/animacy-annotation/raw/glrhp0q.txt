I’m not putting blame on anyone in 40% of all cases it is male factor alone. And I’m not arguing with anyone if they feel that way then that’s on them. And ok you have egg quality issues so your husband is infertile too? How do you know it’s not his sperm too? He could have unexplained infertility then even with perfect semen analysis and perfect dna fragmentation. So he could be the one that’s infertile not you. See how sexist and ignorant that sounds? Seriously when a woman says for example she has had several miscarriage and endometriosis but her husband has perfect sperm no one would ever say he’s the reason they aren’t getting pregnant. Sorry that’s not how fertility works takes soerm and plenty of it and healthy sperm to get pregnant
