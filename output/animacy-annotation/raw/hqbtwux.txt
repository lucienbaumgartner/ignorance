Old people, my relatives included, are generally very selfish, entitled, detached from reality, and douchey frankly. Other than my dad I can't really stand any of my older relatives, they're so ignorant and selfish that it's disgusting. I just avoid talking to them at this point honestly, there's no point in trying anymore.
