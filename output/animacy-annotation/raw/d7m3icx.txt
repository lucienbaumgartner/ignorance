I'm the guy who posted the links. Now whether or not he had sex with underage girls on these flights is still in question, I don't doubt that. However I do not believe that someone in such a high position as *President* would be unaware of the behavior of Mr. Epstein. There is **mounds** of evidence to support a highly organized international pedophilia ring involving these rich and powerful people. If you are skeptical of this you should check this wonderful post from a few years ago:

So, let's say Bill really isn't a pedophile. What was he doing on these flights, especially without SS? If he's not engaging in this lurid activity, then he's doing something else shady. You don't just go on private flights with known pedophile billionaires to snack on tea and crumpets. Maybe he was taking bribes? If so would that be better or worse than pedophilia? Seriously, wtf is he doing? 

In the end Bill is a highly powerful and connected person who associated quite often with this evil billionaire. If you want to believe he was unaware and totally innocent in regards to the pedophile's affairs then go right ahead, but I seriously doubt that.
