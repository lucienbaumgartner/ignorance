The main reason for them not giving GER Giorno's voice would be to differentiate the two during their scene.

Giorno is unaware and unconscious during the erased time, and giving GER it's own voice would help clarify that it's moving independently.

GER having the voice actor of Jonathan or Dio, not the exact voice, would only be an aesthetic decision, and would make as much sense as using any other actor. 
But, that's just my opinion.
