This is the penultimate entry for this story with essentially an epilogue to follow.

I tried to keep the word count down, but this still clocks in at just over 2,000 words. I didn't want to sacrifice substance for brevity, and I couldn't think of a meaningful way to divide it into two entries. I wanted this scene well described, and Travis's perspective, both as passenger and victim, to be fully explored.

I considered cutting the introduction with Liz out, but I didn't want to drop the reader in unaware and unprepared. I also wanted the reader to (hopefully) catch the tense change from the intro to the body of the story. My goal was to illustrate where Travis's mind is currently, in this case, he *is* with Liz, not *was* with her.

I knew setting out that Travis and Scott would fail here. I've been mulling over this scene since I started writing these entries back in September, and couldn't bring myself to let them win. It all happens too suddenly and too quickly, the events too powerful and unknown. I didn't want to degrade the stakes I set up, so Scott was basically doomed to start.

It hurt to write the story of what happened in room 313. I knew it was a father-daughter scene, and it would come back to the same rage Travis was susceptible to, but I never imagined it would play out the way it did, at least not until I was writing it. I found myself avoiding even thinking about it until I sat down to write it.

Seeing as how NaNoWriMo is going on, I'm thinking about expanding this story out, either with Travis attempting the room again, having the benefit of knowing what to expect now, or by telling the same story from other perspectives, i.e. Scott's or Otto's or Lucy's perspective (spoiler, Lucy and little Alice have their own story waiting in the wings.)
