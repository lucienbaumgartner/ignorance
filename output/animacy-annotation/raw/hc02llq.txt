Every example where “the people” get uninhibited and unchecked power has lead to mob mentality, and a general deterioration of human rights. This will lead to someone filling that power vacuum, wherein they will eventually deteriorate human rights. There is no incremental process that’s going to make any system work. Empires have fallen constantly through all of history and they will continue to. Humanity will exist in a constant state of conflict because no one answer exists to giving humans governance fairly, equally, and while respecting rights. We are impermanent, and all of our ideas about a utopia are brain dead and ignorant of history.
