.22 can capably kill coyote and boar. Theres even an example of someone killing an elephant with them. The point is that your soft fleshy body really doesnt care about exactly how big or fast moving the bit of metal lodged in your liver is. Frankly, where you get shot has a much higher bearing on your chances if survival than the bullet calibre. All firearms should be treated with equal respect as they can easily take someone's life if they are not. Tbh youre the one acting like its a game where .22 is some kind of level one round that takes 25 shots to inflict lethal damage.

But back to what we we actually talking about, so whats the point then? Which criminals are you going to kill? If you carry, and you get mugged, drawing while theres already a gun pointed at you is not gonna end well. In almost every situation I can think of with an assailant they've got attackers advantage and are already aiming at you before you have chance to do anything. And if you dont, its for defence against home invaders right? But thieves arent gonna rob you while you're home and if they do, they probably aren't gonna fight to the death if you confront them, lotta thieves dont want to become killers, and I dont think the death penalty is an appropriate response. So unless your first response to any perceived threat is to kill, just quit it with the Judge Dredd attitude. Youre irresponsible, uncaring, arrogant, and ignorant of the respect guns should command.
