I know things grow, but honestly I think they're effected by entropy. Like on a universal scale, isn't it pretty much observed that as time goes on everything breaks down? It's the same as people are over time as they age and grow themselves. Things might improve, but all I tend to feel like I'm seeing are people both unaware and unconcerned with anything growing too much. Or, even if people are concerned the structure of how things seem to be playing out basically keeps people segregated in a way. The system that we should be able to use to fix and improve things is the problem in and itself, or at least that's my perception of it. But, I'm pretty much a pessimist as you may be able to tell.
