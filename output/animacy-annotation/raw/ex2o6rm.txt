2 minutes here and 2 minutes there adds up quick. A 15 minute delay every work day adds up to like 60 hours by the end of the year. Is it the worst problem in the world? No, but solving it is entirely uncomplicated and easy. And we all know that the chances are high that the Toyota driver is just unaware, and unawareness behind the wheel is an actual problem. 

I've also started biking around town, so I'm hyperaware of bike lanes. The Toyota isn't blocking the bike lane, but he or she is keeping a car from clearing it.
