As someone from another country I can still barely believe that masks in a pandemic are a point of contention.

Like really? We knew in 1918 that they helped, are they the solution? No.  Are they helpful? Yes. 

Why are people so adamant in not wanting to help? I just don't understand how people can be so ignorant and selfish..
