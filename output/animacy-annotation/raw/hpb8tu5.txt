I’m not being mean or spiteful. Your argument was objectively ignorant and naive. That isn’t an insult, it’s just lack of information, combined with disinformation/misinformation. That isn’t a personal attack, you DID make an ignorant and naive argument. That’s okay. It doesn’t mean I hate you, it doesn’t mean I think you’re a bad person.
