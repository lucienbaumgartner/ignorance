For context this is a result of Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, explaining how his household was reducing their plastic uses. He was caught unaware and unprepared for the media’s questions and responded with:

“Uh, we, uh, we have recently switched to drinking, uh, water bottles out of, uh, water out of, uh, when we have water bottles, uh, out of plastic, uh, sorry, away from plastic towards, uh, paper, um, like drink box water bottles sort of things.”

The whole of Canada latched onto this and there was an increase in Trudeau ridicule across the country as people attempted to show their contribution to the economy by displaying their “drink box water bottle sort of things” on social media. Quite a funny time to be on social media tbh
