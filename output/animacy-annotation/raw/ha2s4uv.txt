That you're basing your votes on positive or negative aspects of the candidate and not their policies. It means pretty much what it says.

And you've thrown out dozens of insults on this discussion alone. If you're not trying to be offensive then you must have tied a steak around your neck for the dog to play with you. 

Or are you so self righteous and unaware that you honestly don't see how offensive you have been to several people here? I'm only giving you back what you've dished out to others. Heck, I stepped in because of how offensive you were being to others in this thread. I don't normally post in Reddit...but you were being so offensive that I just had to call you on your bullshit.
