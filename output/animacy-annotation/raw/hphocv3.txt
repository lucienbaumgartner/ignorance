Technically speaking, it is a sexuality. It is not one that we should accept by any means, but it technically is. Pedophiliacs don’t choose to be attracted to children. Most of them go their entire lives without doing anything sexual towards a minor. A lot of people say “oh why don’t they just go to therapy?” How the hell are they gonna do that. You can’t just go to a therapist and say “I’m attracted to children.” The current view on pedophilia that society has is incredibly ignorant and dangerous. It does more harm than good.
