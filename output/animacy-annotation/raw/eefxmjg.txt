This is the second top post of all time in this subreddit:

[Can we pause to applaud two of the best lawyers in the USA? Their sincerity was remarkable. Dean Strang and Jerome Buting are my first call if I get framed for murder.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/3z100o/can_we_pause_to_applaud_two_of_the_best_lawyers/?limit=500&amp;depth=8)

The tributes were plentiful:

Three years later they are considered by some to be total garbage, so incompetent and ineffective that they very well could be part of the conspiracy to frame poor Stevie.

They were completely bamboozled by mastermind Kratz when he referred to the Dassey household computer as Barb's or Brendan's, and they were so gullible and ignorant that they based their entire trial strategy on a single sentence from Kratz that there was not much of evidentiary value on the computer.  

The two ignorant and stupid nincompoops probably would have believed Kratz if he told them directly that Avery was guilty.
