There is no such thing as black culture. There is no such thing as white culture. I agree that in America due to segration etc. Then different groups of people are treated differently, speak differently, have a different culture etc. I agree because it was part of my point in the first place.............. 

Those people can't be simply put under the umbrella of a colour because that is patently stupid and ignorant. That people do interchange race and culture isn't an excuse. There are people I know in America who say they are Spanish because it's easier than explaining that they only speak Spanish and Hispanic people don't all share the same culture. 

The guy is describing "Black English" which is something that clearly does not exist. He is describing a form of speech which is not unique to black English speakers. People who speak in this way do not all share the same culture, race etc. 

I fail to see where I contradict myself, I clearly didn't describe culture. 

I don't know what you think I don't see or notice, please enlighten me oh wise one. 

Thanks for listing things you can often notice from an accent. Ethnicity is not listed. I think it is becoming clear you don't understand what culture is.
