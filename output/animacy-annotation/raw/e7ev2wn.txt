Having uninformed political views does make one broadly stupid. If you aren't aware of what's happening politically, you aren't planning for the future. I'm tired of people getting a pass on being politically uninformed because it requires them to expend mental energy. These idiots got us into this mess because they were willfully unaware, and proud of their aggressive ignorance.
