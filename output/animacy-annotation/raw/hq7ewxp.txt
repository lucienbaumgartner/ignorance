yes shes entitled to her opinion but "her opinion" logically and it would make sense.
But we're fucking human. We need to think morally too or thats just gonna be ignorant and illogical. 
When someone is emotionally attached , in this case OP as the godmother to the child , you should think about what you say as it may affect the mental state of the person. 
yes , you have your opinion but stating this biased opinion right now would be not having the mental capacity or the maturity to think and see about your friends. If you want them to respect your opinion , you need to give respect on theirs too. That being said OP's emotional attachment and her opinion of not saying stuff like those is equally valid and weighed more in value because of moral reasons.
