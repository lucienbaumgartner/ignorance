1. Stupidity/overconfidence.

2. Poverty.  Can't get away if you have no means to do so or no money to survive with when you get there.  This was a major part of why Katrina had such bad effects on New Orleans.

3. Nowhere *to* go.  It's relatively easy to get to somewhere safe in the USA by driving your car or taking a bus.  Not so if you're on an island like Puerto Rico or the Caribbean nations.  This connects up with 2.

4. Forecast errors - "We thought the hurricane would hit *here*, but it actually hit *over there*" or "We thought it would be a pretty weak storm, but it suddenly became a lot stronger just before it hit".  Forecasting has gotten far better thanks to modern satellite imagining and computer modelling, but it still isn't anywhere near perfect and changes can catch people unaware and unprepared.

5. People mostly don't die *during* the hurricane, but afterwards while cleaning up and repairing.  Chainsaws (largely being used by people not experienced in their use), improper generator usage, and other work in generally unsafe conditions rack up the death toll.  Plus disruptions in availability of food, clean water, electricity, communications. medications, general medical care (conditions (e.g. heart attacks) that would ordinarily be survivable aren't due to shortages of resources), etc. adds to it.
