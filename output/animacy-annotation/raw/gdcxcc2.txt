This shit is always so strange to me. It’s not like millions of Jewish people raised their hand like “heck yeah, I’ll take a shower!” They knew you didn’t come back from them. They saw friends and family take showers and never return. You either got in the shower or they killed you anyway, and many hoped being gassed would be the less violent option. And still others were ready to die at that point as it would at least end the suffering. 

Viktor Frankel talks about this extensively in his book too. No one volunteered for a shower believing it was a shower. People are so beyond the capacity for historical thought and comprehension, let along empathy, that they can’t grasp the concept of forced murder. 

Literally thousands of insane people on Facebook acting like 6 million Jews were ignorant and unaware of what was happening. They didn’t fall for being herded onto trains. They didn’t fall for showers. They didn’t fall for any of it. They knew it was coming and tried their best to hide from it. And I wish I could yell at all of them and encourage them to learn their history, but they’d just argue that all of history is liberal bias. 

*silent scream of existential dread* End rant.
