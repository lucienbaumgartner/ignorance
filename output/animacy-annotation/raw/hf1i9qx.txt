Based on my own experiences and on reading, I'm gradually buying into the idea that men and women (in the subcultures that I occupy) tend to have somewhat different "languages" and conventions, specifically around unwritten boundaries for emotional openness.

When I'm around close male friends, I can express my emotional state and frustration at them in a way that feels safe because it's predictable. I have a sense of how deeply they'll pry in response to whatever I say. I know what level of irony to sigh with to signal that I'm venting, but that I'm not trying to start A Real Conversation about the topic. And I have some trust that if my friends pry too deep, they'll pick up on relevant signals and back off, possibly even before I pick up on those signals. I don't have the same trust with women generally, and I don't think that's "just stereotypes".

As it happens, I have that kind of relationship with my close women friends too. But based on what I'm reading, I get the sense that those friendships follow somewhat "masculine" conventions. (I don't know if those same friends follow more "feminine" conventions with their female friends.)

I do think these conventions result in different typical "emotional distances", and I do sometimes wish the default wasn't what it is. I could probably use more explicit emotional openness in my life, and it would be nice if it was already on the table without me having to swim upstream and convince my friends to swim upstream.

But I think the coarse idea that women are emotionally aware and close and men are emotionally unaware and distant doesn't tell the real story.

I think even in the stereotypical don't-talk-that-much-about-emotions friendship, men tend to be pretty emotionally aware of other men, and have pretty good models of each others emotions.
