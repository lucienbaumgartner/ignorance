And here we are, you’re just a socialist/commie then that makes sense as to why you don’t know what you’re talking about then. 

If all the shareholders dropped dead, there’d be no money in the companies to run or employ people, like I’ve already said above. Automation is already happening yes, but relatively slowly, force companies to pay more and it’ll speed up and good luck getting a job then mate. Who gets to decide what a “high quality of life” is? Many people on minimum wage already have a good quality of life so I don’t really see your argument? £20 is ridiculous for the reasons I gave above, perhaps read my comment. 

I haven’t asserted anything lmao, I’ve simply stated why your fantasy land idea is unrealistic and unnecessary. We don’t need a new economic system lol, people thrive under capitalism and starve in gulags under the alternative so take your BS elsewhere and quit acting like you understand economics or the consequences of financial decisions because you clearly are naive and unaware of simple facts. Have a good one mate.
