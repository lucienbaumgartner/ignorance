I knew way too many people who were all on the Bernie train but the truth of it is that they were young and ignorant of primaries. 

The short of it is that they just didn't vote. We are slowly and painfully making young American aware of the primary process, but not enough. 

If anything we are getting young people to show up more for midterms and this last election. I expect, though, it to decline midterms.
