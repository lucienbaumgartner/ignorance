Nothing disingenuous about it, stop projecting. “Pretend to be whatever you like online like” is just as useless as the survey suggestions you chastise, if not moreso.

You’re ignorant as heck if you think simply being online is magically constraint-free for disabled folk, that is empirically not the case.

I’m neither self-righteous nor rose-tinted (you’re projecting again, twerp!), I’m saying your suggestion was just what you’re trying to accuse me of. Self-righteous af, not to mention casually ableist, and ignorant of both the vast majority of OP’s post, and any actual useful suggestion for improving their situation.

Guess you can’t hear the reality for disabled folks over your $2.4k 💻 and LG 4K displays though 🙃

Talk about being hypocritical, disconnected from OP’s frame of reference, and arrogant-yet-clueless to boot 😂
