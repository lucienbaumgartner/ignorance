Unfortunately, as Chomsky identified in the 80s in Manufacturing Consent (the guy can be crazy, but you can't deny he's smart as fuck), the alternative to Government-regulated communication isn't free speech, it's corporation-controlled communication.

Obviously neither is great, but as we increasingly learn of Facebook's abuses, allowing highly targeted (and therefore effective) propaganda in the search for profit, we're going to need some level of gov't regulation to help protect the country in the [current disinformation war](https://globalnews.ca/news/4049792/canada-2019-election-russia-meddling-nato/).

At  only $7m, this sounds like a reasonable trial that's not going to change anyone's lives, but finding the right balance between the government protecting us from bad foreign actors vs. the government interfering in constitutionally protected free speech will be one of the most challenging issues we face as a country.

Needless to say, the Ruskis are going to be 200% against initiatives like this, from any government, left or right, as we're a far easier target in our current position of being largely unaware and defenseless.
