I was all in on Mephisto being the big bad with Agnes/Harkness being his henchman (and probably the only villain we’d see properly). 

But after episode 3 I don’t know. I’m thinking that Wanda could be the main antagonist or creator of this fake world with Agnes using her for some purpose while at the same time being afraid of her and trying to keep her happy and ignorant of what is really going on.
