I'm an 1w9 INFJ and my sister is a 4w5 INFP. She's way more messy then I am, she's also way more creative then I am. She has an internal value system she bases everything off of (Fi), while I trust my Fe and Ti to come to the right conclusion. She's way more willing to cry in front of other people, and be more open with her emotions while I lack opening up emotionally. She goes with the flow while I like to have a general plan but nothing super strict or anything. She can be seen as more selfish and unaware of the general atmosphere of a group while I maintain a peaceful and uninvolved status. I'm always trying to correct my morals and see if they are true, while she focuses on her individuality of her art. She cares more about family then anything, while I care about worldwide peace and harmony. We are pretty similar in general aspects but very different cognitively.
