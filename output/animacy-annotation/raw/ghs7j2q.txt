You seem to be very thorough in your research, asking clarification from many individuals, which is an admirable trait in a writer. I've tried to answer your questions below. Feel free to private message if you'd like.

**Stimming vs Repetitive Behaviours**

Stimming is a repetitive behaviour that is used to produce a certain sensation. Rocking (for vestibular input), hand flapping or walking on toes (for tactile input), vocalizations or tongue clicking (for auditory input), and looking at colourful or moving objects are commonly cited examples (although somewhat stereotypical).

Repetitive behaviours in general may not produce any unique or continuous stimulation, but feel just as necessary. This is like when we watch the same show or listen to the same song multiple times in a row, or repeat the same task many times. I get this with cleaning a lot (which lead to initial suspicions of OCD) for example where I will rinse a dish 7 times before putting it away. I also count repeatedly to 10 while completing tasks, say the same prayer repeatedly -- this is sacrilegious in my religion -- (usually sets of four now, used to be sets of forty nine), look at the corners of a room (usually sets of five), and have a very intricate pattern for how to walk on sidewalks "correctly".

**Biological and Sensory Differences**

Autistic individuals have /many/ biological differences, even though they cannot be diagnosed by any of them. We react differently to medication (pain medicine/sedatives are less effective on some of us and we are much more likely to experience side effects of any medication). One common difference seems to be an inverse reaction to stimulants or sedatives (stimulants calming a person or sedatives increasing their energy). We also very frequently have digestive or motor issues.

As for processing issues, auditory and tactile processing seem to pose the most difficulty for the largest population. Many complain that it is difficult to isolate sounds or ignore sounds, or to understand multiple speakers. Tactile issues are generally tactile sensitivities, where certain textures or soft-touch are very uncomfortable or even painful. I generally find that my muscles tense and I often shudder after touching certain things. This is where the complaint about clothes tags generally comes from.

I am tactile seeking, and have PTSD, so in my case I must /constantly/ have new tactile input in order to maintain any order to my thoughts or awareness of my surroundings. I usually manage this through constant tactile stims (even while sleeping). If I stop for more than a few seconds and don't have an external source of stimulation I start going numb and my breathing slows to a near stop. I also become unaware of sounds around me and visual processing issues get /much/ worse. Visual thoughts start racing (flashes of dozens of random images simultaneously) and I may be completely numb and unaware of everything for about 30 minutes. If this happens while I'm asleep, I wet the bed. -\_-\* Which is why I can only have sheets made from coarse materials.

**Diagnosis Methods**

As for the diagnosis, it is probably best not to mention /how/ the character knows they are autistic. It includes the self diagnosed community, without confronting the issue. Self diagnosis is valid for community involvement, but if the self-diagnosed has the "everyone's a little autistic" attitude it may erode the credibility of other self-diagnosed individuals.

P.S. I found these comics helpful when I was waiting for my diagnostic results.

There are other comics that were also helpful, but I won't include them by default since they were not strictly intending to portray autism, and instead portrayed traits common in autism.
