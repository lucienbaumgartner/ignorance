YTA. If you were not ready to play the role of mum in at least some small part you should not have married a man with two small children. That was incredibly naive and ignorant of you, honestly. 

If you wanted to keep your life separate from the children's you should have remained in separate homes as boyfriend and girlfriend until they were old enough to move out our old enough not to view your as "step-mum". 

Honestly, if you are not interested in children and do not want kids why did you even start dating a man with children?  

I day this both as a childfree person and someone who has discovered parents who remarried. 

You are being incredibly selfish to have inserted yourself into the lives of two young, vulnerable children and then went to keep them at arm's length.

Edit, spelling.
