It depends on how the electricity is traveled through your body. Sometime the electricity only travel through your hand, in which case you will get a nasty shock, maybe a burn, but it won't kill you. 

If the electricity travels through your whole body then it is much more dangerous because of your heart getting electrocuted. 

In short, anyone who touches circuits is dangerous, not just child, but adult as well. But because children and generally more unaware and vulnerable, it is probably more dangerous to them.
