Good for you.  The fact that your sister was courageous and courteous enough to even let them know is more than anyone(parents included) deserves. "Coming Out" is by NO means mandatory; its an unjustified, repressive, discriminatory and demeaning practise that never should have been considered a necessary requirement for those of us who do not identify ourselves as heterosexual. For your parents to receive this privileged information and then believe it gives them the right to ostracise, is ignorant and shameful- not to mention embarrassing.
