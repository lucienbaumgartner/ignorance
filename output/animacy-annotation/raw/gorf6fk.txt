If you read it literally knowing communism is anti-totalitarian and that propaganda comes in good and bad forms and communist propaganda is good. It then becomes a very accurate depiction of capitalist oppression and keeping colonies and it's people illiterate so they cannot liberate themselves.  Thus his grandfather was a fascist.

To read this the way the person in the image suggests requires one to be both indoctrinated and ignorant of history, effectively culturally and historically illiterate, fulfilling the irony of it trying to say the opposite of that. Except in the way he meant, his grandfather is also still a fascist... but fascism is good to him.
