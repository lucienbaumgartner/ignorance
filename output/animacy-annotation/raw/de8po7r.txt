I work with a guy that lost use of his right hand due to frostbite on a worksite; he's in tech support now. It happens because people are unaware and unprepared and coaxed by fairytale stories of a promise land. For anyone working in Alberta's oil and gas industry, these conditions are everyday, 14 hours a day, for more than half the year.
