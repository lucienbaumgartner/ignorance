I never said immune escape doesn’t happen with natural immunity, it’s just much harder. Then there’s possibly original antigenic sin going on. If the vaccine is the first Covid-like antigen you encounter, your future responses to similar antigens (vaccine or virus) are pre-programmed to mimick the first antibody response. Meaning you will keep your sub-par antibodies and will likely never produce robust immunity via natural infection.
While it‘s true that the vaccine buys some time, it just delays the inevitable. What we should be doing is early treatment and prophylaxis.
The vaccine neither significantly lowers viral load, nor does it shorten the infectious stage by very much. If anything it enhaces transmission bc vaccinated people are likely less -or asymptomatic and unaware that they are infectious.
Again, I never said I argued that there’s no immune escape with natural immunity. It‘s just much more robust.
It did mutate ro escape immunity, but not very successfully. Reinfection cases are unbelievably rare, as opposed to breakthrough infections.
