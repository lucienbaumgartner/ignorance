I'd love it if we could see more of your types of experiences and recoveries covered on the regular. 

We're so polarized as a species, it's sick. Anywhere you look in the news, there's another reason to divide ourselves further. But reading things like this really gives me a little bit of assurance about how we can evolve as humans, really evolve, and slowly but surely become more civilized and together. 

Because more than ever, the world needs to exercise unification. It's not a matter of something we want, but right now a matter of something that is necessary. 

I'm really glad to see you addressing issues in your life that can take an awful long time to retrain. Lately I've been checked into psychiatric care for a drug problem and what I've said jokingly (but also seriously!!) that I'll leave here less of a dickhead than when I came here. I will never quick to jump the gun on somebody because maybe they don't look or behave exactly like "all virtuous can do no wrong" me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Life can be insanely dangerous if we're not constantly and mindfully questioning ourselves and our environment. You can go down rabbit holes blinkered, ignorant and unaware of the fact that it was even a rabbit hole we went down in the first place. 

It's life man, and we have to look into ourselves before we go ahead and make statements on others. What you throw out to the universe, the universe will always throw back at you some day, for the better or for the worse. 

Take care bro. Wishing you well always. You've made a big change in your life and that should not be taken for granted :)
