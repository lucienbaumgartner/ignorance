Ok, but going behind eugenics itself, it is very true that ignorant and stupid people will tend to have more children. They don't consider the consequences, and will just proceed to go on and suck off the government teat, all the while decrying the minorities and illegals who are supposedly taking all the welfare. They will raise their children to be equally stupid and hateful, and the cycle continues.
