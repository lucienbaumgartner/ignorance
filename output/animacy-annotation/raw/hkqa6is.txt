&gt;Youâ€™re being an idiot, stop it man. Why do you think Stefanski is running so many empty sets? Because teams have a very, very clear game plan on how to beat us - sell out to stop the run and make Baker beat you.

Do you even watch the games? Stefanski runs empty sets, without fail, when we are playing from behind--which we do an awful lot because of our siege defense. It's his panic tic, and the whole world knows it. Teams know they don't have to sellout the run if they get a lead on us. To say he's running them against a stacked boxed to create mismatch, is so incomprehensibly wrong and ignorant of game flow.
