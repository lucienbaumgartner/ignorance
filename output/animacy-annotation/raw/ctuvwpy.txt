This happens to me more often then I want to admit to and has been the cause for a **lot** of anxiety. Especially when I was younger and unaware that these behaviours were hurting my relationships. 

The best way I've found to avoid speaking impulsively, especially face to face of over the phone is to try to get some extra time before I have to say something back if I know I'm in a potentially upsetting situation. Any conversation with my boss, I have to be super careful not to say something I'll regret. 

* delaying my response with a series of "Uhs", "Uhms" and stutters. Not the most "normal" way to speak but sometimes all I need are a few seconds to process and come up with a response, instead of saying whatever comes to my head on impulse.
* another good way to buy a few seconds is to ask someone to repeat something, "Can you repeat that for me?", or a "Wait what?" in less formal situations. You already know what they said, but again, it can buy you those precious seconds to control the impulse

When I do screw up and say something I shouldn't have, I swallow my pride and give a good heart felt apology. (Even if I wasn't actually wrong) Face to face is best for these I find. Acknowledge what you did wrong, validate that person's feelings, state how you felt, reiterate what you did wrong and actually say "I'm sorry."
 
*"I shouldn't have said what I did yesterday, it wasn't my intention to upset you. I was frustrated with the situation, not you, and I spoke without thinking. I'm sorry."*

Even if you're not sorry at all and weren't the one that was wrong, other people like being told that they're right and that you're the one that screwed up. Learning how to mildly manipulate people is a coping mechanism I've learned. It might not be morally correct but it sure as hell works.

Also, if you haven't seen [Russell Barkley's lecture]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDliT0GZpE) (this is a compilation of a few) on the different aspects of ADHD, I highly suggest you watch it. He does a very good job at explaining that ADHD is not laziness or stupidity, and these impulsive behaviours, along with other ADHD behaviours, are not your fault.
