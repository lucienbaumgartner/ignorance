This is the state of things. Too many people enthralled with their phone and the apps and tech that give them instant satisfaction. They expect for dating to provide a similar experience. On the one hand they could genuinely be expressing a lack of compatibility and are unable to elaborate on what/why for a number of reasons. On the other hand they could just be impatient and unaware of the fact that dating is a time consuming process and learning a potential partner takes more than just one date. 

I will agree with you that this is an exhausting response to get and I’ve gotten it a lot. I realized there’s no point in fighting it and you shouldn’t choose someone who isn’t choosing you. Even if they likely are making dating difficult for themselves and will end up settling on a partner who offers them immediate gratification at the cost of a healthy Long term partnership.
