{Kotoura-san} is my top pick for this. 12 episodes' worth of laughter and tears.

&gt; Anything in which the MC really changes over time

Oh yeah! [Here](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/k-s-haruka-comp-350-v2_7197.jpg) is a before and after image that sells this point *very nicely*. She is one of the most dynamic characters I've ever come across in fiction.

&gt; strongly prefer contemporary setting

This is one of my other favorite parts about this show. While psychic powers do exist in this world, they are so rare, its science is *completely unaware and unassuming* of their existence. This tidbit gets deconstructed to hell and back like [pretty much everything else in the show](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet).
