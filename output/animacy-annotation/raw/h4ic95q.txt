I found out I had autism at a rather late age: a few weeks ago, and I’m 33. 

However, I’m also a woman and autism in us has been historically tough to diagnose.  Which means, I lived 33 years untreated and unaware of what was going on with me. 

I don’t feel like OP too much, but I can sort of see where they come from.  Here are some of my pluses and minuses about living all my life entirely undiagnosed and untreated:


&gt;I always had that ardent feeling of never belonging anywhere.  Is like, everyone always told me it was either part of being a kid/teen/young adult, but I **JUST** knew I was way too different from everyone else (both boys and girls alike).  


&gt;I always had felt the innate need of being “against all norms” for some unexplained reason.  I didn’t try to do this on purpose: it just came natural to me. 


&gt;”Reading people”: I had to taught myself what was body language, micro-expressions, and the like.  Even to this day, I’m still studying people.  I hate how artificial that sounds. 


&gt;Stisms: That, I hate.  In my younger years, a lot of my stisms were mistaken by flirts…and it was bothersome as I began to read more about body language.  Then again, my stisms had costed me a lot of job opportunities…so I went on business by myself not too long ago. 


&gt;Special and particular interests: this is my **ONLY** favorite part of autism.  I have lots of particular interests.  


There’s much more, but I guess this is what stands out the most.
