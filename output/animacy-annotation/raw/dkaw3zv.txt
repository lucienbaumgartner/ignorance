100%. And I can tell it is doing the complete opposite of what the media intends. People in my office who were anti trump, prolly still are, are getting very sick of it. To the point when a computer freezes or malfunctions, they joke the Russians must have hacked it. 

It's a fucking joke. The media says the world is laughing at Trump. They are half right. The world is laughing. But they're laughing at our media, not Trump.  The media is as fake as Obama's Christian faith. They're as fake as Kim Kardashian's ass. They're so fake that they make fake tits look real. The media is an enemy of the people. 

Wake the fuck up liberals. The media does not care about you and do not have your best interests in mind. As soon as that camera turns off, the "journalists" are laughing all the way to the bank at how stupid, gullible, ignorant, and unintelligent you all are.  They control you thus making you useful idiots to help further an agenda that is AGAINST your own interest. The "unaware and compliant citizenry" that the Podesta emails refer to.  You all used to be anti-establishment and now we finally get a man into office who is risking his life to take on the establishment but you all flip flop and side with the establishment you once hated.  What gives? It couldn't be the media brainwashing you to hate a man who was once universally loved, could it?
