You’re pretty hopeful and ignorant of you think communism is ever far off. Europe doesn’t have socialism because it doesn’t control what happens to even them. They have to maintain western culture and id say the American right are keeping culture from devolving into worshipping socialism so far. I would bet my life that if America were to adopt communism, the world would follow. We are too large and influential for the world not to follow. The only reason this would not come to pass is if they started a world war. America+China+Russia against the rest of the world = easy victory for the communist party of the globe. And yes I know Russia isn’t communist but I have little doubt they’d want to join in and retry the “right” communism.
