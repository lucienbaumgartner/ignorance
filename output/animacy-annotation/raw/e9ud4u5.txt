~~Cactaceae supremacy~~

I don't know about others, but usually I point it out just to inform people with no ill-will intended. I know people who ask questions are most likely new to cactus in general and unaware that there's a difference. Same with any other non-cactus succulents really.

I am hesitant to give advice on Euphorbias though, since I'm not too familiar with them and whatever care differences (or lack thereof) they may have with cactus.
