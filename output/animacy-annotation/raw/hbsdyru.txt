The cause is urbanization.  Full stop. Interested in what your proposed solution to that cause would be.

You don't seem to comprehend the point people (myself and another poster) are making. The cause is irrelevant when it comes to taking ***immediate action. *** It of course matters in the long term, but in the short term peoples health and lives are at risk. A cull is the best solution to that immediate problem. Future plans to avoid this issue should absolutely include a cause and effect model, and nobody is arguing against that lmao. 

Also your thoughts on culls are a) incorrect, and in conflict with BCs wildlife biologists and conservation officers (I.e. the people who actually do this as a job and know what they're talking about)  and b) idealistic and ignorant of the reality in Stanley Park. The amount of coyotes in Stanley Park is approximately 2, max 3 packs. There is no behavioral corrections available at this point. They've fully acclimated to human food sources
