You're asking a f\*\*\*ing question that has multiple answers and expect a yes/no. 

If your email is a random gmail and you don't know the person you're emailing, of course he won't give a shit. But if you're Elon Musk and you decide to email the NewTech department's partner, obviously he'll respond. Do you see my point? You give ZERO. As in ZERO data for us to respond acoordingly. You say you have "something", but we have no clue who you are, who you want to contact and where you come from.

Are you a student with no work experience and have a good startup idea? He won't look twice. Are you an experienced industry professional, with 3-4 clients that you can bring with you? Ok, he probably would listen. But why would you talk to him then and not your own partner/boss or go freelance?

There's so many questions that influence the answer we will give you, but you're so freakingly stubborn and ignorant that you can't see the forrest because of all the trees.
