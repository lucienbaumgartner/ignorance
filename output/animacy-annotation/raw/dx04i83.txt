I mean uh... if anything asks for a gift card, 99% it's a scam, and people really need to just be pointing that out to the unaware and gullible so it's common sense knowledge. 

To me, it's funny that they think posing as a government official and then asking them to put a shit ton of money on an itunes gift card would ever work, because why would that ever be the case. ever.
