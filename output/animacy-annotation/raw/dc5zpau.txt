One thing I don't like about the elder dragons is that they speak and are intentionally malevolent.  When GW2 first came out the elder dragons were described more as forces of nature just doing what they do, like a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake, and without any reference to or notice of the puny mortal races that are just collateral damage.  They consume the accumulated magic in the world, then go into hibernation for thousands of years and the magic seeps back out of them, then they wake up and consume it all again.  That's the cycle of the world.

I like that.  A deadly, omnipotent, but ultimately unaware and indifferent force of nature is something different than the standard MMO fair of the old cliche of some calculating malevolent entity seeking more power and killing everything in its path to get it.  

Zhaitan walked a line between pure force of nature and self-aware entity.  Zhaitan never spoke to the player, though one of his two primary lieutenants could, the [Mouth of Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mouth_of_Zhaitan).  His other lieutenant, the [Eye of Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eye_of_Zhaitan) could not.  It was also said that Zhaitan absorbed the knowledge and experiences of every living being he consumed, so there was some subsumed understanding of the plight of the mortal races he decimated, but it still felt like an indifferent force of nature overall.

Mordremoth of course was conscious, self-aware, scheming, and talked directly to us (especially if you're a Sylvari) and even taunted us.  That's where this got annoying.  There was no way you could mistake Mordremoth for being an indifferent force of nature, he was intentionally battling and trying to destroy all mortal races.

So I wonder how ANet will handle Jormag and Primordius now.  Cliched video game big bads, or something different and interesting?
