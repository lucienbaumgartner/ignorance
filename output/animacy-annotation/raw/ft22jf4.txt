People who offer madya (wine) as an offering to Shiva and Kaali: Toh mai kya job chorr du?

Mamsa (Meat), Matsya (Fish), Madya (Wine), Maithuna (Sex) and Mudra (Grains or hand gestures depending on context), have been a part of Tantric, Vamacharya, Shaivite, Buddhist and Shaktist worship since the ancient days, I get it some traditions encourage abstinence from these things but that is more or less left to the individual's own discretion, why this priest thinks he has a monopoly over the beliefs and practices of  faiths which proclaims itself to be all inclusive, there needs to be an education requirement for becoming a priest and politician in this country. As for this guy, a person who by his behaviour and karma (actions), livesa life of tamas (ignorant darkness) has no business administering a place of sattva (wisdom and purity).

I don't get it from what depth of their anal cavities these contemporary priests and clerics pull out the "50 shades of being a prude" from these days, I mean I get it they are either too ignorant or are playing their own political games but how do they find the justification for all this? Then again, given how blatantly self unaware and blind believers so many devotees are these days I doubt they need much justification, they could literally burn the sacred scriptures of their respective religion and the devotees will still praise them.
