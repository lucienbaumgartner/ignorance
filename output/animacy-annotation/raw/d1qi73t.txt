He was beyond shocking last night. He'll bust a gut for 95 minutes, to be fair to him, but he's injured for 70% of the season, and is technically so poor and unaware and it's shocking that he's still with us at United. He's like the Hendersons and the Milners of the world; *"honest, hard-working, has a great engine, not a mean bone in his body, humble, passionate, knows what it means to be a footballer."*

I'd sell him this season if we can recoup the money spent on him.
