*RIGHT?* This is some grade-A bullshit. When I was a kid, measles was a thing of the past and was being eradicated worldwide. Anti-vaxxers shouldn’t exist and yet here we are, dying of diseases our ancestors did because the *luxuries* they died for have made the general population so secure and ignorant that they feel they are of superior intelligence to **doctors and scientists**. And that they, the (un)silent minority, they alone are the chosen people who have this secret knowledge, and those who have actually done research and experiments to prove vaccines’ efficacy lack this secret knowledge, which is why they lie to everyone and peddle this poison on us. Never mind that their 1 month old died from rubella and their 2 year old has whooping cough. And how *dare* that 2 year old’s school send her home, just because she has a highly contagious but preventable (by, say it with me, #preventable by vaccines. Good.) disease, that her innocent classmates could catch and *die from*. That level of complete delusion is only matched by a deranged rotted tangerine, who, by the way, has done *nothing* to address this pandemic of complete idiots who are endangering the safety of the nation. It’s just lunacy. Total lunacy.
