&gt; Does it occur to you that I would argue the same way even if there were more evidence? 

It occurs to me that you would argue the same way even if there were no evidence at all, because your belief in magical talking snakes and people walking on water (also swiped from earlier religions), and bringing dead people back to life, demands it, lol

&gt;There is no argument better than scholarly consensus

OMG, and you actually believe that!  That's priceless!  So young and ignorant of evidence and how it works.  That's cute. No really, it's cute!
