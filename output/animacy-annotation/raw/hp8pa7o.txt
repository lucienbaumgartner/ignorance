What is "draconian" about saving lives? Why should willfully ignorant and selfish people who don't respect epidemiology be given leeway or a platform to spout their nonsense? If the house is on fire and someone is running around with kerosene, you don't interview them or ask their opinion, you knock them the fuck out to stop the damage.
