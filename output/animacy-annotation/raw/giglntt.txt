You should read the article(s) again. She didn't accuse him of sexual assault, and saying it was just a "shit date" is disingenuous imo.

I say this as someone who before reading this thread thought it was just a bad date, and then took the time to review the original article and various opinions on it.

There are lots of instances that could be misconstrued as genuine consent, but you'd have to be pretty ignorant to think that (like I assume Aziz was in that moment).  For instance, after she says she needs a break and goes to the bathroom, she comes out and says, "I don't want to feel forced because then I'll hate you, and I don't want to hate you." Then Aziz affirms the sentiment that if she's not ok with it, it's not ok, and they should just chill on the couch.  Then when they're on the couch, he motioned  towards his penis indicating to her to go down on him (which she then reluctantly did).  While this isn't exactly wrong, it shows how sleazy and ignorant of the situation he was. If she just expressed discomfort and feelings of pressure, then you should be extra careful to make sure she doesn't feel that anymore. Clearly he made no attempts of doing that.

A bad date would be if the guy is shit at kissing, is not interesting, and/or doesn't know how to make conversation.  This is clearly worse than that.

There were other instances in the incident that appear to have lacked affirmative consent, which makes it even worse.  For example, he would repeatedly stick two fingers in her mouth and she would repeatedly try to get away but he would keep on following and do it.

Anyway, my point is don't make hyperbolic accusations when you clearly don't know or remember the situation.
