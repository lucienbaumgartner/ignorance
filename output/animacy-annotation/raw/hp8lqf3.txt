&gt;even with your equation

That is an inane thing to say. 

First of all, OP can’t make $15 per hour. You also don’t seem to realize that 20% of your income is lost to taxes.

Your argument that OP is fine because they can share a 1 bed room studio apartment is so disgusting I can hardly stomach reading your words. 

Kid, a 1 bedroom apartment is *not* that much cheap of a COL than a 2 bedroom. Your “equation” to use your incorrect, uneducated term, is wrong. You know nothing about living expenses, nothing about taxes, and nothing about math.

My breakdown included splitting the rent. Both parties need medical, both parties need phone, both need transportation and insurance. The grocery bill would probably be about 1.75 * the one I listed for the two. Electricity would probably be the same.

With all that in mind, with a *reasonable* outcome, they have $200 to spare per month both working fucking 60 hours a week. 

Dude I didn’t even include entertainment, restaurants, dates, emergency, retirement, holidays, family, general happiness and health, **water**, or the general MISC expenses that tend to add up to ~250 minimum alone. 

You are obviously closed minded and unaware of financial reality. 

Taking $15 an hour and just fucking multiplying it by 80 and subtracting rent and food is complete brainlet math.
