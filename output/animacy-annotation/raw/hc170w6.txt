If you never ask youâ€™ll never know! Itâ€™s important to realise you donâ€™t lose out anything if she were to say no, but donâ€™t think of that right now. Itâ€™s always best to say whatâ€™s on your mind, as waiting too long may mean you miss your chance. Give it a shot, tell her how you feel, youâ€™ll know if sheâ€™s worth it by the way she responds to you! If sheâ€™s rude and ignorant of your feelings you know. If she feels the same way, youâ€™ll know. Good luck ðŸ’«
