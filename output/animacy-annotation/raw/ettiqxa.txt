why did you ignore literally everything else I said. Are you that autistic that you will pick a side and stick to your guns to the very end? At what point do you say, "oh, whops, I guess that chest is pretty important as it contains one of the only multi tools in the game.", or "ops, you're right, i guess I learned something new," or "I guess most people did miss that." 

You know, I keep having to pick up my jaw off the floor by the ridiculous crazy things that you keep typing. You're so audacious and ignorant that my brain stops working when I try to imagine what it would be like to be you. The things you say are so entitled, and factually incorrect that I don't know how you get along with other people, but that's just it. You don't get along with other people. You will shit talk me to old age and then some. Constructive criticism, is not harassment. It's when you calmly, logically, point out issues and flaws, and make suggestions or explanations with no personal motive. When you talk shit, and nitpick, and go all in to win an argument, those are traits you see in non constructive criticism, in harassing. When you annoy, argue, and insult a person just because you don't like them, and it's your personal motive that you don't like that person. Just because I call you an autistic doesn't mean other people are. You're the only one still talking shit on a weeks day old thread, with everything you are saying being toxic, with with negative intentions. I honestly can't believe some of the things you are ignorant and close minded enough to believe. Like the youtube lets play industry. That youtube viewers who watch 7daystodie videos are all skillless incapable people who can't play the game, and the youtube video makers who make the lets plays are only just enabling the useless incompetent audience. Way to drag the entire youtube community through the mud. This is literally the dumbest thing you said today. That's so incredibly ignorant to not know that youtube is more popular than tv and that youtube makes or breaks games. Youtube communities will directly result in a game being aborted or developed early in its life. Youtube being the best way to advertise enables the game to grow or to be abandoned later on. I can't believe how little of the world around you understand. You're talking shit to the hand that feeds you. If it wasnt for youtube 7daystodie would have never existed. there have been survival and zombie survival games on youtube for a decade. Way to insult literally the thing that enabled and continues enabling the game that you like. You're like a dog that poops on its own dinner plate. And the very first thing you said is a lie too, you're still harassing me by antagonizing me. 

&gt;You can't even play the game yourself

did a 5 hour crawl on a level 1 account being limited to 27 stamina with almost no food or water with only 1 death to get taza's stoneaxe .

&gt;You can't even play the game yourself
&gt;You can't even play the game yourself
&gt;You can't even play the game yourself

I don't know if you didn't read or didn't think. Why am i still wasting time  on this ignorant toxic hater idk. Maybe i'm a little autistic too seeking hope in people that isn't there.
