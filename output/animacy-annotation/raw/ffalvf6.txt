I don’t blame you, I guess I blame your upbringing. 

I don’t know how you where raised, but I’m sorry that you’ll never be able to comprehend what actual abuse is. Your arguments are so tone deaf and ignorant that I’m at a loss of where to begin.

If you wish to actually learn this subject; then you need more life experience. Get off the internet and expand your friend group. Only then you will potentially understand.

I don’t say this with malice; but genuine sympathy.
