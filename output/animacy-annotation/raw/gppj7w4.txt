Some former SV abilities (not all) exist in massively altered forms without any of the interactions with the rest of the toolkit that made ranged SV what it was. The playstyle and identity of ranged SV is absolutely gone and not replicable in MM. Those things, by the way, were in fact unique and distinguished from MM in theme and mechanics. SV was a different approach to ranged weapon combat; instead of sniping and sharpshooting prowess, it used exotic munitions with better utility.

To put it in terms you, a Rogue, would understand: imagine if we just declared that Subtlety and Assassination weren't distinguishable mechanically or thematically because they were both just dual-wielding skirmishers with stealth. You would correctly understand that this was reductionist and ignorant of the additional mechanics on top of that baseline that made them distinct specs. Hopefully this example helps you appreciate what it feels like to have someone try to make authoritative statements against your class when they clearly know nothing about it.
