Wrong. There are MANY people who want to fight for her, similar to our desire to fight for Trump. The difference is they are not seekers of truth, as we are, they are pods in a socially engineered matrix designed to keep them 'compliant and unaware', and clearly it is working as intended. Don't underestimate the power of psychological manipulation. If you check my history, I have friends who are Ph.D. candidates who have literally said to me they would 'take corruption over hate and destruction' any day. These are incredibly intelligent people, which further reiterates how powerful a tool psychological manipulation can be. If a fucking Ph.D. student *of* Psychology can be manipulated into actually voting for a corrupt cunt like Clinton, you know that shit is powerful as hell.
