That's really interesting because I had a different reaction to and interpretation of the story. My sympathy was actually with Vincent as I saw his behaviour as normal or excusable for his age and situation. I actually viewed the teacher as the villain by the end for not understanding Vincent and ruining his chances of fitting in with her well-meaning ignorance. The story therefore seemed to be about to those people who think they are never wrong just because they are nice and unaware that through ignorance you can cause just as much hurt. It hadn't even occurred to me there's an alternate way to read it. I think I just learned something about myself.
