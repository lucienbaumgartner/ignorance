See, this is where you’ve lost me.


Saying “No federal taxes” is very stupid. How do representatives get paid? How does the Supreme Court get paid? Who pays for inter state infrastructure? The military?


Honestly... It’s like telling someone you don’t like the look of your house, and their solution is- demolish it.


You might think it’s saving you money, but it’s so short sighted, unimaginative, and ignorant of all the negatives it would produce.


How old are you? Because if you’re under 25- that’s an excuse for your “solution.”


But if you’re over 25, then quit wasting everyone’s time. You don’t know how to run a country, none of us do, but your idea is dangerous, stupid, and next to last on the list of good ideas, right next to anarchy.


Literally, I’m only spending the time to tell you this because I’m taking a rank ass shit and have to end this conversation before the last turd can come out in peace.
