You said:

&gt;Blaming everyone else for your problems in a tremendously unaware and hypocritical fashion isn't being honest about emotions at all. It's the complete opposite. It's someone who is incapable of coming to terms with their insecurities so has instead created a fantasy world where all of his own problems are actually everyone else's fault. (Or more specifically, roughly 50% of everyone else.)

I described that as "nice guy thinking"

Now you are saying that "nice guy thinking = self-realization" which is the exact opposite of what I said.  

"recognizing that complaints about the outer world often stem from one's own internal insecurities, taking an honest look at those emotions, and growing from them" is what TRP advocates.

&gt;And it doesn't take a genius for a sub to deny its biggest criticisms in its introduction. Despite that introduction, blaming feminism seems quite common. In fact, control-f just this comments page.

TRP describes "The Five Stages of Red Pill"

- Denial: "Women aren't like that! They're people just like everyone else! Treat them all as individuals, and you're sure to find the right one!"

- Anger: "WTF! Bitches are all like this! They have no honour, no loyalty, and they don't really love anyone but themselves! Fucking cunts!"

- Bargaining: "If I work real hard and learn all the pickup moves, then at least I'll get laid."

- Depression: "Getting laid by shallow, obnoxious women has become dull and unrewarding. And there's no sense looking for a unicorn. Maybe I'll just be MGTOW for a while."

- Acceptance: "Women aren't bad. My expectations of them, and theirs of me, were based on faulty premises. They are creatures of instinct, just like I am... but of different instincts. If I learn what those instincts are, and teach them about mine, we can develop realistic expectations of each other and get along just fine."

By simply cherry-picking comments from people still stuck in the "Anger" phase, you are misrepresenting TRP.  I would argue that TRP is a transient stage, and most of those who finally "get it" no longer frequent the sub.
