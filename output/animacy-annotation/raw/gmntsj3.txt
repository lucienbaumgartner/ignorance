Yawn, your virtue signaling is boring.

The Jews and the Palestinians were living together without problems when Egypt and the other Arab Nations decided they were going to kick the Jews out. They told the Palestinians to leave, the Palestinians like a big bunch of f****** idiots trusted the f****** Egyptians and f****** Arabs and left. Well they lost the war and then the Egyptians and the other Arabs decided to make the Palestinians their political pawns and keep them forever in concentration camps instead of integrating them into their societies.

You are disgusting and ignorant of History.
