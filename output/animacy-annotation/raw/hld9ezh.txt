Either your husband was pressured and coerced into marriage, when he wasn't ready for it, or he has an underlying mental health condition. 

He could be depressed, withdrawn, have an avoidant attachment style, or he could just be emotionally underdeveloped, and ignorant of the emotional aspects of marriage. 

One thing that I say to everyone is to stop obsessing about height/weight/horoscope and make emotional skills a deal-breaker. Marriage is a very complex, very challenging and unpredictable endeavour, and you and your partner have to develop healthy coping skills and emotional self-awareness. 

This is easier said than done. Indians are preoccupied with the external environment, and rarely go inward. Very few possess the ability to introspect, reflect, self-soothe and communicate. 

Marriage counselling is your best bet, but your husband needs to enthusiastically participate.
