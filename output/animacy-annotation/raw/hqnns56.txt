God's and higher powers are a HUGE escalation for explaining things that humans don't know or understand.

And for the past 200,000 years if humans encountered *anything* they didn't understand well right away, they immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was the unknowable workings of some deity or other. But the truth was the humans just didn't have the tools to view the phenomenon they were experiencing *correctly.*

As soon as we invent a technology that allows us to see the phenomena more accurately, somehow the almighty will of the god that once controlled it can be subverted and manipulated at our pleasure.

How many other phenomena do we not yet understand simply because we haven't invented the technology to get a good look at what's going on? How much do we not yet know? 

Is it not premature -no matter how good our technology is, and no matter how much we think we know- to just assume the universe, existence, and consciousness have anything to do with some mysterious higher power?

Don't we have a LOT of work to do to understand what we can about such things before we start assuming (without direct evidence of such activity) that there is some higher power responsible for ALL the phenomena -both that which we are aware and unaware of?

Is it not a mistake to assume that there is such a small gap between the end of what humans now understand, and the unfathomable, infinite, eternal workings of and potential gods or higher powers?

If it were so, then at some point I wouldn't be surprised if we were to launch some new equivalent to the JWST, take a picture and accidentally catch god sitting on his heavenly pooper taking a dump with a rather surprised look on his face.
