It's been working great so far!  

So yes, the vaccinated are *less* likely to catch COVID than the unvaccinated, but not by all that much, they're just as contagious as the unvaxxed and far more likely to be asymptomatic and unaware that they even have it, and the vaccine is only effective for 4-6 months tops. Also testing takes about 3 days for results, so we're dropping that for people who travel to USA for less than 72 hours, and of course for truck drivers and the like, and we've never bothered testing the rich and business travelers.  


Sure, Canada is safe, stay the course people!
