I am inclined to agree, get away from your family ASAP.

We do not get to choose who our parents are, where we are born, our genetic code etc. Our lives are essentially lotteries, we exist entirely by luck.

Though, we do have a choice once we reach a certain age to take advantage of our own freedom. Unfortunately some people have horrible parents who either don't care enough, or are incredibly uneducated and ignorant. That is dangerous, and it will hold you back in life.
