People are constantly illogical, irrational, hypocritical, unaware and uncritical of themselves, etc.

The way you present this question begs the questions "is this a phenomenon that occurs at a scale worth addressing?" (you claim it does, but your evidence is bupkis) and "does this occur at a rate different from other similar inconsistencies?" Not to mention you presented it in a redpill-y, gender-essentialist way ("why do women", "many", "overwhelming majority").
