Many people believe in magic.  Does their belief make it is real?  No.  Many people, when they are driving, refer to their vehicles as themselves - that guy nearly hit me!  Does that make your car suddenly an extra limb when you get behind the wheel?  No.  Then why should some people verbally anthropomorphizing an undeveloped, unaware, and barely differentiated bit of growing flesh suddenly change it into a child?
