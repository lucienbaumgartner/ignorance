I don’t think it is in any way possible. 

Quests used to be 90 Rides in a 7 Day Week. Monday 4:00AM start to following Monday 3:59AM. Next Week’s Quest Begins. 

The Quests now are not possible except on the lower end of the required trips. 

IT’S MISLEADING — The WAY Uber explains the Quest. 

They SAY Quests are FOUR Days. 

Literally. If you look at the promos it’s Day 1, 2, 3, 4.  

In REALITY it’s EXACTLY 72 Hours. 

Friday at 4:00 AM —&gt; Monday at 3:59 AM

That is THREE Days. 

They visualize it that way, and use early AM reset times so the Quest spans across 4 CALENDAR DAYS. 

But it’s exactly 3 Days— in terms of “Planet Earth’s” 24 Day Cycle. 

Remember. 95% of Uber drivers are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Immigrants. Barely speak English. Totally clueless and unaware of how they are literally working for less than minimum wage. 

You could never do 70 Rides in 72 Hours. Unless you live in a very small town with high demand. No other cities nearby. No long trips. All short pickups. All short trips. Then... Maybe. But likely they’d just stop giving you pings as you get close to the cutoff time / reaching goal.
