Yep, OP waved her red flag and her date sensibly bailed. YTA OP.

Either socially inept and ignorant of others' feeling even when they make them clear, or up for flirting with 3rds while on a first date and not having discussed being poly, or so needy for alcohol that you'll degrade your date for a free shot. Yikes.
