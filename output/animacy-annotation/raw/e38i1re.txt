I currently think that becoming a monk will assign a zero value to my contribution to the society. It’s better than being an unaware and destructive entity, i.e. having a negative value, but it’s worse than being a positive value, i.e. helping people and building stuff that carries the world further. Maybe the definition of a monk is different in my head than in others.
