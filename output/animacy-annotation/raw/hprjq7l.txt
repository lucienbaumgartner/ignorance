I replied because it's good to spread knowledge and truth, even if people disagree. Like I said I support abortion 100%, it is important to have the option because we don't live in a perfect world. I think its harmful that people would ban abortion because then women have to resort to unsafe options.  Not only that but it is ignorant and irresponsible to to bring an unwanted child into an already overpopulated earth. Then there's also the autonomy of the mother. 

All that being said, it doesn't change the fact that the "clump of cells" or "embryo" is literally a growing baby. If left alone to grow, it would be a baby. There were times we didn't consider disabled people human,  simply because they weren't fully developed. I don't say it is a baby because I want abortion banned and I'm "pro life" I say it because I think it's important not to delude ourselves to reality so we can speed up the healing process. But again, everyone is free to subscribe to their own beliefs if they want to.
