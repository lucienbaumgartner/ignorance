I went through every sleep test and brain scan etc. Because I had vivid nightmares, sleep walking, waking up confused and unaware of who/what/where I was, night terrors and on and on. THEN! I went on anxiety meds and miraculously, these pretty much went away. I still have an occasional episode or mild nightmare but nothing like before. It wasnâ€™t sleep related really, it was my waking life anxiety coming out at night when my guard was down.
