NOBODY NEEDS IT. Who the fuck is both illiterate AND UNAWARE of just pressing any button on a game that requires manual dexterity. 

it is FUCKING STUPID and you know it. 

NOT A SINGLE PERSON NEEDS A VOICE TO SAY PRESS ANY BUTTON. 

Its just ubisoft trying to sell games with the "we help disabilities" buzz word
