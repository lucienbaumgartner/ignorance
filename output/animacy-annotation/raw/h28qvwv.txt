Back in the day of early release people would do this to change their starting weapon but now that there is mods? 

hmm either they're ignorant and unaware that mods are available to use (met a few people who don't know how to create them even though its been in the game for like a month+) or they're being lazy and wanna respawn with more points/higher tier weapon which I saw a couple people do on cranked before it was removed after season 4 launch.
