Again, you're foolishly trying to apply commercial computer security concepts to a military security application that is way beyond your expertise. Using your logic I could say you're a moron because you haven't configured your systems to require two admins to enter separate admin passwords simultaneously to allow any single admin to log into your system. See how stupid and ignorant that sounds? You have no idea what you're talking about and neither does John Oliver, so just stop embarrassing yourself. Judging by your poor grammar and your misspelling of Oliver's simple name I'm guessing you've been drinking and you're taking what was supposed to be a simple comedic jab by Oliver way too seriously, and now you've apparently wrapped up your ego in his ill-founded criticism of the military.
