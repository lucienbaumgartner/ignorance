He definitely never said she was demure because she was Asian I don’t know where you got that from. 

On their podcast he has said that he liked her because she was demure a few times, and I did raise my eyebrow at first, but when pushed on it by Sharleen he explained he was using the word in an old fashioned way to mean humble and unaware of how beautiful/special she was, and they both agreed it wasn’t the best word choice for that. He explicitly clarified he wasn’t talking at all about modesty or any of those connotations 

There are examples of problematic men she’s friends with we could talk about (nick cough cough) but this specific example I don’t think is fair
