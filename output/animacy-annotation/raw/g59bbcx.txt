It's a 5 second scene in an hour and a half film, everyone has jumped on the hate bandwagon before watching it. The entire point is how young girls are forced to grow up to fast and unaware of what is inappropriate and objectifying them, and what childhood is like for girls now.

People are sharing the dance scenes but that probably makes ten minutes of the film, it's fine to not enjoy it but at least watch it or try to and have a more backed up opinion.
