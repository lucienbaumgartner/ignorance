only a sociopath would throw accusations like that around willy nilly and be completely insensitive and unaware that they may hurt other people or cause them to question their very nature.  Especially if he doesn't have any psych training!!  

Also, "provoke" is just one of many ways narcissists and sociopaths have to blame their issues on you!!  No matter what anyone does, everyone has their own choice of how to respond to whatever it is.  This is point of Viktor Frankel's book "Mans Search for Meaning," where he realized that even as a prisoner in a Nazi death camp, he still had a choice of how to respond to the situation.  Classic book!
