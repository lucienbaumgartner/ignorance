I agree that you absolutely shouldn’t resort to physical violence just because someone says something inflammatory and ignorant that you don’t like. 

But by the same token if you’re stupid enough to be this inflammatory and ignorant in a public space, you’re at least partially responsible for whatever happens to you. 

Saying “you don’t get to ___” doesn’t automatically cancel out thousands of years of human nature.
