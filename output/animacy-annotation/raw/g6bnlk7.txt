&gt;mainly because it had no horror

Yes, because a corpse with no face, has visible functioning organs, and has an entity messing with those around him wouldn’t count as horror. It’s also weird to dislike the story because it doesn’t have much horror because the story is more than just horror- it’s an integral part of an overarching story. 

&gt;it was just plain boring to read. 

I won’t deny that the murder attempts were a tad repetitive but even then they weren’t executed badly. I like the conflict of the nurses and staff trying to keep the man from leaving whereas Arthur is persistent and unaware of the truth.

&gt;I was really hoping we could get more clarification on how the man burned or why the spirit was inside him, but nope, no explanation. 

He got burned pretty badly (The fact he got terribly burned should let you get an idea of what answers you’d be getting)  and the epilogue for Step Closer explained why Andrew connected to him
