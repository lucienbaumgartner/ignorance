You stated that "judging historical figures by modern standards" is a common argument, and you asked for our opinions on that argument. You cannot support or oppose an argument unless you understand it. My post serves to help understand why this common, typical argument exists in the first place.

Most people who vocalize the crimes of historical figures and contribute nothing more, are just feeding their own ego. As you said, it's common. It's lazy. It's not something a learned person would practice. No, it's not a good argument. It's cheap, and easy. "Slavery bad so slave owner bad." Not wrong, but it's just patting yourself on the back, no? Similarly, ignoring a person's failings and saying they're the greatest thing since sliced bread is equally shallow, and ignorant of reality. No human being is perfect, no historical figure is without fault.

The most important thing about history is its ability to show us the capacity of human beings to do great things, both terrible and wonderful, and how this sets the course of the future.
