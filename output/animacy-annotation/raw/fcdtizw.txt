&gt; A universal healthcare scheme in the United States would ultimately lead to the majority paying for the minority, who, in the US, tend to be in the worst health. This would not be a very good think for social cohesion, to say the least.

Its also going to get really stressful when (assuming it happens in 2020) that we ramped up to socialized expensive universal healthcare just before the baby boomers our biggest generation hits their geriatric period of their lives and our healthcare costs are going to go through the roof.

&gt;
And because increasing taxes on the wealthy is also unlikely due to the nature of politics in the US, universal healthcare would ultimately end up burdening the lower-upper through lower-middle classes and increasing the debt to even more catastrophic levels.

The belief that we are going to pay for such an expensive system through taxes on the wealthy is hilariously and pathetically not feasible.  I'm all for a progressive tax system where the wealthy pay the most amount of tax (they do already), and where capital gains is equal to income (should already be this way), but wealth taxes, jamming taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals to the sky, is going to implode the countries economy.

&gt;
The entire system is rotten. There are reasons the US doesn't have something that every other developed nation has beyond just political differences. The US is not wealthy, not in any way that matters. It's like an old aristocratic family, skating by on the family name, cash poor and unaware that the foundation of their mansion is about to break and they won't have the money or credit to avoid becoming homeless.

This is a whole lot of horseshit when its the worlds biggest and strongest economy, its red fucking hot, people are working hard as fuck and banking money, and this is nothing more then fearmongering and sour grapes.
