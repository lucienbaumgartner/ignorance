No woman in her right mind would reject a guy simply for being nice. There's always more to it when women say "you're too nice". Usually the guy has low self-esteem which manifests itself in unattractive behavior, e.g. self-depreciating comments, putting her on a pedestal instead of treating her like she's on the same level of respect. Most women like confidence and leadership (the good kind). 

One thing you see in children is that when they're not competent they often try to compensate in other ways, by being extra nice and helpful. They form their identity based on the notion "I am a nice person". Nothing wrong with that, but if it stems from feeling inadequate it can be an issue. Honestly, adults are just children in bigger bodies. 

It doesn't have to be a self-esteem issue. Sometimes the guy is just very socially unaware and awkward. Or maybe he's kinda stupid (only book smart) and she wants to rely on someone that won't make stupid decisions all the time. Maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, it's most likely not his kindness. She probably just doesn't want to hurt his feelings or maybe she can't pinpoint what it is exactly that she find unattractive, and his kindness is very overt so that's what she says.
