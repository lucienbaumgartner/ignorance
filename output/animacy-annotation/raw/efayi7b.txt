Had my cartilage pierced with a gun when I was young and unaware that I shouldn't do that. It left a weird bump and took years to heal, and was pretty painful sometimes. I heard that guns are more blunt and can actually cause damage and be traumatic to the area, particularly if you're getting a cartilage piercing.  Never again.
