I think both of them are ignorant and uneducated. Carly I think was very spoiled, she mentioned she was an only child. I think McCall's Mom was a single Mom with too many kids to take care of and I think McCall was just left to fend for her self and since she was never the sharpest person she is not smart enough to figure stuff out. And she has no self awareness to know how much she does not know.
