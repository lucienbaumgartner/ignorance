By that logic, suicide cults are also ok because nobody forces you to.

Not every person is in the same position. Some people have power, and some people are vulnerable. Vince pushed steroids on a group of person that were mostly badly educated, young and ignorant of the real dangers of the drug. He pushed a dynamic of peer pressure in said group and arguably threatened them if they didn't comply (by not pushing them).

Trying to paint it as an act between two consenting adults in an equal position is just wrong.
