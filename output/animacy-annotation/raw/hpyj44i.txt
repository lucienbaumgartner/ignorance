&gt;Toxic is insulting people, attacking their lifestyle, calling them discriminatory names or labels. Toxic is not disagreeing with someoneâ€™s opinion or negatively critiquing a season.

Do you not see the inconsistency in this statement? Are you defending the people who harass Torian, an amazing animator who was dealt a losing hand? The dude who made sure that at least the fight scenes were good in Red vs Blue Zero, thus the only decent thing about the current state of RvB? The dude who hasn't been a part of Rooster Teeth since Red vs Blue Zero?

Sure, don't group the whole fanbase under the "toxic umbrella", you are correct on that much, but insisting that the term "toxic" doesn't apply to the people who committed the actions OP listed is ignorant and blatantly wrong.
