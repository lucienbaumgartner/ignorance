'the hell' - the expat US citizen. The 'US is so wonderful, I'm only working in this country because....' brigade who tend to be myopic, ignorant and bigoted. Especially the ones who fail to realize that the rest of the world is not like the us.

The US is special, all good things were developed by the US, everything is historically black and white whilst knowing less about their own history than an ant knows about the moon landing.

Maybe the US expats (even the well educated ones) are not representative of the average US person; but it is those expats who are 'the hell'. They aren't stupid, just ill educated and culturally naive. 

They are the ones who have never heard of operation paperclip, who believe Hollywood equates to reality. They are the ones who just don't get it, that the US is not exceptional.

As for the cold war that would have predominantly been addressed by people now referred to as 'boomers' by current US people. Which is quite amusing and reflects poorly on the current us person and their knowledge of history. They certainly don't venerate or appreciate cold war sacrifices.

Again academic, I just feel that people who meet the criteria for being a war criminal should have been prosecuted. If a 90+ year old can loose their us citizenship and be prosecuted for war crimes, why couldn't they. They should have been. 

It's a large benefit of Covid that it means I end up meeting fewer us expats which tbh is an improvement. 

I'm sure there are well educated and knowledgeable us people, but having experienced the misery of flying through the us and the us security. Well I'll never visit the us, so I'll probably never meet any.

But they are delightfully naive.
