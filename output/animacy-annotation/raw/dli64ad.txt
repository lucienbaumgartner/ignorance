I swear, the only reason anyone complains about DF being OP is that they are some fucking hero one trick he really dicks on and they won't change (mercy mains lol). Literally any time I've played doomfist and seen complaints it's from people playing shit like mercy or whatever and crying that they can't kill me. No, you can't, you're an immobile support, my job is specifically to kill you. 

No one else in any other role complains because they just *change their hero*. ''Oh he's playing doomfist? Well good luck dealing with sombra and pharah.''

Calling it op and uncountable in my eyes is just an admittance that you don't know how to play *any* hero that beats him, and there are literally at least 2 *hard* counters to doomfist in DPS/tank roles *each*, and soft counters in support in that if you can play lucio/ana/or sym well you can fully deny him doing anything to you most of the time.

Doomfist gets shit on so hard by people who know what they are actually doing it's laughable. He is the bane of the unaware and unwilling to adapt and change. He's massive, his move are telegraphed to fuck, and his counters are generally obvious and very strong. How much more fucking help do people need to deal with him?
