Oooh wait lol I get it. You’re communicating you don’t understand how vaccines work! Sorry, it took me a minute because it didn’t occur to me someone could be so slow and ignorant that at this point they **still** don’t understand the basics of what a vaccine is or how it works.

There is no vaccine on earth that is 100 percent effective numbnuts. You can still get covid and die. The point is you are significantly **less likely to**, as well as less likely to **carry and spread it** to vulnerable people, not just people who are vaccinated, but dumbdumbs like you who aren’t, who are more likely to spread it to more people, as well as people who can’t get vaccinated for medical reasons.

Just tell people you’re dumb right off the bat so we know what we’re dealing with next time.
