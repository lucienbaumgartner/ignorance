So women are trying to be badass when carrying a gun to protect themselves or a smaller male? I mean you do realize there are criminals everywhere right? They general go after who they see as an easy victim. So carrying a gun isn’t a bad idea open carry is dumb as fuck asking for attention but concealed is fine. You sound ignorant and illogical. I mean if your mom was attacked wouldn’t you want her to have a gun on her to shoot the fucker?
