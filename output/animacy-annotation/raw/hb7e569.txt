Mishima isn't my cup of tea. I wouldn't have the patience to deal with him in reality. He's so desperate and unaware of how he comes off and the best answers for his confidant are always encouraging this delusion that some of the things he's doing are okay. The turning point is visiting his shadow in mementos, but that just serves as a "we have fixed his attitude!" moment. It doesn't feel earned to me.

Like I said, I have my gripes, but I understand some folks like him. Good for them, I respect that. For me? Nah. I fast-forward through him every playthrough
