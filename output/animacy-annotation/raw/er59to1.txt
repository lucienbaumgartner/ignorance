This post has shown me the vast majority of people don't understand that the poor, infirm, sick and elderly are often isolated and unaware that they can call or order online. Which is a form of economic bigotry.

And that almost no one understands what pharmacists have to do and are ignorant and entitled. 

So that's great.
