ICU nurse here. I feel your pain and I want you to know that you’re not alone in losing your empathy. I feel it every night. I hate that I feel this way, because I’m a nurse. I’m supposed to be compassionate to everybody. Even to those who are willfully ignorant and hateful toward me. But I’ve become calloused, and I feel that it’s my psyches own defense mechanism to keep my heart from breaking over and over and over again. Even so however, I hate that I’ve begun to feel this way.
