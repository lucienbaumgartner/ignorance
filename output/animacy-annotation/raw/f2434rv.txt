Sure, I suppose, but I'd hope that someone with such ignorant, uninformed views would have the intellectual and emotional maturity needed to educate themselves so they didn't continue to have such a dark ages view of things (not to mention the big picture lunacy of the "I got mine" mentality such people display).

I know I'm asking for too much, though. People who have the kind of views you outline here, a good portion of them are beyond help.

Hopefully, smarter people will eventually prevail. People who understand the long-term positives of creating a more sustainable culture, people who recognize that it's important to lead the way for developing countries so they can be faster to get to a more sustainable society than we were, and people who aren't so selfishly short-sighted and ignorant that short-term "competitiveness" doesn't trump (ahem), you know, *the long term future of the entire globe*.

Guess we'll see. Or rather, our grandchildren will.
