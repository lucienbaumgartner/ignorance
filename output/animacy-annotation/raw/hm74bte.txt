5.5G dried. Went to a trail by my house alone with nothing but a couple joints and a water bottle, no phone and no source of the time and the combination with the intense trip I was having left me to feel completely helpless and unaware of how much time had passed. Luckily enough no one else in my neighbourhood decided to walk down that trail on that night so I am thankful to say the bad side of the experience was shortly lived as I returned home safely after a few hours of what felt like forever
