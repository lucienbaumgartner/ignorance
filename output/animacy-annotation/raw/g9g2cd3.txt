You may have had a night terror, which is a hyper realistic nightmare that happens before the rem stage and is often tied to sleep walking, thrashing and screaming. I'd imagine waking up from one of these before reaching the rem stage would lead to a panic and temporary loss of reality. I know when I have them, and I get woken up I'm super disoriented and unaware of my surroundings, generally feeling like it isn't over yet. I find a change of scenery or especially a change of temperature is super helpful, so leaving the room or stepping outside for a moment helps ground me and helps me recover from the shock my mind and body went through.
