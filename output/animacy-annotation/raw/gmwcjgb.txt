the fact the groom is even pressuring u for that is unbelievable. It should be ask you your opinion, then done, accepted no matter what the response.

It’s YOUR body, YOUR hair. People don’t care about men whether they have their hair or not, but society judges women as it being a measurement of our beauty. I’m not saying that’s the reason why you shouldn’t do it, but it’s so insensitive and ignorant of them to not think about YOU and the impact it will have on you. And if the MIL is the nice person you said she is, there is no way she would expect that from you or be upset if you didn’t do it. I would hate for anyone I know to do that just for me, unless they truly wanted to. 

Ugh, it’s just really upsetting that you got treated like this. The wedding is your special day and a memory that will stay with you forever. I don’t want you to look or feel anything less than perfect on that day.

I know that your feelings will reach your MIL regardless.
