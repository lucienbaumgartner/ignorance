Youâ€™re over analyzing it, we have all been there and yes it hurts. Sometimes people can be fickle and unaware of how their actions affect others, other times people just simply outgrow each other as sad as it is. As a person who has always had trouble fitting in my advice to you is stop trying so hard to fit in, just be you and eventually you will attract the kind of friends that like you for who you really are.
