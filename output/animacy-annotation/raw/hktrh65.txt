I’m special needs myself. I am aware of what’s happening around me and very well aware that some people don’t like me just bc I require some care.

But that doesn’t seem like the reason you don’t like this kid. It’s fiiiine not to like him. It’s fine not to hug him. Seems like this guy is unaware and just uninvolved with reality. 

I don’t see why the teachers are forcing a person to hug.
If there’s an ableist thing going on for you, then that’s a problem that you need to face. But otherwise… you’re fine.

Special needs folks -myself included- can be very hard to deal with and understand. Authorities and parents will OFTEN go out of their way to make sure the kid is happy and involved. Cuz, like me, acceptance is key. It’s only a part of the puzzle, but it is a starting piece. When I’m upset to a certain degree, I just don’t know how to handle myself. His emotions maaay have been messed with in whatever happened to him. I kind of black out and am unaware of how that feeling came out bc I wasn’t in control. I know what started that feeling and how it was uncontrollable within my own self…but I don’t recall the next happening. People get reeeeeeeeally scared when I go off like that. I am too. I’ve been on meds for it since school. 

But maybe this dude isn’t on meds or the right dose or something. 
It’s not wrong to dislike a special needs person. But if you dislike them bc they are special needs, THAT is ableism and HIGHLY offensive.

But if you are uncomfortable bc you don’t understand that’s not wrong. 

Talk to me more if you like. My phone is dying.
