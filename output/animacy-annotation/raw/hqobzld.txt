From how the above reads, it sounds like he was hiring actual babysitters, rather than sex workers, and tricking them into engaging in his sexual fantasy? I have no moral problem with consenting baby-play (I don't really GET it, but if it's not hurting anyone, then whatever), but involving unaware and non-consenting people in your fantasies is gross and wrong. I'm guessing that's the issue here?
