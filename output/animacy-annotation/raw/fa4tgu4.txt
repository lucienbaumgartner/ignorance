This comment got super long, so I'm going to put it into two parts: important stuff and less important stuff. Please read both, because both flesh out my perspective. But ultimately you only need to engage with the important stuff.

# Important Stuff

&gt; In group-out group dynamics. You could say certain things only if you were a member of the Communist party.

This is a link between government censorship and tyranny, not content warnings and tyranny. A content warning leaves the content untouched. It's just a warning. There's no link to authoritarianism.

That said, content warning, because transphobic slurs. Again.

&gt; I also don't think there should be a universal ban on any word regardless of context.

I've said over, and over, and over, that I'm not in favor of a contextless ban. Seriously, re-read my earlier comments if you have to. You're strawmanning here.

What I *am* in favor of is social conventions that look down on non-trans people using transphobic slurs. That doesn't mean you shouldn't quote queer period pieces accurately. That doesn't mean you shouldn't very occasionally use the word while discussing it. It means that your use should be infrequent, properly contextualized, and avoided whenever possible. Because, again, removing symbols of hate from public discourse is one of many steps on the road to equality.

I really think you should ask yourself why you have no problem understanding and following such a rule when it comes to the n-word, but not with tranny. There's a reason. What is it?

&gt; rather, people will someday be confident enough and trusting enough to not let the little things bother them.

And someday it *might be* a little thing. But it isn't now.

Let me explain. You and I are protected from each other by the internet, so you using tranny doesn't affect me all that much. It's insulting, sure, but at the end of the day I can sign off and forget about you.

IRL, or in a personally identifiable online space, it's a different story. Like I said earlier, the use of tranny is twofold: as an insult, and as a threat of violence. Hearing a cis person use that slur is fucking terrifying, because I have to face the very real possibility that the person saying it genuinely wants to kill me--as well as the certainty that they would stand by if someone else did.

Standing by is the bigger problem, as a matter of fact. Using slurs like that accommodates hate. Makes it feel more comfortable. As I'm certain you know all too well (having read some of your comments on r/atheism), it worms its way into our lives in the name of discussion or jokes or statements that sound mild to the privileged and frighten others, exposing rifts in understanding. The sooner we can push symbols of hate out of public discourse, the better.

# (Less) Important Stuff


&gt; Watch it already ...

And this is a hill *I* don't want to die on. :P I was using Citizen Kane as an (apparently bad) example to demonstrate a simplified point about rules. I wouldn't actually get offended if someone spoiled it for me.

&gt; If you went back you'll notice I've never said non-trans should go around calling people trannies if it makes them uncomfortable

And yet you continue to use it despite a trans woman specifically telling you that it makes her uncomfortable. I mean, really, why was it necessary to say it in that sentence? You would be just as well served by a phrase by "transphobic slurs" or "the t-word" or "t*******" or whatever.

&gt; I really think you should recognize a need for a more flexible and greyer world that doesn't exist in binaries.

The *irony* of telling a queer person like me this. Trust me, I've learned to grow past binaries. Most of us have to.

I just... I know you meant this bit in a more "the world isn't built on absolutes" way, but honestly, that phrasing is just egregious. XD

&gt; A surer path is for people to stop being so easily harmed by words regardless of intent or context; I don't think that excessive vulnerability will be the proof of living in a more aware society than the one we currently live in

Sure, I'm harmed and vulnerable for standing up for myself. I'm harmed and vulnerable for having a relatively measured discussion with you despite your repeated use of insulting slurs you really shouldn't be using. I'm harmed and vulnerable for feeling bad that so many people are still so incredibly hateful and ignorant that your casual transphobia is the sort of shit my community puts up with in our allies, because we don't have many of those. Harmed and vulnerable. People like me don't get that luxury.
