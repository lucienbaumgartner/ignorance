Going by what information you shared, it sounds like this neighbor needs the consent of everyone who shares the property. Unless you mean that you're all renting, and the actual property owner owns all the shared houses. That would mean she needs that person's consent. Either way, it doesn't sound like she has a leg to stand on, although more specifics would be needed to assess the entire situation. 

Also, has anyone actually talked to this person about their dog? They might just be incredibly naive and unaware that anything is wrong if no one says anything.
