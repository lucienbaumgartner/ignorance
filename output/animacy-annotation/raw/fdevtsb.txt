No, it’s ok. 

Honestly? I think it’s an appropriation of persecution. Sure, people who were pagans were oppressed by Christianity. That is true. 

But was it recent? No. Are there long term effects that people can point to as examples of institutionalized persecution? No. Are there people who can trace their lineages to families who experienced persecution? Not really, no. 

None of it even approaches the level of persecution and hurt the Black community has faced, so when people say it’s equivalent to the “n word,” I think they’re being seriously insensitive and ignorant. 

That being said, just like any other word, if a person asks you not to call them that, don’t.
