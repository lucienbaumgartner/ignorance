I've honestly noticed the people who are into religion are usually lower IQ, easily influenced and just plain sheep or followers. Never the leaders of the pack mentality. My ex who was a sheep is into religion hardcore now after we broke up and she's so blissfully happy and ignorant that I just laugh.
