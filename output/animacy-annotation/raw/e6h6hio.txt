Okay, but then I don't understand your argument against abortion.

If you want to argue against abortion, why not argue against the reasons people consider it acceptable?

Your method, if I understand it, would break down like this:

1) for some reasons, some people consider abortion acceptable.

2) fetuses are not aware of what is happening and are useless 

3) if you justify the killing of fetuses for any reason, you must also justify the killing of everything that doesn't understand what is happening and is useless.

4) 1 year olds are unaware and useless

5) therefore, if you accept abortion you should accept the killing of 1 year olds


There are a number of problems there, but the biggest one is step 3.

For the similarities between 1 year olds and fetuses to require the connection you imply, those similarities should connect up with the unspecified reasons in step 1, and you haven't done that.


(By the way, Roe vs Wade, the legal case that the Supreme Court weighed in on to legalize abortion in America, never mentioned the cons of 'rape babies' but rather an argument based on the right of people to control how their bodies are used (often called 'bodily autonomy' these days)
