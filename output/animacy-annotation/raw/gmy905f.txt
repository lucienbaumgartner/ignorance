I'm so retarded and ignorant that it's painful...

I saw a post the other day where someone said people who have GME (or any stock) in lots of 100 can do what you are suggesting to help get back some of the money lost. At least I think that's what they were talking about.

I have 350 GME and 1000 AMC. Would you mind explaining this concept or point me to a video or something that talks about it?
