This will make me sound ignorant and uneducated but I didn’t know until I was 50 years old that the Bible that I believed in as Sola Scriptora had been butchered and altered by Martin Luther. 

I had no idea there as a Book of Maccabees 1&amp;2 for example. No idea there was a Biblical basis for Purgatory. No idea Luther added the word “alone” to Romans 3:28 to support his heretical Sola of Sola Fide.

When I stumbled upon a Catholic Bible, I thought I’d I’ve been lied to about this- what else have I been lied to about?

So I started down the rabbit hole of Catholic Answers and it convinced me to start RCIA about six months later.

Without a doubt, the very best decision of my life.
