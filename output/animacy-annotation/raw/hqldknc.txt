That’s fair, and I’m not accusing him of abusing his mod powers (I agree, I haven’t seen him do that)… it was less a fear of retaliation and more just… a sense of powerlessness and discomfort knowing that a mod here holds these views about me and others like me. As I’d feel about anyone in a position of authority who openly espoused hateful, ignorant and harmful views about me and/or my peers.
