15 years or so ago, when I knew nothing about investing or financial independence but I knew I hated my dead end job, I fell for "The Motley Fool" and one of their "hot stock" pump and dump scams.

The company supposedly had a patent on a "revolutionary" treatment for some kind of eye disease, and now it's been so long I don't even remember what the disease was.  I remember the probably long dead company's name though, it was "Insight Vision."  Anyways, what the Motley Fool didn't mention was that the company was barely solvent, had competitors with patents for better drugs for the same disease, and the stock was about to go OTC.

I knew nothing about how to even research any of that, but I fell for the feeling in my gut that it was my "big break" to escape the shitty life I was living.  I had 3000 bucks saved that I should have put toward credit card debt, but instead put it into that shitty stock.

A month later it dropped to almost nothing and went OTC.

I learned a valuable lesson, but in my dire and desperate situation it sure stung.  I wonder how many other people they have duped over the years with their pump and dump schemes and penny stock get rich quick recommendations.

I am solidly a broad based index fund investor now, and my life situation is a lot better.  But back then this 3000$ setback felt like my world fell apart, all because I was at the intersection of desperate and ignorant of the too-good-to-be-true proposition they had put forth.
