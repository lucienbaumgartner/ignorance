&gt;Anyway, the point is no one is apolitical.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you even know the definition of that term?

&amp;#x200B;

"Apoliticism is apathy or antipathy towards all political affiliations. A person may be described as apolitical **if they are not interested or uninvolved in politics**. "

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's just the privileged and unaware that think they are.

I find this laughable generalization, well,  laughable, as a poor South-American who doesn't even vote despite it being mandatory in my country LOL

Only sad people like you and the stupid bimbo in the screenshot try to turn everything into politics and believe anyone who doesn't join your particular cult, err, I mean, political affiliation, is a FaScIsT white male... People like you are the reason people like me stay clear of politics
