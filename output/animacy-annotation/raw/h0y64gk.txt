I'm not sure that it's planned out to a significant extent, but I agree.  I think having little 'free time' tends to push people to being both unaware and unquestioning of how their lives could be better in a more permanent sense (in this case, shorter, optimized work hours, and more government control of the economy, in my opinion), and more willing to 'escape' their jobs with short-term pleasures (vacations, movies, junk food) that are obtained by giving away their money, which seems to inevitably help increase the wealth of rich people and the disparity between them and poor people
