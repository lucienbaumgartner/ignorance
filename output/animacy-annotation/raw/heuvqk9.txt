It happens from time to time. It's usually someone pissed and ignorant that lane-splitting &amp; filtering is legal here. I've had a few people get pissed when I pull up to the front of a red light, but by the time it turns green, I'm gone - hopefully they figure out that a motorcycle will clear an intersection faster than anyone else...and that we're not slowing them down any.

But I think it's also dependent on your bike. I generally find harley riders a bit arrogant and confrontational, sport bikes are  perceived as hooligans, and so on.
