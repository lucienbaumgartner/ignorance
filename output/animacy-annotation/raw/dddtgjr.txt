No, *fuck you* sir! That isn't just what liberals do, that's some identity politics BS. It's called having your voice heard, and beyond that, I am sick of fuckwits like you that are so utterly clueless and unaware that they don't even realize that they are basically advocating for the most impotent, feeble, and slow political change possible.

We have an idea for how we want the country to be, and when a company goes full propaganda mode and spreads misinformation, it is totally ok to put them on blast. It doesn't matter who does it, what  matters is that it works, and it clearly fucking works, that's why we see so much of this bullshit appeasement - because they actually get off their fat ass long enough to organize, tweet, complain, etc; and  they do so EVERY day. We need to be loud and proud to make these companies think twice about which half of the country they want to suck up to.
