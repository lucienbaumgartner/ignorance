I went through something similar with my own brother growing up. If you feel like you can do it, I would honestly consider confronting him and telling him exactly how his actions affect you. He may not realize how hurtful he really is being.  

It took me till my mid 20s to confess to my brother (i used a letter) and it was empowering for me and my trauma related to him. Turns out he was apologetic and unaware that his actions had such a toll on me.
