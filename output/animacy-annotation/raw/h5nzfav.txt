So what? Facts exist outside of the Mueller report. I don't know what news sources you trust but feel free to look up Roger Stone's collusion with foreign nationals over the leaking of DNC data. I'll include a link as well.

A reasonable person could absolutely conclude that collusion did happen. Trump may not have been aware of it though, or it wasn't illegal for a number of reasons we don't have to get into. It's still unfair and ignorant of you to treat anyone that talks about collusion between Trump campaign/associates as a fool though, since it did happen between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks.
