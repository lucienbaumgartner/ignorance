As a man, I understand the fears of your husband. He can't bear the thought of his little girl having sex[17 years and has been in a relationship for over a year without sex. I can only imagine the difficulties she has gone through trying to keep it safe till she is old enough]. This is fine and in some cases, normal.

The only way to help your husband get over this, is to get his father or mother to talk with him concerning this present complications. Because he won't listen to you, not because he doesn't want to, but because he sees you as being soft and ignorant of the problems he is afraid of.
