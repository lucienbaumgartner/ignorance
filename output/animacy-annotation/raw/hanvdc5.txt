Nope. Not even close. It's extremely rare to even hear a full-blown sentence in a dialect; Especially here, since each region has a specific language/dialect and then all the provinces/towns/cities/villages speak a different variation of said language/dialect. 

The use of media pushes for the use of 'standard Italian', since most dialects are non intelligible with one another; It's also considered uncivilized and ignorant of you to speak your native dialect instead of Italian in almost every situation that doesn't involve family or friends.

At best, you'd only be able to learn very few expressions. Such as the way to say **[insert word]** in this place, and so on and so forth.
