NTA. And I’m actually disgusted by the amount of people acting as if it’s no big deal that she’s practically forcing you to be a parent when you very clearly communicated to her that you have no interest in ever being one from the jump. She agreed to that and then changed her mind (at best), or lied from the beginning and it isn’t a weird strike of luck that she got pregnant on two forms of birth control. 

It’s extremely unfair and ignorant that your wishes are being ignored here. Look, you can’t stop her from having and keeping the baby, but you also don’t have to remain in a relationship with her. This is likely going to cause a lot of resentment and it’s so unfair that she’s willing to put you in this situation. So selfish to do that to someone who has been very clear about not wanting to be a parent.

Hopefully it all works out but honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if this ruined your marriage. And honestly, you wouldn’t be in the wrong. People, women specifically, need to start taking folks seriously when they say they don’t want children.
