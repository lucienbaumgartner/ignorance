This is a great point. I enjoy reading what people have to say about this edit but it is definitely a glass shattering moment. When I watched Samoa I definitely thought Brett had a chance to win because I was young and unaware of edit implications. It made the end game more suspenseful. Now that I am aware of the edit I definitely watch with a different perspective and can see people feeling like it ruins a little bit of the suspense.
