No. The cost is a symptom of the underlying problem of driving unqualified people to higher education. It's a flooded market artificially inflated. 

25k is nothing in terms of my earning potential from my education. I literally made that differential in 2 years vs. a comparable non-degree job. 

It's not special tricks. It's benefits through incentives... like taxes or deductions... you just call it something different. You're still "in debt" it's just built into your system rather than on an individual. You know this, right? 

The poorer you are the easier it is to get free money in the US. Middle class families have a harder time because of how grants and certain scholarships are set up. I helped tons of kids go to school completely "free" just on the fact their families were poor.

If you dismiss other systems outright you're just being wilfully ignorant and intelligently dishonest. There's bad pieces to every system, they're all created by humans who make mistakes and try to accommodate.
