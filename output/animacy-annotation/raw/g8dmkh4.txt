Totally agreed. I have PCOS and my former “therapist” (a certified clinical psychologist in NYC) once told me that it was my fault because I have adopted more ‘masculine’ personality traits / psychology. The logic being that those traits were somehow overriding my ‘natural’ female biology???

I get the mind-body connection. But the idea that you have single-handedly manipulated your genetic makeup or are somehow culpable is off the wall. It’s so anti-empathetic and unaware that people spout this BS...
