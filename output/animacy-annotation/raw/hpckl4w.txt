I wanna be through so I'll mention things that I think matter:

Flaws: 

* people pleaser: I tend to put others before myself which leads me into messes
* messy: not that well organized
* cautious: I don't like taking too many physical risks
* blunt: I speak my mind when sometimes a white lie might be needed
* moody: I get a lot of mood swings
* unscholarly: I hate studying without a motive
* stubborn: when I feel like I'm right then I will surrender in an argument for peace

Fears:

* bugs: to the point of being scared of butterflies but not bees or a mantis for some reason
* heights: really extreme acrophobia
* the dark: I always like a bright light in the room, I really hate being vulnerable and unaware of my surroundings
* rollercoasters: until someones forces me and I somehow find thrill in it
* death: it's more of a fear of the afterlife itself

Natural talents (not practiced):

* charisma: I'm pretty good at public speaking even though I usually hang out alone
* humor: I'm also good at making people laugh without much practice
* imagination: a trait I had since I was kid but I held onto it, also really good at making connections with random topics 
* fair judgement: I was always good at looking at both sides to a story and trying to make unbiased judgements
