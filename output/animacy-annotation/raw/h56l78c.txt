SSRIs are awful for libido. I know. I caused my DB because of fluoxetine use for a few years. I was normally HL and so was my husband. He’s now the LL because I rejected him for so long. The roles have totally reversed. He’s not on any antidepressant but the years of rejection took their toll on him. Now he doesn’t touch me at all.
When I was on fluoxetine and lost my libido I was completely aloof and unaware of the libido drop. I seriously didn’t care.
