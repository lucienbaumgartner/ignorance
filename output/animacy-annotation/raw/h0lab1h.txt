Devils advocate here...

You know, as above as below, and all of outside is already inside.

The universe/reality is vast an possibly infinite. Essentially a probability device running all possibilities under all possible circumstance.

Yes, our individual story may remain ignorant and unaware of atrocities. Does that mean bad things don’t exist in your reality? Or maybe that part of reality is still in the dark and just not perceived.

Maybe through technology the light of knowledge can spread and illuminate the dark spots of reality. Does this make reality bad?

In many cases where evil and atrocious activities come to light people are able to influence that for the better or stop it all together. 

Maybe this whole “the universe is a mirror in front of us” is a “conspiracy” to make people feel guilty for other’s actions and the evil in the world. Designed to trap us inside ourselves with a window into reality that we are told is a mirror into ourselves. And naturally you feel justified in imprisoning yourself on the idea that all bad is your own doing. 

I beg that negative energy is constructive too, it constructs a realistic view of reality people can use to better this plane of existence for all.
