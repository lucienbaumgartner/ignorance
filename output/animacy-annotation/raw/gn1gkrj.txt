Can it be that Rachael is a product of her upbringing and surroundings? I mean I’m not white or black and not American but even I thought that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Antebellum wedding venue years ago was in poor taste. Rachael lives in Cummings Georgia and by all accounts it seems like a pretty homogeneous area not particularly friendly to minorities. She’s surrounded by her own bubble of Southern white friends and family, and maybe most, not all have rather narrow minded semi Racist values. So maybe she was either ignorant or just go with the flow kind of girl. She doesn’t seem like she’s deep or thoughtful or even empathetic like Katie. Just your basic Southern Belle not outwardly racist but maybe clinging to some forgotten Antebellum nostalgia hence the Ball. Of course this doesn’t excuse her actions. Thing is, if Matt really chooses her in the end, that is problematic. Of all the girls he has connections with, it’s Rachael he chooses. Is it because he’s blinded and unaware of her covert racist or at least complicit views that she hides well under the sweet smiles and demeanor? I would be so pissed if He really truly picks her over Michelle, Bri, Pieper. I would be pissed if he picks Rachael over socialite Kit.
