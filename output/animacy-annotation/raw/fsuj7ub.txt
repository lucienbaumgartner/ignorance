Yep. Look at the alt right on this subreddit and across reddit. Unified in their uneducated propaganda and shouting in unison that "cops kill more white people than black people.

As always, they ignore key parts. There is a MASSIVE difference between cops justifiably shooting someone and cops murdering black people (which doesn't happen to white people) and per capita, more black people are killed.

People have seen through their "all lives matter" racist bullshit so they are trying to find something else for the uneducated, fearful, and ignorant that sticks. They are losing yet another battle to maintain white supremacy and they know it. 

We will tear down every single monument to racism they built and we will never, ever stop tearing them down until they are all melted down.
