&gt;2) In Highschool, a girl accused me and another person of rape. The prosecuting attorney dropped the case because the girl admitted that she made it all up. People at school (Girls she associated w/ but not me) harassed her for the lie. Her mother (upset and unaware of the truth) tried to put a restraining order on everyone involved (including me) but it was denied. So her attorney talked me into signing one between me and the mother (Who I've never met). Seeing no drawbacks because I was young and naive I signed it.

This is so very different from "18 years ago, when I was 16, an attorney swindled me (a minor w/o my parents/counsel around) into a LIFE long restraining order for a person I had never met before. Never knowing the person"

The three people you should absolutely never lie to are your lawyer, your doctor, and your accountant. You need to be up front and honest with the lawyer that you get. Telling them half-truths or spinning the truth will not be productive to them providing you with sound advice and getting you the outcome that you want.
