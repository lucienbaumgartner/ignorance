You are welcome. I am sorry to hear that happened. That sounds quite hard but I understand what you are going through. It's good that you have a supportive mother and uncle. I hope you find a good therapist that helps you in overcoming or handling your issues. Yeah, it's like that and it's even worse when you are undiagnosed and unaware of your autism because then you have no idea why everybody is pointing out things about you or criticizing you. Thank you.

I hope you also have a good day/night. Take care. You are valid. And I agree that autism has many positive things too like you said being very passionate about your hobbies. I see that as a beautiful thing.
