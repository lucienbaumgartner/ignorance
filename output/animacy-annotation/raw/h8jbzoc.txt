No, no. The young black guys are just hated by the stupid writers. It has nothing to do with 9 out of 10 young characters being shown as inexperienced and unaware of all the mistakes they’re making. It’s *just* against the blacks, and in parallel it also just so happens that young Italians are actually dumb irl (that part happened to be realistic, but that’s probably a coincidence because the writers aren’t that good).
