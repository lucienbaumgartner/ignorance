Ooh! Story of my life. The only thing that seems to actually prolong my anger is unapologetic, unaware rudeness. Otherwise, I'm never ever mad, not really, nope.


It's all too easy for my anger to disappear when I consider the circumstances that lead the person I'm disappointed with to act in the ways they did. Once I achieve understanding, I grow bored of it and move on, more or less. It's a pretty quick process.


I guess the one thing I do have trouble understanding is when someone is beyond socially unaware and obnoxious - I still hold a bit of disdain for a guy who once called me 47 times from 1 AM to 5 AM, trying to wake me up because he wanted to know if I could lend him 20 bucks. He was greatly upset I wasn't waking up to answer His Majesty. ‚ù§


At that point I had known him for a day and had given him my number for school purposes, that dick. üòú


In what world does doing that make any sense? It just served to piss me off, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. I guess it amuses me now, though! Still, stands out to me.
