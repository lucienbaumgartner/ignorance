I’m not anti-vaxx at all, I am extremely anti-mandate, as bodily autonomy is a paradigm of a feee and liberal society. This baseless stereotyping of swaths of the population is ignorant and detrimental to any public health discourse. There is the basic fundamental concept of risk stratification in PH and Medicine, just as I wouldn’t the general population to take the PC Men vaccine, I wouldn’t expect young healthy 25 year olds to take a vaccine that statistically speaking is at almost zero risk to themselves. If you wanted to then argue that them being vaccinated would protect others, that would be patently false given not only the data of the last year, but of the understanding of baseline health in relation to VL. Yes those who are already unhealthy and at risk of larger VL become safer for the general population by being vaccinated, this puts them in relation to a healthier individual, the original young healthy adult is already a low vector quantity and in the history of medicine they would never be expected to be subjected to subcutaneous injection for something that would not benefit them or the general population significantly. Especially with this new variant. It is a problem to start vilifying your contemporaries in society for general disagreements that don’t actually hold water in logic or data. If you want to discuss vulnerable and unhealthy people and their duty with PH and vaccines especially that’s another story, but please don’t just label people stupid for disagreeing with you, especially when there is a large part of the medical and scientific community who disagrees with you as well, and aren’t “anti-vaxxers”.
