Holy shit this makes me so angry and i watched it happen today. 

At my work we have "smart elevators" where you hit the button before getting on so it can decide how to distribute passengers between the cars. It tells you which elevator to go to by letter. 

I hit the button...elevator D and go wait out a few feet and to the side. She rushes into me, and side steps (we did that quick awkward danced who's going where) around me and literally stands inches in front of the door playing on her phone. 

Door opens, she doesn't look up from her phone and just starts walking forward. She runs right into a guy getting off, and gives him this look like, "Watch where  you're going!". He says sorry as he exits (I wouldn't have been so nice) and she gets on. Another 3 people exit the elevator after she enters, and then I get on. 

I hate being like this, but the only thing I can think of when seeing people like this is that they aren't actively doing it. They are literally so stupid, ignorant, and unaware that they shouldn't be allowed to live without some sort of mentor and assistant like those poor people with major physical disabilities. And I bet this woman drives a car.
