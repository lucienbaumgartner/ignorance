Thank you for your well thought out response. It's a shame people are downvoting you simply because you have a different opinion, but that's just the name of the game on Reddit (and in life sadly).

All in all, the situation is as it is.

 I would personally say that the worst we can do right now is attack the immigrants - they are simply peons in the psychopathic games played by the elites, victims of circumstances, of unneeded and atrocious wars and a transformation of their native lands into hell-scapes. 

At this point, we need to stand together, firm, as a people. United and not divided. 

We need to resolve the primary reasons for these occurrences (which are in the case of immigration without doubt the wars and interventionism, though soon it will also be climate change, whether one believes it is mostly man-made or not, its consequences will have to be dealt with), stop being passive, unaware and ignorant. Then the psychopaths in power need to be ousted in order for peace to reign again. Only once peace and order is restored can we begin talking about which countries desire to remain culturally more culturally homogeneous and which countries desire to be more multi-cultural. In my view, neither is wrong, neither is right. It is a decision of the people, but the people from all sides should decide where they want to live and how. Including of course every immigrant from the Middle East that has been forcefully expelled from their country due to the war-crimes of the current leadership of all interventionist countries. I am sure that most of these people would prefer to live in their country of origin as well.
