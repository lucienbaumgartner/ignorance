Yeah, I think the DLC comes separate, I can’t remember off the top of my head since it came in instalments. If his coat is separate DLC tho, I should hope that particular island is too!

Yeah, that was my only issue with marrying Ludus. The town events suddenly got super awkward when it went, “You can go with your partner too!” While Ludus is just sitting at home, unaware and unable to join. I know they’re likely done with the game now, but I really wish they’d drop an update that let the DLC characters join you for festivals. :/

I might have to give those SOS games a try, then~. It’s just called Story of Seasons and A Tale of Two Towns, right? Maybe it’ll give me the push I needed to finish Trio of Towns too, I started it and loved it but ended up distracted with other games at the time. ._.
