&gt; Even if a ref were hypothetically perfect, if he calls 7 penalties on one side and none for the other, the game is going to go poorly.

Its not going to go poorly, because he is making the right calls.

If Violent team B is angry, what the fuck are they going to do? Say that they should have been allowed to violate the rules? 

&gt; Guys holding jerseys, tiny chops with the stick, pseudo-interference to protect their space. It's never as simple as "Team A is committing infractions and Team B isn't".

So you fucking call it. Call it whenever you see it. 2 referees on the ice, and an additional referee in the press box to call egregious calls that were missed. 

&gt; Idk, I think the arguments against game management are just so naive and ignorant of how professional sports are for the players

Technology changes. We have the benefit of replay and slowmo. We can catch rule breakers in ways we couldnt before. 

Im fucking *gobsmacked* that people want to continue to let rulebreaking occur, and let the referees union have such a *huuuuuuuuge* discretionary impact on the game.
