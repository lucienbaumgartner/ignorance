I’ve spent plenty of time traveling overseas for both work and pleasure and Americans tend to be overly cautious to avoid the “ugly American” stereotype. In the UAE, Japan, Germany, Spain, France, England, Italy, Peru, and Bolivia I always saw Americans on excellent behavior. Even when uncomfortable due to cultural norms they would still apologize profusely If they felt like they were causing a problem by asking for something unusual. The worst tourists I ever came across were English in Peru who got extremely drunk at a bar in the Plaza de Aramas and began throwing beer bottles at the bartender who cut them off. I also saw Italian tourists making a group of women so uncomfortable they were asked to leave the restaurant. 

Unfortunately in the current environment it’s popular for the internet mob and self-loathing left wing Americans to perpetuate the generally false assertion that Americans are obnoxious and ignorant of other cultures.
