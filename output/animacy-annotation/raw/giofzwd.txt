List it. Your evidence has been discredited line by line by numerous judges and people with actual experience and education in law.

Again, thousands of people would have to be in this conspiracy. 2 ballots with errors does not make an election fraud. These errors occur every single election because sure mistakes are made. But 99.999% of ballots were accurate. You people kick and scream about not being 100â€°, it's ridiculous and ignorant of processes. You sound like a sovereign citizen arguing with a judge about the law.
