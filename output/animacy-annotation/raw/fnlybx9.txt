We should move to a voucher system, at least in the short term. 

Education is something almost everyone considers important. Yet its the one area thats gotten much worse AND more expensive thanks the teachers unions, DoE etc. Healthcare has gotten much more expensive, but it's also better than it was thanks to technology. Some things are cheaper but worse, such as simple manufacturing from china (like tools, small appliances). Some things are cheaper AND better (like TVs, computers) thanks to the free market.

Education is the most important yet has suffered the most. How could they do this?

Bill Ivey (via wikileaks) said it best:

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."
