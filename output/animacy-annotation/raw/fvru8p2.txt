I will say that those of us who are interested in apologetics tend to be drawn into engaging with atheism (and I'm no exception), when really atheists are just as weird as us. A large part of this may be that many of us are former atheists, so we go to arguments that we perceive as effective against our former selves.

If you want to reach ordinary people, you need to engage more with MTD, theologically liberal Christianity, "spiritual but not religious" thinking, and so on. You need to tackle some pretty mushy ideas. Even a large percentage of people who list "none" as their religion are closer to these than atheism.

But that said, I think the main evangelical function of apologetics is to make Christianity intellectually respectable. You can't debate someone into being a Christian, but you can talk them out of the notion that Christians are all stupid and ignorant, that we haven't thought about the objections they raise.
