And poor people give a pair of flying, feathered hootenanies about why they're getting money to pay bills?

Mighty White of you.

Fuck them poors! DRUMPF BAD! ORUNGE MAN BAD! I get to go have brunch again my dude!

If your reaction to 'we should give poor, struggling folk something better than the pigshit we're offering them now' is 'orunge man bad!' you're a worse moral failure than Trump, whatever his motives.

And if you don't like that, fix your shit. You're far too privileged and unaware of it to be deciding who gets to benefit.
