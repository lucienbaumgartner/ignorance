Yeah I’m sure the tiny amount of experience you have with dogs trumps my much larger experience. 

I’m not a dog nutter! Do you read my comments? I agree that the dog attacking the cat is bad! It should be stopped and told off immediately! This is harmful to the cat! All around shitty pet ownership! I know it shouldn’t be encouraged! 

BUT!

That dog is playing! Or at least thinks he is! 

This is absolutely normal play behavior! At this point you have GOT to be trolling. You don’t know shit and act like you know everything !

Fuck it, I’m getting Deja Vu. Just write another dumb reply that makes it more obvious you have no idea what you are talking about, idgaf, I ain’t gonna read it. Either you are trolling or so incredibly stubborn and ignorant that you are not worth talking to.
