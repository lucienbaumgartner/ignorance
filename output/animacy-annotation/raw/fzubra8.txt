" I don't have a problem with losing the game but when you lose in a way  where you feel like you have no control than it just feel a little cheap"  You do have control.  You look up in new caves.  Fighting a cave leech is preemptive rather than reactionary.  It is a punishment for being unaware and alone.  A blind 'lone dwarf is a dead dwarf.  


If you find yourself dying to them a lot: **Look up and stay with your team.**  

It something that comes with experience.  You enter a new cave and look for leeches.  If they didn't kill you their purpose in enforcing team play would be null.  They would just an annoyance a time waster.  Possibly even more frustrating as they are not a threat so you would be less likely to look for them just to get grabbed drained and then mauled on your way down.  There are enemies that justify nerfs but that isn't here.
