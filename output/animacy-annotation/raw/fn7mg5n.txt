YTA, you seem very immature and unaware that using bathwater to grow veggies isn't unhygienic or inconsiderate of you and also doesn't disqualify her of preparing food for other people. You were horrible.

I live on a small holding, we are not connected to city plumbing lines at all. Our kitchen sink water runs into our garden and the area around the exit of the pipe flourishes unlike any other place on our property. It doesn't stink, we have a squirrel, mice and mongooses who drink from the little creek that's formed there. We don't have the luxury of being able to water our garden because we use borehole water, which are stored in tanks, which means we're limited on water usage.

You should be ashamed of yourself for shaming her when you were invited into her home where she provided you free food. She should be proud of herself, for growing veggies and being environmentally friendly while growing them.
