This is assuming that the hypothetical parent who has raised this hypothetical child has no idea how to spot the difference between whining and genuine issues.

That and that this hypothetical parent is aloof and unaware of their child's needs.

Personally I feel that response is much more gracious than "shut up and suck it up"
