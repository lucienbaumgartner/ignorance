I see ScoMo as dumb and ignorant of the realities of life for the average Australian. He has no idea what itâ€™s like to live a life like mine. He would have to have a chat with Jen on how to have a conversation with me. But he is smart and cunning and knows how to play politics. Everything has a plan. An agenda. He is in control.
