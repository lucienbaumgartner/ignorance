I was actually just about to make an ignorant and arrogant comment about how wrong I think you are, but now that I look at it again, I noticed itâ€™s upside down. I still find it weird about the missing slash though, but I guess, it could have been a thing Oda put on it only when Bellamy was introduced to make it more unique. Good catch, bruv!
