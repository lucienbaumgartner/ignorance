I think she’s a highly ignorant and uneducated person (9th-10th grade education) whose sole goal in life was to become a stay at home mom. Which is fine, if you get there with a person who wants that too. But she’s stubborn and manipulative and will do anything to get her way. I think she has undiagnosed mental health issues and possibly a learning disorder but is also an extreme narcissist. Of course these are all things you don’t know about a person you have a sex only relationship with a handful of times. Like we never even talked on the phone or had many conversations. Like after a few times I realized that she was very ignorant in the lacking intelligence sense and that’s why I never pursued more with her. I met somebody more my type around the same time and began dating her instead. I cut things off with kids mom, amicably as there was no relationship to agonize over. I think she knew that’s what was happening and tried to trap me, but by the time she knew she was pregnant I had moved on. She did tell me she was pregnant. I asked her if she thought it was mine and she said no it was someone else’s. She admitted to lying to me in court. I think she was trying to pass it off as the other guy’s who was actually interested in a relationship but after my son was born it was obviously not his (guy was white). The next 2 years she hid him from me while she tried to date other men looking for that husband but I think her parents made her track me down. I was in college. I asked for a DNA test but she refused for a few months instead opting to contact my family and girlfriend. 

Thanks for letting me vent. It’s been an extremely long and frustrating ordeal dealing with her. I may need therapy.
