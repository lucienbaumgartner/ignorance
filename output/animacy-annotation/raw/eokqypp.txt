Your last sentence is so arrogant and ignorant that I don't even want to bother educating you. Doing whatever their contract says is their job. They don't owe you jack shit. If some billionaire bought rfrsh and gave device 100 mln to bar him from only playing in his events, that's what he should fucking do. Don't act like you're not going to do that lmao
