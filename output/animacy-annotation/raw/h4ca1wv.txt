I did read your comment, and like this one it was a lot of undirected upset amounting to very little and making no understandable point or contribution to the overall discussion.

In my opinion if you make the claim **nothing** is as offensive as someone saying the n word to a black person, then **you** have to defend your outrageous claim somehow.

I don't have to defend my position of pointing out how reductive and ignorant that silly statement is, but I have because I don't want anyone reading this thread to believe just because it's an issue related to race you have to agree with idiots making fools out of themselves in the name of collective outrage.
