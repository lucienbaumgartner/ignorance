Clearly she did not realize that mcdonalds sold salads if anything non-meat related at all thus making her dense and unaware of what's on the menu. Besides most of the meat is clearly obvious that its rahi meat since most of the food comes from matoran mcdonalds. If she wanted to a hamburger with no meat in it what so ever she should've "have it her way" over at burger king (AKA the burger themed chum bucket across the street).
