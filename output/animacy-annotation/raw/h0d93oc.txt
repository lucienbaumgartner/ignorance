So was I wrong to do this? I honestly don't know. I honestly am past caring now.


I kept having this sense I was trying to be pushed into a mould and role I had absolutely no interest in taking. And that my bids for freedom and also my expressing my needs in the relationship were met with his rages and savage attacks on me. He was emotionally abusive through and through.


I never seemed to express myself in "quite" the right way for him. He always had an excuse and it was always my fault that he acted as he did.


Another curious point was that he seems to hate all the women in his life. His mother he despises. His ex's all did him wrong in one way or another. He seems entirely oblivious and ignorant of anything he might be doing to perpetuate or escalate a situation.


So anyway. I'm done in. 11 hours on the crazytrain and I'm absolutely done. The sadness hasn't hit me yet but it will. But I will survive this and in some ways he's done me a favour by pulling the trigger. No doubt, as he did before when he dumped me the first time I wouldn't take responsibility for absolutely everything that had gone wrong, he will paint this whole situation in his favour. Just like he did with his long term ex, he will get sympathy, and he will paint me to be the villain again. Good riddance and good luck.
