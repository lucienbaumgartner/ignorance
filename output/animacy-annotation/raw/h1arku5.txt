Not necessarily. All of those are based on a lot of assumptions; yeah, people bought, but people also sold. And don't forget the 5M shares announced by GME themselves.

Yesterday was the first day I ever came to meltdown. I'm not a meltdown guy, and I don't get any enjoyment from making fun of apes.

I was in it too, and I want it to be a success. But we have to look at things rationally. A theory needs to be falsifiable. If you always change the goalpost and always say "hold, the fundamentals don't change" no matter what comes, that just becomes a superstition, a really bad religion.

All of this new mental gymnastics they're doing on the sub is just so sad. If you check out yesterday evening's live stream, you can clearly see atobitt and the other mods being SO excited for the vote reveal; they were certain that it's going to be super high. 

If even atobitt, which the entire thesis is basically based off of his novels about "citadel has no clothes" and the HOC series, thought that the voting results would be legit and would show the actual votes counted...

I think it's beyond a shadow of a doubt that these new theories about how they have to lie on the SEC filing (does that make sense to you logically?) is just a desperate attempt.

Besides, if atobitt and the other mods were so incomptent and ignorant that they didn't understand this, how can we trust their other DD?
