Someone in our apartment complex has a big pittie mix that is really sweet but way too overzealous and unaware of his size, so it sometimes scares other dogs/people. Every morning we see them walking, and the owner patiently stops the second his dog starts to pull. Even if it happens every other step. It's good to see that he's putting in the effort to have a well-behaved dog.
