No, Disney originally showed they didn't care about the actual Chinese folklore and are now going back to a closer interpretation. While I agree the actress' comments about Hong Kong were incredibly stupid, insensitive and ignorant that has nothing to do with the movie itself which is far more culturally appropriate.

Also the heroine is still female so not sure what your point is there.
