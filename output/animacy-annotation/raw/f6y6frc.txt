Yeah, and it's even easier to hit them with a nuclear bomb. But we as a society decided that such weapons are too powerful for civilians and not appropriate for self defense because of the high collateral damage and propensity for abuse. The fact that so many gun owners are like you, so reckless and ignorant that they think an AR-15 is appropriate for self defense, only proves that most gun owners are not as responsible and rational as they claim. You are only pushing normal people to the left with this kind of extremist radical nonsense, so congrats.

&gt; Also staring down the barrel of a rifle is far more terrifying even if the perpetrator has a pistol. 

LOL, what a terrible argument. Death is terrifying, period. You think somebody staring down the face of a pistol would go "well, it's not AS scary as a rifle.... why don't I take my chances?" XD that is retarded.
