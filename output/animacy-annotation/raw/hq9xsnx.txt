You are an example of why we can't have nice things. When faced with facts you hide behind the age old racism argument and make personal attacks on the very people that are trying to help you overcome your ignorant and flawed thinking. You defend these animals and there savage beliefs thinking it will somehow make you look smarter and more popular with your peer group (other idiots). But in reality you are just mediocre run-of-the-mill herd sheep. 

Stop smoking the ganji maybe that smokescreen will clear for you.

Rise above your biases and see things for what they truly are.
