&gt; And that has no bearing on the argument of whether or not humans have easier lives today than in the past.

That's a bullshit argument to begin with, others in this post have answered this question splendidly so I don't need to rehash that, instead I made the conscious choice to point out a very common connection between people who like to downplay the pain others feel. It's not all about you, you're just a sample I am using to highlight this stereotype. Ideology does seem to reflect personality and destructively selfish traits.

Go ahead and call me a bigot as if you think using the term has the same meaning.

Also your original comment wasn't some intellectual question looking for answers, you were whining that other people have no right to feel bad when we're supposed to all have great lives because we have phones and space cities and whatever. It was ignorant and stupid and it got yoinked for it.
