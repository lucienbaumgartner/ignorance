I picked 17 because it is above the legal age of consent in 99% of all jurisdictions, while still being morally reprehensible from the theoretical senior citizen and his proposed recalcitrance toward privacy.

If this theoretical senior lived in one of those few jurisdictions with an 18 age of consent, then I would have used that age. Instead, I just went with statistical probability.

It would not at all be statutory rape in most jurisdictions. I'm not sure where you are writing from, but it seems to be an 18 jurisdiction AND astonishingly insular and unaware of the rest of the world.
