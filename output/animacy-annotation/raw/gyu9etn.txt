If you want to call a Homo sapiens at any stage of life an “egg” then you must think of yourself as an “egg,” too, so since you do Mr. Egg, I will think of you accordingly.

A zygote is one cell, made up of two previous haploid gamete cells and those cells are gone once fertilization has occurred.  The first mitosis happens rapidly thereafter, then the second, and so on, and then you have a blastocyst.

None of these stages in humans can be called an “egg” - the egg cell is gone.

Calling a human being a part of one organ of their mother is ludicrously stupid and ignorant of basic scientific fact, Mr. Egg.
