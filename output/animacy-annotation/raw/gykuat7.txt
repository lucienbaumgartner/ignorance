Are you referring to the bot that signs unsigned comments? It doesn't always work. It can also cause an edit conflict if someone is replying to you but the bot has signed the comment in the meantime.  Overall though, it's just a community norm. You're expected to sign your comments to identify yourself. The only reason not to do this would be if you're new and unaware of it, so intentionally not doing so would make you seem like a newb or someone who lacks competence. I will note that it *seems* unnecessary when every other platform out there includes your username in comments automatically, but Wikipedia talk pages are no different from article pages and both are just pages of Wikitext. There have been attempts to move to a structured discussion system but it didn't succeed because talk pages were being used for a lot more than just comments.
