\&gt; If they're really so fucking stupid and ignorant that they genuinely believe the election was stolen 

Here's the problem though, they think exactly the same about people that don't think the election was stolen. But the problem is more complicate than that because every side nowadays think that about the other side. Tribalism is destroying us. How do we start fixing this? How do we fix this? Not by doing what we have been doing for the past few years.  We need to engage in civil discourse so we can finally stop digging this shit hole situation we are in.

Regarding the people that invaded the Capitol yesterday OP's 100% right. These people have no faith in the media because the media repeatedly lied about them for 4 years. They have been disenfranchised and silenced by big tech, shamed constantly and now they have no faith in our electoral system anymore. In their eyes they are finally fighting back. You're an anarchist dude you should be able to see what they are coming from, right?
