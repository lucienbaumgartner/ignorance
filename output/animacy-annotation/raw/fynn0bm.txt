obesity like i said before is a personal choice in most of the cases, and need decades to cause the pathology that led to death. And in this time frame you have to maintain an unhealthy lifestyle. this virus is not  a personal choice and reages on the weakest.     
And just because there is a disease that causes more death does not mean that all the others can be [ignored. ](https://ignored.you)You  are comparing covid deaths with car accidents adn you think that's a good comparison. 

btw i am a medical student so i still have a lot to learn but definitely not from you.

In all other countries social distancing and masks have worked I wonder why there are still hundreds of deaths in the united states every day.

You know what is pointless to talk to a person who thinks 150.000 death in five months are normal and that he is so selfish and ignorant that refuse to wear a simple mask only because is uncomfortable.
