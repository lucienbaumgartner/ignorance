You know you're being ridiculous right? 2 months is more than enough time to reach the minimum threshold of not treating your partner like garbage. Honestly I wouldn't tolerate this behaviour from a housemate, let alone a romantic partner.

He's being rude and ignorant and if he casually disregards the basics of sharing a living space with someone, then OP I would suggest moving out. Coming to agreeable arrangements with your partner is part of being in a relationship and living together, if he isn't willing to do that, he's not capable of living with a partner at all.

Comment about age gaps are a pretty desperate attempts to justify very obvious shitty behaviour.
