Giannis is the least skilled, most unaware and frankly stupidest superstar I've ever seen. He has no idea or plan of what he's doing.

And Milwaukee is the dumbest playoff team I've ever watch. I know a lot of people are blaming the coach and while he definitely deserves some blame, some of the decisions the players have been making are just unbelievably stupid. 

I'm not saying they're throwing the games but they're behaving so goddamn stupid, you wouldn't blame someone for thinking so.
