As a dog trainer, I see it all the time and it’s incredibly discouraging. Personally, I’ve been bit or close to being bit by more labs, german shepherds, chihuahuas, etc., than pitties. There are not bad breeds—some breeds are more inclined to particular behaviors than others but no breed is prone to “aggression.” I personally stay away from just about 95% of the dog related subs because the comments and posts are ignorant and so misinformed, it impacts my mental health as it feels I can’t seem to escape that even at home, away from my work. I hope this and all the other comments help you to raise your spirits and don’t let other uneducated people dictate your joy, especially with your dog&lt;3
(FWIW I have a sweet shepherd/pit mix and people love to cross the street to get away from him which I don’t mind in the slightest.)
