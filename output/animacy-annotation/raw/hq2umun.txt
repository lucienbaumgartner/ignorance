So pissed off. Daughter’s roommate who doesn’t take any of this seriously. She started displaying symptoms earlier this week. Of course didn’t wear a mask anywhere, despite the state issuing a new mandate. My daughter works in healthcare and wears masks and has repeatedly warned the roommate about the dangers of Covid. Told my daughter she went to get tested and it was negative. Daughter came for Christmas, woke up this morning with symptoms. Went immediately to urgent care and got tested. Surprise surprise she’s positive. Truth comes out and roommate never got tested. Daughter wouldn’t have come if the roommate had been honest. Also she would have tested earlier or even been quarantined.  So she has exposed her coworkers and patients, because the roommate was ignorant and selfish. She does wear N95 mask and googles at work. Roommate and roommate’s boyfriend go and get tested. Despite her telling her boyfriend if either test positive and have to quarantine, he would need to pay her bills as she won’t get a paycheck. Boyfriend is positive. Roommate owes the urgent care money and they refuse to see her. Roommate also told my daughter she was vaccinated, now I wonder if that is true. My daughter along with myself and hubby are vaxed and boosted. We’re on vacation until Jan 3rd. Now I get to spend my vacation quarantined. Thankfully we saw family last weekend and it was just us three yesterday.
