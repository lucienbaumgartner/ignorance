“Poast” is not spelled wrong, you’re just old and unaware of this. Hiring a lawyer to speak with police is cool, particularly when they post on social media that they think you’re guilty to influence a mob to bully you into speaking with them without counsel. And he’s not missing, Feds know where he is. He’s in hiding because of people like you who go off half-cocked with ridiculous conclusions.  By all means, speak with police without a lawyer. It’s the smart move. LMFAOOOO
