While this is important, my empathy towards the cause is very limited. All it does is prey on the unaware and non tech-savy people. What I'd like to see more, is more support from corps like starticket, who effectively fuck the ticket market by themselves and are a part of why this is a thing with their shitty infrastructure/customer support.
