I'm probably a bit older than you.  We stood for the pledge, and weren't given the option to do otherwise.

I can recite it from memory to this day.  It didn't really mean anything to me when I was younger.  It was just something they made us do at the start of school.

As I got older, I thought more about the words and what they meant.  I think having kids learn the pledge and get into the habit of showing respect for the flag is overall a good thing for the country.

...which, of course, is why so many leftist educators encourage the opposite.

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. - [*Bill Ivey, Clinton appointee to the chairmanship of the National Endowment for the Arts, in an email to John Podesta in 2016*](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)
