My own personal anecdote:  An acquaintance of mine is super conservative and really pro life. We had a discussion once about Planned Parenthood and he was a 100% against the organization even when I explained  that most of their services involve women's healthcare, sex education, and birth controlâ€¦ and that abortions are 0% funded by the government.  I asked him how we were supposed to help help poor women and girls receive health services and birth control to prevent pregnancies on a large scale.  He said he made donations through his church that went to the cause, but he truly failed to realize what a tiny drop in the bucket his little donation made. But in his mind he was a big hero, helping the poor and helping women with those services. No amount of conversation could convince him of the national need for financial assistance.  So for people like him, of which there are many, their heart might be in the right place, but they are doing basically nothing to solve the problem.  But they are too ignorant and close minded to know better.
