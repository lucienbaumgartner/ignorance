Very true, I wonder what the purpose of the memories would be if they were sent by Eren - and if they aren't remembered / understood by whoever receives them.  It felt very similar to Eren's "dream" in the first chapter before he actually had the Attack Titan, with both of them waking up confused and unaware of what they were just seeing.
