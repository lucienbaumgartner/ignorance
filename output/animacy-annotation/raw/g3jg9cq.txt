Yes, you are in the wrong. BUT ONLY FROM AN *ETIQUETTE* STAND POINT.

When in doubt, always use the highest title if you are unsure. It is better to give someone too much credit than not nearly enough. While, yes, they do teach, a teacher is very below a professor. Whereas, teachers are not professors. Think of it this way, a senior in high school was once in 3rd grade, but that does not make them a 3rd grader now and it would be very rude to call them such. It's the same here. Teachers are what you call someone teaching 12 graders or lower. 

Anyone at the collegiate level is one of these (in order from least to highest academic rank):
Graduate Student aide, Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor.  As you can see, Professor is the highest academic ranking, whereas teacher is not even on here. Teacher is basically below Graduate Student Aide. Teachers only need a 4 year degree, and since Graduate Student Aide requires you to be in graduate school, they are already at a higher academic rank than a teacher. 

So, while it's okay to accidentally call a teacher a professor, etiquette says calling a professor a teacher is extremely belittling, rude, and ignorant.

That said, many actual professors will request you just call them by their 1st name because they're not pretentious. Your best bet in the future is just to ask them what you should call them, or incorrectly call them professor accidentally even if they're not, or refer to them how they address themselves in writing.
