Yeah your right suicide rates are going up everywhere. This world is so fucked I don’t even know where to start.. People are so selfish and ignorant that they don’t even realize what they’re really living in. I know part of the reason people are committing suicide is because you either work a minimum wage job your whole life or spend 4 years and a shit ton of money on college which isnt even a guarantee you like your job or get rich. And now artificial intelligence is coming soon I saw a YouTube video of one of Elon musks car factories awhile ago and It took me a minute to realize why there are almost no people working it’s all ai. No wonder he’s so rich he doesn’t have to pay anybody. Grocery stores are starting to do the same thing too with self-checkout. Life is way to hard
