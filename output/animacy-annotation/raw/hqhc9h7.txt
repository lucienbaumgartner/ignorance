I think then that since I do have a bias towards liking Tim, I'll give him a break on it unless Jack returns. I'd like to believe that Tim was ignorant and unwilling to throw someone he considered a friend (I would assume anyway) under the bus based on an article, some rumors and some drama. 

Luke, however, I think made his feelings on the matter perfectly clear even if he didn't necessarily say it outright.
