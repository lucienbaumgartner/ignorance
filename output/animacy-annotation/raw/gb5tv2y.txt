I'm past just calling these people stupid and unaware of the information that has been public knowledge about trump for decades. I'm at the point where everyone who still supports him are traitors to their country and supporting trump is a treasonous act.

I don't want a civil war but we are basically 2 countries now. The blue states pay into the federal coffers and the red states take that money in the form of welfare.

The only hope we have is that if/when Biden wins, most of the hard-core trump supporters will forget he even exists and will deny ever supporting him. It's the only way that we can avoid some serious civil unrest if Biden wins
