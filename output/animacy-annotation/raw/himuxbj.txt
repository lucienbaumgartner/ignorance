It could be any number of things. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, here is my guess:

It was a passing, flirty comment. People are sexual. They like to tease each other. They always will. In mature adults, it’s not possessive or presumptuous, just testing the waters and learning a little about you by how you react. I really doubt we’ll ever get passed sexuality in professional work environments entirely. You would have to cut away so much of yourself.

I’m a gardener and I work with three women. We don’t have the same sterile concept of professionalism that offices usually adopt to appease the lawyers. There’s more or less some sexuality communicated in any conversation, maybe excepting when something has to be communicated urgently, like “You’re doing that wrong, it needs to be done this way, or we’ll never finish.”

But we are able to easily police each other if the vibe isn’t mutual. We just show disinterest or aversion and it cleans up immediately. It’s punishment enough.

But, I really don’t know the guy you are referring to, or the situation. It could be all sorts of things going on, and you’ve only communicated a single literal sentence without any feeling attached to it. Going conspiracy mode, it could be

1.	He’s a bitter man impulsively flashing cruelty.
2.	He’s misogynistic and takes women being compulsively catty for granted.
3.	Light hearted teasing.
4.	You may be inexperienced socially and became a bit fearful at the uncertainty.
5.	He may be immature and unaware of how unreceptive you were.

I can’t pretend to know. Maybe it did cross a line. Maybe it didn’t. Maybe the answer is more obvious than I realize, but, consider finding a way of life that isn’t dependent on knowing things that can’t be know.
