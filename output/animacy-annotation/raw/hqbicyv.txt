That girl should have her own show (Kourtney) 
Keeping-Stuck with a Kardashian. That girl is stuck in ever sinking quicksand. And she acts so fervently pious, when she is completely unaware and delusional. She enjoys being the “beeeotch” of the family bc all other seats are taken…the good ones. So she revels in the “anti-establishment” factor of her position in the family. She thinks it’s edgey  and mysterious  and we all watch and think it is an perpetual infantile temper tantrum. If I was Kris, I would give that D- attraction of a daughter, the boot, for the effort she has to beg people to book her for anything. Kris can’t POO$H ;-) this insane $hit on us and call her anything but cray. 😵‍💫🙄Kourtney please move off the grid. I am tired of you. Skidattt.
