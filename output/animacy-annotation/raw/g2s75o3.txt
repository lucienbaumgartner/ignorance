Well yes, but not all people will enjoy being accountants. You basically just said "Yeah some people might be forced to enter numbers into a calculator for 8 hours a day for the rest of their lives and still make less than people with a more desirable position, but some people are fine with it, so it's perfectly fine". Do you honestly not see how dishonest and ignorant that is? Sure, some jobs need to be done. But at least compensate them well enough.
