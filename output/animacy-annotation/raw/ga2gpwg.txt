Musk has a tendency to present himself as an expert well outside his field though, and people believe him because he's famous for being smart.  

Neurolink for example is absolute bullshit.  The way he talks about it demonstrates little comprehension of neuroscience and just how sophisticated the brain is and how frankly unrefined our understanding of it is.  A large percentage of his endeavors are pure science fiction that Rogan's show humors as legitimate. 

I don't have a huge problem with Rogan on the whole (he is bagreat interviewer) and don't think Musk is an example Rogan's show at it's worst (he's not so much a fraud, just egotistical and unaware of his shortcomings), but Rogan does have a tendency to give an unchallenged voice to bullshit artists and bunk peddlers.  Open mindedness is great, but ideas and ideals still need to be challenged to cut to the underlying truth.
