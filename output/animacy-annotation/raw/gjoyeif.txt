Put the 6 in Int or Wis, because a surprisingly burly and charming little lizard knight who is also naive and ignorant of worldly things will be great fun for your entire gaming table.

(Being easily fooled or misled is also an excellent way to play a strict by-the-book fairness and rules type, because it doesn't wall off sneaking and double-dealing as options for the rest of the party, it just means that the Cunning Plan (tm) needs to include a cover story to fool you into going along with it.)
