You nephews truly don't know anything about the league.  

From [Rule No. 12, Section B, subsection 3](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/):  
&gt; "A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screenerâ€™s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. **The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.**"
