just give up.  OP is just auto downvoting as is the army of ignorant fools who don't even understand the economic system they like to blame for unemployment and poverty and rain and wet farts.

The notion that the economy is a pie is so insanely stupid and ignorant that if it's taking you more than one post to explain reality, it's because they are either dumb as a post or they are the type of person who, when faced with opinions that disagree with their ignorant feelings, just hold onto their weak premise for dear life and jump into non sequitor tangents, shout bigotry, or generally misrepresent your position.
