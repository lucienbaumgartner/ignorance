I don't know where you hang out or what you attract, but I know plenty of lovely women of many different shapes and backgrounds. 
But, if you are not attracted to Latinas, overweight or not, in behalf of all Latinas in San Antonio, allow me to say: THANK GOD!!!!
Your comment is ignorant and vulgar.


OP, when you get to San Antonio join some meetup groups based on your interests. Also, join a gym if you're into working out. Lots of nice parks in San Antonio to go walking, jogging, biking. 
Are you religious? Churches are another place to meet others.  
There are plenty of volunteer opportunities where you might make friends.
