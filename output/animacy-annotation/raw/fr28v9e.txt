Agree 100% with everything above.  I hate the “heroes” label for most things we hear it attached to.

However, if you’ve never dealt with life/death decision making in real time, you might now have an appreciation for the level of responsibility involved.  That’s not an excuse, but it’s a reason that people given such power must be carefully trained and closely monitored.  I’m not at a all a fan of our current militarized police force, and there’s a lot wrong with policing today in my opinion, but the claim that most are pieces of shit is just so inflammatory and ignorant that it drowns out reasonable discourse to improve the situation.
