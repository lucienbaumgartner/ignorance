Shut the fuck up, it's literally right in the Wikipedia article you linked.

&gt;increasing headway leads to diminishing the capacity of the travel lanes, increasing the congestion

Now let's go one further, and look at the definition of [traffic headway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headway) 

&gt;Headway (or frequency) is the distance between vehicles in a transit system measured in time or space. The minimum headway is the shortest such distance or time achievable by a system without a reduction in the speed of vehicles. 

Booyah, bitch. You're so arrogant, and ignorant, that you had to stew over this for a day, then come back and make a fool out of yourself.

You can't even grasp the simple concept of how stop waves actually work. This is simple shit, dude, but instead of at least trying to understand why creating several fucking gaps actually makes congestion worse, you're taking it as a person attack on manual cars, you absolute fucking child.
