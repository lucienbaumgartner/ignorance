i definitely relate, i’ve felt it since middle school and unfortunately it continued into college. i’ve gotten rid of social media for a few months already (instagram, snapchat, twitter) and it helps me to not see any of that stuff anymore. idk it kinda feels better for me to be disconnected and unaware of what they’re doing
