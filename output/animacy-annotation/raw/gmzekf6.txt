Privilege? That’s a strong assumption. This is the problem- When someone says something that others disagree with you get labeled as “privileged”  and “ignorant.”  That type of labeling just shows that you don’t even care to have a civil discussion. I have said MULTIPLE times that Rachael needs to be held accountable and apologize. What she did is wrong. How is it ignorant and privileged for me  to say that  peoples responses are rude. No   HUMAN deserves to be dragged down like how she is when we haven’t even heard from her. Again, I hope she makes the right choice does but then again it probably won’t be “good enough.”
