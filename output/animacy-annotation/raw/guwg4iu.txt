The issue I have with asmongold is that he thinks he’s a highly intelligent individual. I’m not bashing the guy, and frequently enjoy his content. However; by defending this emby guy, it makes him look misinformed and ignorant. Of course the world isn’t fair, of course streamers profit from streaming GGGs game. That’s not the issue. People waited weeks and put their own time and money (some spending thousands) into this game, and when it comes to launch day, they are treated like their time and money meant nothing. Asmongold is hardly in the POE community, but as soon as he shows interest in a new league, he gets treated like a king. Idk, i feel like everyone should be on a fair playing field, not just people who have a few thousand watching their stream.
