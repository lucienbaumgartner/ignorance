Yes, I think so. Some people really are true believers, and women are often the harshest enforcers of religious doctrine. You can certainly be both a true believer and deeply miserable, but lots of people worldwide live in situations that would seem terrible to us in the West, particularly the women. I think it’s probably a lot easier to be happy when your ignorant and unaware of *how* you’ve been oppressed or abused. I think NoLongerQuivering’s story of leaving her husband is a great representation of this. Knowledge really is sometimes misery, even when it can be simultaneously empowering.
