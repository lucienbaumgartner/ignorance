I get that it's a joke. It's a joke which rhetorically says that in other situations where a cop has shot someone unjustly, they were defending themselves in the long run; effectively ignoring the fact that the shooter here was, obviously, not at all innocent, and still posed a huge threat to the safety of others. It ridicules those that acknowledge the presence of immoral and abusive police officers. 

To make that comment means they were either aware of this implication, generalizing this situation with the rest of the cases of police brutality; or they are just so socially unaware and stupid that they understand none of this at all, and have no clue how satire works. The same goes for you all.
