But in your example the fear wouldn't be death. It would be fear of failure and consequences. 

I'm not afraid of my own death, but I hope it will be painless.

I'm not afraid of the death of people close to me, because every reason why I could fear their death is selfish and ignorant of their own thoughts, but I hope they will die in peace when their time comes to an end.

I'm not afraid of strangers dying, because frankly they die every day and their deaths have no or very little impact on my life. Death is all around us, just as much as life is. Fearing death would be fearing life, because you could encounter death while living. 

You have to detach death from other fears, because it will make the fears stronger. Disentangling different fears is sometimes difficult, but it helps to overcome some of them and strengthens your mind.
