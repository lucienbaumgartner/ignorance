You do know that people consider American Republicans to be equally as stupid, if not more, right? Thankfully I’m Canadian and don’t have to deal with your nonsense, at least directly (I’m sure you think we’re all a bunch of communists though without knowing the true meaning of that word). You claim to be “centrist” but it’s clear you are anything but. Centrists don’t base their identity on political affiliation because they can see both sides and baselessly insult anyone else who differs from them even marginally. I mean this sincerely but you really need to come up with some other debate tactics as it is not doing you any favours. Also, Mariam Webster Dictionary did update their definition of racism to include systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic and political advantage of another so that commenter was not wrong. You are just unaware and unwilling to learn/look beyond your own biases, neither of which are hallmarks of intellectual superiority. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism
