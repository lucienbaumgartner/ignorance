Oof I feel you. I'm a 4th gen singaporean Indian myself but a few years back it was still common for Chinese kids to be taught by their parents that us Indians are the "apu-nehneh" boogeyman that will kidnap them if they don't eat their veggies.

We're a multiracial society for years but apart from being tolerant and not having racial riots, we're still brimming with micro aggression

It's also stupid because whites here are not as uncommon as black people in rural China would be.

 But alas, in Singapore you can grow up not needing to speak English and not needing to see any other race as long as you're in the majority. I've had fellow mates during conscription who were genuinely unaware and oblivious, and also very amazed when they learnt more about malay and tamil culture (and that there were more food than the stereotypical ones they were led to believe).

At least younger millennial and gen z are starting to be more aware, curious, and inclusive of other races and cultures, then their older counterparts

So sorry you had to ensure it
