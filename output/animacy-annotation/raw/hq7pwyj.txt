&gt;LOL just throwing everything at the wall to see what might stick huh.

New Atheist leaders like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris have [blatantly engaged in imperialism ](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/12/new-atheism-old-empire/). And you are blatantly following I’m their foot steps. Or what do you think it’s called when you take minorities from a different culture than yours and say ‘you dumb little savages need to get civilized and stop worshipping your sky daddies” ? 

Or did you just not put two seconds of thought into the implications of your positions? 

&gt;I don’t live in the Mid-east.

This statement is a global statement not. 

&gt;I choose to live my life without automatic respect for religious systems **that** 

See that is as far as we need to go to find the part you’re not thinking about. Here you are making a conditional statement, as in, there are religious systems that do not meet the condition for you to disrespect. You know they exist, but you chose to disrespect all of them anyway. Repeatedly. 

&gt;some westerners on the other side of the world 

Again, your ignorant and bigoted statements had *global* implications.
