I cradle my head as the memories continue to flash across my eyes. Blood. Fire. Screams. Shrapnel. All of it mesh into this undefinable blur of images and emotions and senses. It overwhelms my entire being, leaving me to feel like a puppet who's strings have been cut, nothing to lead it and powerless to stop.

Hell, I don't even remember going down.

Wait....

I went down?

I walked out of the dorm rooms, out of the dorm itself and into the night. The air was cool and crisp, like what you would expect from the Winters. I would've shivered if I wasn't already.

I rubbed my face over and over again, vainly trying to get rid of the visions, only for them to return over and over again. My face was already a mess. covered in sweat and marks, a keepsake of my night terrors.

I sit down on the bench in the courtyard and look above, watching the night sky twinkle carelessly. Oh how I wish I can be like that, unaware and free.

"I will never be normal, would I?" I ask the sky. They reply by twinkling, "Yeah, I thought so."

I place my cane across my lap as I tap a small melody against the body, the wood creating a symphony of taps and scrapes and thunks. I look straight ahead as I play, trying to forget.

My mother's face, smiling

My mother's face, covered in blood.

Everything hurt, yet nothing was hurting.

I notice a person coming out of the women's dorms. At first I thought it was Tanaka, but she was walking so it can't be.

I sigh, watching the woman walk. It was the walk of someone who's carrying the world on their shoulders, the walk of someone who has seen too much darkness in the world.

I take a mental picture of her silhouette against the clear skies. I place my cane back beside me and pull out my journal. I flip to an empty page, and write.

And write and write.

Hopefully she doesn't notice.
