That's nice and all for the very few who are actually doing the responsible thing. Except that a lot of them are NOT properly quarantining themselves. 

Relatives boss for example who just came back from Mexico for leisure had to quarantine and the first day he's back it's been, "just working at night" when no one is in the shop.. infecting everything potentially without sterilizing, which is so beyond fucked up. 

I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy for a bunch of children who want to vacation and possibly kill not just the only family I have left but other people as well.

The ones dumb enough to vacation now most likely would not quarantine themselves properly.

While responsible people are sacrificing their time with loved ones by not travelling to make sure no one else catches it and dies or recieves the lasting side effects from it..we've got a large amount of people who see nothing wrong.. and quite a few more than there should be that are okay with the weak and old ones dying off.

Incredibly selfish and ignorant of them.
