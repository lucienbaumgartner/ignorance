This is reddit so I'll get crucified for this but, is it really so bad that companies are relying on foreign nations to police and implement their own labor laws? If they're lobbying foreign governments to suppress labor rights then that's clearly evil, but why is Apple to be held accountable for the failure of China to protect Chinese workers from Chinese companies? If China has determined that these practices are fine what place is it for Americans, whom reddit considers morally deplorable and ignorant of the world, to disagree? Are we really supposed to be the global moral compass?

The CCP should be who is policing their companies, not American companies. Their failure to do this is squarely on them.
