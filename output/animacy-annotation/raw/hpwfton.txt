Assuming that that is the complete summation of all of rap/ hip-hop feels ignorant and disingenuous. Especially considering I prefer the more lyrically dense an poetic forms of rap. I can name at least 25 well-known rappers that have consistently made positive hip-hop and sold well but I guess Kanye west doesn't count as positive? Nas,  COMMON and Lupe fiasco must not rap then.. Or KRS-one, mos Def, GZA, RZA, Black Thought, the roots, Outkast, Goodie Mobb, etc must not be famous enough to represent hip-hop..I'm sorry the only rap you've heard is Jeezy and migos but it's not hip-hops fault for the Dunning-Kruger certain people seem to experience after listening to just a few rap songs(or any song of any unfamiliar genre really), if that.

Honestly I don't think a lot of people who dislike hip-hop are even familair enough with, or educated enough in it, to ACCURATELY critique it in conversations like this. Like if I could judge all of Rock by the antics of Ozzie Osborne or Marilyn Manson. Same people swear they open-minded tho
