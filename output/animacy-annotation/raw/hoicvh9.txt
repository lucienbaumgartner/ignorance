Beware: this side effect for me continuously built until I quit.
Now I'm overly sensitive and uncomfortably aware of emotional vibes- including those of others.

I'm so overwhelmed anymore with social situations, it's given me extreme social withdrawal from even opening emails or responding to texts... 

This is me personally- but I noticed the numbing, then stopped to notice it at all, then became apathetic and reclusive and unaware of others emotions, I began to dissociate and finally upon quitting, I slowly have been handling (not well, most times than not) a process of getting overwhelmed with others and my own feelings and have been adjusting to being able to newly recognize that people around me at all times have thoughts and feelings and opinions and reactions. It's been a long journey into an empathetic outpouring of new grounds within my anxieties.
