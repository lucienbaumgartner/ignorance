I’ve seen this a few times on reddit. He was mentally handicapped and unaware of where he was. This poor guy simply had no clue what was going on. 

Not saying he didn’t deserve it unfortunately, but a lot of people are jumping to conclusions and calling him an ass. Please look into odd things you see on the internet, there’s usually a real life explanation.
