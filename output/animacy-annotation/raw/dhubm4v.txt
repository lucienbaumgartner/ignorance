Why is it that leftist are completely void of critical thinking. So anti freedom? Equal outcome by any means? 

 The donald is a fan page, genius. Its for high energy. We have "ask thedonald" for discussion.  This seems to be a problem for equal outcome leftist to comprehend. Crooked Hillarys fan page, Tyrannical Obama's fan page does the same shit. But news, worldnews and politics? The bias and double standards of the sites admins? 

 This site was created by someone who believed in free speech. He would be ashamed of whats happening and the totalitarian left. 

 This goes past reddit. Its all of social media, hollywood and msm. Everyone thinks theres a far right. Truth is, you all are extreme left. Everyone, even center looks far right from way over there. 

Edit: funny you say "unaware".        

Bill Ivey (national endowment of the arts board member) to John Podesta.    

    “And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly."


Psst, you are just the type of useful idiot they were talking about in their "private position".
