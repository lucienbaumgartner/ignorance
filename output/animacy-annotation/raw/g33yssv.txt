I will try and ease your fears the best I can. Tornados suck, I'm in Arizona so I can't relate there. But literally all they do is hook up a couple of monitors to your chest (which don't hurt at all), ask you which arm you do better with IVs (I had no idea so I chose my non dominant in case it was sore- it wasn't), poke a needle in you, and attach a little tube into it. The poke doesn't really hurt, the tube in your vein kinda stings ngl but like a 3/10. After that, they're probably just gonna finish getting ready for the operation. In my case, I was completely unaware and out cold before I realized it. I woke up feeling like I had the absolute best sleep ever 45 minutes later with gauze in my mouth. It's okay my friend! Promise.
