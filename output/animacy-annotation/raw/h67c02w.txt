All I have really heard you say is "you are wrong" or "bad argument" or "you're a doomer". 

I have shared information, data, and evidence. A lot of this is still being studied, and anyone stating otherwise is just uneducated and unaware of what is going on. 

The fact that you literally do not understand the basic difference between vaccine efficacy against symptomatic illness and vaccine efficacy against transmission to others...is rather alarming. It really does flag that you don't understand English well (ie. don't understand what "transmission" means in this context), or just don't understand how these studies work.
