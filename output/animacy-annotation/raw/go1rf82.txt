&gt; So then you would have the son of a Jewish Holocaust survivor bake a birthday cake with swastikas and Adolf Hitler’s name on it

Where did you get this information lol? I think you misunderstand the way the law is. Certain protections are in place and certain are not, and it’s good that it is this way. For example asking a black baker to bake a cake saying “I hate Black people” on it would also be a legitimate reason to turn down the services 

&gt; I’d like to think that we as a society would be able to let the free market take over and screw over anyone who refuses to serve others 

You may like to think that, but you’d be wrong, naive, and ignorant of history. 

&gt; I’d at the very least like to try

I wouldn’t

&gt; If it turns out that it still can’t work because people are assholes, then sure we can go back in the other opposite direction   

Very comforting for members of historically oppressed groups. Certainly made me much more comfortable! Yeah no ... not happening 

Those laws were placed with the intention of them remaining in force for good, not until you decide racism has been defeated lol.
