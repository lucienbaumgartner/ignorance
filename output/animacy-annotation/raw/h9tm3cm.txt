Maverick Hunter X. The PSP remake of the first Mega Man X game.

I like it a lot and think that it's a fun experience (it uses one of my favorite games of all time as a basis after all) but sweet jesus does it miss many of the things that made the original so **perfect** in both gameplay and story.

For starters, the game feels heavier in general. There always seems to be a little delay and "weight" to every single action: walking, dashing , jumping etc. and some moves had their properties greatly altered by this and feel less effective as a result (I swear the shotgun ice trick to get the heart tank on Kuwanger's stage is impossible in this version). Not a deal-breaker but noticeable if you played the original game extensively like I did.

Now for the one thing I absolutely despise... It's how they moved upgrades and armor pieces around for the sake of being different than the SNES version while, in the original game, they were strategically placed in specific places to accomodate the game's design.

The Leg upgrade is meant to be found in Chill Penguin's stage. A.K.A the stage that's immediately highlighted once you finish the tutorial. A.K.A probably the easiest level in the game and the one that most people are likely to start with. A.K.A the stage that, once beaten, changes Flame Mammoth's stage so that the lava is frozen making it easier to get the heart tank once you get there.

What did the remake do? Hide the most useful upgrade in the entire game in an area that's obscured by the camera on a stage that they will most likely visit **HALFWAY** through the game. That means that an unexperienced player could easily go through the entire game without the leg upgrade.

It's not a "nitpick", it's stupid design.And it's repeated throughout.And it could potentially ruin the experience for newbies.And longtime fans didn't care for it either.And you get the point.

What is a nitpick on the other hand is the fact that Vile's boss fight has a health bar and you're supposed to defeat him like a normal boss. Not game-breaking stuff but it did kinda ruin the whole "puny character fighting unbeatable behemoth" thing they had going in the original X. Granted, he still ends up kicking your ass but it doesn't feel the same...

The new continuity is a mixed bag. Loved Vile's character, loved the Dr. Light scenes, loved the fact that they actually bothered to explain some things about the world the characters are living in... Kinda "meh" about everything else.

I feel like they made the idea of "maverick" so much more confusing. Is it a virus that makes reploids go crazy or is it just a term to define all those robots who oppose coexisting with humans a la Magneto's Brotherhood? Are the robots sick and unaware of their actions or are they merely agreeing with Sigma's schemes, making them a lot less sympathetic and likeable? I think the game made it a lot more complicated than it needed to be, the original explanation was simpler but ten times more effective.

Not a fan of how Zero wasn't the one responsible for Sigma's corruption as I thought it was an amazing way to link the X series with the classic games, showing how Wily continues to be (indirectly) a pain in the ass for the Blue Bomber of the future.

I could go on for a long time but this is already way longer than it needs to be lmao.

Again, it's still a great game but I didn't like how they purposely ruined some things just for the sake of being different than the original game. Should've just sticked closer to the original, in my opinion.
