These posts always confuse me. Are they just young kids who don't know anything about the real world, or are they adults who are really so naive and unaware of what legalization has actually meant? This guys says he lives in California, yet hasn't seen the effects? How is that possible?

All the hippies and kids thought legalization would mean freely available weed for anyone and everyone, that quality would skyrocket and the black market would die because selling drugs is bad! Unless you get permission from the government, then it's, like, totally awesome, dude!

Seriously, who the fuck thought granting government the power to pick and choose drug dealers was a good idea? A bunch of fucking burnout potheads, I guess lol.
