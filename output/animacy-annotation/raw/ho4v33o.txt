Likely you were getting in the way of his upcoming drug deal by sitting in the middle of his tranaction place. You were too unaware and unperceptive to his nice way of informing you to get out; hence the exaggerated belligerence. Learn a lesson from this incident. Are you allowed out at one am? Yes. Is it wise to be out at one am? No. Nothing good comes from "hanging out" in the wee hours of the night in parking lots
