You’re a dumbass. The people are supposed to test it? Or are you just entirely ignorant and unaware of clinical trials to render something safe and peer reviewed.. it’s the peoples’ job to investigate and test substances on our own bodies’ when we can investigate hepatotoxicity and other things in isolated lab conditions? Grow the fuck up and get a degree you dumb monkey
