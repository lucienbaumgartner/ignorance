As an American who has travelled quite extensively... I would say that those people are incredibly misguided and ignorant of history.

There's this old saying we've tossed around in political science: "I've met foreigners who are die-hard Americans, and I've met American citizens who are not Americans at all." 

It's a creedal nation. It's not based on race or gender or ethnicity or religion (albeit some people try to, wrongfully, make it so). It's based on a creed, a fundamental idea as to what a government should and should not be, and the rights and responsibilities a citizen has. 

I'm not blind to America's faults. Not at all. And it's important that we recognize and correct them. But anyone who says that America is evil does not really understand the principals and guiding ideas that the nation was founded on.
