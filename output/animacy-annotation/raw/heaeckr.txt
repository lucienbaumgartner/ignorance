1) You made a good point, maybe he was on his 7th day of being awake and was completely delirious and unaware of his actions.  Unfortunately, that doesn’t excuse his behavior or make his threats any less threatening.  At best, it’ll maybe help him receive mandated treatment instead of extensive jail/prison time.

2) My “blind and deaf” line was regarding if he was blind and dead and the police knew he was **blind and deaf**, not high on meth.  Meth makes people have a higher propensity for violence, not less, so I’d never argue that being high on meth makes the cops somehow responsible for his actions.  That would be an odd thing for anyone to claim.

3) Forcing police off you and trying to flee when you’re under arrest and have already verbalized threats to officers lives when they haven’t been able to ensure you aren’t armed is a great reason to use a dog to stop a active violent criminal.  

Don’t be an active criminal threat if you don’t want to be treated like an active criminal threat.
