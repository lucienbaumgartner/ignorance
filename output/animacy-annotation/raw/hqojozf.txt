For me it was backwards. There wasn't a reason NOT to believe, there just wasn't a reason TO believe in the first place. I grew up in Eastern Europe, and religion was frowned upon during that time. It was seen as backward, ignorant and small-minded. So I was never indoctrinated into it at an early age. And once I had the ability to think on my own, any attempts at brainwashing with that nonsense just wouldn't take.

But there was one thing that really helped. The church near one of the places I lived was converted into a museum of history of religion and atheism. It was basically packed chock-full of examples of religion - an Egyptian mummy, a Pagan sacrifice altar, and a space suit, all packed together into one museum. With a Foucault pendulum hanging off a steeple for live demonstrations that the Earth is spinning. And this was in a church. Sacrilege? Maybe, but effective. Made it almost impossible to be converted, when you saw side by side so many examples of conflicting religions (Christians, ancient Egyptians, Norsemen, Pagans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines, etc). It was impossible all of them were right. And it was immediately demonstrated how many of them were wrong, scientifically (planet is round, planet spins, and how Catholic church punished Galileo for it). And this made it impossible to believe in Jeebus, because the whole thing is utterly ludicrous. 

So I wasn't so much TURNED atheist, as I was inoculated against religion and not exposed to it to get infected before my brain was ready to fight off its influence.
