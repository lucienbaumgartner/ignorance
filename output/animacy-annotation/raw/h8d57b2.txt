You can apply that to any addiction.  I bet alcoholics would be surprised by how much better they would feel if they didn't drink so much.  I bet hard drug users would be surprised how much better they would feel if they didn't have to shoot up hard drugs ever few hours just to feel normal.

In reality they wouldn't be surprised.  They know what they're doing to their body is bad.  They know if they could just quit what they're addicted to they would feel better.  That how addictions work.  You want to quit but you are so dependent on that substance that you can't.  As someone who used to weigh 675 pounds I know that all too intimately.  I used to wake up eating until I went to sleep.  I knew the damage I was doing to my body.  It wasn't until I started having major health problems that I got serious about getting healthier.  I've shed over 200 lbs but I still struggle every day.  Unlike other addictions I can't stop eating cold turkey like you can with alcohol or other drugs.  Almost every street corner sells the thing I'm addicted to in the form of fast food.  Coukd you imagine if there were as many liquor stores as there are mcdonalds orburger kings?  Could you imagine if there were store that sold coke or meth on every street corner in every city in the world?  That's what overweight people deal with every day.  Not only are they there but they market and price their food in such a way that it attracts people to come in and indulge in their unhealthy food every day.  How many times have you seen a commercial for fast food and then you go out and grab some?  What if there were commercials for cocaine or meth tempting rug addicts to go out and use?  How is this acceptable?

To say that overweight people would be surprised how better they would feel if they lost weight is just insensitive and ignorant of the struggles overweight people face every day.
