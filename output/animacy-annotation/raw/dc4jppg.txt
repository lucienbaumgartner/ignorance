I see where you're coming from, but i personally disagree with it. I totally get that Ned's lie and him shutting her questioning down so harshly can be easily taken as cruel and injecting more of a rift between them and not giving her closure. However, I think you're incorrect with how it could have been handled. Like you mentioned, telling Catelyn the truth could change the relationship dynamic between her and Jon and introducing possible suspicion. But the other option of lying to her and giving her a false name doesn't necessarily give her closure, it could actually have the reverse impact and spurred on additional questions. "What was she like, did you love her, what happened to her, etc". Lies tend to have the risk having to make up additional lies to support them and each new lie becomes harder to remember and weakens the original story. He could getaway with saying a telling Robert it was "Wylla" because Robert wasn't invested in the truth and the story ended there. For Ned the cold hard truth is the 1st, 2nd and 3rd priority was keeping Jon's secret...even from Jon himself who i could argue had more of a right to know. Telling Catelyn or making up lies and stories only complicates an already difficult situation. Keeping her unaware and resentful is price he had to bear, and he as far as i can tell, he accepted it.
