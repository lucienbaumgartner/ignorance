It's offensive because you can and I have clearly destroyed a dude. Flank him super sneakily shoot him in the back, shoot him in the back again. Its ok he's camping hard and unaware of you. Shoot him again, and again, and again. Two clips gone, he doesn't know your here. He shifts his aim and shoots the wall with a pistol, you die. Your kill cam shows you doing the fuckin mokarina in the middle of the map.
