I had the flu, actual tested and it was the "swine flu" back in the day.

I got pneumonia.  It damaged my lungs so much I got pneumonia several years in a row until I got the pneumonia shot, and pandemic hit and we started wearing masks.  I plan to wear one during flu season forever.

I had auditory hallucinations and got so dehydrated because I did not have the strength to drag myself to the kitchen.  It was an open plan house, I had the bedroom closet to the kitchen, partner found me in the floor halfway there.

Real flu is a dangerous illness.  If you had "just" the flu I would recommend having help, taking care. Seeing a doctor after several days of high fever.

If you had the flu, and had spent seven days with fevers, and had relatives saying it was no bug deal, I would offer to tell them off for you, letting you pick between mild chiding and full blown WTF, pretend to be a decent human being for five minutes level of chiding.

You have every right to be upset having vivid and being treated they way they are treating you.

Just, you also would if it was the flu also.

They are ignorant, and awful.
