I mean yeah some of what he says is a bit exaggerated for sure, but most of what he is saying isn’t far off. You literally can’t say shit against the movement without being called a racist and having people try to ruin your life. It’s out of control. 

People have tried (and in some cases succeeded) ruining multiple people’s lives over instagram posts. People are being fired or their sponsorships are being pulled for liking tweets. College campuses break out in violent protest when even a moderately conservative speaker comes to town.  People lose job offers or school acceptances because of posts or liking tweets.  That is literally insane and it’s exactly what he’s talking about. 

People like you are part of the problem because you are so partisan and ignorant that you can’t see what is happening all across the country every single day. You complain that the police are being too violent with protestors and rioters, and talk about how they’re suppressing free speech, but then when it comes from the other side you’re suddenly okay with it. You are gaslighting anyone who disagrees, telling them they’re conspiracy theorists or radicals.  This is fascist strategy 101

Apologies if you weren’t being sarcastic, but I’m assuming you were.
