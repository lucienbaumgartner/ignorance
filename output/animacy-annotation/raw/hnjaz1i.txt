&gt; This is exactly contributing to almost all of the longstanding problems the city has and people are simply choosing to be shortsighted and ignorant of it.

The people in power aren't ignorant of it, they know exactly what they are doing. The citizens are ignorant I suppose. 

Most everyone that's looked into it knows it's a ponzi scheme. There are literally youtubers making tons of videos on the subject.

We are a society of short sighted human being lead by politicians that are even more short sighted due to their 4 year long terms. It's no wonder long term problems like sustainable city growth, pensions, and climate change (fundamentally 20 year + problems) are out of grasp of the general population.
