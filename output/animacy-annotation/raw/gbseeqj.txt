Hi OP! Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! I was a bride in June this year, and I want you to know that it is in no way selfish to express your wants and needs for YOUR wedding to your future wife. While I did most of the planning, every decision for the day was communicated to and okay’d by my husband. It’s your collective day as a couple, and one that should be remembered and cherished as a celebration for just the two of you. 

It seems notable that future BIL hasn’t made his feelings about the rejection clear, and at 22 he’s likely too young, inexperienced, and unaware of how that move would look to others. Maybe you and your fiancé can have a conversation with him collectively to help him understand your position as a couple. Surely future BIL can surely find another time in the next few months to pop the question with family present- the holidays are coming up after all. 

This is your first hurdle as a couple in showing complete solidarity for one another. I do think it is time for your fiancé to get involved in de-escalating the scenario with HER family. She needs to communicate that this is a joint decision that she fully supports. You should not be fielding those calls- if it were me and mine I would be picking up his cell to handle it and telling my family exactly where to shove it. 

Whatever happens, just know that weddings are stressful for everyone, and the most important part is being married at the end of the day. Good  luck to you and your future wife! I wish you both a lifetime of love and happiness.

Edit: some words for clarity
