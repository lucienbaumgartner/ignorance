Make sure you know the labour laws in the area you will be so that you can advocate for yourself. In some places grooms are considered farm workers, others they aren't, and in a lot of places there are different rules around wages that include room/board. In my area anyone who works in the "breeding and boarding" of horses legally has to be paid minimum wage. I didn't know that until I got taken advantage of by a shady barn owner and fired when I questioned why he only paid me $350 for six weeks of work. And make sure you read carefully and get a copy of any paperwork/contracts/agreements you sign, and that they include your wage. 

The majority of barn owners are great, but unfortunately there are a barn owners that will take advantage of grooms. Most bank on the fact that grooms tend to be young and ignorant of their rights. So protect yourself and make sure you know what you are entitled to, and take action to make sure you get it.
