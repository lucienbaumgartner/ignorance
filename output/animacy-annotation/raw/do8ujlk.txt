Dude, are you a sheep? Can you even think for yourself?? I just gave you a link and specific instructions on how to find the emails. I really don't want to resort to your bullshit insults, but you are making it DIFFICULT. 


Here is one more round of easy to follow instruction: 1. Go to http://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com

2. Click on the GREEN button that says "Top 100 Leaks." 


3. Look at bullet point #6 for links to leaks on making citizens more unaware and compliant. (This is what they've done to YOU with their propaganda.) 


4. Look at bullet points #18-19 for MULTIPLE LINKS to cables referring to the DNC's rigging against Bernie Sanders. 


5. Take the time to peruse the other 97 bullet points because you obviously know nothing about this election whatsoever. 



And 6. Leave me the fuck alone :) and enjoy your day and the premier!!!
