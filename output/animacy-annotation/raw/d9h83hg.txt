I don't think he's being misinterpreted here. He has advocated for an unaware and compliant citizenry, here in the email and before, by using their political games and he's lamenting the idea that trump is beating them at it. If he is criticizing the practice of maintaining a certain class of unaware, compliant citizen, I think it's only because he thinks the tactic no longer works.
