The women in my church believed that the more you thought about sex and were promiscuous the bigger your boobs would get. I was the only person in my family with bigger boobs and everyone immediately assumed I was promiscuous. I was a super sheltered naive teenager, but there were so many mothers in the church who said they didn't want their sons around me because of this.


It's so ignorant and toxic. I'm glad you're able to embrace your body and wear what you want now.
