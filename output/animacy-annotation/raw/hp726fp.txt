Don't you believe there's an alternative these days to total deconstruction and massive death and suffering of it's citizenry? 

Trump or anyone like him is NOT and never will be the answer to this problem. You're trading a democracy in need of major maintenance with a narcissistic wannabe dictator with a thirst for money and no morals, and for what? To throw a wrench in the spokes? Have you forgotten all of the good that had been done around here?

2016-2020 only makes America look foolish and ignorant of what it takes to sack up and do what's right and just. We have the tools to fix this bullshit and it doesn't involve weaponry
