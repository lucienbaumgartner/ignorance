Podesta talked about it in one of his emails leaked on wikileaks. He complained about fading compliance. Here are some extraits of the email:

The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking – and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
