It is the same and it isn't.

All depression, guilt, shame, fear, and anger are built upon pain.

The difference is in how one reacts to the pain. If a guy take your wallet, you might feel like the world sucks and you suck (depression), you should have protected it better or voted Democrat so that people aren't poor enough to want to steal wallets (guilt), freak out about your situation (anxiety), never want to go outside or in crowds again (fear / anxiety), or go for vengeance against the guy to teach him a lesson (anger).

Society tends to pity depression and anxiety because it's a person in pain but in a relatively harmless state.

Most people fear anger on the other hand, so will try to avoid you, condemn you, or hate you for showing anger.

Society on the whole is unaware and unconscious of how all of this works. Everyone sees out of their own lens, which is always the lens they find most convenient for them.
