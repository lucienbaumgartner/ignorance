It's all about her and her issues. She completely ignores the discrimination faced by the lazy and ignorant. Compared to fat people, the lazy and ignorant face hurdles that fat people can't even imagine. As a PhD, a professor and an author, Linda Bacon is so privileged and unaware that she constantly shames the lazy and the ignorant by flaunting her achievements. Shame on her.
