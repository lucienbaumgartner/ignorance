You're continuously pointing one finger while three fingers are pointing back at you. It's like you're in denial or just simply can't acknowledge the faults of your people. I have no problem admitting that some Arabs are ignorant and hateful and do cause problems. Is it too hard for you to say that Jews and Israelis? And please explain to me how Arabs shove their patriotism down people's throats but Israelis do not. You can't be serious when you made that statement. The Arabs and Jews are no different from each other.

You continuously say things like "either they live with the Jews or leave"... It seems like you really do want the Arabs to leave. First you say it's a neutral land followed immediately by saying it belongs more to the Jews. How is what you are saying any different than what the Arabs you are complaining about say? You claim to want peace but at the same time advocate for the Arabs to leave. You really need acknowledge your hypocrisy. You're pretending to be holier than thou meanwhile you're exactly the same as the people you're complaining about
