I should write a book. If telling stories of the actual events that happened in my household will enlighten or provide some clarity to others, or that some epiphany will occur, then I should.

For those out there that had premature-born siblings of a religious parenting, and were subjected to unnecessary violence, abuse (mental or physical) or had parents that suffered from some childhood trauma and failed to act on protecting you in your development (ironically protected the premie from reality), you are not alone.

You can not have a family, sparing the future of fuckups.

You can have a relationship and/or family but only after getting psychological help from a professional. (no, praying and some organized religious leader does not count)

You can pursue a family or healthy relationship when you come to grips with what was wrong and repair you. Forget about others and fixing your family; its too late for them unless they are younger and welcoming to support.

Understanding that our parents were both ignorant and unaware of their actions because they would never admit that they had no experience or quality parenting as example. They just "provided" to make sure there was a roof overhead and food on the table. Everything was a bonus!

(I wish to use this chance to say, Fuck you, to my two older sibling males. I hope you both rot where you die. And fuck you for preventing me from seeing my father get old). There. I feel much better. Good luck!
