Because superheroes are an American invention so it doesn't really fit with Asian culture. Shang Chi kind of failed miserably IMO as he was completely Americanised and was basically just an American superhero with an Asian face (I got halfway through the movie but it wasn't interesting enough for me to keep watching).

On another note, I really don't like how ABCs are portrayed in movies (like Awkwafina's characters that she keeps getting typecast in), basically ignorant and whitewashed. We're not all like that and it's kind of embarrassing to be honest.
