You get a 90% damage reduction with a single maxed-out intensify, add in streamline and I'm pretty certain her 4 gets incredibly cheap to just spam. Sure they won't have the Zenurik field, but I'm pretty sure it's possible without too much hassle.

Also you could literally just ask any MR20+ for a basic set of mods and you'll get showered in them. Unless you're new and unaware of that or actively only looking to get mods from drops Gara is pretty friendly considering she can't die with a single intensify.
