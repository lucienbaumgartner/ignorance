NTA,

I was raised in the south in an area where table manners ate so inportant theres a class for children on it called cotilion. 

I have NEVER heard of this being a rude concept  nor can i grasp why anyone would consider ordering takeout at the end of the meal trashy or embarrassing. 

Yourr original friend is being kinda a turd but i sorta get where there coming from. But this has been yalls practice for years and having to change it for this 1 uppity couple seems both unfair to you and a diservice to society to bending to the whims of the ignorant and petty.
