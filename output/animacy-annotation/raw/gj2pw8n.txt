 Some guy told me today on a different sub that what I find attractive in a man (I think a man who is average looking, but dresses well and takes care of himself is more attractive than a handsome man who dresses poorly and doesn't care about his appearance) isn't important because I'm a "32 year old woman who is WAY past her prime and your opinions don't matter anymore". His point, I guess, was that only a person's face, height, weight and age are what matter when it comes to attractiveness and not how they dress, smell, speak, manners, etc. Men in their late 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s were pissed after reading his comment to me and came flooding in to back me up and tell me how utterly incorrect and ignorant that boy is and that real men find women of all races, shapes, sizes and ages gorgeous. Many told me that women just get sexier and more beautiful not less because they know how to accent their best features, they know themselves, they know what works for their personal look and they walk and lead their lives with confidence. They also said we are better in bed because we know what we want, are less self conscious and know how to "work a bedroom". Made me feel better.
