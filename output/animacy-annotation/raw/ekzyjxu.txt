How is Israel a golden calf when our prophets literally told us in writing that we would return to the land?

And it’s happened. And it’s still happening. 

The problem with the Rebbe on the founding of Israel was that it was being done by secular Zionists. They ultra-Orthodox were so convinced they knew how Israel would be formed that they refused to believe there could be a “secular Israel” and Rabbi Soloveitchik was famous for his belief that Halacha preceded the existence of anything observable - and not the other way around. Therefore, Israel as a secular state existed and it was our responsibility to learn how to behave towards it. 

And he and the Rebbe respected each other and that’s why the Rebbe essentially admitted he was mistaken. 

Zero golden calf and you have no clue how offensive and ignorant that sounds.
