Also there are “bastards” in every profession that make them look bad. From medical malpractice to mail delivery guys breaking items in boxes. Yet as police we get labeled as a whole. Which is unreasonable and ignorant. That would be like saying bc I am half white that must mean I am half racist, which many people have said about white people in general.
