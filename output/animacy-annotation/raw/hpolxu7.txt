It's an interesting conversation that even over a very short amount of time reads differently. Fitz, to me, initially comes off as more ignorant and defensive but now comes off as much more hostile and mean spirited to his friend. If not outright bigoted. Especially as greater awareness of nonbinary individuals has grown.
