I think you should follow his lead on this. If it’s something that just popped into his head while he was high, and he really doesn’t feel like it’s affecting him now, then appreciate that he felt comfortable sharing it with you and leave it there. If you wanted to be extra cautious, you could bring it up and say something like “hey the other night you told me about something pretty serious when you were high. I just wanted to check in when we were both sober and make sure you’re doing ok.”

Our society conditions us that sexual assault and sexual trauma are the worst possible things that could ever happen to a person and if it does, their life is automatically ruined, police need to be involved etc. That’s just not true in all cases. Some people choose not to report something (and that *is* their choice—it’s not an obligation to tie yourself up in the legal system if someone assaults you). 

In this case the details are really murky as well. Was this other guy awake? Could he have been asleep and unaware of what he was doing? Is your boyfriend still in touch with this dude at all? This was at least 5 years ago. I wouldn’t be too concerned unless he brings it up again or it’s bothering him.
