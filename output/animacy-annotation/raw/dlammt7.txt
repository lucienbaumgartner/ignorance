A true general anesthetic means you're so deeply anesthetized that you loose all protective airway reflexes and cease spontaneous breathing. That is generally done in a hospital OR or out-patient surgery center. It is sometimes possible at a dental office that employs an anesthesiologist or, technically, with an Oral and Maxillofacial surgeon though most only offer moderate and deep sedation in their offices (and also don't do fillings). You'd be comfortable (as in completely and totally asleep, unaware, and completely unresponsive). Finding a general dentist who has privileges in a hospital OR or surgery center would be difficult, and I really doubt your insurance would actually cover it. It's also massively overkill for a filling unless you're a small child or profoundly developmentally delayed.

Also, pretty much all deeper forms of anesthesia will require you to have an IV placed while awake. Which means you still have to deal with your needle phobia.

What you're really looking for is a dentist that offers nitrous oxide and/or oral conscious sedation. That would be more than enough for a filling. Also, your insurance might actually cover that.
