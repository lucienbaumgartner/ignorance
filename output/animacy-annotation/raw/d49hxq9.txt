Well a person who does not have delusions of reality would conclude that the text of the Quran was obviously not written by a god that knew about the earth being round and the poles issues with sun sets and day length.

Believer go full apologist mode to cover, explain and defend the logical conclusions that God did not know about this stuff by bending over backwards. The same thing happens with prayer in a certain direction. When you are on a round planet and you are facing a direction your back also face the same point but the other way...that is if you think that prayers follow the curvature of the earth.

Also praying in a direction basically also means facing a point in space. Prayers do not follow the curvature of the earth UNLESS you are on a flat earth. Your back also does not face the same point UNLESS you are on a flat earth

Sane people can conclude that the Quran was not written by God, that God was unaware of the earth not being flat and unaware that northern countries would have much longer days for Ramadan...which when you are an epileptic illiterate warlord living in the middle east when a lot of people thought the earth was flat then it makes a little more sense
