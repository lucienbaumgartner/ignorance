The data doesn't really show us anything but I can speak anecdotally. As a decent IR lmp2 driver (around 3k BEFORE these last 2 days where I lost ~200 IR. It's been rough...), the issue is almost always back of the pack drivers. Doesn't matter the class, the issue is just that a slow driver in a slower class will get passed by more people during a race than a slow driver in a faster class, so there's more potential chances for incidents. Saying that, from the perspective of an lmp2 driver, by far the worst are back of the pack lmp2 drivers. Just like slower drivers of every class, they're unpredictable and unaware of their surroundings, BUT they're doing that in a faster car so they can cause much more damage. I also get scared of GT3 drivers simply because they'll always be lower IR in top split due to the lack of participation, but I can dodge a GT3 much easier than I can an LMP2 that's going the same speed on straights.

Of course, this is completely anecdotal.
