Seems like a general bias, all these seem to boil down to neglect by the person/owner, the fact that you blame a dog that is nurtured into becoming what it is on the dog itself, shows that you have the inability to see the full picture and intsead project your bias, I don't care about citations and peer reviewed articles, as someone who grew up around german shepherds, king shepherds, bull mastiffs, pitbulls, etc, they all boil down to the way they are nurtured. A violent King shepherd I knew became a guard dog for an entire 25 acre farm, it doesn't really bother with people, unless its suspicious of you. Basically, if you nurture a dog to be unaware and protective in a home setting, shit like that happens, if you nurture them properly, this does not occur. Doesn't Caesar Milan have a pitbull.  https://www.cesarsway.com/cesar-millan/cesars-blog/why-i-love-pit-bulls    A dog is a dog, a person is a person, a baby learns from their parent, a puppy learns from its master. EDIT: This part is the biggest issue: "Sadly, a lot of people have come to think of pit bulls as violent and aggressive dogs. This is reinforced on TV and in newspapers that go to town every time there’s an attack — and often the offending dog is described as a pit even when it isn’t."
