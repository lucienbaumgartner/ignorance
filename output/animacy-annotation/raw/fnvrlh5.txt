Yeah, I'm sure the school explained to them why they're not getting diplomas. They need to learn that actions have consequences. And good thing they're teenagers, so they can learn from this. You don't get to go around spewing racist shit online and then get pass just because of your age. If they were adults working full time jobs, they'd deserved to be fired. Their age doesn't change their consequence. 

By the way, this isn't just a fuck up like crashing your parent's car. They setup this video, filmed it, probably did some editing to fit into tiktoks time limit, and uploaded it. In that amount of time, not once did it cross their mind how stupid and ignorant that video is. They deserve to have their diplomas pulled. You don't get to spew racist shit and then get a slap on the wrist for it.
