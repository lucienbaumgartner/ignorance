&gt; Look up effective altruism. I'm not going to do your research for you just because you're lazy. I don't owe you that. 

"Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?" Direct quote from the first search Mr I don't owe you that because I rather type an essay on my reddit phd rather then referring it here. 

Thank you yet again for reporting my point at the start, how to use resources most efficiently. As I have said before being pedantic and throwing random terminology isn't going to make you look smart, you are just beating around the bush and running back to the same starting point.

&gt;You're wrong that "most" are corrupted. That's an asinine claim based on nothing. I was making the distinction that *some* being corrupt does not mean *most* are. Your statement also implied that because "most" are corrupt, it's pointless or a waste to donate. That's what I was replying to. 

Maybe you are the one who need to reread what u actually wrote.  "Corrupt charities exist therefore it's pointless to give to any of them." That is the most typical example of twisting someone words. Being stereotype and imagining what others have in their mind thinking its their exact thought is the most idiotic thing ever.

You're wrong that "most" are corrupted. That's an asinine claim based on nothing. How about I hit you with your own logic, "no, you."

&gt;You're not even making any sense. Of course I'm not going to tell you about my personal life, you psychopath. I don't talk about my personal life on here at all. Because nutcases like you do things like dig through user histories, as you did elsewhere in your comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's hilarious that you think you have some upper hand when you're just blindly assuming things about my life, which is just impressively stupid. I hope you're not actually that stupid, and this was just a fluke for you.

You are actually ridiculous to even type this kind of stuff, because word by word is exactly what you are doing. Making countless claims about someone without knowing anything, putting words into someone's mouth, accusing people not having evidences while doing the same in the previous paragraph. The only thing you can claim is the second hypocrite in the world, cuz I am sure no one will dare to claim first.

Maybe you should stop these personal attacks and feel good about yourself if you can't take any of them. Being a cry baby saying you are getting your history looked up while not able to respond to any only make you worse when you are the one who started it up. 

&gt;Why would I? That's not my job. Besides, I never said it's a waste of money. I never said it doesn't help. My entire point was that you were bragging and shitting on other people because you committed the Great and Noble Act of spending a whole 3 months doing some unskilled manual labor. My point was that it's not as impressive as you seem to think, and your efforts could have been far more helpful in other ways. 

Worst argument ever, is not my job therefore why would I. Thank you Mr. Obvious there are lots of things that are not your business yet you are still going on. You can attack me all you want with your "unskilled manual labor", but at least I won't be a discriminate and look down to people who actually does these kind of jobs in order to survive or feed his/her family, what a fucking disgrace you are without any conscience. 

&gt;What a strawman argument. All I said was that your money could have been more effectively used. Nowhere did I say or imply that it's some magical solution.

Can you stop repeating my point? Do you have some sort of mental disorder which has numerous of characteristic like the movie split? You ask what part of your response did you even ignore? Well there you go again calming that was my money when I legit said countless time that it was the organization's. How thick is your skin to ever claim that you were not ignoring?

&gt;You didn't have to. My entire point is that **you didn't help nearly as much as you think you did**. It sure as shit wasn't so helpful that it gives you a pass to shit on people donating money to a charity that has helped literally millions of people more than you have. Meanwhile, you're dumb enough to think that that charity **buys water**. Is your concept of charities seriously so simplistic and ignorant that you think that's what they do? Do you seriously choose to be that stupid? Or do you just not have a choice in the matter? 

Wow are we in poe the absence of value and meaning? Are you the elder? I didn't  have to say things for you to claim? I guess after all you are a creature with testicles. Parasite. 

&gt;Not my fault you're too stupid to do some rudimentary reading. Guess it wasn't a fluke after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not going to bother responding to your other comment. You're welcome to respond to me if it stops you from feeling small for moment. I won't see it though since I'm blocking you. Have fun digging through my history, lunatic.

Yeah good come back sir, as I can see your metal was breaking down on the last paragraph because all you can do is personal attack when you obviously could not respond to those issues. 

Hey I am also glad that you can finally admit you were and still feeling good about yourself when you cherry pick comments to reply. Also we got your message ages ago already, you don't need to block someone nor personal abuse to imply there are topics that you are unable to comment as you can't cherry pick anymore.

Apart from split maybe shuttle island is also another good movie to watch when your mental state is back to normal (I guess never). Because you know what kind of people like to call everyone else lunatic? Yes, the madman itself :)
