Your last statement is the weird statement, since unfortunately many people have committed suicide because of depression without dementia, as we all are aware.  

We don't know the situation with Robin Williams, but not everyone has the same experiences either.    

Even with a slow progression, the point where it goes from forgetting a few names, to forgetting to take your medicine the week after, then not being able to find your room when your standing in the hallway 1 door away from your room in the home, to not knowing what that urge was causing you to stand there with urine running down your legs, there comes a point, at least for some people when they just aren't aware of their personal situation. A person can go from a nice, kind individual to being angry, combative and unaware of self, yet not commit suicide.
