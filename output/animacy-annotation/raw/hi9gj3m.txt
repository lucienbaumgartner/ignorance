Wow…Ok. Obviously, there’s a disconnect here. It’s just a fact that K-Pop is inspired by Western pop ideologies. Everyone knows this. Also, some Koreans in K-Pop culturally appropriate, say the N-word, and are culturally-insensitive. This isn’t “imperialist”. And, whether or not we call it K, J, I or anything else is only to differentiate. We use it to identify. You’re still missing the point. So, let me break this down for you. 

- K-Pop isn’t an original genre. 
- It’s built on Western pop ideologies. 
- Many K-Pop idols are culturally inappropriate, insensitive, and unaware of racial slurs, disparities, and inequities that Black people face. 

You’re completely missing the point.
