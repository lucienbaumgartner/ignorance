Luckily I have a CS degree and Iâ€™m working a good software dev job so my talents and education are pretty desired abroad. I wish I had studied abroad as well, but I was so unaware and stupid until I started to pay attention a few years ago. Oh well. Hopefully after this pandemic ends I will be able to get a work visa elsewhere quickly.
