Correct. Personally, I disagree with the rational as one factor is prior to the age of 26 is hard to build a financial foundation, whereas after there should be something. 

Again, I absolutely disagree with the federal stance on that and as someone who works in the disability field, the amount of people eligible and unaware of ABLE accounts is astonishing. My point is that there are so many resources that are unknown by those who could use them. I don’t believe that’s by coincidence either. As an example, I get people connected to accessibility modifications funded through Medicaid. While very specific, those eligible don’t know about my service because the state doesn’t widely advertise as they should given I operate through a Medicaid waiver. This prevents as many people applying to services therefore decreases expenditure. 

People on SS prior to 26 often times aren’t educated on ABLE accounts, in my opinion, because then they’d have the means to financial independence which would down the line defeat the need for certain services which exists to justify the state’s need for additional Medicaid funding. In short, they keep themselves relevant by making people reliant.
