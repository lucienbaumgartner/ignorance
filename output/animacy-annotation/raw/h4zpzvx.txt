I apologize. I don't mean to act like I know more about you that you do. I'm just speaking from a lot of people I know who I deem alike to you based on your comments. I'm not trying to radicalize you or say you aren't allowed to have an ideology that is in preservation of the status quo or anything like that. I'm saying that you think because you're a centrist you assume you are just able to pick the correct option because you are free from extremist propaganda, but you are actually just floating in the center-right bubble. You can be in the center right bubble, that pretty hip these days I hear. But there's no need to act pretentious about avoiding extremism.  I know I'm not getting anywhere, and even though I know nothing of the canadian new Dems, I can bet they are just another green, healthcare party who wants to preserve the status quo. You may not care about that, you may want exactly that. but you should at least understand why people do care about that. Saying that all extremism is bad is vague and ignorant of critiques of the system that stem from so called "extremists".
