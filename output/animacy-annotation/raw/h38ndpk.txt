I think I explained clearly that I am not referring to someone simply taking your watch, so the fact that you keep presenting my argument as such is disingenuous. 

The original post is referring to men being just as fearful of being attacked as women. I am not making it a contest, this post is, as well as your comments. I find it close minded and ignorant that you can not put yourself in someone else's shoes and understand that they may personally be equally fearful of being assaulted.
