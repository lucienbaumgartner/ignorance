honestly have been thinking more on this comment since it was made.

I never really expected to go to far into the back story of big papa, I knew how he ended up on the streets... but the after math... 

&amp;#x200B;

Big papa was born in a house with a family, but was born with bat wings. His parents chewed them off and hated him as the "monstah babeh", His siblings and parents were cast out of the house along with him when the people had to move and well... its easier without pets. One by one his folks were picked off... till he remained.

&amp;#x200B;

Him being a young and unaware of the streets fluff. I can fathom he had some hard times, trying to figure out ware to go how to go what to do so forth. I know he joined a herd after his folks and family died, And with no wings to mark him as a monster. He was taken in by the other. 

Booger and his brother Bow were the "bestest" bebehs of the leader of the herd. And given big papa's beginnings he was probably still considered small or weaker or dumber.

With some things that may have needed to happen, them using Big papa as a decoy or blaming him, eventually he got fed up. Got stronger and took over the herd and area. But due to his past with the brothers he May have had to teach them once or twice or a few times. 

You don't. Mess. With Big Blue.

this after thinking on the comment for so long is the best i can come up with. I feel there are enough holes that you are welcome to fill in how you think it went. But my general idea of their history.
