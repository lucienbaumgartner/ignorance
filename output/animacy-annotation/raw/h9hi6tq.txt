More like effective wait-outers. If the United States Military stayed in Afghanistan (not that we should have, fuck that), and/or actually went about fighting them effectively and with the intention to win (because as I said in my previous reply, I'm surprised people in this sub don't acknowledge the fact this was a war the elite purposely dragged out) then Taliban would be fucking toast.

The United States Military has absolutely fucking destroyed numerous terrorist organizations in the past. Why? Because they weren't part of a war that was inflating the MIC with billions and allowing the state to further collect tax revenue to fund it. It was a matter of utilizing the intelligence community and socom to demoralize, isolate, and surgically strike. As opposed to the never ending bombing campaigns of Afghanistan that just hit random goat fuckers who's lives meant nothing to the Taliban itself, but maybe his family, who then decided to join up for that sole fact.

Depicting the Soviet-Afghan War and/or Operation Enduring Freedom as Taliban single handedly holding off invading forces is not only incorrect, but it's disingenuous and ignorant of history, just like how people think Vietnam was strictly a guerrilla war. The Soviet invasion was obviously way different circumstances and MAYBE more in line with the narrative of "goat herders beat big empire", but still not quite. Even then, the Soviet-Afghan War was fought between the USSR and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan against the Mujahideen movement which included **way** more than just the predecessors of the Taliban.

I'm not insinuating we won by any stretch; and while I already addressed that anyways, I'll also point out that I hardly consider hiding mostly and maybe coming out every now and then for 10 years, then rolling over an army that didn't even fight you to make you a good fighting force.
