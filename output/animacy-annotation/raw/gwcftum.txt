No, I get his point perfectly. I don’t agree with it though. To act like AI will not be able to do something as simple as that ever is completely shortsighted and ignorant of how powerful AI will become. 

You are looking at the performance of tools that currently exist and assuming that their limitations are static. There isn’t a single thing that producers or engineers do that won’t be outsourced by AI in the next 5-20 years.
