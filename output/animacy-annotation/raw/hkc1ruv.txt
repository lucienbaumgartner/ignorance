I can see why you’re too upset about this. You seem to think that we reject any form of western/liberal ideas in our society solely because they’re foreign and different. Perhaps you think we’re backwards, close minded and ignorant of the reality we live in too. This isn’t the case even according to the liberal political theory, which states that if a society or state is predicated on certain set of values and beliefs that they consider necessary for them to function and exist, then any attempt to undermine these values can be considered a unlawful and should be held accountable by the state.

On another note suffice to say that since you believe in moral subjectivism this doesn’t give you the upper hand whatsoever to enforce any moral judgement on anyone. What you hold to be true and right, is just right for you, and you should have no issues with others who see it otherwise.
