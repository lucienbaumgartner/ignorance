Podesta has a lot of interesting emails in there.  [I find this one from Bill Ivey \(Bill Clinton political appointee\) to Podesta especially interesting](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) - particularly the part where it talks about the left having endeavored to "produce an unaware and compliant citizenry" via their control of the education system, and how they see the "unawareness" remaining strong, but consider it a problem that "compliance is fading rapidly".
