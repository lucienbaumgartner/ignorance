Dog 1 is way too big to see Dog 2 so Dog 1 constantly steps on Dog 2 who is old and over weight (working on it with diet and proper exercise) so Dog 2 can't move very fast and is only like a foot and a half tall (idk exact height but up to my mid calve maybe and I'm 5'4). Dog 1 (to my mid thigh) doesn't mean harm, Dog 1 is just too tall and unaware of their own surroundings for their own good. Dog 2 often gets trampled but it's ok Dog 1 never causes damage, just shock
