I was born in 1951. When I was 9 or 10, my grandma and I rode a Greyhound bus from Owosso to Flint to see the circus. It was my first ride on a commercial bus and first circus.

I rode a school bus to school everyday and normally would ride in the back. So, when I got on the Greyhound, I headed towards the back of the bus as usual. 

Now keep in mind I was 100% clueless about race or racism.

That bus driver came on the bus, seen me about 3 seats from the back and walked back, told me I could not sit there, and made me move just forward of center. Whatever, sounds stupid as hell to me but ok...

We get into Flint and off the bus and I needed the rest room and headed into the first one I seen. As it happened, it had a sign that read colored. The nicest black gentleman in his finest suit, says to me the following words, "young master, that bathroom is unfit for you, yours is over there" and he pointed to another restroom. I remember wondering why there would be an unfit public restroom anywhere.

Today as I remember these events, I still wonder why any of that was ever a thing. It is just plain ignorance and stupidity.

Owosso is about 90 miles from Detroit. I remember the 68 riots and how the people of Owosso reacted. They loaded up on ammunition and formed neighborhood patrols. I remember the older people worrying about how the black gangs of Detroit might descend on Owosso as if anyone from anywhere else could possibly care about a little piss ant town like Owosso. I also remember driving to Detroit about a year later and seeing just how many businesses had been burned to the ground.

The lesson I took from it was simple, racism hurts every single person including the racist.

Racism is bone stupid and ignorant.

That rather explains the current president.
