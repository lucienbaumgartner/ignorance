You ever been hunting son? You ever had meat besides beef, pork, or chicken? Like goat meat or quail or shark or octopus or snail? It's all disgusting--all blood and guts and (literal) shit you clean out before it gets to your table. And it's also all delicious once it's cooked. And like literally everyone in the thread is saying, it's salt causing the nerve endings to react. Someone even posted a video of beef reacting this way in this very thread. 

You ever stop to think they might *enjoy* the taste? I'm hoping you're young because you objectively sound incredibly sheltered and ignorant. That or you're just a troll trying to bait people.
