Yeah, this is all great! Thank you!

In fact, two members of the coven are already using disguises in the village, as innocent members of the village. And the Green Hag has appeared to the party in disguise.

The **Sea Hag** frequently appears as the old, smelly, ritual leader in the village. "He" leads "worship" of "Tymora" while keeping an eye on the very old cursed magistrate and giving the villagers charmed water to keep them unaware and docile.

The **Annis Hag** takes on the guise of the village's "Captain of the Guard", so "he" is in charge of the villages defenses against the goblin-trolls (he doesn't seem to be very good at it...).

And the **Green Hag** has appeared to them as a "Faerie Princess" who needs their help saving the village from a swamp monster (she set them up to fight a Catoblepas).

So the party has already encountered the members of the coven in disguise, they just don't know it yet. But they *strongly* suspect that the Faerie Princess was not what she claimed to be.

So the Coven could approach them in these same disguises, offering to raise their dead comrade.
