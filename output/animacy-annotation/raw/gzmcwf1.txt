I have neighbours from hell and I wouldn't normally say "deliberately aggravate neighbours" but yours sound very intrusive and unaware of boundaries. You can't control what other people have as decoration! 

It's not like you have a lawn full of junk or anything offensive, it just "doesn't fit THEIR decor." 

So...Get a mannequin and make it a ghost costume. 

I used to have one and my friends (a family with older kids) were storing some things for me, they were renting a house in a posh neighbourhood with unfriendly neighbours. They put her in their front window and the kids dressed her in different outfits, they found it hilarious to hoik her top up so her plastic boobs were showing.
