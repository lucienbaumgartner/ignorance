You do realize that most of the world carries a disdain for communism... right? You seriously can’t be so sheltered and ignorant that you think that people who have lived through communism or have been affected by its destruction don’t find the ideology as being negative. Calling someone a communist should carry nearly the same weight as calling someone a Nazi. If you disagree then you’re lost.
