To me, an unaware and ignorant commentator, 1-2 seems like a comfy margin. Even if 2 carriers catastrophically fail and are completely destroyed, all we need to do is maintain current positions until the 1-2 undergoing less expensive maintenance are done and we can reestablish the safety margin, and that might be a job that could be rushed under emergency conditions. That isn't even considering having any of our allies with carriers "fill in" or us in one of the hotspots, perhaps the Persian Gulf where action is so far limited. While not something to really on, this strategy is also planning for the destruction of upwards of 2 carriers, so it's really more of a plan C. Baring astronomically improbable catastrophe, aren't our bases pretty well covered? Or am I missing out on something here?
