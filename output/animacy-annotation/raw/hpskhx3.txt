A part of it might be differences in education. I find it frustrating having worked nothing but blue collar jobs since graduating university and nobody I work with understands important concepts like bystander effect, attribution error, supply and demand, the many cognitive biases, logical fallacies, etc that have such an important effect on my thinking every day and then I have to listen to low level managers who thinks they're somebody and they can treat their subordinates like shit because they've risen one or two levels above entry-level meanwhile the opinions they spout and decisions they make are so ignorant and stupid but you can't even explain to them why they're ignorant and stupid because even if you communicate it as politely as you can they won't even care to hear you out and they wouldn't even understand you if they did.
