I didn't say space exploration either, I said commercial space flight.  Are you really so thick and ignorant that you don't see how cool it is to have a car launched into space that people in the future travelling to Mars can follow?  The entire point is that he was able to do it and it was for fun, it's commercial fucking space flight!  IT'S HERE!
