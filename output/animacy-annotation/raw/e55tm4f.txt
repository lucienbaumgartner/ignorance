This hits an organization my company manages pretty heavy. Most of the users are young and unaware, and it feels impossible to keep them secured. 

We've recently seen one phishing attempt that is *a lot* like this but at the top they've added a light green banner saying "this email comes from a trusted sender."

I don't have a screen shot hand (on Mobile) but keep an eye out for this!
