I've actually heard something else.  Essentially, it's because we offer the best healthcare available to the poor and ignorant that drives prices up; we offer the same care to everyone.  It's the enormous generosity of our healthcare that makes it expensive, not that rich people are somehow "unduly privileged" -- in fact, it is that our poor are so privileged that it appears that the wealthy are somehow worthy of disdain, because they can attract more attention from the best of the best within the same healthcare system.

Poor and ignorant people are not suffering from our system, they are actually making a generous system worse off for the majority -- that is, the middle class.
