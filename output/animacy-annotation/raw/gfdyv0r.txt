this post was all whitney's (a POC himself), not a product of the mod team as a unit, so i should be clear i'm not speaking for whitney the OP:

i think the value in addressing it is so that BIPOC users know they are welcome here, and know they are not alone and not crazy when they witness microaggrssions both on the show and on the subreddit.

active users on the sub are [nearly 80% white](https://i.imgur.com/Pp8J6Bg.png), which obviously is far above the percent of white americans. the lack of minority perspective is reflected in opinions of users, but also in upvotes/downvotes and in more subtle ways like the word choices OP is highlighting.

we can and do ban trolls, and we'll surely ban a few that flame this thread. but policing microaggressions is a whole different ball of wax and almost an impossible task--obviously mods have no control over a minority opinion getting downvoted to oblivion, but there are also way too many of the more subtlely damaging comments that BIPOCs pick up on for us to make any real dent behind the scenes. plus that's kind of the point with the topic of tone and word choice--many of those comments taken on their own do not rise to the level that anyone would want them removed, but taken as a whole they further the stereotypes, they make our BIPOC users feel unwelcome, and they reflect poorly on the community.

just speaking for myself, i know i was a mix of unaware and indifferent to this type of insidious racism until people i cared about in my life made me aware, and until i began to take the time to read and process what POCs like OP were trying to communicate to me.
