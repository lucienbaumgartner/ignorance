Setting the scene: All gens are done, 4 survivors alive, I am chasing a survivor while keeping eyes on the doors. I see Nancy opening the nearest door while I am looping this pallet.

1. Ideally you are chasing someone when the gens get done. Everyone knows you are in chase so they will bolt to the door. Keep watching the doors while chasing. 
2. When the doors are 99 you need to run to the door. Ideally you down the person you were just chasing. Leaving a slug adds pressure to the person by the door. There is almost always a person waiting there. They see you (!), turn to open the door, and the second they do, you leave the area. Go back to your slug. No one has ever continued out the door when I do this. This is why I said confused. They continue to stand there after opening the door for me wondering what to do, hence, confused.
3. The hardest part is keeping them in the game. That slug you left may already be up so you need to get back there and try a couple things depending on situation. You need to be chasing someone ***poorly.*** The idea is to run down the clock. So just slugging everyone would take forever as that slows the EGC timer. So running down the clock through chases is ideal. What does chase poorly mean? Normally you want to end a chase ASAP right? But here you want them to last as long as possible. While looping a pallet don't break it, even when you normally would, keep looping them. They want you to break the pallet so they can leave the loop. You aren't going to let them. Block them from getting anywhere, they want that fast window vault? deny it,  you are running out the clock.  If you need to slug for more pressure you can. Just remember that will slow the timer so you want them to get that person up if you need the timer to move faster. Basically you want to look like a bad campy gamer. Makes the team get close and unaware of your plans. They want to save the one person from "the bb killer who tunnels." When they don't respect you they dance around in your face. Perfect. This all works best against SWF or super altruistic gamers. In fact this method was made just for SWF.
4. Now once the timer reaches half way it's GO time. DO NOT HOOK AT THIS POINT! You will lose. Just get ready. This is the part I have tested over and over and over. 
5. Probably the most important part: **you need to hook your target person when the timer is 40-45%** **AND you need to let them unhook IMMEDIATELY.** Don't camp the hook, don't attack anyone, don't be cheeky, JUST LEAVE THE ABSOLUTE SECOND YOU HOOK. Seriously. Act like you don't even see the other survivors. You want them to unhook ASAP, because as soon as they unhook.... they have sealed their fate and they are all dead. The unhook, restarts the EGC timer increasing its speed. So don't go downing them again because the timer will slow down.
6. After the unhook: congrats you have just pulled off a PB. NOW you can be cheeky and dance around the survivors as they realize what just happened. There is nothing they can do. If I am Bubba I like to rev my saw while they all die around me.

And that's it. Keep in mind that every game is different so you need to adapt the strategy to the survivors play style, the map, the killer, etc. The strategy isn't super complicated but the variables you have to work with can cause a lot of problems. After all this strat depends entirely on how the survivors react to your actions. So it can be hard to do if they are not "working" with you. Good luck trying for a PB!
