And believe me, I've lived here well over a decade and most Texans are nice people, but you look and act like assholes when you travel. 

I have a buddy from CT that says Texans and New Yorkers are actually both the same. They have some legitimate reasons to be proud of where they are from, but they are loud, proud and ignorant of other places and weirdly enough take pride in their ignorance by claiming where they are from is the only place that actually matters.

Also, when rubber meets the road, despite acting like total assholes, most will help you out in a pinch.
