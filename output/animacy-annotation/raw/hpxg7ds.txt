This is the classic right wing playbook right. Keep the population ignorant and incurious and they'll keep on lapping up whatever bullshit u feed them, keep them from using critical thinking and basic common sense and they'll keep voting for you. It's worked in the US for the GQP, half the country hates science now. What's to say it won't happen here too? A lot of my friends, highly educated I may add, spout right wing talking points and espouse hatred of the "other" (could be anyone non hindu/different state/economic status, whatever bogeyman the Modia spuns that week) as easily as breathing. It's frankly astonishing to me, not to mention disheartening. Now imagine the same after decades of indoctrination.
