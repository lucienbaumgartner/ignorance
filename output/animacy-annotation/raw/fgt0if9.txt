So. Elizabeth Warren is proposing legislation to punish companies from knowingly distributing information they know to be false. This is literally libel. Laws against this are already on they books. Assuming someone or an organization were to be charged with violating this law, there would be a trial where the prosecution would be forced to prove the person or company knew for a fact that they were spreading lies, which is nearly impossible to prove. For example, I don't know for a fact that you don't have sex with minors, so if I say that you are a pedophile, I don't know that to be false. Therefore no libel.

The second source shows that a pretty decent majority of students think speech should not be limited in any way for any reason. 58% to 41%. This question does not allow for any nuance at all so the students voted 17 points in favor of someone going into a hospital with some dry ice, yelling, "Nerve gas!", then getting no punishment. Just because the National Review doesn't understand how statistics work doesn't mean you have to remain ignorant.

So where is someone saying US free speech should be any further curtailed than it has been at any point in history.

It goes on to show that 71% of the male student kept their opinion to themselves to avoid being socially ridiculed. Boo hoo. Everyone does this every day. Either have the courage of your convictions to accept the ridicule, or maybe your opinion position isnt as strong as you want to believe it is.

I didn't watch the YouTube video so I'm not going to comment on it. Based on the first two sources it probably won't provide much insight.

It must be hard to go through life being so scared and ignorant that you buy the shit your saying.
