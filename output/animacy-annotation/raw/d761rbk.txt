I think this OPs assessment is spot on. I have also observed this major blind spot and try to remain actively aware of it. Yes of course it's the drivers primary responsibility that they operate the vehicle in a safe manner, but I don't believe anything he said was victim blaming. Have you never seen videos of pedestrians trying to claim insurance, fraudulently and intentionally stepping out in front of a car TO get hit? (Usually a dash cam on the drivers car saves them from liability) Obviously that's not what happened in this case, but to say that it's so clearly never the pedestrians fault is bullshit. If you cross not at a crosswalk, if you cut the 'crosswalk' sign short and try to run across after time is up, if you run across the road at night (especially wearing dark clothes), or cross while looking down at a phone (or general distraction), if you run between traffic, you are unaware and stupid. Yes, the driver should be looking for you, but they are not entirely at fault. The pedestrian has a responsibility too, to not just ASSUME they won't be hit because they have the right of way. I feel bad for this woman, losing her child, I'd be dead inside, but there is more to this story than we know.

Edit: So you know that whole thing we are taught as kids, to 'look both ways before crossing the road'. That's like victim blaming right? Because it's saying you should be cautious/careful before crossing a road. Implying pedestrians don't have to be careful is the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I'd say if you behave like that you probably deserve to be hit. Sorry.
