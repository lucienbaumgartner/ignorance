Lol you type of people just repeat the same lines over and over, not an original thought present. You pretend that people don’t hate on christians and religions in general on Reddit then claim everyone just wants to be left alone from the evil Christians. Your like a little kid who has one insult, “you people dumb and ignorant!” That is used for everything. 

In all seriousness though are you trying to claim that Reddit isn’t literally full off people like this? I mean we both know you fit into this category but come on you gotta be willfully ignorant.
