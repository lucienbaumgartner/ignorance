Unpopular opinion, but NAH - he's clearly dealing with some severe trauma regarding babysitters. He needs to work on this, not only for the sake of your relationship, but for his kids as well.

[Trauma changes the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181836/) and so, to an extent, his responses to situations involving babysitters is a result of this trauma being triggered which causes him to essentially RELIVE IT. [This is biologically valuable because trauma helps animals learn how to survive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792048/) \- but this is really out of balance with most modern circumstances humans find themselves in within a largely safe society. 

So when it comes to the idea of leaving a loved one in the care of a babysitter, he is triggered and reflexively defending against re-experiencing that traumatizing event. Imagine if he relented and something DID happen to the child? This would only reinforce the trauma and his behavior, and it may cause him to take more extreme responses. Because he is both terrified and UNAWARE that he is terrified - [and fear impairs our ability to think rationally](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/202007/how-does-fear-influence-risk-assessment-and-decision-making). 

So speaking rationally to him isn't going to convince him to not be afraid - because his rationality is already impaired by the topic and his brain is already hardwired to respond to this topic in fear-based ways - fight, flight (avoidance), and freeze (hoping the topic will go away or "hiding").

The only way to deal with this is for him to recognize he needs help, and that begins either with seeing a therapist about his trauma, or recognizing the [signs of distorted thinking](https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/).

This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and no one is really to blame here. The only thing that can be done is to focus on how this impacts his mental health, and how he might be modeling unhealthy behavior to his children because of his trauma without ever realizing it. So to be a good dad, he needs to deal with his own emotional health. He needs to set the example for his kids that when you understand you have experienced trauma, just like when you break an arm, you need to see a medical professional to make sure it is "healing" properly. Otherwise, you will spend most of your life impaired by a wound that is invisible because it is emotional rather than physical.
