Lmao o right posting a link that leads to a document means you supplied a document/ evidence. Garbage evidence. The composition prove nothing because it utopian and ignorant of economics. So no you can't can't make that claim because it bullshit utopian nonsense. Economics all disproven socialism in the 20th century cupcake. Since you posted garbage utopian nonsense, you can't even make the claim it decentralized to begin with. The only decentralized system is capitalism. Lmao main stream economics is bunch socialist/ keynesian that suck off the state. Socialism= central planning.
