I mean- since you mentioned it, your personal preferences don't dictate where another person's comfort level lies. That is sort of the point of my problem with the romance. Personal preference means a lot in the BDSM world, especially for people that are new and unaware of how the dynamic works. It's also usually a dynamic that keeps going after the sex. So, if there was a scene or banter after the initial sex scene where he is in more of a/an aftercare-caregiver role, I would probably have less of an issue. But even still, the way Bioware went about the BDSM portion of Bull's romance is the smaller issue I have with it. The bigger one being, I'm not a sub and I'm not a fan of being forced to be one if I want the romance. So, obviously I don't and refuse to. Hence my response to the original post.
