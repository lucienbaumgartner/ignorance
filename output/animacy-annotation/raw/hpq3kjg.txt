Yeah this was a terribly ignorant and stupid take. It seems like his statements was based solely on stereotypes of African Americans and Jewish people . Like it is ignorant of the history of after slavery and during reconstruction there was still a lot of money and corruption in the south to keep black American in terrible low paying jobs, even in the same jobs that were during slavery. Also to assume that every African American has a victim mentality and thus weren’t able to accomplish anything besides music, let alone such genres like gospel, jazz, rock, ect would’ve even exist, is a stupid fucking take. It can be the same reason on how poor class white people get an advantage over black people of the same class simply cuz of race
