I think you're missing the point. The only reason the migrant workers were needed was after the minimum wage came in to force. Before that the field workers would be UK based. So Brexit would have zero impact if the minimum wage was not forced on farmers, pickers are also classed as key workers, so Covid would have zero impact as the workforce is here. 

It's nothing to do with how hard the work is either. That's just the false narrative used to suggest British workers are lazy and won't do the job and in turn why we supposedly needed migrant workers, they're not and we don't.

Like any job there is a knack to it and a lot more skill than is given credit to. It's not for everyone. And everyone that went has a different level at which they work, some would walk out each week with Â£1000+ and others were happy with a couple of hundred in their back pocket. 

Blaming Brexit and the pandemic for a problem that started 20 years or more ago is pretty lazy and ignorant of the root cause
