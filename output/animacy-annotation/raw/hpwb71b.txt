There’s different kinds of bad parents. There’s parents who beat the brakes off their kids and put cigarettes out on them and then there’s parents like Clint who shovel the responsibility for caring for their mentally retarded spawn on to the taxpayers when they turn 21. The truth is that there’s a lot of things he can legally attempt to do besides let him waste away in a chair and be an internet circus monkey, he’d just rather be willfully ignorant and negligent. I know, I was in his position with my son, I fixed that situation in 2 years and now he’s doing really good.
