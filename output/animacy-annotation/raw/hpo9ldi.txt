I'm ardently pro-vaxx and frustrated as I can be about anti-vaxxers, but this is an abhorrent idea. It punishes the children of ignorant and poor parents, and financially punishes misinformed and often uneducated people. We have a (largely) free healthcare system, we shouldn't be punishing people for falling for misinformation.
