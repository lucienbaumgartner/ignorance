I'm probably trans, and not likely to escape my conservative parents. I can keep burying it, but right now my mental health is tanking. It'll probably be a very long time before I'm even able to experiment. I'm already at a stage of self-harm and constant suicide ideation. I just want a job, but I'm not qualified for anything because I spent a lifetime sulking when everything was given to me. So much of my living situation is my fault for being so unaware and unthinking.

sorry about being so ranty
