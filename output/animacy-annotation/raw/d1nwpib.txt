The correct answer here is "Sunday drivers". The 5 is the major North South artery and the traffic on it week days are commuters who know the lanes and the exits.

On the weekend you have the casuals. They are unsure and unaware and so lane changes are high, people are unsure of where they are going and confusion causes late lane changes and delays.

Also, there are parts of the 5 that are old and complex, like just southeast of downtown where the 5, 110, and 10. Delays and confusion are inevitable there.
