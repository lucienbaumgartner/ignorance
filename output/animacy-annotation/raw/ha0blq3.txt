if you tell McTominay to be the defensive midfielder then he is more than capable of sitting at the back and doing the same job Fred does…

The issue is that he’s much better going forward than he gets credit for, so when he came on he was clearly told to get forward and be a goal threat, 

The issue is that Fred and Matic are the only defensive midfielders we have, Fred can’t pass to save himself and yesterday at points Matic just seemed slow and unaware of his surroundings…
