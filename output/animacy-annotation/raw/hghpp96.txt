Just my personal opinion. I find it distasteful when people because of their celebrity status, influence and wealth move into areas unrelated to their work because they can, especially food. People work harder than most industries in the high end food world and celebrities eat at good restaurants for a couple years and think they’re foodies and put out a cookbook without living the lifestyle of a working chef. I don’t want the perspective of a diner, I want the perspective of a chef. It’s pretentious and unaware and undeserved, presumptuous to assume because of your celebrity status anyone cares that you like certain kinds of pizza. You’re not a pizza chef, you haven’t spent thousands of hours mixing dough, so I don’t care and it’s self absorbed of them to think I might. So many celebrities move into food influencer world thinking it’s some universal experience but unless you’re actually a chef you should not be doing this.
