As a person with ADHD depression and epilepsy this resonates with me so much:

This is trying to be beautiful at first glance but when you see the details you can see that this person depicted is in suffering. To me the flowers are what I try to show to everyone else, but since these are attached to my body I can't detach my work from my conditions. The muscles detached from the skeletons give me the sense that I'm incomplete, messed up and that I see my mental illnesses as detached from me, being that we're one and the same. And lastly this looks like a person falling to the ground, detached and unaware of the world around them, exactly like when my seizures start.
