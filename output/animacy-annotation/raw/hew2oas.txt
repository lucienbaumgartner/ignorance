"I mean if you weren’t awake for it and the resident was being supervised, I don’t see an issue."

 I don't know any OR nurses, so I can't comment to how closely all med students are actually "supervised" during their tenures/exams/procedures. However I know fellows typically handle routine patients care, conduct exams and procedures, and then get feedback from Attending Dr or their immediate supervisors in their fellowship. 

But along the lines of patients being unconscious and unaware of invasive exams... This is like saying Josh Duggar was completely ok to molest his sleeping sisters because they were unaware it happened at the time! 

NOT OK!!
