I would not. I carry and I think it is the dumbest thing to do. Someone is going to steal it then use it to rob or shoot someone. You may have even seen me on here bitching about it and going off in tirades, because I mention it every time I see a comment or post about it. It is just irresponsible and ignorant of the reality. Sure, in a perfect world it should not matter, but who tf carries a gun and believes in a perfect world? 

I'm sure there will be even more with permitless carry. Sure they increased the penalty for stealing a gun, but I doubt that makes any difference because jail does not stop crime. Instead of wasting time doing that, government should put money into things proven to reduce crime, like healthcare, living wages, and education- but that wouldn't net the private prison owners any money.
