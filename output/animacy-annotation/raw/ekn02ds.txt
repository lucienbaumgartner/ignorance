I'm so sorry you go through this.  The ignorance of these people is awful and the fact that they now have a public forum (social media) to spew their stupidity is even worse.  Please do not think that everyone is like this, I'm sure you don't anyway, but it's a select few who are loud and ignorant that think this way.  I love that you say you own your autism, as you should, it's a huge part of who you are &lt;3
