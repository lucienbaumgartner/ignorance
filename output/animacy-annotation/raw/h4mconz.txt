As a (vers) top, I am always confused how on earth people can be so inconsiderate and ignorant of the other's needs. If you want to get off without considering your sexual partner, just jerk off for fucks sake. I'm sometimes ok with bottoming without lube, but my bottom-leaning bf simply can't, and I'd feel like a major asshole for trying that. It isn't even pleasant, especially for uncut tops, I guess, the foreskin would get chafed, I don't get it. 70% of bottoms I've been with/talked to don't stay hard while getting penetrated, to the point that I kept thinking *I* am doing something wrong.

You are totally normal.
