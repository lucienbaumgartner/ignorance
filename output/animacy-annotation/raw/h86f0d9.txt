I've actually come to love my hair. When I grow it out I get conpliments from random strangers all the time "love the hair dude!" And almost every black person asks me about my heritage and I have to tell them I'm an American mutt, mostly german and unaware of any black in my bloodline. I do get tired of it though, it's a lot of work to take care of so usually around summertime each year I get it cut. People's reactions are always priceless. I've had a man nearly break down into tears in front of me because I cut my fro, I've had a lot of people get jokingly mad at me and demand I grow it back instantly and many more crazy reactions that just make me laugh.
