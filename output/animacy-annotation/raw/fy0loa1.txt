Heres some real life DD: i didnt know tesla did anything except make cool cars and I own 5 shares @ roughly $1300 cb per share. People are investing because the news says stocks go up. I didnt care enough to look into the company, or its financials, paying between 1300-1600 a share without batting an eye, fuck the thing could have been 100k a share and i would have worked towards a full one.

Tldr: the culture is so new, fresh and ignorant that we are fuckin up their algorithms, yolo 2500c 8/21.
