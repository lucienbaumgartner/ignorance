Assuming LNP people are able to cotton on to anything. Every person I know who supports the LNP actively tried to stay uninvolved and ignorant of politics - "I shouldn't have to worry what they're doing all the time, they're elected to run the country and that's what they're doing. It's not like the country burnt to the ground under them" (Apparently last years bushfires didn't happen?) - but will loudly and angrily defend their right to make uninformed and ill advised votes based on lies they are told to believe in - "They'll tax my franking credits if I don't! I don't even know what franking credits are, but I must have them because I'm being told I'll be taxed on them!"
