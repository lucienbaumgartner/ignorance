I like Cersei because she is a deeply flawed, complicated, messy ass character. That's why I love her. To this day, I have never seen anyone play themselves as hard as she did by setting up the Faith Militant and paving the way for her own incarceration.

Lena Headey does this in a way I think the books don't, as much; Cersei is more of a whiner (to me) in the books, and I hated that. But she is so destructive and unaware that what she possesses is low cunning, that she doesn't stop to think about how people might react or have a will of their own, because she is exactly that narcissistic. 

It's like Littlefinger said, she forgets that even the lowest of pawns can have a will of their own. And watching her play herself, over and over again? Fantastic.
