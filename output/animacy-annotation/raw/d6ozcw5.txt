The Paatru, fully unaware and unprepared for such an attack, barely have any time to prepare for battle, as the armies march outside their capital. A quick defense force is prepared, though it is small due to the surprise attack,


Defending force:

| Infantry | Cavalry | Battlemages |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| 14,073 | 0 | 56  

The defending army amasses outside the city, attempting to block the attacking armies from entering the city. Knowing they are severely outnumbered, they send out messengers to alert the nearby Patani settlements and territories. They hope to block the attacking armies until a larger defense force arrives, but they are doubtful that they will arrive in time.

The defending force awaits the enemy armies' attack.
