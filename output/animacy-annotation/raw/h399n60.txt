When I tell people that Democrats, compared to world politics, are actually more right wing, they get weird about it. 

Democrats don’t want to believe it because they don’t want to be considered anywhere close to Republicans on the political spectrum. 

Republicans are so propagandized to believe that Democrats are the “radical left” that they refuse to accept that modern Democrats are basically just where Republicans were two or three decades ago. 

American politics are generally moving further and further to the right and nobody wants to talk about it. Most of Europe wouldn’t even consider our “radical leftists” (Bernie Sanders, AOC, etc.) to be anywhere near the socialist side of things. It’s all just a story that people believe in the United States because we’re so isolated and ignorant of what’s going on in the rest of the world.
