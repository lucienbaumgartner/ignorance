So because the executives didn't have a plan and producers didn't keep the series under control, it's JJs fault? He was the director only. To blame the current state of the series entirely on him seems short sighted and ignorant of the system by which movies and series are made. 


What about all those Supermen aren't actual Superman? What is different between a movie with an alt-take and a comic with an alt-take? Is there some sort of difference between *actual* Superman and alt-takes?
