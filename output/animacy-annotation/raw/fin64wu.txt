Wow, butthurt much?

I work in an industry that is constantly attacked by falsehoods and when I seek to make sure people are more educated on the topic, you're ego is offended? 

The populace is already stupid enough as it is. I will tell people "I shear sheep" and they will immediately turn around and say "oh, you shave sheep huh?"

Do you realize how stupid and ignorant that is to hear? 

Words are important, they communicate meaning and ideas. Using the words that are correct for the meaning are very important as it conveys that idea to others properly. 

One of the largest problems I deal with are people complaining that when I shave sheep they are going to freeze to death. Well being that I don't shave sheep at all...... 

You shear the wool in half leaving wool on the sheep. If you were to shave it, you take it down to the skin. There is MASSIVE difference in that, it's not just me fussing about using the wrong word, they mean 2 totally different things. 

So, you can keep defending your ego or learn something. Sorry for correcting your ignorance and offending you.
