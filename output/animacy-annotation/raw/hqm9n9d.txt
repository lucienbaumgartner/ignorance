Also for those who have been sexually abused and raped as children they already have to live with shame depression and PTSD among other things. I think OPs post is somewhat ignorant and sheltered but I'm glad they are asking because some of us never had the choice of remaining virgins and to make anyone in that position to feel bad, negative or sinful is downright cruel and insensitive and to be frank that's unchristian if anything.

Personally if it's none of my business it's up to God to work with that person until they are able to help themselves. What I don't agree with is putting people on a pedestal for never making any mistakes in life.
