Han Solo. Kessel. Co op. Don't get too cocky (don't go into the battlefront completely reckless and unaware of your health bar cause the AI could wipe you out in a millisecond) and you might just end up with 150 + kills. Star cards: Broad Shoulders if you suck at getting headshots, if you are good at getting headshots with Han, switch Broad Shoulders for Keep Your Head Cool and then, Always keep Air Burst and Heavily Modified Blaster. There is also something called an Infinite Round Strat on Endor That you can do with Leia or Han.
