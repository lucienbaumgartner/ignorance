A lot of what I got was from your articles, what I do is keep digging after I read and you find out the DC police aren't on capital grounds so weapons weren't confiscated at the capital but leading up.

And most were people that were stupid and ignorant of laws, like you can't carry everywhere and some weapons are legal at home area but not there. I know a lot of knife laws are different and I still know morons who have carried brass knuckles since high school like it's a wallet.

Bottom line is there was no pre planned insurrection and the morons in the mob riled up the idiots and once that happens you get dumb shit. A few were trying to calm shit down but failed to the idiots who just grabbed what they could to force their way in.
