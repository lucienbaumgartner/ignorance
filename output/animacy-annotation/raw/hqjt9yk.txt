You're right, it's not a symptom, but to say introversion is not something to be struggled with is ignorant and simply untrue. People are afflicted with all sorts of different thoughts, and in a society where extroversion can be sometimes considered the superior personality trait, introverts can feel isolated, misunderstood, and like another user said phrases like *you're too quiet* or *you should go outside more and stop being a hermit* can leave an introvert feeling further isolated. It's great to see so many people content in their introversion, but I don't understand why theres a superiority complex amongst introverts that are content over introverts that struggle.
