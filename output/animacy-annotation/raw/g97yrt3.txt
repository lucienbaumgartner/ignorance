Seven months into a lock-down that was supposed to last two weeks. Ever notice how nobody says "flatten the curve" anymore? Nobody ever mentions how we need to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed, which was the original purpose of the shutdown. The narrative has somehow shifted to "beat coronavirus", which is impossible. So what are we doing? What is the justification for the continued lock downs?

It blows me away how many of my fellow Americans are ok with what's going on. I see people walking outside and driving alone with masks on a daily basis. How? How are people so scared and ignorant that they don't question the fearmongering bullshit that has been sold to them for the better part of a year now? You could tell these people that they need to be anally probed each month for their "health and safety" and they would voluntarily line up out the door for it.

I could honestly rant about coronavirus until I hit the character limit, but the thing that upsets me the most is this push for mask culture. Masks aren't going away from our society anytime soon, and it seriously saddens me to think of a future where fear dominates so many American lives. Even when this "pandemic" is over, people will still wear the masks, and they will continue to shame those who don't. It's anti-American.
