As a guy, I've always felt much less value in the "some crazy woman trying to trick you into a baby" argument than "this woman just tried to convince you to NOT protect her from whatever unknown disease you might have that she hasn't even asked about" argument.

How many men has she said this to? Are the men who've had risky, unprotected sex before been more or less likely to say "unsafe sex, fuck yeah".

If I'm not comfortable talking to you about when your last test was and what sexual partners you've had since, I'm not comfortable trusting you with my sexual health.

It's not the devious, planning, scheming woman who thinks you're the one she wants to trick somehow. It's the ignirant and unaware of the repurcussions of their health and yours that worry me.
