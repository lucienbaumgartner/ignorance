I wouldn’t usually jump to the whole “dump him” thing over celebrations or birthdays etc because I’m particularly very, very low maintenance for birthdays and things like that. I’d also point out that you can’t necessarily expect your solo boyfriend to replace the parties/celebrations that you may have had with your friend group because usually those types of celebrations (SO vs. group of pals) are pretty different from one another (vacations/dinners/intimate gifts vs. clubs or bars). 

The issue is not that he had to cancel plans on your birthday. It’s not even that you found people to cover your shift at work. It’s that he woke up, unapologetic, and wasn’t even aware that maybe you’d be down on your birthday. Why were plans cancelled? Could he not have done something else in their place, like a nice dinner, breakfast in bed, maybe flowers? He was completely unaware and inattentive and then bailed on you because you were upset over your birthday being a flop. If he knows that birthdays are a big deal to you, he should’ve definitely been more attentive and definitely shouldn’t have ghosted you when you were feeling lonely and vulnerable on your birthday.
