The people at those protests represent a failure of our education system and are a national embarrassment.

Imagine someone so gullible and ignorant that Fox/Sky News and some low-effort memes made by conspiracy-minded methheads convinced them to ignore the collective advice of every medical officer on the planet. Imagine such a knuckle-dragging cretin explaining why they protested mask, vaccine and lockdown mandates during a fucking pandemic. 

The interviews on the day with protestors was some truly uninformed, industrial strength cringe.
