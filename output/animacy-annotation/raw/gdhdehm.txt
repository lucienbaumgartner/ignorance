Ah yes, I also remember being in high school. I'd genuinely feel smug about how objectively correct my worldview was and wonder how so many people could be so unaware and incorrect.

Then I went to college and lived on campus and was surrounded by people who had a huge range of different beliefs and opinions, many of whom were reasonable, smart, or level headed, and had clearly put as much or more thought into their various beliefs as I ever did mine. 

Made me feel a lot less like I had all the answers, and more that the world is really fucking complicated and it's not just a matter of people who disagree with me being unintelligent. 

This guy just hasn't quite reached that point lol. Hopefully he'll grow out of it.
