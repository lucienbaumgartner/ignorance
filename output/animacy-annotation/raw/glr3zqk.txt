Pepper spray??? A 9 year old child?? Have you ever been pepper sprayed???

It's so unbelievably painful, it doesnt stop no matter what you do, it's a torture to such a sensitive parts of your body and the burning lasts for so long sometimes hours at a time.


As someone who has volunteered in a mental health hospital for children there were so many other ways to handle this-

1. After she is cuffed she can't really do anything to harm anyone- distance away the crowd from her and have a single officer stay with her to be a temporary companion to stick with- make them her voice of reason that doesn't use any sort of force whatsoever. A "good cop" is actually useful.

2. don't rush anything and let her calm down- panic can sometimes make you blind and unaware of situations.

3. LISTEN. She clearly repeatedly calls out for her father which could mean she finds his presenceas a sign of safety- USE IT: ask her about her father, whay about him makes her call out to him? Try to understand why is she looking for that figure in this scary situation.

4. Even when she gets in the car don't just dump her there and drive- she is obviously in crisis and needs help, she clearly doesn't want to harm any of the officers and she is just pushing and kicking away because that's all she can do to prevent harm to her.

There are many more options amd actions that could have been done to help this poor child. 

It's so much emotional damage that a few weeks of training could have prevented...
