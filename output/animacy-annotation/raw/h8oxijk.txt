The fact is: urban planning, access to recreation, transit, food, culture, diversity is light years ahead of what we have in Seattle.

Yep. And yet my fellow Americans are so ignorant and unaware of what's right beyond their border, everyone in America still seems to labor under the delusion that Seattle is this amazing laid back, perfectly green place, where life is happy and great, when in fact, it's long felt to me like a PNW version of L.A. in many respects, more and more, in which much of the natural beauty is ripped apart by insane 6-8 lane highways at many points, transit is spotty and segregated, and the explosion of tech has made it increasingly unlivable for everyone not working in the field, much like with SF. Yes, as an American, Canada's problem is that it's extremely economically linked to and dependent on this gigantic country next to it, which kind of dooms it from ever being a fully European style country IMO and experience thus far, even though it's leagues better than the US when it comes to many things and cohesion. That being said, it's still far away from European standards, and my Australian friend here in Van is appalled by how things here are compared to Australia..to make no mention of the US.
