Hard to say. Just plain old xenophobia manifesting itself is hateful and potentially scary ways. 

I am sure there is a fear of competition (see: they took our jobs meme) but that’s really small imo. 

Where I am in particular people can be extremely closed minded. If you don’t look, think, vote, eat, etc the same way as someone, they will dislike you. 
I also think there is a disproportionate disdain towards Muslims in particular here. They are seen as extremists,  strange, smelly, Incestuous, by the racists. And that it is only a matter of time before they begin to start taking over parts of cities, forcing their beliefs etc. 


It’s asinine, the reality is you have kids assimilating while trying to hide the more haram stuff from their parents. I dunno...I can’t speak like I know what goes on. I know I was distrusting or apathetic towards immigrants at one point but I was very young and ignorant. That evaporated with time for me, but for others it stewed inside and ..it’s scary.
