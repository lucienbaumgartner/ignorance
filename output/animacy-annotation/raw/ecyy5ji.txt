Short answer: Your personal performance is not representative.

Long answer: You had a big caliber spg with premium enhanced splash radius, an experienced crew and consumables on top of it. Then you went on a rampage. Nearly any knowledgeable player can do that. SPG farm damage from unaware and inexperienced players. The game has no dedicated tutorials to learn and prepare for that. Players have rarely the opportunity to train against arty. Most of them refuse to anyway. The setting, which you created, is not valid to measure and conclude anything objectively.

The better a player gets, the moreso less effective spg becomes against him. You do not really wonna balance a competitive game around casuals, who do not expect to be the one target out of fifteen and getting oneshot by it . Trust me on this please.

I play spg on different servers at different times and engage all kinds of more and less skilled players. A certain vehicle might be nice to have, but in the ends its all about your and their wits. When you encounter veterans you really need your teammates to create opportunities to be effective. Ever seen a SPG in esports?
