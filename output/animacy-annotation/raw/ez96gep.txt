Police work requires a lot of training and a lot of policy/procedures (despite what you may have heard. I have a university degree and considered police training to be the most challenging thing I’ve ever done). The general public is unaware and uneducated as to why cops do what they do a lot of the time. They haven’t experienced how the job actually feels or works. It’s necessary to have someone who understands all of that make a decision as to whether a cop did something wrong or not. 

With that said, a lot of those governing boards are made up of police officers AND civilians.
