1) I called the aspects of his comment “explaining” how justices interact with each other, in his bizarre food fight analogy “misinformation”, not “disinformation”. His analysis is simply incredibly misinformed and ignorant of how the courts work.

2) The court’s job is not to correct bad policy decisions by the executive, but rather to determine whether or not executive policy is constitutional. There are incredibly specific requirements in the way that SCOTUS analyzes things as a result. Thus, the outcome of a case is not how legal scholars evaluate its soundness. SCOTUS reviews the law and determines what it allows for/requires, they don’t determine if the policy the executive enacts is wise, only if it’s constitutional. I have no doubt there was a great deal of trepidation within the court about the wisdom of such a policy, but the issue that would have been discussed is whether or not in war time/exceptional circumstances and national security threats, the powers of the executive extend so far as to allow internment of Japanese Americans. There was some basis for the concern, as several Japanese Americans played key roles as informants to Japan in battles such as Pearl Harbor, etc.

In the sense of all that, what lawyers look at as bad decisions are scenarios where the law is misinterpreted. I won’t go into a historical case study of that because it would require you to go through a full semester of law school learning first, but suffice it to say your gripe regarding Korematsu is with the executive for implementing a policy you don’t like, and the remedy is at the ballot box.
