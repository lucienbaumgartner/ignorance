Economics has never been, and never will be, my strong suit, but I find arguments with it to be entirely moot due to the absolutely random and unpredictable nature of a player-driven market, excluding the one made about supply and demand.

Secondly, money now is great. Instant gratification is nice and all that. But if I only have one of a particular item and I know I'm not going to get more of that item any time soon, I want to get the most money I can get out of it. "Money now, need inv!" people ruin that by undercutting and not being patient. This is a video game. It's not like anyone here has in-game bills to pay or debts with high interest rates to pay off. All they get by undercutting is having a little more money ready for the off-chance that they conveniently see something they want appear at an affordable price right after they made their own sale.

Thirdly, sure, 500k can be made easily in-game by just running stuff, but that's not the point here. Undercutting is a scummy move, and isn't at all necessary. If people would be patient in a game where you're not forced to have a certain amount of money in your bank at any point, we would all be making more money in the long run. But because of how Economics works, all this raving and ranting makes me sound like the ignorant and naive one, so I don't know. I want to understand economics more, but I simply don't. Never had a class for it in college.
