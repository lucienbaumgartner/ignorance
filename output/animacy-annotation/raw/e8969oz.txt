I think a lot of our issues stem from my sister just being unorganized and unaware that the wedding wouldn't just happen all on it's own...the only thing she had her coordinator (a friend of hers) oversee was the changeover from ceremony chairs to reception tables. Immediately after the ceremony everything went to chaos and she had to go try to fix it, so I got stuck trying to read her notes on how to set everything up while she sorted out all the bickering vendors and lack of communication.
