There needs to be a bit of push and pull with restrictions.

I was watching the modeling presentation and for the first time ever, they starting showing the impact that restrictions have on mental health, and it was staggering.

Its not perfect, and there will be elements of risk, but we need to do more for those who are suffering, we don't get case counts for this stuff daily and the media doesn't give it enough of a voice, but those of us hurting mentally need something to grab onto. If it helps 100 people get better mentally but gives 5 more cases as an example, it has to be worth it.

There are two pandemics going on right now, one with a virus and one with mental health, we are incredibly mindful of one, incredibly obtuse and ignorant of the impact of the second.
