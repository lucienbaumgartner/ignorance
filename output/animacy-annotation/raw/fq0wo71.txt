Excess &amp; Avarice! Yes! That was the kicker for me as well!!

First and foremost—I can respect everyone’s interpretation of the strip. 
My take?
Do what you love. Whatever it is. Don’t settle for doing something you DON’T want to do...(especially when your PASSION is somehow involved)
...but to do so SOLELY because it’s EXPECTED of you by OTHERS? 
...that only makes it WORSE. 

Go to college.
Get a job. (If you like it, good! If not, doesn’t matter—
just plan to work ‘til you retire.)
Strive to be the boss. 
Buy A, B &amp; C by these set/recurring timelines. 
Reach THESE milestones. 
Engage in THESE cultural rituals. 
Train your offspring to adhere—STRICTLY—to the above. 

It’s bad enough that many of us accept and adhere to the above as some sort of happiness LAW. To be able shake free from that school of thought is hard enough. 
...but even if you’re able to, you then have to deal with EVERYONE ELSE who believes in this happiness law. 

Many individuals adhere to all of the above and are—sadly—TOTALLY unaware. UNHAPPY and UNAWARE. And for those who choose not to adhere—just as stated in the strip—they’re looked at as if there’s truly something wrong.  “excess and avarice” has been systematically...UPLOADED into so many of us so much to the point that if someone DOESN’T show signs of it, it’s almost...frowned upon. NEGATIVE in some way.  
Is there something wrong with living within ones means? 
Is it even POSSIBLE to do so and be “happy”?  
Do you know how many people would answer that with “No”? 
I think the individual in the strip—whether his love was drafting, model dinosaurs or whatever...simply made the decision to stop doing what he didn’t want to do —because he wasn’t happy doing it, yes—but I believe his focus was more of not feeling the need to continue doing what he hated due to the expectations of others/society and being content with THAT decision as well. 
It’s twofold.
