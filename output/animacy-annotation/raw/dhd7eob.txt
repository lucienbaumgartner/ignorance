Yup same. I hated him last season and thought he was a total misogynistic prick, but I kind of forgot that over the break. I went into episode one thinking he'd be like Kelly, a nice guy but has some issues, but I quickly remembered how disgusting he is. Then WWHL was just the cherry on top. He is so unaware and delusional.
