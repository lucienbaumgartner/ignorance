lmao, I was just adding to the above points (the ones I made, you yourself didnâ€™t actually make any valid ones) and Iâ€™m sure readers got more out of what I posted than what you did. 

And omg this is hilarious ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ you come at me out of nowhere and start swearing and carrying on like a little diva lmao, then act all hard and tough, venting your little problems onto the world 

Then when someone calls you out on them you act all innocent and like a wannabe intellect ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ youâ€™re a crack up mate, canâ€™t even script this honestly! Youâ€™d be an amazing character on a show! 

Hypocritical, rude, childish and ignorant of much of the world and the people within it, what a combination you are!
