I'm going to go fully unpopular opinion with a few different hot takes™:

* **The way that Barristan died in the TV Show was perfectly consistent with the way that GRRM writes the deaths of heroes.**

He died in an alley, stabbed by some unnamed goon. Instead of being outraged that one of the world's top swordsmen died in this way, consider some of the other great warriors of ASOIAF - Arthur Dayne (probably) got stabbed in the neck by a teenaged minor northern lord, Khal Drogo basically died of an infection, Syrio Forel got hacked down by Meryn "fucking" Trant, and so on. Historically, Daemon Blackfyre got riddled with arrows, even Aemon the Dragonknight himself got taken out by a couple random Toynes.

For every Rhaegar who gets killed in noble, one-on-one combat against an equal, there's **plenty** of all-time-great fighters who get outnumbered, mobbed, and killed. 

"But he wasn't wearing his plate, that's the inexcusable part!" - yeah, and he *just* finished reminiscing about how Rhaegar would go hang out with the smallfolk without caring about his own security. Barristan **fucked up**, he was being sentimental and prioritized communing with the people of Meereen above taking precaution while strutting around in a city in the midst of an active guerrilla campaign.  

Even after all that, he killed like 15 guys while he *wasn't* armored, which is a superhuman feat in something like ASOIAF that tries to treat sword fighting in a more grounded way than most fantasy. Someone as fearsome as The Hound struggled against 5 Lannister goons *with* his armor, and Arya backing him up to an extent - Barristan *cleaned up* against much greater odds. 

In the books, I suspect that Barristan is about to get mobbed and killed by Brazen Beasts following their coup in Meereen, as I personally ascribe to the theory that The Shavepate is obviously playing him, and is about to dispose of both Hizdahr and Barristan (an easy patsy). 

* **Dorne is Ultimately Pointless**

The Show version of Dorne basically stands in a uniquely terrible position - it has some of the worst scenes in the entirety of A Game of Thrones, some of the dumbest dialogue, and ultimately served no purpose beyond killing off Myrcella. I don't think that's really up for debate.

Where I'm going to swerve into highly unpopular territory is that I believe the book version of Dorne is equally as useless, if written more cleverly. I see a lot of people praising the intrigue and conspiracies in Dorne, which there's certainly a lot of, but none of them actually lead anywhere meaningful within the scope of the greater plot of ASOIAF, and I think that the end of the Dorne plot in the books is going to be uncomfortably similar to the end of the plot in the show.

Doran gets praised for his Vengeance, Justice, Fire and Blood speech, but his grand conspiracy (so far as we know) culminated in sending his notably weiner-ish son to woo the most powerful woman in all of Essos. Quentyn's chapters were enough of a shaggy dog tale on their own (they can be summarized as "conditions during war lead to plague, plague is bad, then the dragons broke free"), but even in-universe this is just laughably bad planning.

Seriously, the first time Barristan lays eyes on Quentyn when he shows up with his proposal, Barristan's reaction is basically "haha look at this fucking weenie trying to marry the Queen of Dragons". It was **never going to succeed** and even someone who's noted to have a hard time grasping political conspiracies figures that out **the instant the plan is revealed to him**. It took SEVENTEEN YEARS for this plot to come to anything resembling fruition.     

Of course, Arianne (and probably Doran as well following Quentyn's death) are going to latch on to a *different* Targaryen claimant, but this is mere opportunism and the fortune that Arianne is both unwed, firmly against the Throne, and aggressive enough to pursue Aegon on her own accord. This is Oberyn-esque opportunism, not Doran-led plotting. So, at the end of the day, yes, Dorne has relevance to Aegon's plot, but it has taken them forever to get there (SEVENTEEN YEARS of letting their end goal run around Essos unguarded and unaware), and the Dornish plotline — from AFFC up until whenever they link up with Aegon — can be summarized by "The Dornish Conspire Amongst Themselves". 

When Aegon loses his Dance against Daenerys, the Dornish will disappear from the rest of the plot just as they have in the show. 

* **There is too much focus on Worldbuilding at the expense of Plot**

This is where I expect to receive the most criticism, since I completely understand that a lot of people enjoy ASOIAF precisely because of its deep world, enormous cast, and layers upon layers of intrigue and foreshadowing, but I am of the opinion that GRRM has become lost in his own garden.

I like Brienne as a character, and I understand why her chapters in AFFC are so well loved by many people, but almost her entire plotline is just killing time in the actual scope of the novels. We, as readers, **know** that she won't find Sansa in the Riverlands. This use of dramatic irony doesn't enhance Brienne's plot at all, since the main thrust of her chapters is instead to explore the horrors of war, but her search for Sansa has been turned into a MacGuffin by this loss of an actual end goal. The plot doesn't actually advance until Brienne encounters Lady Stoneheart.

The above Dorne example is expanding the scope and scale of the world he's written, adding more characters and their associated plots and motivations and fates and *dozens of chapters*, with the end result of *maybe* affecting Aegon or Sam's plotlines. Similar criticisms could be leveled against the Ironborn, although at least most of them have already intersected with the primary plotlines. 

Personally, I prefer AGoT-ASoS significantly over AFFC and ADwD, and I think that this is because nearly every chapter in the earlier novels drives the plot. In the latter two, many of the chapters are essentially filler - finely written and exploring some deeper messages, of course, but filler nonetheless. For an honest question, what do Aeron Greyjoy's chapters actually add that couldn't have been covered by Asha or Victarion's chapters? Are Areo Hotah's chapters actually necessary, or would witnessing the same events from Arianne's point of view be sufficient? 

Does "Daenerys learns how to rule" require the exploration of Volantine politics, of the state of Astapor post-battle, or the culture and conflicts of Pentos? Do these additional plot details (Elephants vs. Tigers, the war of Yunkai against Astapor, or the Tattered Prince and whatever conspiracy *he* is involved in) serve to drive Daenerys forwards, or are they simply expanding the scope of Essos?

As a meta-example, the amount of work that GRRM has put into the history of his world seems to have outpaced the amount of work he's putting into the "present events" of ASOIAF - he's written, what, a few hundred thousand words for *Fire and Blood*?
