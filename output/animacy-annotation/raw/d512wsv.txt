It was actually my cousin's neighborhood, and there were quite a few. I was helping him move in, and was unaware of  it being off-base military housing (of which I was untold and unaware)... 

That said, we finished for the day, and were letting the kids watch the huge ones up the street coming from the local outdoor BBQ/Concert place (an actual restaurant here with a hillbilly vibe, but amazing food) when I decided to grab my smoke bombs and bottle rockets left from the pre-game the night before.

I'm all smoke bombs and 5 bottle rockets in, and the neighbor comes out, and explains that the cops are about to be there to patrol, and that she was the (I'd say overbearing watchdog, y'know, that one lady who has nothing better to do than act like she's the founder of some rabid home-owners' association, and thinks she owns everything, with 911 set to SpeedDial #1) Neighborhood Wellness Rep, and really politely explains that it's illegal to shoot fireworks in the area, that she wasn't threatening me or anything, and that her husband, along with others around, have PTSD, and that it'd just be best if I stopped.

I did stop, with no problem, and being a veteran myself, I have a tinge of PTSD, especially when it gets hot or I'm depressed (I get nightmares and flashbacks, just not the kind from tv where I think I'm back in 'nam, or in my case Iraq or Afghanistan, I just wake up thinking I need to grab my rifle, and sometimes illogically think trashcans are IEDs, etc.)



EDIT: TL;DR
There were lots at first, but was a VA neighborhood, so it got shut down quick. It was ok.
So, all in all, I'd say there were a lot of illegal fireworks shot off, and my opinion is that sure, wrong place, right time, but had it been elsewhere, Id've thought they were badass. 
My kids loved it and were pretty upset until I explained the reason why we couldn't do anymore.
