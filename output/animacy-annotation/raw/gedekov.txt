&gt; Jesus H. Christ, are you fucking kidding me? Do you seriously believe that all impoverished people own cars, have access to medical care, have electricity, have a cell phone, have access to the internet, etc.?

I never said all.  However, the the typical person below the poverty line does.

&gt;150 million Americans struggle with medical dept. That's nearly half the population. 50 million Americans go to bed hungry every night, including 15 million children.

Source?

&gt;Are you so privileged and ignorant that you've never met a homeless American? Because there are over 1 million of them. 

Never said there wasn't.

&gt;Nearly 1 billion people worldwide have no access to electricity or running water, but hey fuck them because they're not American and don't count, right?

My comment was specifically about the US.

&gt;I am honestly fucking appalled that you have the utterly heartless temerity to believe that poor people today are better off than rich people a century ago. For fucks sake you asshole, maybe do 5 minutes of research before you post such a blatantly inaccurate and frankly insulting take.

I have done the research, which is why I made my statement.  All you have are baseless personal attacks and emotional appeals.
