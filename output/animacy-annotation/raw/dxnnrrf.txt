there's so much rampant abuse that reading headlines from the years 2011-2015 are absurd. You can tell we Americans have been bred to be unaware and compliant because no one batted an eye when OBama signed that 2012 NDAA which basically made our Constitution swiss cheese. 

We literally had our State Mainstream Media  telling us 'Oh now we're "working with" Al Qaeda'....Bitch..you don't 'work' with Al Qaeda. You give them guns so they can continue a holy war against the muslim groups you disagree with.
