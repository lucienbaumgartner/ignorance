A hundred plus years of Southern revisionist propaganda called "The Lost Cause" that tried to shift the South from being traitors fighting to destroy the nation and keep a people in bondage, to instead fighting for their rights against an oppressive Federal government.

Lincoln can't be the villian in this story since he was already painted as a martyr by the entire world, so the number 2 in the war became the villian. Grant went from brilliant general who could tenaciously wear down an unbeatable enemy, to a bloodthirsty drunk in war who carelessly ordered the slaughter of thousands and was too drunk to even ride his horse to oversee a battle. His Presidency went from even handed reconstruction of the South, hunting down the KKK and other neo-Confederate terrorists, and overseeing Manifest Destiny, the unlocking of the West for the American people, to a historic perception of an administration so mired in corruption that it couldn't function due to Grant being completely inept and unaware of how the government worked.

Grant was adored worldwide in his time and, for a couple of generations after, he was held up with Washington as one of the greatest American generals and leaders in history, however the Lost Cause propaganda was tenacious and unrelenting at tearing him down from his pedestal decades after he died.
