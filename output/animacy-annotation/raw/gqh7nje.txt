Literally two quick knocks and a shout of "police" can save an officers (and hopefully civillians) life in the event of a mistake targeting an unaware and suddenly defensive civilian. If police already have a warrant to search a property they are entering regardless of what you say and are prepared to do so. Specifically in the case of your 20 person drug house if flashbangs didn't affect their stupor much neither will someone shouting police.
