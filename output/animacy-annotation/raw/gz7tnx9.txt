If they had both been in the same intoxicated state then perhaps it wouldn’t be rape, but Ruby knew what was going on and recalled a lot of what happened and that Otis was completely black out drunk and unaware of what was happening meant he couldn’t act how he wanted to. If Ruby had been blackout drunk and Otis a tipsy or slightly drunk and they had sex, would you be saying that he raped her? Yes, you would because that is rape. So why is it different when it’s the other way around? Rape is rape, regardless of gender and the genders involved.
