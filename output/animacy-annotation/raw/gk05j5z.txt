I think you did the right thing. Most likely the cops wouldn't have cared since it was a woman with a push chair and not a teenager trying to hop the turnstiles.

If they did stop you, they probably would have let you go since you are foreign and unaware of the rules. But you never know with NYPD so you made the right call.
