Prettipls and her bro are just fighting fire with fire.

The ad is distasteful I gotta admit, but the vid was uncalled for as well. They are just inciting more hate with their actions.

A few months back, Prettipls Brother Subhas was also flaming toshrock about his past LGBT tweets which were years back and he called for Toshrock to be removed as an ally. Tosh has shared how he was unaware and ignorant about LGBT issues in the past when he was still a Pinkdot Ally. 

But Subhas still has to call him out on that? Now he does this ðŸ˜— That guy probably just wants to brand himself as more woke and relevant, but he is just trying to subtly incite more hate under the mask of equality and justice for all.
