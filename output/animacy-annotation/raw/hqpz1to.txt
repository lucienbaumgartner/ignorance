In my opinion they should be seen as less than human! They may not think they’re bad people and they may think they’re doing the right thing…but so did nazis. Hundreds of millions of people have died from covid, my friends, my family, have died from covid even though they were vaccinated. All because some delivery person or some random they passed in a store are too caught up in propaganda to help save lives. People are dying all around us and all over the world. And there are still people unwilling to get a vaccine. Something people have done to get past every major disease in human history. At this point it’s beyond ignorant and selfish not to get vaccinated. It’s downright evil because these people WILL spread the disease. They WONT care who it effects or how it effects them. They’re just trying to prove a point or are over trying to be part of the solution and care more about “living their lives”. Obviously it sucks for the people not fully capable of making the choice to get vaxxed. But the ones that can and choose not to are disgusting selfish people imo. They can burn in hell for helping to kill people in my family and friend group, as well as others family n friend groups from around the world. Thank you
