Actually sheltering is often more damaging to development and traumatizing than physical abuse or other forms of emotional abuse (with exception of extremes). Dr. Peter Gray illustrates in his book Free To Learn why kids and youth absolutely need free uninhibited play as part of full autonomy to develop healthy and be capable of taking on the world. 

The hyper sheltering of millennials on forward is actually a shift in parenting, and is likely the main cause of the youth independence crisis. This is closely tied to the social justice epidemic, which makes it all the more obnoxious and ignorant that bandwagon social justice skeptics use it as another reason to blame kids and youth. It's just repackaging the standard belief that kids and youth are stupid and not worthy of autonomy, which is the root of the problem in the first place.
