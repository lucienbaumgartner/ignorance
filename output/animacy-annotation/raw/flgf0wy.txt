No prep time then the TMNT take this handily.

They regularly fight mutant animals more mutated then themselves and highly trained ninjas as well as having superhuman strength and speed themselves with years of martial arts training.

The penguins are great and they’ve hijacked a whole freight ship on their own but they fought the crew while the crew were unaware and likely wouldn’t have been able to beat the lady from Madagascar 3 if she had full gear while she just doesn’t compare to the types of characters the TMNT face daily.
