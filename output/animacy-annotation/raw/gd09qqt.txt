Maybe increasing  radiation levels meant it was impossible for humans to live on earth outside a container so they designed cars to be their permanent  housing. Inside every one of them is a human controlling it without even they exist. Everything in their brains believes their a car, they're completely numb and unaware of their own bodies existence. They ARE the car.
