That's true but I'd say that if a marriage is flailing, the temptations are numerous. And if it's not some guy who's aware of the situation, it's going to be one who's unaware, and totally innocent.

Way too often people blame external forces for the failure of their marriage, when in fact, it's the lack of attempts to face and address the issues that is the problem.

My STBX hates the girl I cheated on her with, even though she barely knows her. She is convinced that our divorce is due to her (even though that girl has now been a friend for years, and I just filed divorce). That she is a homewrecker. 

The truth is, the real homewrecker is my STBX who refused to have dialogues about things that I was unhappy with and I found unfair in our marriage. She'd block communication, she would give me the silent treatment every time I would talk about my frustrations, as if to punish me for voicing them.

When people blame a 3rd party for wrecking their marriage, that means they have zero sense of accountability and ability to introspect. And that's sad for an adult.
