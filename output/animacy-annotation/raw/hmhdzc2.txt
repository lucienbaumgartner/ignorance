Look at everyone downvoting me, because they are uneducated and unaware of [California's Proposition 47.](https://nypost.com/2021/11/22/mobs-of-looters-are-grabbing-goods-in-california-thanks-to-downgraded-shoplifting-laws/)  


Don't hate me because you aren't up to speed on laws in your state. Be angry at the people who enacted such laws and voted for the politicians to make it happen.  


*"In 2014, California adopted Proposition 47, which made thefts of $950 or less a misdemeanor. Once people realized that they were unlikely to be arrested or prosecuted for stealing below $1,000, they, of course, responded to the incentive. For their part, the stores advise employees not to interfere with shoplifters lest they get hurt. Many crimes donâ€™t even go reported."*
