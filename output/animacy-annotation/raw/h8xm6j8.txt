I won't deny, it is condescending. I *do* look down on people like this, I can't help it. They don't live in reality, they have an overinflated sense of self-importance, but the biggest factor in my disdain is that they are *willfully* uneducated and ignorant of the actual machinations and systems which force them to be reliant on that industry for their very survival in the first place. To the point that they actually fight with all their strength to preserve that very system which has oppressed them. Bumbling unthinking reactionaries...I have a hard time trying to "respect" the viewpoint of people like that.
