Hey, this is Kinjou! I am very happy to receive a critique. Thank you very much.

I am a new writer and your analysis was very easy to understand. You pointed out problems that I didn't even knew to look for and I will definitely address these issues in my rewrite and further works. 

I agree with your first 2 points. 

The third point, well it was for humour. I hope it didn't come out too annoying, do let me know if it did.

The fourth point, I agree with that too. I didn't realise it due to my lack of experience

The fifth point, I wrote it like that to give the sense of 'mansplaining' by narrator. The narrator is kind of an a-hole, he is arrogant and ignorant of the world he lives in. And petty too. But it may also be a serious issue on my side as a 'writer' and not a 'narrator'. Did the personality of narrator come out right? 

I also agree with points 6 and 7.

Okay, now! I don't wanna be that guy but can you tell me more about humour in the story. I was really worried about that the humour would fall flat. I am not asking for praises (I know how this looks like), does it really flow nice and smooth? Did it feel like I was trying too hard to be funny? I'm a funny guy irl but most of my jokes come from knowing my friends well so I often worry if my jokes work among barely acquainted people.

And again, thank you! This is really helpful.
