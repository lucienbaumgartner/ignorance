You're completely correct, but I think you missed an important point as to why brats get so much hate in the community. You touch on it with the real negotiations but lose it because you enjoy the brattiness.

In my experience, brattiness is usually not negotiable. Most brats identify their defiance as part of who they are rather than something they do for fun. You would not believe the number of times I've straight up said "I don't like brats" during negotiations to be met with something like "Okay I'll try not to but I can't help it, it's who I am".

It's seriously off-putting. Like, can you imagine if the roles were reversed? "Hey, I know you just said you don't like spankings but I'm a spanker". It comes across as completely selfish and unaware that you're playing a game together with someone else.
