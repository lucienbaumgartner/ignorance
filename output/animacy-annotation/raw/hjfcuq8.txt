Forgive them for their ignorance. Ignorance is a natural reaction to the world and overall sense-making. Without ignorance, you'd literally die as you'd go and try out every single thing in existence until it'd harm you. 

You father is simply afraid to grow above his current level of consciousness as it would likely harm him. Imagine if he becomes a social justice warrior and fights against the Healthcare or Politics corruption. Worst case scenario he gets assassinated by some group which makes money from the currently abusive system. That's why he says you won't be able to do good: not because you can't, but because he's afraid and unaware of what's possible. 

As to what's possible, you can be both infinitely harmful in life and infinitely useful and loving. It's your choice what you will become, not someone else's.
