The irony is that this question is itself ignorant. I am American. I am not racist. I know more than one language. I know a great deal about other countries, and I'd bet I could beat just about anyone in a head to head geography test. I have traveled and lived abroad. I genuinely enjoy learning about other places.

Sure, some people here are racist and ignorant. That is true of every place. I don't know what country you come from, but I guarantee I could point to certain people and groups in your country and ask the same thing. I would encourage you to come spend some time here before assuming that Americans as a group are just a bunch of racist idiots that don't care about anything other than the USA.
