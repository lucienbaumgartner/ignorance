I looked at the data and agree. The data was not very easy to find, it was hidden behind what seemed to be forced conclusions that people need to get vaxxed, basically. Not only that, it seems to me at least, the vaxxed are a greater danger to other vaxxed people since they are more likely to be asymptomatic and unaware that they have it. So itâ€™s seems to me to be such bullshit the vaxxed take up this attitude towards the unvaxxxed like they are such a danger to vaxxed. And such a shame these arguments seem to be unable to be heard or taken seriously before they are dismissed as antivax propaganda, as seen in this thread and prevalently across society at large. Thanks for sharing your perspective in the face of all that.
