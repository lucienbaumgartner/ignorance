Everybody generalizing in this thread are actually just ignorant and also happy to be asked for their shitty opinions.  Also, if you are the 2nd or the 400th person to call the Beatles overrated, just read the responses and find the appropriate one to add on to. Same for rap music, pop music and old vs new, etc. 
reddit really need a find-in-thread function.
