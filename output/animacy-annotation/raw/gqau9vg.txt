I am deeply offended by your use of the word 'pecker' as I study Ornithology and most bird lack the ability to defend themselves. Please you alternate names such as ~~trouser bologna~~, womb broom, or crumple foreskin. 

Edit: I apologize to all bologna enthusiast's that may take offense to my previous comment it was insensitive and ignorant of me. 

You are correct.
