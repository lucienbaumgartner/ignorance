if what i understand is correct, in the santa movies santa is absolutely real, but the majority of people believe that he isn't, so this is portraying a world where the general population is wrong and unaware that they are wrong. the santa deniers are usually represented by miserly old guys or tightly wound business people, who has lost the magic in their lives and can no longer see what is true. this is totally opposite from flatlanders or UFO abductees who claim to be the only ones that can see the truth.
