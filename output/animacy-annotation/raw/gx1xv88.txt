This mindset is way too old and ignorant of recent changes to zoos. Sure some zoos/sanctuaries aren't great and many are in other countries. But many American zoos have too many regulations to keep them safe. They are born into captivity or are saved as ambassador animals because their environment is being destroyed. Orangutans in specific are saved from illegal pet trading and brought to safe areas for them. Many zoos create areas for animals to hide from people. The zoos care and are not just kidnapping animals to show off like a trophy. Its for good reason now.
