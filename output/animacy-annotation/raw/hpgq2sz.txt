Why should I NOT post things from Noelle mains? If the majority of us are all toxic, we should be shitting on other characters right? But if you took 3 seconds to read ANY of them, they're all defending Itto.  Sounds like to me you didn't read a single one of the things I posted. 

At this point, you've proved that you're just spreading misinformation. You have no proof. My proof is in front of you. And you're refusing to acknowledge it. Like all Noelle main haters do. 

Attributing toxicity to an entire characters mains because of one person's toxicity is ignorant and dangerous. 

You owe us an apology, son.
