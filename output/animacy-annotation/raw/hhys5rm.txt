Lots of these are basically CP, other terrible forms of porn, and gore. Can't deny that those are awful. But for me, the most fucked-up stuff I've seen was at a nursing home I volunteered at for half a year.

Things that cause trauma and death are terrible. But seeing people live through their own decay, slowly turning into vegetables over a period of years while still conscious, haunts me much more.

I've seen cases of very advanced Alzheimer's where the victim is terrified and unaware of where he/she even is (even when reminded every couple of minutes), severe brain damage to the point of turning people into blank-eyed animals, grown men's diapers being changed, an ancient woman who babbled and screamed nonsense words with a deformed tongue and passionate intensity, others who suffered through series of strokes that progressively took away more of themselves, and many others who had lost everything that once made them who they were. There were not many visits from family to that place.

The pain and suffering that these elderly go through at the end of life continues for years as they progressively fall apart. And death, when it finally comes, is generally not some peaceful hospital bed surrounded by friends and family. These people usually die alone, hooked up to machines, and if they still have any consciousness at all, it is full of confusion and fear.

All of this is pretty good reason for an advance healthcare directive, IMO. I'd rather die by hurling myself off a cliff with a beautiful view than be consigned to such an end.
