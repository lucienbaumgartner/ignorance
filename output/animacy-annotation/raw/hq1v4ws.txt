&gt;Listen, i'm not a diehard Kanye fan, but labelling his music as non-experimental or bland just seems ignorant and childish.

There's honestly a lot more creative and original rappers than Kanye, the industry just finds his style easy to reproduce so its an easy money maker. Easy to make and people don't really question if it's any good or not. Win-win for lazy execs.

They know that rap/pop fans are elitists that will defend any artist that the industry assures them are good and part of the in-groipm
