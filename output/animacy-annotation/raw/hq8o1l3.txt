The religious infection our species suffers from is one of the reasons I do not believe our species is going to survive climate change and the many human conflicts, and diseases it will dump upon us. Religion divides us and makes us irrational and frankly stupid in the face of real danger.   

The American experience with something as straight forward as a virus pandemic demonstrates clearly that religion does NOT prepare us for survival. It greatly hampers every attempt at rational response to everything.

In America, right now, your primary victim of covid, over ninety percent of those in hospitals and morgues, are people who are unvaccinated for mostly religious reason. They cry loudly that their evil god thing is punishing gays with an ai9r borne virus, yet the majority of current victims are freaking politicized evangelicals Christians who believe they are the only genuinely moral people in the world.    

If this virus was created by a god to punish someone, it is very obvious who is being punished. Are evangelical Christians all secretly gay?   That is a legit question IF you think the virus is here to punish gay people.  I suppose their god must be as stupid, ignorant, and blind as they are.  Either that or it hates bigoted politicized religious nuts.

No, it is just a damned virus that stupid religious people have become willing victims of. Zero sympathy for people who kill themselves, their friends, and their families, for such stupid reasons.
