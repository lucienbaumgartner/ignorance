This comes up all the time from Europeans, so let me just say this. In the US we have a different understanding of things like nationality and ethnicity, influenced by our multi-ethnic citizenry and history of immigration. You’re being obtuse when you intentionally fail to understand this simple concept.

We are separated from Europe by thousands of miles and hundreds of years. We do things differently. That doesn’t mean we do them wrong.

Imagine if I went to Germany and insisted on things being explained to me using Imperial measurements, and how rude and ignorant that would be. That’s essentially what you’re doing.
