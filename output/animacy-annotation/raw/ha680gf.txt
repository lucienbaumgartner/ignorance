It’s easy for someone invested in Cardano to feel a sense of superiority because of the price appreciation lately but everyone would do best to reminder yourself it’s mostly LUCK in one way or another that we all probably stumbled across the project and most of us are horribly under-educated on the technicals and ignorant of most of the industry’s history so please always reminder yourself to try and stay humble and open to new information and not to become complacent in your knowledge and involvement in the crypto space. That’s how you become a maxi and miss out on future developments and new projects.
