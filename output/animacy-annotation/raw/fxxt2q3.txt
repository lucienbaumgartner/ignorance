First, please stop with the socialism nonsense. These are social policies and laws applied in the most capitalistic countries on earth. We are not talking an an entire ideology. Most americans are brainwashed that everything that improves the quality of life for the general population is "socialism", it's really pathetic and ignorant. 

That said, I don't think you understand what the effect on the US economy  is on the long term without universal healthcare or more social safety nets. 

Of all Covid-19 cases maybe 1% will perish. Of all Covid-19 cases between 20 to 40% of the patients will have permanent heart, lung or brain damage to a certain degree. 

That means a large portion of the workforce will be affected. Most of which do not have the financial means to cover long term health expenses, and even if they do, they might never even be able to work again. 

What are the current republicans laws and social nets to prevent this? The answer is none.
