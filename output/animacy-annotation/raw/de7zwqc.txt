Sheesh !. That's quite a read. Barry did a lot of things that I don't agree with but lifting the ban on proganda to my mind was the most destructive. I think we can all agree that the "unaware and compliant" citizenry of the far left will buy this without question. That the essential message is don't use your words just use violence is evident now. The whole no need to prove they are doing it just believe us when we tell you they are may as well have come straight from CNN. It does appear they have realised that they are the fascists and are trying to prevent their peeps from looking up the definition. Even if they did look up the definition of fascism Google changed it to suggest it was right wing anyway. A lot of work has gone into this. I smell a Soros.
