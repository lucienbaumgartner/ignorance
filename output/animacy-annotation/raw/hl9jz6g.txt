Can we just stop the woe is me narrative? Everyone wants to crucify this boy for doing what? Protecting his neighborhood? Here's a scenario, young man DOESNT shoot angry mob allegedly attacking him is this just collateral damage? Like thats what white people get for being white? You play with fire u get fucking burned. My problem is why was a 17 y.o. kid doing what I pay my fucking taxes for the government to allegedly be doing. I can't drive drunk or do drugs (neither of which I actually do) but you can allow an angry mob to attempt to burn an entire city to the ground? Everyone in here defending ANY riot is irrational and ignorant. That is not an opinion that is a fact. You are all blind sheep playing out racially orientated narratives portrayed by a government that does not give a fuck about you. There is no left or right, black or white. There is only us, the little man, getting shit on by corporate America year in and year out and you all just fall for it every fucking time. They need the division so we can't attack them on the real issues like the elite level of pedophilia or the hunger problems in this country. The drugs, sex trafficking, global warming, the shit they don't want to be fixed so they distract. Why don't they want these things fixed? Bc it would hinder the most advantageous global markets. WAKE THE FUCK UP PEOPLE, WE ARE LOSING.
