I didn't, but I would guess it's because, in your post, you are questioning other people's life choices internally comparing them to yours thinking you are in a similar situation, but in that comment, you clearly show it's not even comparable. The best comparison I can find is this:

You, part of 10% of the population living in a city\*: Why are people even buying cars? I take public transportation every day and it works for me and is better for the environment. Are they socially pressured to do like everyone and have a car?

The people you are talking about: \*\*Literally live in a rural area with no public transportation 40km  from the city and hospital\*\*

(\*factual to represent that not many people globally have to do grad studies for law school)

See how that sounds weird and unaware that living in the city is the exception, not the norm? That would be my guess but maybe there's another reason.
