Everyone on the same flight as her, yes. Me? Not necessarily. I was trying to make a point. 

I had baggage claim next to a flight that landed from Shanghai and flew in from the US. Does that require self-isolation, IMO that would be an overstretch. Does that mean I’m being ignorant about not doing anything, no. I’m not about to reveal to a random ‘redditor’ my personal life circumstances. But it’s likely I could be one of the only people aware there’s a chance I *maybe* could have come into contact with someone exposed at the airport. Blame the Government for not notifying the other people on that same flight.

I think you should worry about everyone else that may have also come into contact with *someone*, and is completely unaware and oblivious about it.
