You got a puppy and your wife is now upset that the puppy…is a puppy.

What breed of puppy did you get? That will largely determine how long you can expect this, but other than that, it seems your wife was unprepared and unaware of what getting a puppy entails. Comparing an old dog to a puppy is just unfair.

This is like asking if there’s a way to make an infant not cry. It doesn’t matter what you do. Short of irrevocably breaking him/her, they have to go through this phase to come out on the other side. 

And how you do this phase affects EVERYTHING.
