Pfffffft 

Right over your head. You should read up on the history of toxicology. What u/Stomatin wrote and what I added get to an important concept in our understanding of our body’s response to substances. 

Your sarcasm is so unfounded and ignorant that it’s glaring. 

Along the lines of doses and your body’s reaction to external substances has been the recent (last 20 years) advances in understanding allergies and autoimmunity. If you have a severe allergy, the now common treatment is to not avoid the allergen, but instead be administered sub-reactive doses of the allergen to build tolerance but not a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis

But hey if you’re an expert in LD50’s and Kd’s, pharmacokinetics and toxicology, apologies for pointing out the obvious to you. Hopefully other Redditor’s can benefit, but clearly not you all knowing one.
