Staying away from people is obviously a challenge for my mental health, but I'm trying to *not fucking die or have permanent lung damage for the rest of my life*. That outweighs my need to socialize in groups at this time.  Besides, I'm maintaining my physical and mental health by keeping in contant with friends and family and having lots of exercise outside every day. You go get drunk with your bros, I'm sure it's much healthier for you.

Politicians put their own lives at risk because they are selfish and reckless. That does not mean this virus isn't dangerous and that social distancing doesn't work. I don't give a fuck what some politician does or says, I'm distancing from people. Not because some asshole tells me to but because I don't want to get sick with this virus. I know people who have been in covid wards, people who have died.  If you aren't taking this seriously at this point, you're being willfully obtuse and ignorant of what this virus can do to you and your family members.

I know a family with three kids mourning their dad right now. He wasn't even fifty. And now those kids get to grow up without a dad. Because he got covid. He was reasonably healthy, too. Not obese or sick. Just a normal guy. You go and tell his family that they should all go out and socialize because they're fucking stupid.
