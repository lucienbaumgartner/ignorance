Nah grab a history book (you can use Google too) like I said kiddo. It's a waste of my time to try and explain 200 years of racial inequality that black people have faced in this country to somebody that doesn't care enough to do the smallest bit of their own research.

If you wanna remain stupid and ignorant of history that's fine with me
