There is more entertainment options fir sure, but I found that the increased cost of living meant that the amount I could eat out, go to events etc was net quite a bit lower.

Transit is pretty good in Montreal and Vancouver but still ouldbuse a lot of improvement, especially if you rely on the bus systems to get to a rail station. Montreal especially is pretty tough if you aren't already in the core. Toronto isn't great and Calgary is somehow worse then Saskatoons.

As far as the people I can honestly say I didn't notice a difference between Saskatoon or any of those cities. The amount of ignorant and rude people seems to be a pretty steady constant no matter where you go, if anything Toronto and Montreal seem a little worse 

But to each their own. I tell people all the time if you feel that was take the plunge and move, go in with an open mind but keep your expectations in check.
