Has it ever occurred to her that people in this country self medicate because we don’t have the proper amount of mental health care or awareness. We walk around all day blinded and unaware that we aren’t like other people. So often in my life I have been tempted to try meth just because I heard of a woman who cleaned her whole house on meth and I thought “maybe I would be able to do it too if I had just a little. Not even a lot” your mind goes through shit when you don’t know why your mind isn’t doing the right thing. I have never abused drugs and the doctors here in my state are still denying me treatment because maybe I might abuse adderall who knows? Don’t take any chances. I switched doctors because the whole “no stimulants no matter what” policy is so fucking regressive. 
They can’t fathom someone who was an abuser only did so because they were at their wits end and had no control in their lives and they thought it was the last resort. These people always say shit like “just reach out. Just ask for help.” Then you do and they paint you with a broad brush. You’re on MediCal so they see “poor person gonna abuse drugs hurr” a rich dude could walk in and get adderall and chop it up and snort it and as long as he wasn’t some “poor slob” he can’t be as detrimental to society as the poor man. Rich people can use and abuse all day but it’s the poor they think are the problem. Sigh sorry. Tangent. I am so sorry I hope you get back on proper treatment soon. Is that the only doctor that you can see on MediCal?
