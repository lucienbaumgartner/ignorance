You literally tried to bring her up as an example of somebody who got famous despite not playing the "social game" (which is literally just human interaction, calling it a game is ignorant and just dismissive of those who engage in the world whose rules you don't like), when it was her family who did it for her after her passing.

If you want to have public eyes on your work without putting _in_ the work, then feel free take a page from Dickinson's book and wait for somebody else to do it for you. Hint: it probably won't happen in your lifetime.
