I love y’all but a lot of comments kinda missed the mark here. Celebrities often leave their kids from the public eye ON PURPOSE so they don’t get traumatized/turn out weird. (MJ, Britney, Beyoncé, the entire cast of FRIENDS, literally anyone with a huge following) AC is is just unaware and ignorant. Who is anyone to decide why this is happening? Breh wtf is her issue
