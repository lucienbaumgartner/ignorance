&gt;Dude, I don't you understand what a plural society is.

Racial minority is not the only thing that makes a country "plural", religious and ethnic diversity also makes up for that

&gt;you should know that Malay and Chinese are not a monolith either and both races consist of various subgroups as well

So what? We also have major ethnicities here like Acehnese, Batak, Malay, Minangkabau, Sundanese, Banjar, Dayak, Javanese, Balinese, and Madurese for the western part of the country that waged war and killed each other in the past, **and even then** those ethnics also have subgroups among them.

And that's not even counting the central and eastern part of the country, and the multiple religion these people believed in. So saying that only racial diversity is what makes a country "plural" is pretty ignorant and naive as hell
