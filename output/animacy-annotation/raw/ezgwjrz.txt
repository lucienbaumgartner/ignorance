I think a lot of people hear "cancer" and assume the worst diagnostically, then ultimately assume the worst in terms of what a patient looks like. It's not a negative reaction, just a misinformed one. Both my dad and a friend had skin cancer removed, and I know of two people who had prostate cancer. None of them looked like "cancer patients." Different illnesses affect different people differently. Unfortunately wrestling fans are so jaded and ignorant that even the most serious thing in the world invokes a ridiculous reaction.  


Anyway, thanks for sharing your story, glad you're doing ok. Good luck going forward.
