My post was about the virus,.not Trump. Read it again.


Also your second post is entirely if entirely wrong and ignorant of the dangers a virus like COVID had on our medical systems and the well being of people that has nothing to do with the virus.

Additionally, you're trying to downplay COVID as only people with bad health problems and the old dying when referring to one of the most obese counties in the world with the least accessible medical care. Sit and think about what you're saying for a second. Also research why the death rate wasn't THE threat covid posed.
