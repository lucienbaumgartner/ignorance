The reason she pulled the trigger is the same reason that gets so much untrained people killed... she thought that by pulling the magazine out the gun was emptied.

But by cocking the gun as she did before, she remain confident and unaware of the bullet loaded inside the chamber smh.
Glad she could live through her rookie error to understand that a gun IS NOT A FUCKING TOY.
