If I weren't primarily a jazz musician, this might sound like a compelling argument. I'd encourage you to look into the history of jazz music. Your assumptions about what people from disadvantaged backgrounds have access to and are capable of doing without going through formal channels is very far off the mark. People like Charlie Christian and Charlie Parker grew up in abject poverty before the civil rights movement and achieved absolutely astonishing things as performers and composers. This is a big component of what makes jazz and its history so incredible. 

You are massively overestimating how expensive it is to own and learn an instrument. If you can access things like midi controllers, computers, drum machines and buy records, you can also acquire instruments and learn how to play them in the same way you learn how to use sampling equipment. Countless poor musicians have done this over the last century. I'm not saying that growing up poor makes no difference in how you learn music, what I'm saying is that the argument that sampling is somehow uniquely a function of poverty in a way that other styles isn't is entirely unfounded and ignorant of music history.
