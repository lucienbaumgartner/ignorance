Like I said. You are lost and dumb, and ignorant. That one statement unequivocally proves it. Try looking at the standard of living in other countries, the human development index. Or any index you like. Then find America on it. I'm actually from one of the highest overall, and one of the highest for education. Repeating a stupid statement from your laughing stock President does not an argument make.
