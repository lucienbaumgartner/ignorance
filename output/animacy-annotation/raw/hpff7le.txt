You're wrong about "half the country", and they can if they want to but it will be out of hatred, ignorance and stupidity. Make some black friends and try to see it their way.  The confederate flag is a symbol of southern pride that's inseparable from it's racist roots, and anyone with a shred of decency chooses not to fly it because they understand that it makes them look like racist assholes.  Choosing to fly it anyway and going "fuck you i'm not a racist" just makes you look ignorant and stubborn instead, so it's hard to believe anyone who flies it isn't also racist.  Pigheaded bigotry is nothing to be proud of.
