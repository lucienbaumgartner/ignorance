In ‘the beginning’, as it were, awareness was dull and unaware of its own nature. This is the “connate” ignorance, because it is connate with awareness from the beginning.

When appearance arose, ‘some’ awareness correctly identified the nature of appearance as not being dualistically separate from itself. It gained insight into the nature of mind and thereby lost the connate ignorance. This is the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra.

‘Other’ awareness mistakenly viewed appearance as being dualistically separate—it viewed itself as a subject and appearance as external objects, as we do. This is the “imputing ignorance”, because it imputes duality into experience. This imputing ignorance is the basis of entering samsara.

When you become enlightenment, you achieve the same enlightenment as Samantabhadra, eliminating both the imputing and connate ignorance. Without the connate ignorance, there is no basis for the imputing ignorance and therefore samsara to arise again.

So the answer is basically that Buddhahood is *better* than the original state; the original state wasn’t perfect. We never had Buddhahood and lost it; we only had a state of dull ignorance.
