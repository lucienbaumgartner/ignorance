Well, incompetent is a word that totally oversimplifies and mischaracterizes Nancy Pelosi, in a way that is diminutive and ignorant of the complex ways she maintains power and control in the status quo.

If you want to criticize her actions, criticize the tactics themselves like the weird Mama-Bear complex she works to establish among all the House dems.
