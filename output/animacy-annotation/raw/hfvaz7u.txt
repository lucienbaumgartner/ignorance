He's said before, he thinks trans people are a 'white people problem'. Yea it was part of another special, but he was clearly giving his "this is Dave Chapelle dropping pearls of wisdom so lean in" lines. So to him when transpeople are telling him to not be transphobic he sees it as rich white liberals trying to silence him. Which is huuuugely disrespectful and ignorant of the black and other minority races trans people, many of whom face violence and abuse everyday. Heck black transpeople themselves were criticial in pushing the trans movement in America from the start.
