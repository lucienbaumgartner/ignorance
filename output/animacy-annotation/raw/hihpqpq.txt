I don't get your point. If you're not advocating for speeding, then what are you saying? 

What happened was pretty simple. I was driving down various city streets around the Lower Mainland at or slightly above the posted speed limit, including construction speed zones. Somewhere along each and every road I drove down, I was being tailgated by an ass. Note that I did absolutely nothing other than drive at the speed limit. I did not cut anybody off or do any dumb crap. I was already established in my lane for at least a good minute. The only thing that I was doing that was pissing people off was that I was driving at the speed limit.

It is very naive and ignorant of you to assume that I absolutely MUST have been doing something stupid to provoke aggressive responses. Were you there watching me drive to say that with such confidence? Like today, for example. I drove down the exact same roads as the other day at the exact same speed around the exact same time. Nobody tailgated me. 

I reiterate, the only thing I was doing that day to piss people off was follow speed limits. That's it. Is it wrong to follow speed limits? Now if you're still saying that I was doing something wrong, then you're advocating for speeding.
