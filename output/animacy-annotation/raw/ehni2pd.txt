You don't have to support every right-wing president to be right-leaning? That's not how it works, tons of right-leaning people don't support Trump because he's a nutjob and the "Right" or "Left" are so broad that people can fall very far away from eachother on the spectrum.

Alex Jones views are incredibly consistent with that of someone who leans extremely far to the political right.

Not a single trump supporter can defend their beliefs in a rational way because their beliefs are entirely irrational and ignorant, that doesn't mean they aren't politically right - justs stupid.
