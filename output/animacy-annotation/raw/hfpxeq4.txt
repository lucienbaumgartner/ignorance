I'm a veteran and I could give a fuck less if you trust me or not. I know who I am as a person and what I believe in and it's far from what these extremist stand for. Painting every veteran as untrustworthy is the same as saying these groups of people can't be trusted or that group of people can't be trusted. If you can't judge a person on their individuality, then you may as well join the extremist because they see the world the same way you do. Closed minded and ignorant of the full spectrum of things
