You are so far off base here. 

Firstly, what about people who ALREADY have kids? People who once had a stable situation and then for whatever reason no longer had that and suddenly have to care for themselves? What about the people who become pregnant accidentally and aren't able to get an abortion because of America's fucked priorities? Throwing a blanket "LOL don't have kids if you're poor" is disgustingly irresponsible and ignorant of the hundreds of thousands of cases where it doesn't apply.

"People you see claiming" is not evidence and considering your attitude is possibly just selective bias. Ignoring the fact that you think it's acceptable for millions of people to have "The barest of bare lives" lets assume that's the intention of the minimum wage; The reality of things is that the minimum wage does not provide enough to meet even this BARE MINIMUM save for your theoretical best case scenario where a magical person who never gets sick or injured for any reason, lives a comfortable and safe walk/bike to their office, in a temperate location where they don't have to worry about intense heat or cold at any time of year, can metabolize rice and beans into all the necessary nutrients needed to survive, found incredibly cheap rent (with utilities included!) and can share that rent with someone else, with decent and cheap internet that always works and a phone that never deteriorates or breaks with a plan that is also cheap...

And even then, even in that impossibly best case scenario they probably aren't able to save more then a few hundred a month, all the while working 40 hours a week. If any of those things go wrong or aren't ideal, or if there are any extenuating circumstances such as children or college debt or even ongoing medical costs like Type 1 Diabetes... 

This isn't about luxury, this is about survival. But you ignore that and hide behind your "but they want the playstations and the iphones" argument.
