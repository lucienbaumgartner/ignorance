the explanation is simple: the real and original me is a tormented brain with a lot of questions and emotions (metal side). the old mature me is bored and ignorant of everything, and after long workdays just wants to enjoy his gaming and smoking sesh(other trivial or electronic genres) -&gt; and chill bass beats go so well with that. ofc I dont feel like listening to drill trap when I play valheim. for valheim I have black metal and dark ambient. for crossout pew pew vroom vrooom I have electronic and bass. that simple. ;))
