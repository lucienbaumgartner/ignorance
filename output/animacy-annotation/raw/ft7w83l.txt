Who told you you were stupid, lazy, and ignorant? 
That sounds like someone in your life making you feel like you are those things, and i don’t believe for a second you are. 
1. You may have clinical depression. This is super common and treatable. I know it’s a huge step but trying to get to a doctor could be life changing for you. 

2. You might just need a change of scenery. (Which is difficult in a pandemic, I know, but not impossible).

3. A lot of us feel lost for a long time. No one has it 1000% figured out. Take a few moments and think about what’s one thing you can do to better yourself RIGHT NOW. Whether that’s taking out your trash or brushing your teeth or looking up a course or idea that sounds interesting to you—just one thing. Every day remind yourself that you are keeping a promise to yourself, and do one thing to show up for you.
