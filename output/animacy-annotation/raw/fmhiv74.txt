It testifies to how shallow people are, or maybe the better word is gullible. Social media produces some of the most insecure mentality that I have ever witnessed. Facebook, twitter, reddit, you name it, the vast majority of posts are so shallow and ignorant that I know why I only spend 20 minutes per day online. If people spent the same amount of time making a contribution to society, as opposed to being on some kind of electronic device, we'd probably have a vaccine for the virus by now.
