Hello, thank you for reaching out and commenting, i seriously appreciate it.

I have been dealing with mental hardships most of my life, and I have found myself to be capable of managing them by myself whether by rationalizing or any other mechanisms, because of the unknown nature of these mental diseases, i do think this is a valid approach. 

I was looking to see if what I'm feeling or thinking about is relatable to anybody/ explainable by somebody who's knowledgeable of these things , as that would help me rationalize it and try to control my feelings. The idea of meds, , especially anxiety meds is quite scary, and I don't know for sure if that's stereotypical and ignorant of me but I'd much rather solve my problems without them.
Ofcourse, if it gets too overwhelming, i won't hesitate to reach out for help. Thanks again for your take.
