People stopped doing the fundamentals the second we started lifting restrictions.  It’s honestly sickening.  Last month, I was one of a few people in grocery stores during my visit wearing a mask - I’d honestly get snarky stares from others for doing so.

Now that our cases are back up, at least some of those people - who have moderate intelligence and reasoning skills - have resumed wearing masks. 

But social distancing here has always been fucking terrible.  People are either blind to spots on the floor to stand in lineups, or they are so selfish and ignorant that they just ignore them.  I’ve come close to a few altercations with these people.  It’s disgusting.
