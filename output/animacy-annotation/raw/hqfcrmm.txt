Yes I know it’s much more contagious but not as bad symptom wise. That’s a sign of the vaccine working but also a sign of it mutating but the Spanish flu did the same it was killing people too quickly, it then mutated to keep itself going so it became less deadly and became much more infectious we are just lucky modern medicine is as it is nowadays. Until we can get everyone on the same wavelength and being less ignorant And less people calling it a mild cold we won’t be over it.
