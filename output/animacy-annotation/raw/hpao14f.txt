How was the Amish bunked and how is this debunked? Cutting funding towards programs that provide abortions is stopping abortions. I can't believe how your thought process works, it's idiotic lol.

Sorry saying that most libertarians are uneducated isn't an insult and not having an education isn't an insult. It's part of the culture you were raised in, I guess. You probably don't believe in finding schools haha. 

Well your ideologies are really ignorant and outdated, libertarian isn't a popular political stance. Which is why they vote conservative and contradict their beliefs. You cant say you're libertarian and support republic and conservative viewpoints that undermine your stance. For instance Texas made it illegal to get an abortion after a month of pregnancy, that is directly taking away the rights of women. Libertarians voted for that. That's a direct contradiction to your beliefs.
