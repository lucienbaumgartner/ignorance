I'm sorry if this offends you but your fiance is horrible for what she said. Orgasms do not equal enjoyment or pleasure; it's a natural reaction to stimulation and the mere fact that she tried to tell you you liked it all because you remained erect and reached climax shows how little she knows on the matter.

I hope she's simply ignorant and unaware of the things I stated being factual and not just denying it's truth.

I'm also a bit bothered by how she's clearly not on your side but just blindly believing everything this guy is saying which is basically invalidating you feeling violated and blackmailed. Like she's supposed to love you yet isn't caring how much this all bothered you, and even seems more interested in the "juicy details" of your past affair with this guy instead of the actual problem; that he tried to blackmail you.

I'm not saying "leave her ass!" But I do feel like this whole thing has brought up some questionable flags in her you should not ignore simply because you love her and don't wish to lose her. You revealed a deeply vulnerable part of you for the sake of your relationship and I just get the feeling she isn't focusing on the important things like how your mental and emotional health is fairing, and the mere fact that you were the target of blackmail.
