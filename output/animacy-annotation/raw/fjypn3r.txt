I can't tell if the people in this subreddit are actual homophobic idiots or bots. Like, seriously. The shit that's being said sounds just so rude and ignorant that I question if it's real.

How iconic and badass can this character be if the love people have for him is so contingent on his sexuality? Like, it's not a big deal IRL, it's obviously not a big deal in the show, and therefore be quiet.

No one needs a warning before someone reveals their sexuality, or some big big-build up as it's not a big deal. It's not lazy writing to make someone gay "out of nowhere." 

Holy shit.
