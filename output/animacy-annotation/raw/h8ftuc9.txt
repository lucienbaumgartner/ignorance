How awfully closed minded of you. And how insensitive and ignorant of you to compare people who are hesitant to get the covid vaccines to racists and Nazi's.


I would like to try to bring people together on this issue no matter where they stand so both sides can better understand where the other is coming from. How are you helping with your video view points?


Can you understand that there are people who have lost their trust and their faith in the government?
