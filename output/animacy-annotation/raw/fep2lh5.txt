So, Papa Clint has paid around $1200 in overdraft fees for this dumb motherfucker and Jorf is so Goddamn selfish and ignorant that he orders a pizza on a livestream the tecond he gets a paypig to give him some money? He **just** said he can't get his debit card back until he pays Daddy, but of course a fucking disgusting pizza is a bigger priority. He's a fucking cartoon character, like Garfield with lasagna or Homer Simpson and donuts.

Can you imagine, right after Clint has this big argument with Jord about how he can't have his own debit card because he can't be trusted and he's tired of bailing him out, he gets a Facebook message from his retarded son saying he ordered a pizza but his trolls canceled it and he needs Daddy to fix it for him? He can't even call his dad because he smashed his phone in a sperg rage. Jesus, what a fucking loser. And he has the balls to call his viewers idiots. Although, it is insane to think someone was actually stupid enough to give this ghoul $40 to open his fucking mouth.
