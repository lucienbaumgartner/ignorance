NTA but your GF sure is, red flags galore, only bullies excuse their actions by saying the other person was too sensitive. She knows he is a young person who's had a hell of a hard time yet she chooses to fuck with his mental health by saying something incredibly ignorant and insensitive. Thank God your brother has you and your wonderful friends.
