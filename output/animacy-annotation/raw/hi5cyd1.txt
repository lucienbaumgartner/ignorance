I am very inexperienced and ignorant of this subject but lately I have been curious.

I've done a little research what dolls are like and while many, too many, are beautiful, I must say...

I am a total ass man. Like, I am not so much wanting something unrealistically large in proportions. But I love them when they are very jiggly. From what I can tell in videos, butts on dolls are very firm and hard? Am I wrong?
