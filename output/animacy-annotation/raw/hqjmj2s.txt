With the resurgence of Viking and Celtic culture, the hairstyle is becoming very trendy because of that. Having nothing to do with African culture at all. As 'cornrows' was a common hairstyle with both of those cultures going back to artwork depicting those hairstyles as far back as 300 AD... So anyone choosing that style for those reasons... is their prerogative. And they do not deserve to have some SJW attacking them for appropriating African culture. 
My comment stands. 
As for your comments about the treatment of people pf African decent for their chosen hair styles... you are correct. No one should be harassed of denigrated for their styles. And it is great that things are changing, too slowly, but they are. Because any one culture claiming ownership of anything like a common hair style is ignorant and silly. And anyone denigrating someone due to their hairstyle is also ignorant and silly.
