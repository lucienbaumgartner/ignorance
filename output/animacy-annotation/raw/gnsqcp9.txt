So, for one. this post says nothing but, a woman deciding that she'd rather be alone than take a chance with someone that might not be to her liking at first. For some idiotic reason all of you have this thought in your heads that someone being upset because a woman disregarded them for whatever reason is not right and that's completely an ignorant way of thinking because guys are not on this earth to be some doll waiting to be picked with no emotions and no ideas or feelings of their own. I seriously dislike people like you because it's so fucking stupid and ignorant that a group of people would put one gender on a pedestal and then say every other gender is disgusting and vile for no reason. I'm sure you've been hurt before but, you can't blame the world for a few people hurting you. It's no-one else fault but, theirs.
