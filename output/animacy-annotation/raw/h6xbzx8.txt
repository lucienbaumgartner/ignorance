I think you have a point there. You're right. If only they would impress themselves more often. People are so afraid to appear ignorant and yet we humans, we living things experience life always and without exception ignorant of what's to come as it comes moment to moment and as it passes into the past we are ignorant of all but the consequences as they occur and our fading mental fabrications of what has come to pass. We are an ignorant being but I suppose there is ignorance and there is igggggnorance. I mean if a chap is ignorant of her ignorance despite reality unfolding right before his eyes what's there to do? Help them while they grieve a shattered ego? That's what's at stake here, I think. That's the caveat to, "hey, it's okay. just look to mind." Ego cannot perceive mind because Ego is mind made. If Ego perceived mind Ego would cease as would all attachments and views, cravings and aversions and what then would be left at all in all of that empty space Ego occupies? Nothing. Void. Emptiness. It's absolutely horrifying. Yep much better for chap to just remain fearful and ignorant of ignorance and focused mostly on appearances amiright
