This has left r/niceguys territory and is now in r/iamatotalpieceofshit territory.

I’m so sorry for your grandma, OP. I wish the best for you going forward. And try not to let what this piece of shit human said to you make things too much harder. I, like you, am completely baffled by people like him. How could you be so unsympathetic, insensitive, and unaware of other’s feelings? How cruel can you possibly get?
