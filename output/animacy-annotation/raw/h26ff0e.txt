&gt;It definitely sounds like significant over reach using this unit to intimidate and persecute political opponents.

My problem is that for the unaware and ignorant he's not clearly a mouthpiece for one particular side of politics and he's using the appearance of being such to drum up support. Sure, if bad power abuse stuff happened then there's a problem but if he's being a prick while trying not to appear as one well I'd be a bit concerned if the threat of being thrown in a cell overnight didn't help curb that behaviour.

Remember, he's no greenroots little guy activist with nothing but the hippy moss in his hair and dust in his beard, he doesn't have to do what he's doing the way he's doing it but this is what a little guy looks like so that's the path he's taking.
