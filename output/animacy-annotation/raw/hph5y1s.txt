Late 40s early 50s, putting my little feet in the machine in the shoe store and watching me wriggle my little toes inside the outline of the shoe sole was one of my favorite things to do and still strong memory. And yes in chem class in HS (60, 61) the teacher handed us beads of mercury to play with. Amazing properties! Such fun to have grown up then. Before Nader. Before the scientific and civil awakenings, so ignorant and oblivious.
