Other than driving with that stupid line on not really. 

You could have seen it coming though and could have avoided it. There are many many drivers out there that donâ€™t have s clue what they are doing and well with experience you can see like 99% of the things that are going to happen before they happen. 

And turn that line off. It makes you slow and unaware of your surrounding. You will never really learn how to rave with it on.
