Is that what I said, or implied at all?

You realize though, if you claim to be as enlightened as you are, this is the case for the former Soviet Union, modern China, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, several European countries, so on and  so forth. The US and USSR, as the leading powers of the era, are obviously at the top of the list. 

The only reason someone from a country that in some cases kills homosexuals and also funds terrorists would go ranting at an American visitor who clearly isn't an agent of the CIA or political strategist is he is an ignorant and hateful hypocrite. 

And if you defend such behavior? We have plenty of ignorant xenophobics who behave in this way. I surely hope you also defend them. That's my whole point, a "top mind" should get called out as such.
