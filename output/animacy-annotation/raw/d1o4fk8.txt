My MIL is generally unaware of current events unless it pops up on her FB newsfeed. So, at least there's that. But she does like to sprinkle in tales of woe she's heard about whatever person somebody else brings up. "Oh, former neighbor is getting married? Did you hear her mother......? Well, here's what happened..." Ugh.

I'm sorry your MIL is so unaware and insensitive. That's the sort of thing that just makes you want to smack somebody. Nobody wants to hear awful stories at a get together, especially if they're emotionally significant to somebody present. Just keep them to yourself!!
