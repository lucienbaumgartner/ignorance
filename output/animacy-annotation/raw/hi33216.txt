Well, I can't really comment on the 5th wave, but if you think this is the last place the virus would be seen, that I think is highly stupid of you, and unscientific.  
Likely, this virus will be with us for 100s of years; likely a much less rate of dying to it --- currently 5% hospitalization rate, last I checked; decently high, but much lower than most people think, including myself till I saw the study --- and likely, it will be in much more places than Alberta.  Look at the States!  Look at literally any third world country, where thousands more die from it, who have low priority for vaccines, who literally cannot afford to lock down like us, because if they did, masses would starve to death in a month, much higher rates than what the virus would likely kill.    
I mean, excuse me for saying it, but the "last place on Earth" makes you seem highly, highly privileged and unaware of the world.
