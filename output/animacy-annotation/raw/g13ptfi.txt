Love you guys! I click the best and most naturally with ENTPs. Like u/FirmPeaches my SO is also an ENTP and we get along so well because of his developed Fe and my developed Ti :)

There are a few ENTPs I don't get along with, but I find it's because of their under developed Fe which makes them be a bit unaware and insensitive. In those cases, I do bump heads but it's always more of a "it's not what you say it's how you say it" type of situation. 

If you find that ISFJs don't understand you or they get offended, you can try considering how you're saying certain things :) After all, we are a logical and emotional type so we'd be able to see facts without a problem, it's just often how you come across as. (That, or you run into an under developed ISFJ lol)
