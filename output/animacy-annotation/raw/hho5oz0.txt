Something about this guy being a trucker makes me sad. All these suburban karens who have easy lives and bought into the cult I don't empathisize with but this guy worked a hard job that involves alot of Isolation on the road and he was scared and ignorant of the world around him. I read what he posts and I can feel that he is really scared. Sad that people buy into this stuff :(
