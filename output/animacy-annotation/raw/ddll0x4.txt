I actually got a "what evidence is there of this? I'll change my mind if you can prove it!" from a Trumpet today for saying that Donald thinks vaccines cause autism. Either they're being belligerent, or they can't even fucking copy paste to google. Someone pastes the link to them, and their response? Not a "oh I guess he does believe in some idiocy", but instead a "yeah, but [they're conspiring to create an unaware and compliant citizenry!](http://www.snopes.com/clinton-compliant-citizenry/)".
