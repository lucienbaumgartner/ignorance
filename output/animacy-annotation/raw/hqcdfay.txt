Where did I tout American Exceptionalism? I’ve travelled through much of Europe and have close family in Switzerland. And while I think that the narrative of the “stupid American” is overplayed here on Reddit, I would be crazy if I didn’t acknowledge that many Americans are woefully miseducated, insular and ignorant of the world. But one cannot look at the variance in demographics by region and conclude that we are a homogeneous nation.
