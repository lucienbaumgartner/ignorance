“Hi, my name Bryan. I’m closed minded and unaware of diversity amongst humans. I think that all humans think how I think because my parents taught me what I know and it’s validated because their parents taught them and we are all very happy together. City people are clearly uneducated and because they don’t like matching with narrow minded humans. I’m sorry, this isn’t going to workout because I haven’t learned that there is more to life than my ego. 

Sincerely,
Bryan”
