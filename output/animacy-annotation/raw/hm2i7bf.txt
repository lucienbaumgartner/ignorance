I've heard all the arguments against minimum wage over and over again. In other countries they're paying the higher wages and even giving benefits and it hasn't caused the market price to go up.

It's honestly a stupid fucking argument, you honestly think raising wages just automatically means people will pay more for an egg? They'll pay more for a bottle of water? There's other forces than wages that effect market pricing. It's so shallow and ignorant that it makes it painfully obvious people are not taking econ classes and half the ones who do prefer the rhetoric to the numbers.
