&gt;Well that's just blatantly not true, but anyway.

It is **so** true! ROFL

&gt;A tyrant has been elected president. 

Wrong again, Clinton was the tyrant wannabe, (you know, keeping the citizenry “unaware and compliant” with the “public policy” meanwhile implementing the “private policy” on behalf of billionaire bankers), but fortunately the country as a whole saw right through her.  Thank God for that!

&gt;In a democratic process everyone's vote should equal exactly 1 vote, not more or less depending on geographical location. Otherwise you are saying that the 500k people in Wyoming deserve more of a say in our election than someone from California or Texas or New York.

Hold on a second!  Wyomingites each have a 1/500,000 say in who their governor will be but Californians each have only a 1/38,000,000 say in who their governor will be… ***How is THAT fair?!?!***  If everyone’s vote should equal exactly 1 vote how do *you* explain this discrepancy!?!?  Why do the folks in Wyoming each have 76 times more influence over who their governor will be than Californians do in California?  ***WHYYYYYYyyyyyy?***   LOL  

Sorry, but your argument is too simpleminded.  You see, if every single Californian moved to Wyoming and every single Wyomingite moved to California then the positions would simply be reversed since the electoral votes for each state are based on *population*.  It has NOTHING to do with the specific geographic location of the voter.  To win the Presidency a candidate needs to win elections in several locations throughout the country and can’t simply get all their votes in just one or two places.
