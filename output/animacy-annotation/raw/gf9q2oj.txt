I'm stanchly in the no-spoilers camp.  If I get wind of a interesting movie ( a sequel or from a director I like) that is coming to theaters soon, I try to avoid watching the previews.  I like going into a movie completely fresh and unaware of what will happen.  For me, watching a trailer will show significant plot twists and action sequences that take the fun out of watching it for the first time.
