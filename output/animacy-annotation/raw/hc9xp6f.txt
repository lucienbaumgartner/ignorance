No. Canon is what is real. If anyone can just claim that something really happened that would cause a lot of problems. So if I went out and said the robot gaara episode was canon, and everyone must now acknowledge that, that is just me being really stupid, and ignorant of reality. This is not up for debate nor is it up to your opinions. There exists a definition and one can not simply change it.
