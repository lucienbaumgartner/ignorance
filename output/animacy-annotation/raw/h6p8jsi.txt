Even at bike races pedestrians are completely obvious and unaware of their surroundings.

I can't tell you how many times I was cycling a long a path for a while, able to see someone walking ahead of me for a long time and not once will I see them look behind them or look around. Just straight ahead and unaware of their surroundings, then when you get closer they'll start to drift into the middle of the path.
