I think that since the end of WWII, church has been heavily involved in politics here in Poland.

 starting as an opposing side to the communist regime to early 90's and after that evolving to a mob like structure (Poland has a major problem with sexual abuse cases within church, ending  every scandal with either moving priest to different parish or covering the whole thing up with some settlements). 

Anyway, church holds a significant number of voters (especially  on the eastern side of the country, which is more conservative to say politely and more uneducated and unaware of the reality in my personal opinion) so Everytime a party wants to win an election, they always need to get into some shady agreements with those people...

Sadly speaking i think that in order for the separation to take place, the Soviet occupation generation needs to pass away...
