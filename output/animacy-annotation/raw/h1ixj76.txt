As others have said the danger is proper measurement and dosing. Generally when you receive medications they are measured in milligrams (mg). Fentanyl is measured for dosing in MICROgrams (mcg) which are 1/1000 of a milligram. 100mcg = 0.1mg. It is very easy to use too much especially when you consider the person doing it is likely untrained and ignorant of proper procedure. The other issue that has an effect is there are several types of fentanyl, some of which are considerably stronger. Lastly, dealers only care about the bottom line and have no problems using untested and unregulated "research chemicals", many of whom are made in China. The last variable is the supply chain. It is likely that an heroin bought on the street has passed from multiple people before reaching the end user and there is a strong chance that every person who touched it cut the product again without regard to what the last person did. So you might have pure heroin cut 10 different times and there is no way to tell how much is actually in there without lab testing.

There was a scene in the show Ozark where someone decides to spike a supply and they literally throw a big handful of fentanyl on top of a large container with no measuring or mixing. This lead to some bags being almost all fentanyl which ended up causing overdoses.
