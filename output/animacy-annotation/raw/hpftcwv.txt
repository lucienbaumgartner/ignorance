And I get that people are stupid. Very stupid. But there's a difference between being willfully ignorant and stupid.

Take your wife's friend, go example. [Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=vaccine+magnet&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS868US868&amp;oq=vaccine+magnet&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512.4167j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) is how easy it would be for her to actually learn that if she wanted to. Two words and a fraction of a second and there are dozens of answers that even stupid people can understand.

So that person is no doubt stupid. But she's also willfully ignorant, and those two are separate issues, and they are not mutually exclusive.
