White people have a huge variety of cultural foods, traditions, clothes and art forms but you refuse to see it as you lump all white folk into one big group. German culture is very different from Scottish culture which is very different from icelandic culture which is very different from american culture and so on. Hell even america is not one homogenous culture and you see a couple big cultural differences based on region(mid west vs new England for example). Just because american culture has become so normalized for the world due to media does not mean that that is the only culture white people have and to use that as justification to say that "white people have no culture" is a gross oversinplification.       
         
Thats roughly equal to if i made a judgement on "black culture" but only considered the culture of black americans rather than the broad variety of cultures on the entire continent of africa. Ghanaians and Kenyans are going to have  different cultural norms and traditions, same with pretty much every other african country. But i cant just lump all those in with my western perception of "black culture" to do so is simply ignorant and wrong
