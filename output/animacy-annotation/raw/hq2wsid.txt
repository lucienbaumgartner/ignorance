My brother didn’t have the best male role models, and despite me trying to talk sense into him and get him to see a therapist, he takes the familiar route.  Apparently being negative, cranky, willfully-ignorant and closed-minded, and perpetually putting his foot in his mouth are easier than trying to work on oneself and chancing having a better outlook on life and attracting a better crowd. Mind you, he doesn’t pull that stuff with me because he knows I won’t put up with it (and I think he knows I care about him and believe he can do better for himself). At the same time, he’s got a kind heart. My brother will stop what he’s doing and help a neighbor work on their car, pull over to the side of the road to help someone with a flat. He literally gave the jacket off his back to a homeless guy and bought him breakfast. He raised a girlfriend’s kid for 10 years when she split (and he did an incredible job at parenting than what we had, so I think he genuinely has it in him to undo the years of damage our upbringing did). 

All that being said, I don’t totally blame him for his mentality- our parents failed all three of us kids, and my mother would have done just fine on her own if she had divorced my father. Back then, for Christmas, I wanted my parents to divorce. But that’s for a whole other post on a whole other sub. 

The irony is that I talked to my mother this morning and my brother was over her house changing out her car battery. Plucks my nerves that my mother and sister were pissed off enough at him on Christmas Eve to disinvite him on Christmas, but they fail to see their own manipulation. This isn’t new behavior- They’ll hate on him when they want, but suddenly buddy up to him when they need something. My family sucks and thank goodness for geography.
