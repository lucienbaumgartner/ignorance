Because Sarri is implenting his ideas, does that mean Jorginho gets a free pass just because he’s played successfully under him before?



I don’t think the OP is stupid and unaware that the style is changing, he’s noticing that Jorginho is not adding much to the team in an attacking sense and a weakness defensively. 



I personally think both Kova and Kante are smart players and technically good enough to play that role and ease a lot of the pressure we face from counters.
