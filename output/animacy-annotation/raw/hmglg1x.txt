Sedation makes you forget the procedure happened. When the sedation wears off which will seem like seconds after it started, it's all over and you remember nothing. You'll be numb and maybe it hurts a bit from the procedure but as for what they did, that is something you'll never recall. And yes, during the session your anxiety is not manifested consciously, so you're not fighting the dental surgeon.

They still use local anesthesia like numbing and so forth because it would physically hurt during the extraction. To them, remember, you're awake. And can feel things and respond to what they tell you to do, like turn your head, open wider, whatever. But you will not remember that.

The phenomenon is called anterograde amnesia. The drugs mean you cannot remember new information, e.g. the procedure. So an injection, followed by hello, please sit in this chair for your recovery, all in what seems like a blink of an eye. Highly recommended for the dental terrified.

Typical methods can vary from Nitrous Oxide gas through a nose mask, to oral anti-anxiety medications before the procedure (which I understand is uncommon in the UK) to a quick IV shot of propofol and midazolam, all of which are very short acting. You do not want to be fully asleep because if you are not conscious, you cannot breathe on your own which means a ventilator which means there's a tube in your mouth in the way. So you are awake but unaware and will never recall it.

Relax and be happy this will go quickly and anxiety-free.
