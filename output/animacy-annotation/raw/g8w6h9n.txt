Research shows that wearing a mask dramatically reduces the aerosol spread of the virus if you are infected (and perhaps asymptomatic and unaware of the infection.) Mask wearing works as a policy if the general population complies. If everyone is wearing one (or at least a very high percentage of people) there is less virus in the environment for one to encounter. You will still be susceptible to infection if you touch surfaces etc. I hope that's useful for you.
