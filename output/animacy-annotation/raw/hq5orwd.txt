The guy walking around with his radio like that also pissed me off, it's just ignorant and rude af to do that shit, not to mention Buggin' Out acting like some self-righteous prick because there aren't any black icons/figures/heroes on the wall. I get that the place should have some and even agreed with his sentiment.. but the way he approached it was so completely fucked up and arrogant. So combining two egocentric, arrogant ass motha fuckas with an impressionable one and seeing the situation explode into what it became? I cannot say I'm surprised. 

I think it was supposed to be like that on purpose, art imitates life, but life also imitates art. I know people who are and do act like that in real life. They're in the same spots everyday.. but I don't think the shit was painted I figured it was filmed in location.

That's also the message of the film.

Yeah, shitty actor, and his films are hit or miss. Some are great, most not so much, especially that Oldboy remake.. good god it was terrible.

I rooted for plenty of people so idk where you're even getting that idea from.

Anyways, Reddit's majority of people are white westerners, males, in their 20s to 30s so I'm not surprised so many people agree with what you're saying.
