We can be real here, I was raped at his age by an adult, if has had a tremendous impact on my life. My experience is also in line with research and the outcomes/impact it has on people's lives. You can argue against this, but you're either trolling or ignorant, you make getting better harder for people like me. It hard enough having to deal with the trauma, which I'm sure you will just laugh off, but then the oxygen thieves who think it's all some big joke and I'm somehow lucky. Get out of here with your 'let's be real', you are utterly clueless and ignorant of what you speak.
