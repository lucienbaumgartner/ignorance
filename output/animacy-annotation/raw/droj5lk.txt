Super Carlin Brothers actually have an incredible theory on this.  Usually portkeys only go one way, right?  The theory is that the portkey was designed to go to the cemetary, then BACK to the entrance of the labyrinth, because VOLDEMORT was planning to use the portkey to go back (instead, Harry uses it to take Cedric's body back). 

It would have been convenient to have all the teachers, including Dumbledore, waiting unaware and unprepared expecting the students to be ported to the entrance.  But, things didn't go Voldie's way and so the portkey wasn't used to send him back.

I probably fudged the theory a bit, Super Carlin Bros explain it better on their Youtube Channel.
