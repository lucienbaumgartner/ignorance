I have no idea about your struggles and certainly, I am speaking from a place of ignorance. However, I am going to take the liberty to be bold enough to say that Kashmir is being used as a diversion to steer the people from the real issues. In many years of this country being independent, the majority is still poor, uneducated, and unaware of their rights.   


Whenever, the politicians want to create a distraction there is a disaster in Kashmir. I think the reason that people in Kashmir will keep suffering, if we keep making it a matter of protest and allow the issue to become bigger. I am really sorry to say this but i think logic dictates that ignoring Kashmir for now will help the people more.
