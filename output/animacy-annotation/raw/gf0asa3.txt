I experienced this for the firs time. Luckily, I'm not an idiot. I could put two and two together. Lots of ranches around. Car flashing lights. I slowed down. There you have it. Like 5 cows crossing.   


It isn't that hard to not be an idiot. However, it is easy to be complacent and unaware of your surroundings.  


My brain had to think about where I was and what was happening.
