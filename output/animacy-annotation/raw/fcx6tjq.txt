I got hooked into Episode back in 2015. There were a lot of trashy stuff but I was young and unaware that the stories I've read are actually cliches. Of course, there were some hidden gems that were actually good and have choices that impact the story. Then, somewhere in 2018, I lost all my progress because I somehow can't open the app, which was alright for me because I've finished most of the books that I actually like and the ones that I haven't finished are going trashy and boring, so I downloaded Choices to sorta mourn or something, idk. At first I thought it was just another copy of Episode since it went out 2 years later, and I didn't like it at first because it doesn't have animations like Episode, but the first story that was suggested to me was a sci-fi story called Perfect Match, and boy did I LOVE it. Then, I lost my progress yet again. I almost gave up but I really really wanted to read the book 2 because I loved it so much. So I downloaded it again and I diamond mined some of the shorter stories (THoBM and HftH) just to read PM until book 2. I was planning to leave Choices after that but then I read HSS, then BB, then TRR, then the next thing I knew, I've read most of the series in the library :D
