Pretty sure if someone is this hateful and ignorant that their significant other would be either equally hateful and ignorant or they just wouldn't stand for it and leave. She knows who he is and she stuck with him. I doubt her side of the story would be one of tolerance and compassion for people with a different skin color tbh
