I was invited to a few meetings years ago to AmWay and as ignorant and niece and gullible as I was, it felt like a pyramid scheme covered with a Christian atmosphere. I’m literally supposed to con people into buying overpriced products so that I can give my trainer most of the money, leaving me with very little. Which is why I’m supposed to recruit somebody so that I can make even more money. And the more people I recruit, the more I make, the more my trainer makes, the more his trainer makes and so on. But I’m supposed to smile and have faith in God that I will prosper. Screw all of that! It was a pyramid scheme
