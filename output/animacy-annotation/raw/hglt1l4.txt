YTA so so much! The fact that you and other guys get turned off to women because women have been in more than 3 relationships is misogynistic, sexist, and just sad. It speaks volumes. Like you are not 14, you and your friend are both grown adults, and it's good she knows what she wants. 

The hypothetical guys you are defending are not great if they want a virgin or someone with so few partners! What is wrong with all of you? Oh wait! I know, it's that girls who have less experience are more naive, submissive and unaware of most things so you can get away with a metric ton of messed up shit, and they won't know better? It's a power and control thing, and it is pathetic! 

But I'm glad you told her that, now she can avoid you and all the other creeps who think like you, freaking red flag brigade you all are!
