The phrase “Q sent me” is probably the perfect example of impotence. You’re so weak willed and ignorant that you require some anonymous thing to tell you to troll something, which you then do. And this accomplished what exactly? So you’ve arrived on some random internet post, now what? You’ve accomplished nothing and nothing will change even though you’ve posted “Q sent me”. The world still turns, people who actually do things still put out news articles, and Q is still a sham.
