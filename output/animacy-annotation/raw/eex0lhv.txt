lmao you’re a lost soul man. Literally nothing you said in that comment is correct or even sensible. 

Choke holds are completely legal. They’re against department policy in just about every police department in the United States, but they’re not illegal. They also don’t implicitly kill people. You don’t throw someone into a choke hold and they die. Multiple forms of martial arts train people in the use of airway chokes in order to submit opponents. 

Your firefighter/EMT buddy hasn’t had to choke anybody because 1. The police will render a scene safe for FD before they ever approach to provide aide and/or 2. FD aren’t in the business of arresting people or making people do what they don’t want to do. People aren’t generally hostile to firefighters, so your anecdote about his experiences is utter nonsense.

The rest of your post was so trashy and ignorant that I’m not going to address it
