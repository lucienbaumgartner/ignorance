The thing that continues to utterly perplex me about all this is - this is all obvious. It was obvious from May's red lines that we would end up in a situation like this. There is no way May does not know this, that advisors around her do not know this, or that they haven't known this for years. If I knew it, then they definitely knew it!

So they are doing this on purpose. It can't be magical thinking in terms of the government, I just refuse to believe they are ALL that stupid and ignorant, that all the civil servants are that stupid and ignorant. They're doing it on purpose and everything else is just fluff and nonsense and stories put out to the press to confuse everything, but when you get right down to the reality, it looks like they're going for no deal and have been from early on, they're just trying to make it look otherwise.

It's either that or Theresa May is legitimately utterly insane.
