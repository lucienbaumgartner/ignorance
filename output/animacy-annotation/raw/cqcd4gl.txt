&gt; I'm really, really, concerned about the younger girls. I'm comfortable being a bitch. The younger girls are uncomfortable and unaware that they can be mean to an adult and it's okay. I have to stand up for them now.

This is a critical point and worth recognizing. Kudos for being willing to take responsibility for more than just your own safety.
