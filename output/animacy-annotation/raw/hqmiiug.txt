&gt;Words and ideas mean things. If someone tells you they are going to burn down your house, and draws comics about burning down houses, and writes about how cool burning down houses are, do you just wait till your house is burnt down to be like "hey, that guy wants to burn down my house!"

Thats true but what you linked is not that.

What we have the first one is somthing called cashing in on a trend.

First comic is pointing out the hypocrisy and lack of self awareness of one radical being mad at another radical.

2nd comic: satire of the power rangers. Jokes about colours and relating them to race has been around since they first started.

3rd: i dont quiite know the context. If i had to guess its the rights/conservative view of an enlightened centrist. Its got the horseshoe referencing the horseshoe  theory probably.


So none of those examples are calls to action and if you think they are i want you to explain why.

All that is to be seen are comics that mock ideas and people.

Not too mention these are just the comics where are the references from the man himself that line up with his comics.


These arent some impossible goal posts. What are your references for thinking these comics are nazi material? Because to me it seems like a bunch of people call him and his comics nazi due to either personal distaste or feel they are one of the people being mocked and thus are emotionally blinded.

And if the only argument left is that its his intent to by a super seceret facist creating sunversive content to corrupt the unaware and non beleivers... then how the hell am i supppsed to argue aganist a conspiracy theory that cannot be proven correct nor incorrect?
