Is not awareness thought? I think I just confused myself... if you exist, you must be aware that you exist, and awareness is thought. If you can “exist outside of thought” then you are aware and using thought to be aware of your existence “beyond thought.”

Is there a point when the brain may cease to function, that doesn’t involve death, either cerebral or total, where one can exist and return, while simultaneously being aware and unaware of an existence that is not governed by our own thoughts? Idk bro, seems kinda hokey.
