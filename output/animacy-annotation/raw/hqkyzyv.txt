I wish I could convince my mom to get the vaccine. I could say or do anything, send her countless info, videos, try to have doctors talk to her. She doesn't care, she's willfully ignorant and apathetic. She's stuck in her way of thinking and no amount of information will tell her otherwise. It's fucking sad considering her mother died from Covid and none of us got to visit her in the nursing home. It makes me so angry
