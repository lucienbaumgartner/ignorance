Calling it "extra edge" is pretty disrespectful and ignorant of what is different. The colors, mood and lighting in his art are different. The special attacking art shows him beginning to change (tentacles, the mass on his lance arm)

Plus it isn't really unrealistic. It's likely we'll encounter him in his mount still, and the transformation is a gradual mid combat thing in the chapter. Which makes more sense if that is what ends up happening.
