The “comfort” is fleeting in a world as sick as this. Regardless if you feel financially stable, all the money in the world won’t save you without a planet to live on. And I’ve seen millionaires end up on the streets in the matter of months. Nothing is guaranteed but if you feel like you want to roll the dice and place the risk onto another human being (your child)… that’s on you to carry. 

In my eyes, it’s incredibly selfish and ignorant of reality to bring a child into today’s world. I’ve tried to see it any other way and I just can’t, anymore.
