&gt; Im confused what the bikers have to do with your health, 

Covid went from very few cases to quickly and efficiently sweeping across the country. Across the world. Then a funeral in Georgia became the first example of a "superspreader" event. The whole town caught it. Then there were more superspreader events. Then this megaspreader event at Sturgis. 3-4 weeks later, the entire Midwest blew up with Covid. Then the rest of the country.

There is no guarantee as far as any PPE goes. The checkout at the store is nowhere any matter of concern compared to many other factors. A person with Covid that is asymptomatic and unaware of having Covid (there must be tens of millions of them in America right now) for example. A shopper can transmit Covid to a product on the shelf in many different ways. These boxes, cans and such can retain the virus for days.
