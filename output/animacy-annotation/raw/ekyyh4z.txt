Words come easy when you know what you're talking about...and it's one the reasons you struggle with expressing your thoughts to others. It's typical for women to go to shaming tactics when they can't produce valid points or counterpoints. Amused mastery my ass...you're completely ineffective. 

My wife and I are great. I don't have a problem "owning my shit" - as if you're worthy of telling me how to be man. I've been doing fine long before Reddit. I wouldn't listen to you no more than I would listen to a 10-year-old. Coming up with a few lines on the terrible behavior of women is "light work" when you see the breakdown and lack of proper behavior from today's women. It's much easier to find men of character and integrity than it is to find the same in many of today's women. Even worse is that unaware and unsuspecting beta males are out here listening to women whine and complain about "toxic masculinity" while loathing the very same men who cater to female whims and incessant caterwauling. It's pathetic - on both the men AND the women. Dead bedrooms happen mostly because women marry men for which they never had any real and true attraction. Of course, they "like" these men, but they never love them the same way as all those one-night stands. 

The best thing about your comments is that you validate most of what I already know about women. 

Remember - you're the one who responded to my statement. Like I wrote earlier..."itâ€™s probably best if you just ignore my comments and go on with your day." 

I'm expecting moderator admonishment for my response in four, three, two...
