Just allow it sometimes.  It is cinematic and fun.

However - it can only work when the rogue has complete surprise, makes an attack roll at disadvantage due to the "called shot" - yes this counteracts the advantage if he would have made a normal attack.  Then require that in order to knock someone out he must hit and deal at least 1/3 the target's HP.  This makes it such that it will only work on weak and unaware foes.  It will fail frequently as well and lead to alarms being given off, etc, but fine to let them try - just don't make it too easy.  That keeps things simple - mostly to the rules (you just are essentially adding a 1/3 HP KO rule when completely unaware and not in combat.  That won't break the game much even with bardic inspiration, etc. and will add some nice tension when PCs want to attempt it.

That's what I would do (I think I have done stuff like that on the fly).
