You might want to add a "/s" to that as i thought you were dead serious for a minute...its getting harder by the day to differentiate satire and liberalism. Im consistently astounded by some of the liberal brigaders on this sub that voice immensely ignorant notions backed by nothing but blind faith in nefarious institions and media...their blissfully unaware and zealous adhearance to the categorically false borders on some sort of perverse religion...
