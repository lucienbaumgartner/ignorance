I think its the latter; its too big of a benefit to be unaware, and very simple to file. 

If 1 of 5 homes are investment property... how many of those properties are owned by larger firms vs. mom and pop investors?  I would suspect over 50%.   So 1 in 10 are potentially owned by larger institutional investors (perhaps not REITs exclusively, but inclusive of them and firms like Blackwater as well).  That's a lot, and if we extrapolate nationally.... its well above 400,000. 

This is obviously all speculation, but I think there's enough to suggest we have a problem.
