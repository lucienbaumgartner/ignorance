The people that were chosen to bring about the progressive enlightenment in video games were pretty much unintelligent lolcows that gave the opposition ammo. In my opinion though, most people who played video games were unaware and unaffected by the politics of GG. It was and is a war fought by weirdos who cared more about their fringe politics than games anyway. One look at KiA or Ghazi and there's more discussion about non-gaming shit than anything else. The journos on both sides benefited from the whole thing but the industry chugged forward without much changing despite the sound and fury.
