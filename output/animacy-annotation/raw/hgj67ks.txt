A delivery driver makes on average  3.00-4.50 an hour while they're on delivery, and minimum wage while they are working in the store. However during a typical evening a driver will spend roughly 6.5 hours of a 8 hour shift on the road, meaning that for the majority of their day they are making less than 5 dollars an hour.  Some places do reimburse for miles driven. I make 32 cents per mile I drive for my gas and maintenance but in all honesty it comes out to about 15 dollars a day because our delivery range isn't that big. So on a large delivery that is 4.5 miles away, would take about 10 minutes to pack up and load, 10-25 minutes of driving, each way, and then about 10 more minutes to complete the delivery and hand it over(more if the place is hard to find or up multiple flights of stairs). mind you 25+ pizzas can get quite heavy. Using my own gas, in my own car, taking all the risk of an accident or getting robbed in order to feed you and your guests. All of that making less than 5 dollars an hour, before taxes plus roughly three dollars for that reimbursement. To be handed a 10 dollar bill or 20 dollar bill after all of that(which is an ok tip if the order is like 150 or less) when the bill is in the hundreds is honestly just rude, inconsiderate, and ignorant of what exactly happens when you order a pizza, it doesn't just appear. If you can afford to pay 400 dollars on pizza you can have 4 or 5 people throw in 10 bucks each for the driver. When you're tipping a delivery driver you have to ask what it would take for you to do that for a total stranger.
