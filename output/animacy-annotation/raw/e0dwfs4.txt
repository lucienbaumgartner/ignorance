EQ is about intelligence. But it does not cause anything. It just indicates how well someone can identify their and others emotions. Like IQ but for emotions. The useage of the term EQ, I think, has been quite controversial. EQ stands for emotional quotient, it's real but not totally conclusive for mental health. People who suffer do have an average lower EQ but I don't think it's because they're "weak" but it's just that their issues *cause* lower EQ.

But EQ is just misused a lot of times by a lot of people. Like my dad who uses "weak EQ" to specify how someone is weak and lacking. It a way of blaming someone for their problems. And quite ironically, someone who says something like that probably have a low EQ as well. So unaware and insensitive, I'm sure those qualities reflect a low EQ as well.
