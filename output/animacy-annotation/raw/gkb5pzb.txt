It’s American business philosophy 101, unfortunately. They’ve slipped up and put a number of players and their best manager of the Red Sox in recent memory on huge wages before pulling an about face after they turned out to be crooks (steroid cheats and tampering with the game itself by stealing pitchers signals in real time), and I’m assuming making that level of investment on personnel a thing of the past for fear of not getting any return on it like happened in baseball. Also people have to remember that in American sports something like “administration” is not a thing and as such baseball clubs and the like dont get an opportunity to restructure debts while the owners retain their licenses, the club either dies or is sold for pennies on the dollar while they enter this process. So while they are aware it is a different process overseas I don’t doubt they’ve instilled a bit of a blanket policy regarding spending on personnel that is overly cautious and ignorant of the unique circumstances. It’s a shame.
