Melatonin can be a depressant for some people.  It is for me.  You have plenty of reasons to be depressed/ having an existential crisis.  It’s a very common thing to happen .  It does sound like you are developing a depressive state of being, anhedonia, etc.  It could become chronic and persistent, or it could be a temporary response to stress and loss.   In any case, you should definitely try to get ahead of it, and please don’t pin it to your self-worth.  I’m sure you aren’t a piece of shit, or whatever, you are just going through it.  Some people seem to go through life blissful and unaware of the shakiness of everything.  You could call those folks lucky, or just unaware.  I don’t know.  Depression is real though, and stress is a major cause.  Stress and loss.  If you weren’t depressed, maybe that would be sign that you weren’t really paying attention.
