That's the secret sauce of the modern world. There's an insane amount of our infrastructure that is just that easy to break.

If you want to deprive a city of power, you could drive out to one of the high tension towers in the middle of nowhere and cut the struts in a few minutes to bring it down. Theoretically if you're fast, you could gut several major lines to a city and bring a metropolis to the stone age for a day or two while they fix it up.

Pipelines? I think you can see how easy that would be.

This is singularly the thing I point out when I say that terrorism isn't as big of a problem as we've made it to be in the post 9/11 world. It's not that people are stupid and unaware of these options or that there's a secret army of guards along every square mile of power/gas infrastructure, it's that basically nobody is doing them.

Furthermore, this is the problem with any fantasy of a second civil war here in the US. If it lasted even a couple months, the probability of an ACCIDENTAL atrocity skyrockets dramatically. Much less ones committed on purpose! All it takes is some moron with a piece of construction equipment or a moderate supply of explosives to compromise a levy during flood season. Imagine what happens if someone decided in Colorado that in the fighting no water should be sent to Nevada and they blast open some of the aqueducts sending water that way.
