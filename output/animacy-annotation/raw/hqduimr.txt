Say you were an old and sickly man. How would you exactly go about defending your property without a state behind you? Without a judge to decide what sentence to give to those who violated your right? Without a police force to intervene should someone try to take your right from you? You would be a corpse, not a landowner.

I never said we need to go back to hunting and gathering, there are some benefits from civilized society (where a state is present to defend the rights of its citizen from those who wish them harm) but to say that you are born with rights it's to simply be ignorant and unaware of reality. Rights only exists where there is someone or something capable of enforcing them, they do not exists on their own.

Also, your argoument about the people somehow knowing and agreeing on wich rights are valid and wich ones are not instead of just making them up as they go is plain bullshit. Have you ever talked with another human being? You really think nobody would just come up with some fake claim to some fake right if it could benefit them? This is how loan sharks came up with interests rate.
