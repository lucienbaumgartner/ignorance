Millions of people didn't raid the capital lmao. A minority of people full of Ignorance/hate/racism with a generous portion of mob mentality and a sprinkling of mental illness did that. 

&gt;It is unreal how sad and pathetic it is that these people are part of our every day society.

What is your solution? Should we put them into... say... camps? I hear eugenics is very popular. 

Oh, I know! Maybe we can just make them a lower class of people? We'll pay for their food and housing of course and put them to work. Better make sure to take away their rights to vote too. Can't have those uneducated savages expressing their opinions! Then of course we have to deal with their kids... Hmm... Probably best just to take them away and put them into schools. It'll be fiiiiine. We've done it in the US, Australia, and Canada and look how happy and safe all the indigenous people are! They'll be so thankful. It'll be fine when we do it this time because we're *pretty sure* our current belief system is the only correct one. 

At the end of the day, proposing to "do something" to millions of people based on the extreme actions of a few is insane. It makes the woman in the video almost look good by comparison. At least she is most likely mentally ill and unaware of her problematic beliefs.
