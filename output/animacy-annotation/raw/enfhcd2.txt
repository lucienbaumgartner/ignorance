Hey, that's what I'm here for.

Truth be told, things aren't as bad as they seem.

If things do turn out this way, an oblivion of unaware and painless bliss is much better off than it could be. Plus, if it was anything like being asleep you would have no concept of time and a million years could feel like a second. 

I like to believe that the afterlife would be a very rational force of nature. Much like Gravity or time.

What goes up must come down. 
Past, present, and future.

Death, life, and the afterlife must work in simple blueprints like the other forces of the universe.

The universe does not overcomplicate, it does not nitpick, and it does not judge you for your actions.

It works as a basic law like everything else it's comprised of.
