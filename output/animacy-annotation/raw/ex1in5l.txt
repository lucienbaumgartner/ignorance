The reason for this is because games were shipped finish and online gaming wasnt too big yet, the only exceptions to this were original psn and xbox live which many people didnt bother to hook up because most games were couch co-op and the additional cost of stuff like headphones and such for minimal online multiplayer game choices. PC however had stuff like MMOs and "some" FPs Arena shooters. The reason there was no bug fixes for games was because a game had to be shipped finished or else risk losing money without a reliable way to grab your cash. Now that patches and online system updates can be shipped out, you get bug fixes not because you only paid 60 dollars, 60 dollars is for the product but you mostly got a satisfying finished product.

There's no reason for game developers to introduce extra content for extra, there never was before.. "but games are harder to make".. yeah thats what the 60 dollars is for, thats what pre-orders and testing your game is for. You don't have to boycott the game, you just avoid buying DLC/MTX in a game that charges you 60$ up front. Someone else will pay your "extra content, give me money" hopes and dreams ten times over because gamers have become unaware and unfortunately stupid as to what they get for their money. You may also think, but it doesn't effect you if I buy. Wrong, singleplayer games now have loot boxes and at the very least MTX even though theres no need for it because gaming companies know they can get away with it and they do, and its just sad.
