Are you high? Let's take a minute, I'm happily scrolling, reading, what not, and here comes this unenlightened, ignorant and celibate fool (for good reasons) or just a dumbass dude that decides a woman needs to see his dick. Its not been asked for and  it makes her feel cringey (cause that's what's wanted, a response about his precious penis and making a woman feel ick). As far as I'm concerned he gets to be treated with the complete lack of respect and forceful personal expression he showed her. Dont fucking start if you can't take the push back. No woman is gonna go, 'OMG what an awesome penis, gotta get me some of that!' If its coming from a moron like this.
