I cannot answer your question since i am new to this trauma healing world. But i found your post really relatable to my experience.

 I was an extremely sensitive kid and since a young age used to cry incontrollably when i saw old photos of my younger self.The thing is that it also happened to me when i saw old photos of my parents when they were kids. 

 I remember myself thinking (way before i know what trauma or inner child meant) that i felt really sad and criying for the loss of inocence/joy of both my parents. It was as if in those pictures i could see a happier version of both of them that died somewhere along the path of their lives. And i was really feeling it.
Today i realise i was really sensing the pain of their inner children... tonight is one of those nights where i feel extremely compasionate for my dad (even if i cannot forgive him lots of things) and for what he had to suffer as a child. 

It is very strange but i was looking at a photo of my dad when he was around 4 or 5 and a photo of myself when i was a kid, both put one next to the other, and i felt an overwhelming sadness looking at them as if both innocent children were victims of their own circunstances. But there in the photos they both look so pure and unaware of all the suffering...

What makes all of this so complicated for me is the fact that our abusers were also victims in a similar way we were, with the exception that they may have developed a different coping response... And since we are compasionate people we cannot avoid feeling very sad and sorry for them... which makes everything so complicated. I find myself in an emotional rollercoaster where sometimes feel anger towards him but some other times an overwhelming compassion that makes me cry.

It is a hard place to be... big hugs and courage!
