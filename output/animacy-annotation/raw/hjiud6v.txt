Republicans blame other Republicans. When I was a Republican, and when I wasn't but worked with and campaigned with them, they were always blaming secret Republicans for being confused and unaware that they are actually Republicans and then ending up voting for Democrats.

Republicans also blamed Republicans who won if they themselves lost. The losers and their supporters would accuse the winners of being too liberal and causing the voters in their (other) district to not be able to tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats.

I also remember Republicans often blamed establishment Republicans for compromising with Democrats and not throwing enough stupid tantrums or not using language that was childish enough. And that's why they'd either lose to Democrats or win but fail to then go on to immediately turn America into white Jesus' perfect paradise. If only they were "tough"/childish enough, then every knee would bow.
