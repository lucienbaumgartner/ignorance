So you have just declared 15,000 people to be non muslims based on no evidence. You are ignorant and unaware of the danger of Takfir:

In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (6104) and Saheeh Muslim (60) it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a man declares his brother to be a kaafir, it will apply to one of them.”  According to another report: “Either it is as he said, otherwise it will come back to him.”
