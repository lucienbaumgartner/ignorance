I mean I’m only 24 but because of my lost weekend period where I was socially clueless and unaware of my challenges I feel so behind- especially now that I’m applying to internships, I saw undergrad students who were in five activities and had a great GPA and pretty much everything and I didn’t do so much. Had the GPA but whatever I did I didn’t really like or get much out of. The funny thing is that I’ve always been around those types of people and I feel I should be like them even though I’m probably not cut out for that, it’s just not me. I need my free time and all that. Plus I’ve never had sex or had a girlfriend or a real friend group and I feel abnormal, never felt a part of much.

But in the end it’s really all personal stuff and self image and esteem and confidence and all that
