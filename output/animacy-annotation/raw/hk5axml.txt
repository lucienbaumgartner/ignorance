Are you retarded? Our economy is incredibly damaged. We can’t get our container ships unloaded because of massive over regulation. We just hit the highest rate of inflation in 31 years. Our workforce involvement is at historic lows. Our gas is the most expensive it has been in history. 

There is not a single metric of how the economy is doing better for the average person now than it was 5-10 years ago. 

This is why I think you’re a troll. You’re so comically stupid and unaware of reality you can’t actually be a real person for you to believe all the stuff you’re saying you would have to be so dumb you’d probably be living in an assisted living home. 

I refuse to believe that someone is actually this stupid.
