“Straight talk”? 😂 Your talk is completely bias, small minded and ignorant of the realities that exist in both China and the US. You’re just perpetuating the typical right wing talking points (China is abusive, US isn’t, China unleashed a bio weapon etc…), so I guess that makes you a far right “cuck”. You point at the inhumanity in Chinese society, yet happily ignore the inhumanity in your own. Look at the level of police brutality in the US, the inequalities, the lack of affordable healthcare, the inability to prioritize lives during a pandemic over political gain, bombing and occupying other countries for self gain etc… Your black and white view of China vs the US only reveals how brainwashed you are. You don’t care what Hawaii does… well, Hawaii is the US. 

The irony of you saying I have a superiority complex, when I am saying both countries have plenty of examples of inhumanity, yet you’re acting like the US is somehow “superior”. 😂 I’m sure the irony is lost on you.
