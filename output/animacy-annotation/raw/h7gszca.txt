If this man makes you paranoid then consider that around 80% of people with herpes are asymptomatic and unaware of their status. So some of the people you’ve had sex with before very well may have had herpes, and the people you sleep with after this man are just as likely to have herpes and yet will *think* that they are herpes negative. 

You can stress about sex with this guy, even decide you’re not comfortable taking the risk with him, but the risk is just as high with someone who thinks they’re STD free because they either haven’t specifically been tested for herpes or they haven’t asked to be tested for herpes because they’re asymptomatic. If someone doesn’t know their IGG numbers, they don’t know their herpes status. 

There’s also a good chance that you already had herpes asymptomatically before meeting this guy. Again, if a doctor never told you your IGG numbers? Or you never saw them on paper, you can’t say with 100% certainty that you didn’t have herpes already.
