That early in the marriage and no kids, knowing what I know now, it would be hard not to cut and RUN.  

The only reason I would be tempted to stay is because this person brought me so low that I literally fell apart, and that led to "positive disintegration."  I don’t know that I would have reached this level of spiritual connection and personal enlightenment without his extreme activity making my faulty belief system apparent.  

Before discovery of my husband's actions, I was an extremely unhealthy, workaholic, overeater, overspender, and inwardly miserable person.  I believed I was "happy" and successful with my self-owned business, long term marriage, and 2 beautiful children.  I had no concept of joy, no self-awareness, and regularly made choices fueled by fear of what I didn’t want instead of love or what I did want.  I was harmful to myself but blamed his actions.  I had zero boundaries and no idea where my responsibilities ended and his began.

I learned that my core beliefs were extremely harmful.  I learned that my understanding of "love" was flawed and just plain wrong. Frankly, there's no way pre-discovery me could have chosen a healthy person to be with because I was so unhealthy and unaware of it. 

I am grateful for my new-found understanding of life that our children will be raised with.  I am grateful to have a spiritual life and amazing relationship with my daughters.  I am grateful to know the man their father has become 3 years later.  I know we trauma bonded throughout this process, but it really works for me and him and our kids now.  I respect him more now than I did pre-discovery.

I recommend using this period to learn all you can about yourself, what core beliefs fuel your choices, and how your brain chose him.   The books "Getting the Love You Want" and "Attached" are great for that process.  "The Body Keeps the Score" is an amazing resource for self discovery as well.
