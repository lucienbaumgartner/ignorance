What idiotic drival. Without the US, the allies would have lost BOTH world wars. GB was heavily supported by US industry and shipping in both wars, and without US supplies, the soviets would have lost major battles. 

Are you really so dumb and ignorant that you think bodies are the only way to contribute to war, or just incredibly anti-america?
