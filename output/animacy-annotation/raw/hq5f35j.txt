Going out of your way to say this is the most ignorant and ridiculously stupid comment I've heard in a while. The only things that are completely lgbtq+ are the month where we celebrate the priorities individuals and literally just the things they do with in their own community and unless you go out of your way to go into that community you're not going to find a whole lot of lgbtq+ things because the community is actually quite small in comparison to the entire planet.
