That's fine for Joe-Schmo Transphobe and Jane Ableist Doe who have five followers each, when you're a minor celebrity who's working everyday to get more famous, you have more reach and more responsibility. Clapping back is okay, but proving you'll take the lower ground and be more ignorant and hateful is not the way.
