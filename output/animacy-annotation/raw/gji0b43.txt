Addressing climate change? Do you even realise how many evs there are compared to traditional ones? According to wikipedia evs make up 0.4% of all cars globally. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_car\_use\_by\_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car_use_by_country). If you only take teslas into account, the number is even lower. Although a surely good development, that's a drop in the sea.

Climate change can be changed my meeting international agreements and reducing emissions country-wide. Musk's staunch hatred of all government intervention, his huge influence over the crazy fanbase and the love for American leseferism and unregulated bussiness do far more harm than the drop in the sea does good. The things that allowed him to succeed are the exact same things that caused the problem in the first place. 

Also, he's not getting us to Mars, he's getting himself to Mars (I mean space for now). Pretty interesting, but it's not humanitarian in any way, although a pretty smart thing to do concerning climate predictions. Seeing how obvious all that is, it's fucking scary how fanatical and ignorant of basic statistics and facts his fanbase is
