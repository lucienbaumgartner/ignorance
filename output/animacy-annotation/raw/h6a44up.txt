I'm so late on this thread, but I had to jump into say that this was such a fantastic script. I was so invested in the characters, and then the boldness of the end-- kudos to you. Just so amazing. As a viewer coming in, I wouldn't be able to stop talking about this show. 

You've already got great feedback and have mentioned some changes you plan; I just want to say, the main thing that bothered me was Tabitha's character. For me, she feels much younger than a 15 year old about to become a woman. She sounds like an 11 or 12 year old, still asking questions rather than demanding answers, not resorting to typical "I'll find out on my own" older teen tactics, and until she leaves in the evening, doesn't seem to have that self-confidence/I know everything attitude that teens get. I actually went back and checked how old she is while reading, because I was so confused about how old she's supposed to be.

That's all subjective, just my experience, and I know she's meant to be naive and unaware of how things work, but I'd like to see her pushed more one way or the other: very meek, quiet, not yet prepared to step into the world of adults; or more rebellious, aware of her power and position, entitled despite all she doesn't know. 

That one quibble aside, this was a banger of a script. Such a great world, so many breadcrumbs to follow in later episodes, a mysterious betrayal-- even the way the magic works feels unique. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and please tag or DM me if you write a second script. Thanks for sharing.
