I hate to be seen as the up-tight one, but trying to be in a relationship with someone that has low morals and is aware of it. I can understand having low morals and being unaware and willing to improve, but being aware and not giving a shit instills a confusion and irritation in me that blocks all ideas of "maybe it could work"
