While still out on his stroll, Jack caught sight of someone familiar. A fellow marine like him that was in one of the ships headed to the island. She looked lost and unaware of her surroundings but it didn't look to be out of character. She was rather large but nowhere near Jack himself who stood at a mighty two and a half meters tall.


He went to approach the hot blooded long arm but waited first, thinking about whether helping her with anything but going back to the ship would be wise of him. He was already in hot waters due to his rather long break and being carried away by her would be bad, especially given that he seemed to be of a higher rank than her courtesy of a lack of Justice coat on her end. But it could also be a result of her losing it or betting it on a scam since she didn't look to be the brightest.


Leaving his doubts behind, Jack shook his head to set himself straight. His gentle side took over his pragmatic one and approached the fellow marine.


"Hey there, are you in any need of assistance?" He asked in a gentle tone.
