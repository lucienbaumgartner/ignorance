Exactly. If you go to the subreddits for individual countries, they are always complaining about how things are there. The Ireland subreddit is just people complaining about how our government can't do anything right, about the parts of our culture that are shit, about how people are awful/not like they used to be. Every now and then there's something nice and people say how great it is to live here/be Irish, but I would say it's 80% whining. That's just what happens when you get a group of one nationality together, and because Americans dominate this whole website it ends up being everywhere. 

I do also think though that Americans are going through a bit of an awakening of sorts, especially young Americans. Other countries don't raise kids to believe that they are the are number 1, the greatest at everything, the best place to live on the planet, and that everyone else in the world just wishes they could live in their country. But I think many Americans were raised to believe that, and their education system tends to keep them very US focused and unaware of life outside of American (other than that it's bad and people have "no freedom").

 So when the Internet comes along people realise that that's no true, and that the US is just like any other country with its strong points and its weak points, people feel disillusioned and lied to and kind of angry. And so they keep talking about it because they can't believe it on some level.
