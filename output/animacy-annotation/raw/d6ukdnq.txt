I was thinking the same thing. Even with this minor minor inconvenience I'm still THRILLED with the auction house because it's much more responsive. I don't know if it's because the user base is smaller right now, but in 16, there was sometimes a 2 second delay from when you bid and it registered, sometimes leading me to believe I won an auction, move on to another card, only to be outbid last second and unaware that I'm losing the card.
