Worked through the shame. 100% felt it, lived it, walked through the fire and learnt my lessons.

The way I see it; there is no point being defensive and ignorant, that amounts to nothing.
Sit in absolute humility, even if it the worst feeling in the world and you will come out of the other side.

You will realise youâ€™re mire whole, strong, grateful and courageous.
