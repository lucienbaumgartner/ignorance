&gt; It blows my mind that companies keep making the same mistake. 

Two things are frequently found in corporate-land:

1. They're used to getting away with things and the tech press is far more developed today, with a further reach, than it was just a few years ago. You can make an argument for consumer protections in just about any tech/product-related subreddit and you'll have people argue against you, the general population of consumers has a fair number of people who would cut off their noses to spite their faces. Some people enjoy the taste of boot ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

2. The culture at these companies can be very insular and ignorant of the realities outside of their rose-tinted view of what will happen with their products... or at least they'll go that route to 'fake it til they make it', see point #1.
