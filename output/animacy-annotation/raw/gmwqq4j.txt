From the rules...


&gt; Section III—By Screening


&gt; A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position


I think they are probably technically right. WCS had no idea he was there and Trae snuck in behind him, within a step.


Then Trae went and aggressively abused the referee.
