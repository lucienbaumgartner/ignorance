Intelligence reports on:

1) *Psilocybe tampanensis* and

2) Persons of Interest posturing (and/or postured as) 'celebrity mycologist' experts - who ought not be named in connection with this other than exclusively for (grimly) investigative purpose

1 - **Psilocybe tampanensis: From obscurity as a mushroom in Florida to famous as a "truffle" in Europe** (Sept 19, 2018) www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/9ha2va/psilocybe_tampanensis_from_obscurity_as_a/ 

2- **Paul Staments has lost my trust entirely...** OP  u/JVHIGHBE (July 5, 2018) www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/8wciwe/paul_staments_has_lost_my_trust_entirely/ (snippet sample, doctorlao 4 points): 

&gt; &lt; Intriguing business (in more than one sense of the word) about this Stamets character's dealing and doings vis-a-viz - a certain long-dead close 'colleague' of his Dr Stephen Pollock (co-discoverer of Psilocybe tampanensis)  &gt;

One more thread (these don't even scratch the surface of what's "in the files") this one stacked to the ceiling with heaping helpings of uniquely damning info.  

But first - a word of thanks whether requited or not to OP-mod u/Zealousideal_Belt_17 - for refrain from any mention whatsoever (despite what the cat drags in "Stamets" had to go there) - of a certain notorious web of malignantly cheered 'community' disinfo narrative.

Code name BLOOD SPORE.

And now that acknowledgment is duly made for not having touched that most malignant of all the noxious disinfo out there  - the thread 

www.reddit.com/r/Psychedelics_Society/comments/in45oc/suspected_cult_leader_and_enabler_of_child/ (info posted there comprises an entire case file dossier just about - snippet, sampled):

&gt; All four corners of Schlesinger's 'Cain/Abel' map of 'the vast majority of murders' - map directly onto every detail in the unsolved 1980 murder of Paul "Cain" Stamets' underworld rival Dr Stephen "Abel" Pollock, discoverer and owner of *Psilocybe tampanensis* (like an ultimate jackpot he'd hit) - . &gt;

&lt; a professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City Univ of New York, Schlesinger has studied the minds of killers for decades... recently completed a major research study with the FBI [on] crime-scene behaviors of some 37 serial sexual murderers in relation to 162 victims &gt; http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

&gt; The 2013 Narrative of St Paul &amp; Hamilton (whether 'useful idiot' or knowing willing accomplice) Morris - uses the exact same diversionary "tar the innocent to whitewash the guilty" tactic already used in a 2011 narrative - by Stamets' Evergreen State Mycology-gate 'partner in mycological crime' Michael (shudder) Beug

&gt; Relative to how a murderer, or accessory, might try 'gaming the police' (to throw off an investigation) - as noted by Schlesinger:

&gt; 1) &lt; *The perp hires a detective* [or 'journalist' - Morris] *to solve the crime* **in order to throw suspicion off himself**... *to strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it* (**the same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police**). … an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was abused like this &gt; https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy  

&gt; 2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameup &lt; In US criminal law a frame-up or setup is the act of framing someone [i.e. an innocent party, by]... to falsely prove [i.e. stage an appearance as if] someone else is guilty... incriminating the innocent might be done out of sheer malice, but *framing is primarily used as a distraction.* Generally, **the person who is framing someone else is the actual perpetrator of the crime**… Frameups often use conspiracy theories to hide the true crimes &gt;

The scapegoating a "patsy," ideally someone 'expendable' like pinning a murder on Poor Dead Pollock on some dastardly cops - is basic time-"honored" method - for whitewashing a perp. 

To manipulatively 'acquit' some slime ball perp by staking out an 'innocent' claim with fleece as white as snow - is "all good." But the Mary's Little Lamb whitewash step is only half the job. 

Next comes the tarring of a "fall guy" - aka a "patsy" framed to take the blame.

It's the first thing they teach in Bait-And-Switch 101 aka 'blame shifting.'

&gt; "The mystery has lasted long enough" 


Like the "mystery" of who killed OJ Simpson's wife and friend - since Nobody Knows (that crime was never solved!) 

The only thing Everybody Knows is - OJ is Innocent and had nothing to do with it. His hands are clean as St Paul of Stamets' in the cold case file of his poor murdered ex-friend Pollock

And OJ was found 'innocent' - by a real jury!

Not just some 'good buddy' posing a 'journalist' who is gonna 'solve' this case (as he self-aggrandizes for readers) conjuring a hambone story - "The Innocence Of St Paul In The Unsolved Mystery Of His Poor Murdered Buddy - That Pollock (Who Just Had To Go And Discover A Mushroom That Turned Him Into Stamets #1 Business Rival)"
