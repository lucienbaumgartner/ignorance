I don’t live in India boomer. In the US the false accusation rate is somewhere between [2% to 10 % with only 35% of cases of rape even being reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684) so great myopia there. And the situations you posted are terrible and DCW seems like a good source though I haven’t vetted it yet. I agree falsely accused rape is terrible, but I don’t see you concede that the scores larger scale of actual rape is also unconscionable so I’m not interesting in talking to another woman-hater/raging incel who engages in fallacies of composition and is uninformed, unaware, and unempathetic. It’s like r/confidentlyincorrect bingo. Not interested 

Oh and that’s how Gen Z talks for sureee “I belong to Gen Z”. How very “hello fellow kids” of you. Go and touch some grass and work on that fragile ego. Imma officially tap out, byeee
