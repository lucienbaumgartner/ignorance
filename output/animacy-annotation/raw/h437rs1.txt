They weren't looking for anything in the emails, but rather what emails the Clinton IT staffers had put on a private email server hosted by a private corporation. Over 90% of the emails were deleted at the start of the FBI  investigation by the private corporation. So it seemed at the beginning that there were attempts to hide something, and that provoked a more thorough investigation by the FBI as they tried to recover those deleted emails.

In the end, there was negligence and ignorance on Hillary Clinton's part. Of the emails that didn't get deleted about 2% had some kind of classified information in them. Only a few emails had top secret information in them. Still it was an embarrassment that such a prominent politician would be so careless and ignorant of security clearance policies (Of course, this was in 2015 before Trump took office).
