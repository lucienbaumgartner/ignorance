It's both funny and ignorant that they said Darius Leonard is our only good LB. Walker put up a fabulous stat line last year. He played in 15 games, started in 14 of those, and his stat line was : 1 INT, 4 PDs, 1 FR, 1 sack, 105 tackles, 10 TFL, 2 QB hits. 

He's not Leonard, but c'mon, that's a good LB.
