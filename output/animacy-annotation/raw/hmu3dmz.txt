I assume it wasn't her choice. Jim Bob, meech, pest, or someone told her she needed to leave to avoid being defrauded or hurt or that this part was all lies ðŸ™„. they need her to stand by him and she can't know everything, so they send her away so she stays blind and ignorant. that is what their whole cult is about. it isnt for her protection, its to keep all of their ducks in a row and no secrets get out (again)
