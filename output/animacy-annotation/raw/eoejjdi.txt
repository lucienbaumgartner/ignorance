Depends on your definition of them lol.  Most of the actual ones have been dead for a long time.  Unfortunately I’ve seen good people I know called that word in recent years...like many things it’s a word/term/phrase tossed around loosely like a $2 slag...yeah it’s stupid and ignorant (that clan name) but this is the world we live in now (thanks internet lol)
