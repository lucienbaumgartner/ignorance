&gt; Compared to the general population, LGBT people are more likely to experience and be diagnosed with a mental health disorder.

Thank you for this. I was very unaware and Australian survey does seem to confirm what you are saying. 

However, they also have lumped LGB in with the T. Doesn't this assume that Gay and Lesbian servicemembers are more likely to have mental issues as well? But they are not being disallowed from service.
