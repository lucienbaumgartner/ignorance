Imagine being this fucking stupid and ignorant that you believe the whole 70c to a dollar bullshit. Itâ€™s a myth.

Women are paid more ok average between the ages of 20-30 right now, but older men get paid more than older women on average.

Men are paid more on an overall AVERAGE because of many factors, including

- Working longer hours on average

- A large chunk of women will take maternity leave at some point in their lives, sometimes multiple times in their lives.

- Being more likely to negotiate salaries than women are, and more likely to ask for promotions.
