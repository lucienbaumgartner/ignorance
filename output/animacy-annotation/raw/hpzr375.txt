lol same. i couldn’t imagine putting up with someone so ignorant and full of hate. 

I have what I have because of this country. I’ve made everything for myself. in this country. 
     how could I not be proud to live here? — I’m able to put food in my family’s mouth, a roof over their head and so so much more, for others. all because of what I was able to create. there are so many people in this world that would kill for that chance.      how could I sit here and not be proud?
