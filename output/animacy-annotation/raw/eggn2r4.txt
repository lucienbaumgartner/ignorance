Thanks for the insight to a leftist mind. It was a little enlightening.

 It is truly amazing to me that you accuse the right of being divisive, when identity politics, the hallmark of the modern left, is at it's core, divisive. Of course it is writings such as yours that make me wonder if you are actually being truthful and believe such things when they are so obviously incorrect. As I age, I wonder more and more just how disingenuous some people are.

 "in that they have a more informed and educated voting base" Verdict? False. Look it up yourself.

"No economist on the left or right agrees with Trumps policies," Again false.

Republicans are the foul play party. Wow. The veritable plethora of evidence contrary to this statement is positively breathtaking. Kennedy's presidential election. The latest Democratic presidential primaries that shut Bernie out. Awan brothers. A non government SERVER for gods sake that, contrary to what has been stated, all top government leaders knew about. The president didn't know his Secretary of State used a non .gov email address? Come on man. “And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry."
