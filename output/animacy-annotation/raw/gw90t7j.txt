Could you imagine what humans are capable of if we had clean water, clear air, Real organic foods without chemicals. Meat from the wild. What if we knew all the plants and trees and used those for food and medication when we needed to. What a human could do if real knowledge was given to them instead of the stuff they teach us in school that has no benefit to anyone. Schools today teach us to be Obedient and ignorant of the truth. We are shown everything that destroys humanity on TV where it is pumped into our heads from cradle to grave. Thank you for your post.
