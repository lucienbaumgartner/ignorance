Except we have real math and working scientific models and methods backing up our science not just idiots who wanna feel special and cant work out a equation if their life depended on it. This is plain and simple and will never change because its fact not opinion. Just because you cant understand it dosent mean its not true. The more you fight it the more ignorant and egotistical you will appear to the rest of the modern world. Keep going it makes no difference because its not like scientific methods and mathematics are going away and surely not because someone dosent understand them therefore claiming they are false. Just tattoo FL on your forehead so we can see you coming.
