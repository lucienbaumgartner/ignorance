Why does your wife think she overrides your daughter's actual mother and how she feels about her?

Why does your wife think what your daughter wants to do has any bearing from her opinion?

Quite frankly, your daughter doesn't have to invite *anyone* on such a difficult day, let alone to throw a party without her mother afterwards. She wanted to keep it small, she is still mourning her mother; has your new wife not lost a parent yet? Does she not understand grief?

With that entitled attitude, she is lucky to be invited to the party afterwards. I understand she is your wife, but your daughter (and any children, quite frankly) come first. Period. I understand she has a half-sibling too but if she wants folks who understand her loss to be at the ceremony only, it is her choice. If your second wife thinks she comes before your children, she needs to reevaluate her choices as a parent and a step-parent. She will always come second and it's selfish and ignorant of her to think that she can manipulate you into manipulating your daughter.

If I were you in some semblance, this would be a hill to die on. Respect your daughter and her wishes on *her* day. Your wife had her own wedding to run and do as she wished. Why does your daughter not deserve the same?

I'm not a fan of wife #2; I don't think she cares about you or your family's loss. It wasn't a divorce, it was a death. Huge difference and she is being super fucking insensitive about it.
