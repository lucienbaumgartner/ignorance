&gt;freedom of speech

Are you referring to the first amendment?  How does it apply here?

Or perhaps you are under the incorrect impression that it cannot be illegal to speak certain combinations of words to people.

Or perhaps you are ignorant and unaware that the GOP acknowledged Donald Trump's complicity and dereliction of duty regarding the insurrection yet voted to acquit him anyway.

Either way - you lose, son.  You gotta bring a little more dick than that to the table if you're going to debate a smart person.
