Weird someone would want to be us really. If I could choose I'd be an ISTJ (blissfully normal) or EXTJ (do shot) or even IXTP (atleast they're smart). INTJ sounds like a disastor... high aspirations, hated by most ppl, unaware and stubborn and often unsure of the worth of an idea since Ni is not exactly sequential.
