"Biden stopped the wall before it could be completed"

So Trump failed.

"illegals started caravans as soon as he was elected"

So Trump failed and put his problems off on the next guy. He even made things worse during his term. If he solved the problem immigrants wouldn't suddenly come again.

HE DIDN'T ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE - AND MADE THE UNDERLYING ISSUE WORSE. 

"Republicans WELCOME LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, the problem is with Illegals."

Unless you are the Trump administration who tried to reduce legal migration.

They also tried to end CHAIN migration... after Ivanka used it to get her parents in the country. 

Everything you said is dumb and ignorant of reality. Try again bozo.
