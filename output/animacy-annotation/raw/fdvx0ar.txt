Yeah because conspiracy theories never turn out to be true. Dismissing alternative theories is quite closed minded and ignorant. It's a fact we know very little of our past, and using "known" history as canon is also very closed minded and ignorant.

That said, I was just asking. I personally have doubts that CD is correct but if we have no proof otherwise and there was no faking infolved, for not that's what we should believe.
