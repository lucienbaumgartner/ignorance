Oh, i didn't see the part about the devils and thought it said "your soul spirit having sex with your spirit. This is suicide sex!"

Somehow, as nonesensical as that might be, i think it makes more sense, like, if demons were, hypothetically, fucking my spirit with their presumably hot something, it wouldn't be suicide sex, with that logic (which for some reason involves death) it would be homicidal rape, and that doesn't make sense either, why would they fuck my soul while i'm alive and unaware of it? They torture the souls of the departed, and my judgement, hypothetically, hasn't even come yet, why torture my soul now? Fuck my living body you cowards!... This is merely a hypothetical scenario of course, demons aren't real, but if this person was right and there were, Â¡they'd be a bunch of cowards for not fucking my living body!... Can you believe it? Fucking my soul, got no guts demons these days. I remember back when a small deviation from the heavenly path would lead to torture and death, what a time to be burned alive... Was i talking about some hypothesis? Ah, yes, i conclude demons are guilty of homicidal rape on sinner souls still residing on living bodies, that is all.

Note: i've read somewhere that devils are in, definitely not in me though, spineless bitches... I guess angels are out then
