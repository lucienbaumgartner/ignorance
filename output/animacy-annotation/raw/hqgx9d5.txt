Yeah. The stock ran up in August, as expected. The stock ran up in November, as expected, just in the earliest part of the window, which was a bit unexpected, but not unpredicted. I made $4k and $7k on options on these two runups. $11k that was hedgies' and is now GME shares DRSd in CS. Yet people who are supposedly *for* GME rocketing keep telling me, especially on gherk's daily thread post here, how they're somehow mad about this (gherk, the thesis, options). Further, I expect GME to run up AGAIN (and again and again) because SHFs cornered themselves. I hold far-dated NTM call options for when they are forced to do some buying (which has been what, six times just this year?) Knowing this, and knowing how options can actually hurt SHFs AND contribute to catalysing a squeeze (and as such, probably terrify them), I can only assume the people who show up here fighting against  gherk and his thesis and options are ignorant and uninformed or are working for the other side in order to keep others from becoming informed.

One note, options *are* expensive for GME, and you need to understand them as well as the theories of why the price dips and why it shoots up cyclically, as well as the risks, so they aren't for everybody. I myself keep my shares-held-vs-options ratio at about 9:1 because of the risk of options losing their value (I don't think its likely in this play, but who knows, we *are* dealing with criminals and a fraud-based system). If you're not at higher XXX holder, options probably aren't the way.

That said, options are on sale right now! Price is low, IV for April is low. I bought my August options on Aug 5th and I bought my Nov options on Nov 18. Good luck to you if you choose this way and I wish you all the success at the SHFs expense!
