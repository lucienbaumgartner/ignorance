Even if he’s not crated, he’s still kept inside for over 12 hours some days?? I’m a nurse. My actual shift is 12 hours not including travel time. You should absolutely hire a dog walker or take him to doggy day care. If you’re this dense and unaware of basic needs how do you take care of patients all day long??
