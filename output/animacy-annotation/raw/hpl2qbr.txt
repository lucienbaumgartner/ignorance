That is just a lazy response because you absolutely know that there is nothing you can say that justifies your opinion. I’d honestly love to hear it. I’m guessing your internalised racism or dislike of rap culture, or just dislike of rap in general is causing you to try and reduce the value of rapid a whole. Your argument is honestly very ignorant and mindless.
