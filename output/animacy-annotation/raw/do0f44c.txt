His ult isn't any more deadly than it was before. It has the same damage, same health, it's just faster. It's still a one-shot for a Widow, and leaves the user completely unaware and helpless while he's driving it. A good Rat will come at you from around a corner or drop down from above, where the extra speed isn't that critical in the fraction of a second you can see it. 

If you want to talk about wrecking supports with nearly unavoidable ults, take a gander at Doomfist.
