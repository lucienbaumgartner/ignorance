My family believes I’m possessed. However if they care about you they won’t really disown you. They just get super annoying for a while until they finally wrap their heads around it.

You are valid. Many people don’t like penetrative sex, and some don’t care for the act at all. Just because someone likes intercourse doesn’t mean they want a man. I would like to say, as I am one, that a lot of lesbians don’t buy strap ons or dildos that look like a penis, as they don’t like them. 

I like spaghetti and meat balls but I detest tomatoes. Preferences are strange but just because you like women, and sex, doesn’t mean you’re trying to fool yourself into being a lesbian. It just means your family’s mentality is warped and ignorant of science or how people work. Mine is too, I just ignore them and be me. If they hate me, then why should I like them. They’re already breaking the tenants of their Bible and the commandments by being bigots.
