I'm glad to see some sanity for a change! What's actually "transphobic" is ignorantly grouping this waste of human life in with actual trans people.

It's always annoying when people on the other side of the world make ignorant and highly offensive statements about a notorious case here in Australia.

Pretty much everyone over here is familiar with the Denyer case and the true story behind it. But, of course, these hyper-woke Americans see Denyer as trans and a poor victim, and not as the manipulative, evil, misogynistic monster that he is.

I keep having to mention to the clowns who cry "transphobia" in reference to this case that **six** psychiatrists- you know, actual doctors specialising in psychiatry- confirmed Denyer's claims of being "trans" to be false. They **all** determined he was attempting to use deception in order to manipulate others to obtain privileges, and also wanting to inflict psychological harm on his surviving victims and their families.

And it worked. The mother of a teenaged girl, Natalie, that Denyer brutally massacred was horrified when he first started this charade. She said in one interview that she almost vomited. There were newspaper articles all about this in the early 2000s, when it first started.

This is a man with a diagnosis of "sadistic personality disorder". He enjoys tormenting and torturing both people and animals (need I remind people that he also slaughtered people's pets, including kittens). Again, [he admitted to hating women "in general" in his confession](https://web.archive.org/web/20080602094844/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1023113.htm). Anyone who defends him, particularly after knowing all of this information, is as disgusting and repulsive as he is.
