I’ve had to quite 4 jobs due to sexual harassment when I was younger and unaware of the legal routes I could have taken. I’ve been sexually harassed in day to day life more times than I can count. I’ve been masturbated to in public 3 times (that I know of) I’ve was almost rapped once by a guy who, once I went silent and stopped moving after fighting for my body and life, stopped and called me a bitch and jerked off instead. Ass slapped and groped dozens of times, breasts poked at. It has been endless. Now at the ripe age of 29 I have zero fucks left to give and am ready to bring the full law (and my knee to his balls) down upon any fuck face wanting to fuck with me.
