Because knowing your audience, like you said, would  have prompted this person to speak differently about OP. That's not a "pass" 🙄😒🤮. And it's gross and ignorant that you said that. It's being cognizant of the fact that black people, especially black women are often doubted, looked down upon, and undermined because of people's own biases. Too many times we are told to minimize ourselves to be less than we really are to appease others. Fuck that.

So you are doing the undermining. It's deeper than your ignorance and narrow mind will allow you to see.

Thank you anyway. I have gotten the gist of your pick me nature and self-righteousness. ✌🏾
