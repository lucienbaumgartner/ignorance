Yeah that was 50 years ago. Now we know better. When we know better we correct the science

It's not supposed to give us definitive answers. It gives us the best answers we know at the time. Science is every changing

But you, as a pleb who's not gone to school for communicable diseases, don't know better than scientists doing all the hard work. It's extremely arrogant and ignorant of you to assume you know better just because you don't understand the scientific process.
