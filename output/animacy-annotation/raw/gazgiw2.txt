That's where you're obviously unaware and incorrect. It was a SHY green statement, aligned with Labor politically, and they didn't need to resort to boats as they could have arrived at an Australian airport with documentation in transit from Indonesia or another country without leaving the airport and made legitimate claims for asylum. They had passed through Indonesian customs and immigration with documentation after arriving there by plane before destroying documents en route by boat, instead of claiming asylum at any diplomatic mission in Indonesia as was entirely possible at the time before 2014. The only 2 people that were allowed entry were 2 undercover journalists from the NY Times Luke Mogelson and Joel Van Houdt as they were the only 2 people that had retained documentation, despite arriving illegally and irregularly based on Australian domestic law, which overrides international law.
