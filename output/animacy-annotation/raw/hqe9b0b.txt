I come from a family of very punctual people. I was born on my due date! Been on time my whole life! 
I hate people being late. I have someone in my life that is never on time. Like hours late. Every time! Can never plan anything those days. Person is meant to be there at 10, they might show up 11 at the earliest. Sometime 2,even 5 o'clock before they show up. Whole day gone! 
It's so ignorant and selfish. It has knock on effects to other people too. 
Example, person was meant to be somewhere at 10am.  Didn't show up till 5pm....in turn that left 7 other people in limbo, waiting around, couldn't go about their day for 7 hours. 
As a person with anxiety, those 7 hours feel like 7 days. 
They know people are waiting and they do not care. 
Drives me mad!
