&gt;Man your arguments are dumb as shit.

Because you can’t read? Good to know. 

&gt;Lol … fucking idiot … why would he know any resuscitation was even happening.  He saw a fan passed out. He watched him be removed. I assume that Travis assumed he was fine.

So you admit Travis saw a lifeless body get dragged out of a crowd and immediately put on the ground and he assumed “ah he’s fine I’m going to continue playing” and it’s a good thing? And it’s also a good thing that he never checked up again or MADE SURE TO GET CONFIRMATION the lifeless body was fine?

&gt;Why do you insist on claiming Travis knew he was being resuscitated when the video shows him look away?

Because anyone who’s not a piece of shit wouldn’t look away and ignore the situation. When a lifeless body is dropped on the ground surrounded by frantic medical personnel. 

The only human being worse than that would be the absolutely undeserving of life scumbag that defends it. At least Travis can pay for these travesties. Your existence is a detriment to the species. 

&gt;I mean that’s cause you’re just a dumb cunt. But if you really try to think rationally you’ll see where im coming from.

It’s amazing that you can think you’re the only one thinking rationally in a thread where you’ve accumulated over 6000 downvoted in 24 hours. 

Did it ever occur to you that you’re ducking wrong and ignorant? Of course not. You’re a piece of shit.
