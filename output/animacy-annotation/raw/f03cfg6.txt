She's 15, and she wants to go home worth random guys in a foreign country to have fun? I don't even know what to say. That's so disgusting. (Coming from a 17 year old.) That is literally so unaware and nasty.

NTA by the way, she sounds like a entitled basic teenage bitch. Harsh and probably rude, but true.
