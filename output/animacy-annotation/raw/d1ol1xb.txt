Yikes, isn't the euthanasia solution stinging/burning if given sub-Q?  I realize not everyone might know that, but that must have been frustrating, what with the client not allowing you to help.  Kinda hard to euthanize or really do much of anything if you can't put your hands on the patient, no?

I can understand why the muzzle if biting is a concern.  I was thinking quick injection under the skin then step out while the sedative takes effect, but I can see why you'd still want a muzzle on.  You have to keep everybody safe.  But if you're trying to shield the owner from the site of a muzzle, does that mean you remove a conscious and responsive pet from them and return to them a limp and unresponsive pet?  I'd personally rather see my pet with a muzzle than have them taken away and returned unmuzzled and unaware that they were with me again.  Then again, I'm not offended by a muzzle.  Sometimes it's just needed to ensure safety.  I'd be saddened to see my pet muzzled in his/her final moments especially if it couldn't come off until he/she was no longer aware, but I'd find it preferable to my pet being removed from me until no longer aware.
