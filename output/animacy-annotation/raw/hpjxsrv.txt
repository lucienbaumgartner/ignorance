I know! That’s why I said it. It’s fucked up the amount of vitriol that people spew based on their overwhelming ignorance. And it’s even more pathetic today because it is so incredibly easy to educate yourself instead of parroting the bullshit of others. Somebody told you McInnes is a racist? Maybe you should listen to him yourself. Somebody told you Spencer is a nazi white supremacist? Maybe you should listen to him yourself. It is so incredibly easy to educate yourself, yet people don’t put an ounce of time into verifying a claim, but they’ll invest tons of time into parroting their hateful ignorant and intolerant claims.
