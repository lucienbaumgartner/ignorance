Wait, nurses? Do me a favour and look up the topic "angels of death" in the medical world. 

By your logic, due to there being a small outlier of nurses that kill people on purpose: all nurses are murderers and the fact you support them and have had them aide you makes you a terrible person.

Like, really, nurses and accountants are the two worst possible examples as nurses have been known to actively kill patients and accountants can very easily steal from their respective companies and clients?

Are you like really young and unaware of how terrible people are as a whole if you look at only the negatives of our world? 

Extremely, extremely weak cope.
