Hey, I wasn't sure if you were actually aware of asexuality when I originally wrote my reply, but if you're unaware and curious, look it up, particularly romantic asexuals and terms that are on the asexual spectrum such as demisexual and gray-A.

I thought of this because "wait what the fuck I thought everyone was like me and just pretending to care about sex because it's what the media does ???" is like the quintessential asexual experience.
