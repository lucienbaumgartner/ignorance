If you can't admit that your country has serious problems with electoral fraud simply because it might help the opposing party's narrative, then you are being a bad leftie.

I'd rather Americans realize that their elections are heavily tampered with than live in fantasy land.    What's the goal of not informing Americans about electoral fraud in their own country?  To make them more ignorant and unaware of the political machinery in their own country than they currently are?

Regardless, ultimately, the military is the one who decides who sits on the throne of the Oval Office.    A good example of this happened in your very own country back in 2000 under G.W. Bush.  [The military literally created fake ballots to beat out Al Gore at G.W. Bush's request.](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/02/politics/bush-gore-military-ballots/index.html) 

However, unlike G.W. Bush, Trump doesn't have the same level of support with the military.   Not to mention this ignoring the fact that Biden.  And this is among both the [rank and file](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/) and the [generals](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/10/20/list-of-former-senior-military-leaders-backing-biden-now-outnumbers-trumps.html).  At most, he's got tepid support from the military and you need more than that to get help with a coup.

The reason why I think Trump isn't that bad (compared to Biden of course)?

[Because Trump's interventions usually end like this.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-press-trump-for-answers-on-foiled-venezuela-raid)  The Dems were even whining that Trump was too incompetent to successfully regime change Venezuela.

Meanwhile status quo Democrat and GOP interventions end up being [far more successful.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-worst-mistake-libya/478461/)Now they've got slave markets!  Wee!

I'll take the incompetent warmonger and fraudster than the competent one thank you very much.   

P.S.  Vaush makes some great points but I don't really get this hostility.  Particularly when there's seemingly nothing backing it up.  Do we actually try to argue anything here or is this all just a giant circle jerk?
