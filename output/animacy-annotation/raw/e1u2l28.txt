This is such an interesting perspective! And it's definitely why I feel so much for NPD and don't want them to get hate. It comes from misinformation and listening to nothing but Criminal Minds diagnosis' and abuse stories.  

None of us asked for this and we're all just sick while also facing SO much stigma for it. Unaware and untreated NPD can be dangerous, just like APD, HPD, and BPD. But that doesn't mean we're evil people at our core.
