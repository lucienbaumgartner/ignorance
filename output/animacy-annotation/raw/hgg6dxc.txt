Dislocated both shoulders as a toddler from being yanked back by my arms for 'wandering off' and 'not listening'.   Dishes smashed in my face and food being forced in my mouth while held down for not eating food that bothered me.  Many other darker scenarios best left out for now.  That was my dad.  Mom got in my head real bad instead.

Weekly beatings from my older sister for being "weird" around her friends.  Or so I thought, she's since told me "mom would make fun of me and you would laugh so you deserved it", which in context means that she thinks I, an autistic kid all during the ages of 6 to almost 8, when being watched by her, deserved to be beaten to the point I was on the ground protecting my face because my mother (the only authority figure around) would make a joke and I'd laugh, because I didn't have the capacity to recognize it as cruelty.

So offhand, I'd say yes.  A lot of us were probably raised at least in part by the undiagnosed and unaware (and probably un-self-aware), since it's common parents of autistic people have their own neurological issues and as poorly understood as those things are now, imagine how poorly understood those things were then, when they were kids.
