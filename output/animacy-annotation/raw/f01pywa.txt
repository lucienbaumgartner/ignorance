While I don’t have much experience at all playing him specifically, I do have a lot of experience fighting him and playing this game in general. 

Do not become a predictable Aramusha player. There are a select amount of tools at the Aramusha’s disposal, however they are all pretty readable. Aramusha is meant for a high damage/risk type of play style. Few other characters have the ability to confirm as much damage as he can. But that’s the trade off...he’s easily read and predicted. Your best friend, therefor, is feinting. Baiting attacks and counter attacking will be your game, if you truly decide to get good with the Mush. 

- His zone can be feinted into a guardbreak, as most players will go for parries on the unblockable attack. 

- Most players who aren’t able or aware how to exploit Aramusha’s chain will also go for parries on his heavy chain attacks. Use this to your advantage. Feinting these Heavies into the side lights is a good way to chip away at a defense-happy enemy. Feinting these Heavies for your full-block counters is a good way to combat parry-happy enemies.

- Aramusha excels at removing the unaware and incapable. Single out enemies who seem busy at other tasks (I.e. clearing mid, back capping zones...) 

- Never mindlessly throw your endless chain at a fully aware enemy in a 1v1. Read them, because they’ll read you better, as your chain has a very specific sequence. 

I hope this clarifies my experience with him. Good luck.
