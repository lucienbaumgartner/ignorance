Well now, I donâ€™t think we are going to agree. I do believe that there are effective therapies for these people, but like people I know, they would never admit there is anything wrong and investigate the options. Most of these people should investigate how an SSRI works. Just learning that your feelings are usually the result of chemicals in the brain is therapeutic on its own. 

Generally good advice for people who get angry easily; realize your emotions are mostly the result of brain chemistry. There are various therapies that manage those chemical states and mental health challenges effectively.  

What could also be effective is a culture of acceptance for people that are neuro-divergent. These people are often isolated and unaware of how effective therapies can be, or even just diagnosis. With a qualified professional, a proper diagnosis gives direction on the therapeutic options available, which usually does not include being a nazi.
