The sad part here is that Trump and his family have an audience they can milk for the foreseeable future. Much like the televangelists who prey on the stupid and ignorant of this country to "donate" money so they can live in mansions and fly around in private jets. These people can barely afford things like mortgage and medical care, but they'll give every penny they have to these con artists.
