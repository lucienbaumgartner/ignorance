Hahaha holy shit, did you seriously just use that quote while accusing *me* of believing propaganda???  Did you read the whole thing, or just take what breitbart shoved down your throat?  Go read the full email and come back and say that shit again with a straight face.  Oh my god I can't even take this, I'm actually crying from laughing so hard.  You've seriously got to be trolling at this point... "You are weak minded and aren't capable of making your own conclusions"  hahaha holy shit
