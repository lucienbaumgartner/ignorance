Yes I agree it’s not offensive to say there were other groups, but those groups may interpret it differently as an event that significant will have different meanings and within those groups may be different meanings and experiences. Trauma is an emotional issue and can take generations to solve, if it ever does. I stand by my argument that Mendoza is not an Antisemite, but she is crass, insensitive and unaware of other people’s perspectives to the point of being so offensive that some people will see her as AS because of the sheer hostility in some of her output, that is likely to be those who see hostility towards their ethnicity as racist, arguably she’s trying to prove a point in a political sense to ‘unlock awareness’. I would always start from the point that people are essentially good and should do the right thing if they become aware of what it is, because reciprocity is in all our interests mostly, I don’t think you can do that from a starting position of ‘WHAT SHALL I BE ANGRY ABOUT TODAY!?’ at least partly because she just becomes ‘That angry person’ to most people who she is trying to persuade.
