Yep! But I do want to make it clear that knowing he can’t literally know everything isn’t part of my thinking. He’s really laid back with Alyssa and not led the game play. Which is smart in some ways. I think he maybe did it too much for a normal game but it worked in this alliance. I wish I could be into him as a winner but it’s coming off to me as so arrogant and unaware of the game that was played. And I feel like a lot of sexism is feeding into how they are talking about the women. 

I did not see your edit when I replied. Fully agree about Ky. I guess Ky might win? But his game play has suddenly become so bizarre.
