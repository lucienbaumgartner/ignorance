Oh great, What a shining vertex of humanity... Really helping out society and any hope for progressing towards a more caring world. Feed the rich and stamp the poor, creative and helpless.

Lol, it's same story everywhere, and you advocate it because he takes advantage of people and gets away with it? Haha that's laughable. Not every musician is narcissistic and delusional, (yes they are out there I'm not ignorant to that) but they are trying to get their foot in the door and fall into traps like this. They waste their time and money which they don't have. Why don't thy have it? Be more like Jason you say? Because they spend 40 hours or more a week on their craft, not 40 hours on menial tasks like working at starbucks. Or maybe even like you suggest, fuqin other people over. 

Musicians and artists are "scum" in societies eyes until they aren't... and then they are literally revered like the apotheosis of man. They are "Gods" when they are on the big stage. They all started as humans so maybe you need to excuse a healthy dose of ego in the young musicians. Even the big CEO at the top of giant firms holds someone like John Lenon or Jimi Hendrix above themselves, at least subsconciously... they know it! Ha!

 Take all of your records from the great musicians and the classics and burn them if you don't understand that. This kind of attitude is a platitude and ignorant of the fact of how incredibly important music is to the progression of society. Music changes the world, so don't screw over the little guy. Yeah, ignore the narcissists and egomaniacs, because they won't make it anyway. But the true and talented indie artist might need a hand up not a foot in the face like most "opportunities"  out there. 

I apologize for the rant but that's a gross way of looking at indie artists. Do you really believe that all artists using submit hub deserve to be screwed over? Strange thinking.
