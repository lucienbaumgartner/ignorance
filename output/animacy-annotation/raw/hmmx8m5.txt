I think its hilarious that you are are worried about something being a generalized as a universal phenomenon, while calling it an "American phenomenon". 

Not only have I seen plenty of people being made fun of for attempting the local language in many places across the world (I've traveled every week for work for the past 30 years). But more than one person lives in the US. 

Generalizations about anyone are nonsensical and ignorant. That includes generalizations about Americans. 

Not American, just sick of hearing the "Americans do this" "Americans think this." "Americans act like this." When in fact humans act pretty much the exact same way across the globe.

 I've never been even slightly surprised by anything, or anyone, I've encountered in America because I've already seen it EVERYWHERE else.
