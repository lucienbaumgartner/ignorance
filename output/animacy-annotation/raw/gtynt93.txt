I was with a woman who felt this way towards black men. She was also blonde hair and blue eyes. She was a controlling, arrogant woman, who could never be wrong, even if she was blatantly so. She was very manipulative, would start arguments from out of trivial bullshit, and also I could see down the road if I didn't leave her and walk away from her, she would have probably became physically abusive.

I was also objectified extremely hard by her, she sneakily took pictures of me while I was naked and unaware and then showed them off to her friends. 

These women feeling this way towards us is not flattering at all, but as a way of sexualising us as only objects, or as a way to express their rebellion, but we would never be respected for our personalities, our brains, our creativity by these sorts of women, only our dicks, how long we last in bed and how jacked we are.
