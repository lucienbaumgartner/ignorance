That's far from a definition. Typical uneducated boy makes a lame statement with zero backup. Asked to educate and provide a definition and the simple minded boy simply says longer than 2 seconds.

The fact of the matter is there are tens of millions of police encounters per year. Of those tens. Of. MILLIONS.  Maybe a dozen or so make the news out of those tens of millions and there may or may not even be excessive force used. The dim witted, ignorant and uneducated idiots like you think this is the majority of police encounters.

If you don't think a LEO pulling over or helping citizens with accidents you are simple. 

I remember my first baby argument too.
