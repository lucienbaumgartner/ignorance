&gt;I didnt show any emotional reaction at all. I said: „That already happened, we cannot change that incident“  
I tried to calm the others down and direct their attention to something else since there was nothing we could do after we brought her to the hospital.  
I was called cold-hearted and ignorant of the feelings of others more often than i can remember. Older family members called me a robot without feelings.

Reading the audience would be a good skill to apply in cases like this. While it's true that an accident can't be undone, it's also compassionate to recognize and validate another's emotional feelings, especially during times of distress. The word itself refers to taking on/sharing the burden of someone's pain. I can tell you as a mother that watching children get seriously hurt is distressful like no other kind of distress on this great, green earth. By stating technical facts only, you came across as unsympathetic, which I'm going to assume did not really reflect your beliefs about the whole incident. 

If you have trouble connecting with people emotionally (from everything from emergencies to having fun), that's not a factor of Stoicism but might be one of social skills, which like all skills are understood and expressed on a spectrum. If I had a genie in a bottle the first thing I would ask for is a comprehensive method to help people of all ages develop and improve social skills. A lot of communication goes on behind the scenes, so to speak, and non verbal communication is an important part of human social behavior. The thing is, not everyone has the opportunity or effortless aptitude to pick it up early. There should be more efforts to address this, imo, especially as we're learning so much more about it, but now I'm rambling.
