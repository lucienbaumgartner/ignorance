LOL YES. It’s absolutely HILARIOUS when short white men consider themselves an oppressed group hahaha. But it’s also infuriating because of the ignorance. How ignorant do you have to be to think you are oppressed because of your height? Imagine being SO privileged and ignorant that you think “oppression” involves being rejected by some women for your height. 

Now - like you said, I’m not at all saying discrimination against short men is a thing. I think it’s disgusting for men to belittle other men for being short, and I think it’s disgusting for women to blatantly tell a man she’s not attracted to him because of his height. 

But discrimination =/= oppression. You are not oppressed simply because you’re made fun of or judged for your height. That’s like saying women with small breasts or butts are oppressed, that people with large noses are oppressed, etc. You do not have prolonged societal repercussions for being “short.”

Plus, last point - the stigma short men push is SO over exaggerated. Not all women require men to be at least 6’0. Hell, not even the majority of women require that. Like you said, the average height is under 6’0 - are they saying all short men will never find love? That’s obviously not the case. Yes, some women do require/prefer taller men, but those are clearly not the women for you. There are many, many others who will still date you and not give a single fuck about your height.
