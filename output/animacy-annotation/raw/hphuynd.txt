Eh. Yes and no. It’s a megaphone for stupidity that easily snowballs out of control among the ignorant and gullible. Social media is detrimental to critical thinking among the less intelligent but it doesn’t just highlight their shortcomings and prejudices; it exacerbates them. The echo chamber gives them confidence in numbers to the point that they lose the ability to question themselves even in the face of irrefutable evidence. IMO
