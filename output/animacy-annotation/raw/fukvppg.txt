I wish things like this were on when I was a child. I was so closed minded and ignorant. That kind of rational lead to a lot of hate in my heart for reasons I didn’t understand. Took me a while to understand how misinformed and uneducated I was about the world. I hope messages like this help kids to become more accepting and understanding so that their hearts don’t feed into the same hate I once harbored.
