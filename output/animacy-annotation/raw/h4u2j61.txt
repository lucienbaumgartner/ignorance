You're right, yes not wanting to date someone solely because they're trans is transphobic. That doesn't mean you can't reject someone for that reason or should be forced to date them, it just means there are internalized biases, and someone who can't even be bothered to examine their internalized biases is in no way an ally. Self identified allies are the worst, I legit prefer transphobes, at least they're honest. 

Not waiting to date a trans person you aren't specifically attracted to? Not transphobic

Not wanting to date a trans person because they don't have genitals you like? Not transphobic

Not wanting to date a trans person because you want kids? Like you said, the standards there should be the same for cis people. If so. Not transphobic

If you don't want to date a trans person you are attracted to, or were attracted to before finding out they're trans, and they have genitals you like? Transphobic.

If your "preference" for trans people is exclusionary, and if what they actually look like or what their body is like don't matter and only them being trans does, yes it's transphobic. We can't stop people from being transphobic, but we can still call it out when they are.

Also, cis people don't get to decide whether something is transphobic or not, and while genital preference is a legit thing, preference used by these "allies" you speak of is often just a mask for internalized transphobia and bigoted assumptions about other people's bodies, while they pretend to be caring trans people and trans rights so they can jerk each other off with how good they are. Not all trans people have the same genitals, and excluding all trans people based on assuming their genitals is gross, and ignorant of the fact that surgery exists and is advanced enough to be often indistinguishable. 

Honestly, it's hard enough to get people to accept that rejecting someone solely on race is racist like you said, this is even less accept by cis people. 

But yeah you're right
