Every now and then we’ll bond with someone in a truly special way, and every moment with them is perfect and unforgettable so we inevitably fall in love. We’ll hold that thought for weeks, or months waiting for the right time to tell them, only to find out they don’t feel the same way. 

This happened to me a few years ago, and it caused me a lot of pain but neither of us wanted to end the friendship. It was ok at first, but I was still in love with her fully knowing she will never fall for me. Our dynamic never changed, every moment together was still just as perfect, but that only made me feel worse, and our relationship became increasingly strained. We fell out in the end and haven’t spoken to each other since. 

If you know this relationship is impossible, why come back into it? You’ve already made a decision, and that was really brave of you. It will suck because if you two decide to be friends again, you’ll likely get on just as well as before. If you know he’s leaving it’s not worth chasing it. 

You’re not an asshole for making this decision, but he’s probably confused and upset. Based on your post it seems he really values your friendship a lot, I think you should talk to him about it, but make it clear you’ve made your decision and why, especially how you feel he’s deceived you. Hopefully he’ll learn not to do it to someone else in the future, because it sucks to be led on for nothing. 

Some replies are saying he’s manipulative. Maybe but as a boy I think he’s just dumb and unaware of the pain it’s causing you. Also he may actually like you but is reluctant to move forward because he knows he’s leaving, it’s easier for him to accept. 

When I was younger I never dated someone for more than a few months. I just had no fucking idea what I was doing, I was scared of commitment and unsure of where I was going with my life. Still got a lot to learn, but I’m much happier without chasing anyone. 

NAH sorry about my long comment
