&gt;developers / contractors who spend time and money doing it right
Bur earlier you said all HGTV contractors shows like Mike Holmes or Bryan are “garbage”, yet they’re all licensed contractors and do everything perfectly.....
So why call it garbage then?
Why disrespect the entire profession?

&gt;calling me for help
So you admit that non-professional “mom and pops” call you for help, and based off your limited experience you call the entire profession “99% scum”?
You’re so clueless and ignorant that it’s laughable.

The worst part is insulting my family, indirectly or not I don’t care.

My family works 14 hours a day and they do everything they can, and to see ignorant jerks like you spread lies online and insult them(99% scum) is an insult to both our honour and the profession.

I’m sure you wouldn’t like people saying “99% of architects are pieces of sh!t and scum of the Earth”, right?

I’m done with this conversation.
