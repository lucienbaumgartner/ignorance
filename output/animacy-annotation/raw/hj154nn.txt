Minorities of people on the left are also doing that. I’m from Portland where and antifa guy killed a Proud Boy on the streets. 

But I’ve addressed the point you’ve made multiple times already and I don’t feel like doing it again. It’s paranoid and ignorant of our history

And trust me, many in the right saw the left in the same way when we were throwing shit at cops, trying to burn the police station while cops were inside, saying the only good cop is a dead cop, etc… (Portland) 

But yeah, if you look at the most extreme of each sides were on the verge of a civil war, like we’ve been in almost every decade since we were founded

People need to learn their history and get out of the 24 hour news cycle, it’s feeds paranoia and lives off fear
