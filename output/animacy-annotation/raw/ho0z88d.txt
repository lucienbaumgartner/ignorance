Ryoma. Initially all the glitz and glamor of Ryoma being absurdly overpowered kinda makes you forget his part in the story. But when you actually think about Birthright’s plot Ryoma going afk to fight in a secret Nohrian resistance group is just bizarre, and paints him as being irresponsible when Hoshido is in the midst of war without an established leader. I find it hard to believe that he’s doing more good as a soldier than he would as Hoshido’s leader, and his actions put the cast of BR in a lot of danger as they go on a wild goose chase to find him. Add to that the fact that Ryoma is somehow unaware that Nohr struggles with food shortages and limited resources and he just comes off as being comically ignorant. Nohr is literally Hoshido’s neighbor and political rival, how could the heir to the throne not be privy to such obvious details that even a Nohrian commoner knows? Unless Garon’s doing a really good job of hiding Nohr’s problems it just seems strange. To his credit immediately upon learning this fact Ryoma makes a promise to try and alleviate this problem once he is king, but yeesh, Ryoma’s teachers and advisors should be fired if they couldn’t even tell him that basic information about Nohr.

Ryoma is not malicious but his actions paint him as being unaware and unthinking, especially for someone in his position of power. I have no issues with a flawed character but since nobody calls Ryoma out on these flaws (that I can remember anyways) it detracts from Ryoma for me, at least
