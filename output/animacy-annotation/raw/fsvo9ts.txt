In general, it is not up to organizations, charities, political parties, corporations, etc. to educate children. That falls within the home, the family, and the parents, friends, and close social groups the child is raised with.

If a child is raised racist and unaware that hating a race based on skin color and stereotypes is morally wrong, that is not the fault of lack of money.

Likewise, no amount of money can make a cop not murder someone. That would be a miracle cure-all to instantly make bad, murderous people into good people. It's laughable you think giving out random amounts of money to organizations will solve what are actually thought crimes (racism and prejudice are born in the mind) or that money to organizations somehow will make someone or people that are bad into good people.
