Ok now you're the one reaching. You should really figure out why you hate Houston so much, why you can't imagine how people with different wants and needs might like something you don't like. I honestly don't miss how fake people in LA are like you. People brag about being morally superior because they are "tolerant" and "woke" and yet they are super ignorant and discriminatory against something that is even slightly different from what they're used to. It's just sad.
