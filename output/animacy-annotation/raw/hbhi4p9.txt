I find it so sad sometimes because I remember how hopeful I was as a kid. As if me being naive and unaware of reality was a gift. Now its sad because my greatest fear is finding the love of my life. Starting a family being a loving husband and caring father, and just as I begin to think that everything will actually be okay, things falls apart and I lose everything and everyone. But like you said I like to think that I won't be swept away by life's injustice but sure enough I expect to get swept away regardless.
