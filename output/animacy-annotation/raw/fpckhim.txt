Yes, my ex was unaware and untreated. She stayed with an abusive NPD for seven years before me (if what she says is true and the truth for a BPD is what it is), from her own word "she was obsessed by him" and only left because he almost killed her.
Recently I contacted her to catch up, I still did not know anything about this disorder at this point, she didn't answer, left her job and moved miles away almost immediately. I will never know if my message triggered that reaction.
They think that by changing place they can start fron scratch, that their issues were all related to the people in the former place. They cannot accept it will follow them everywhere just because they cannot accept the problem is in themselves.
Did you have an experience with a BPD or do you have it?
