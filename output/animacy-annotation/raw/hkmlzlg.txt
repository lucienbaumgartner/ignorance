Thanks for starting this conversation.

I’m born in the African continent, and I’ve experienced being a diaspora because I’ve lived abroad in different countries, so it’s been interesting.


In my home country, being black has only become a recent conversation, since we’ve imported a lot of American culture through music, movies, etc. Not that we don’t discuss or engage critically with race, but the identity politics conversation here feels very foreign and exclusively American. In my country at least, the biggest conversation is about Africanness. (Not the ancient Egypt kind of Africanness either)


My experience living abroad was telling. I was living in a country that is very homogenous and unaware of blackness and black people in general. Since I speak English too, many people assumed I was American, which to me was always a privilege because I got to be a “cool foreigner”. African Americans however would be offended whenever someone asked them if they were African, but could never articulate why. (Theoretically, I get it. Double consciousness and all). 


I honestly feel that the American version of blackness monopolizes the conversation, simply because it is American. The US as a nation monopolizes, it’s a point of power, and it’s simply the international system. It’s difficult therefore to critically engage with African Americans who don’t realize or refuse the acknowledge the American privilege that characterizes their position. In Portuguese, we call this “lugar de fala”, something like “positionality”. 


I think African Americans need to think amore about positionality. What space do they occupy in the global race conversation? How can alternative experiences be given the space to emerge and share? What kinds of exchange can be made possible if other voices are given the room?
