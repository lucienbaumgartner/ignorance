why do you assume i'm not self-aware? perhaps i am, but i genuinely do not care how you perceive me, or i subscribe to a worldview that engenders behavior different than yours. didn't you just say assumptions are bad two posts ago? wow, how stupid do you have to be to immediately contradict yourself while believing yourself to be correct? it's like you're literally so stupid and unaware that you're unaware of how your internal logic conflicts. it's *almost like* you deserve condescension.
