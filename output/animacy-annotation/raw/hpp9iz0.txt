The person you're replying to is both delusional and ignorant of history. An often fatal combination for any constructive dialogue. Imagine calling others racist while espousing the belief that in the 1800s there was some European "super-class" called "White people." While campaigning against the imaginary belief that people are ignoring the contributions of minorities and lumping them together (nobody is) she proceedes to lump all Europeans in one category.

That minorities contributed to the creation of Canada is a fact. That they were the most important element in its creation is utter nonsense and wank. And this is coming from a minority (Afghan-Canadian).
