So true. Each civillisation or remote tribe created their own God, which they worshipped and appeased, as they were both frightened and ignorant of the natural world.

No God is better than another, they all served the same function.

Little difference between human sacrifice practice of the Aztecs to appease their God and the Bible advocating sacrifice of the'first born son' to God.
