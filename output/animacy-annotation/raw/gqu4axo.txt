Crypto is not built on the greater fool theory. As the true fool is the one who doesn't buy bitcoin and holds USD with the federal reserve printing out money. You lose wealth that way. Also you obviously don't understand market caps as you think its just as likely for CRO to reach 20$ as 2$ when thats simply untrue. You obviously don't understand market caps in crypto. I feel bad for idiots such as yourself. Its so ironic you call it the greater fool theory when in reality YOU are the fool. Very sad and ignorant of you.

You are completely wrong on pretty much everything you just said. Yikes ðŸ˜¬. I feel bad for you.
