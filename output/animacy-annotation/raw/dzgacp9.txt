&gt;Look in the mirror, boomer. You “people” have done much worse to American society than Nazis could ever hope to do. 

If you look closely, you can see the entire point of the conversation go directly over the head of the retard. The tard continues to flail about, shoving chicken tenders, and what appear to be a type of laundry detergent, into his gaping maw. Breathlessly, between a chewing motion that reverberates down his chins and ripples through his bloated midsection, he mumbles "boomer."

He thinks to himself, after he catches his breath from the rigorous chewing, "that'll show him."

Completely unaware, and seemingly unconcerned that the term is only pejorative in his mind, he tosses his crumb-covered paper plate to the floor and heaves to shift his massive body toward the end table, where the two-liter of mountain dew sits. "It's okay if it only makes sense in my mind, because in here I'm important. In here, the God Emperor knows me by name and loves me."
