Also you do understand you can never actually "win" these kind of conversations, because the people you are arguing with, aka me, has to care about appealing to your notion of what is a righteous opinion, and I don't care. I do my best to be good to people according to my own righteous opinion, and so far so good, so why would I agree with you and deem myself a bigot because you say so? You can call me ignorent and racist, but this is reddit everyone calls everyone ignorant and racist so it doesn't mean anything to me. 

Hope you figure out how to empathize with people on a personal level without having to pigeonhole every POC and push your moral superiority on everyone to feel like your opinions are valid. I don't need to do that, I can just be decent and empathetic to people's personal experiences.
