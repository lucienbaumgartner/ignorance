Looking at him running away from those girls and his friend and getting on the elevator I thought  maybe he's re-thinking his choices and perhaps turning rogue. But then he went back to the bar and treated the bartender like shit and shot his friend and I thought "yea he's just dumb". Also the way he wants to butt in in every conversation Marcos has with his advisors shows how unprepared and ignorant of the situation is. He's just a kid but Marcos getting inside his head made him think he's hot shit.
