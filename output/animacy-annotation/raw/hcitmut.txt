You're completely right. These grown, wealthy women spend large amounts of money to get into multiple fan signs to give very expensive gifts with the express purpose of getting the attention of these idols.  They go to extreme measures going to multiple locations to make sure they stand out and then give their personal information to the idols in hopes of attaining a physical relationship with them.  

It would be very naive to assume these women are completely innocent and unaware of what would happen if the idol accepts their invitation to their hotel room.  Also very naive to think if they accepted one person's invitation,  they wouldn't also accept others as well. 

I'm not saying what he did was right,  but the responsibility isn't just with him. Don't go around buying expensive gifts to get attention.  Don't be willing to accept being treated in a way you feel uncomfortable just to get close to a celebrity.  Don't think that spending tons of money to try to be close to anyone gives you rights to that person.
