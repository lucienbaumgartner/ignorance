Are you in Australia? I don’t think so. I grew up in Yolngu and Worimi communities and ongoing genocide is a load of crap and ignorant. Ongoing descrimination - certainly but it’s both within the community with elders and uncles holding kids back from making a decent life and valuing education and teaching them to hate the white way of life and middle aged and older racist white men who are ignorant and target Aboriginals and put them down and reinforce stereotypes and abuse them on social media. Aboriginal people have Aboriginal specific job listings that pay above award wage and are often given first preference for employment and scholarships for private school and further education. Unfortunately they are over represented with incarceration rates and targeted by tiny dick racist police officers and are let down by the system being placed in communities out west with no chance of employment and not enough money to buy a car and drive 200km to get a job or education however a lot have broken the mold and achieved great things - Latrell Mitchell (footballer), Andy Saunders (comedian and reality TV contestant), the Kid Laroi (musician), Uncle Jack (actor and comedian who grew up in the stolen generation), King Stingray (indie band) as well as many academics, actors and dancers.

Aboriginals certainly had a horrific deal in 19th and 20th century Australia with stolen land, genocide, eugenics programs, incarcerations on missions and the stolen generation but to say genocide goes on is massively misinformed and ignorant. Mass disadvantage? Yes. Educate yourself before making embarrassing statements.
