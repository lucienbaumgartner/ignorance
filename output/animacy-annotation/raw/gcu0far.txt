No for some reason there's a couple of these Mensa members who somehow believe that the drivers were totally innocent and unaware of everything because there were no shining lights.

Except that sirens and lights are used so that other motorists or pedestrians are aware that they are traveling at high speeds and to take caution. There's no law an officer needs to turn on their lights to signal they are pulling someone over who is partially stopped in a driveway.
