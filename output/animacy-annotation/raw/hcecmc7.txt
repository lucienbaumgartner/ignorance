Teen girls always get hated while the men have their pen!s pass accepted. 

A bit unrelated but I remember watching a video about the truth of lil tay and it was actually the teen brother controlling her and telling her what to do while the mother just sat around and let him exploit his sister for views and money. One of the most liked comments on the video was from some guy with an anime pfp and his comment went along the lines of “It’s obviously the mother's fault, not the brother. The court favors mothers and if she was with her father, this wouldn’t have happened.”  Along with several other comments defending the brother because “he’s only 16!! He’s allowed to be selfish and unaware of what he’s doing!” But I 100% bet if the brother happened to be a sister and lil tay was a boy, the sister would get hated on so much and people would be like “She should know better!” “Prime example on how women get away with everything.” “Why are women so selfish and self centered? You don’t see men doing this.” “Teen girls really are the worst.”

I remember seeing something posted on this sub like “a man's finger will always find a woman to blame.” And the more I hear about teen girls and women in general getting hated on for something that they were completely innocent in the more I believe it. Women literally get blamed for everything while men and women will literally make up so many excuses for men and come to his defense. I am so sick of men and women acting as though men are children who are never aware of their mistakes and are saints who never intend to hurt anyone. Especially if they’re ‘alpha’ like they claim they are.
