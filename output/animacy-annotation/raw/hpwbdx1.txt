If you think the US is the only country with colorism and racial issues you are both seriously ignorant and apathetic to what is happening outside of your own life. These issues are everywhere and fantasy based media like this actually does a great job of exposing cultural biases/prejudices and those should be addressed otherwise things never improve.
