Not a NP, but I am a master's prepared nurse working in mental health specializing in drug and alcohol addiction. 

During nursing school I saw my share of blood and needles. You need that training to prepare you for a career in medicine. I think when people think mental health, they imagine a cute office with Rorschach blots, a big couch, sharing heart to heat conversations, "Here's your Prozac come back in a month." It's not all butterflies and rainbows. Remember when you work in a mental health setting you may have clients that are gravely disabled and unaware that the " red stuff"on their foot is cellulitis, or that they have defecated in your office chair, or they may show up in alcohol withdrawal and vomit all over the floor. You might have to make trips up to the medical unit if your patient get hospitalized. I give injections all the time. Sometimes you tell someone you're a nurse and all of a sudden you get the "Oh, you're a nurse huh? Hey look I got this weird thing growing on my back..." and all of a sudden you're staring at an ingrown hair on some random guy's back at a family bbq. They don't care if you're a psyche nurse...a nurse is a nurse. 

Best advice would be to do some volunteering at a local mental health clinic and on an inpatient medical ward. I doubt you could volunteer on an into psychiatric ward, although that where you get the best exposure. 

Not saying you are, but if you're in it just for the money or the title...walk away now. Last thing mental health needs is more people whose hearts aren't in it 300%.
