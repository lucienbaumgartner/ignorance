It’s like that in Australia. What is known as a king hit, or coward punch more recently, can land you in prison for a long time, a life sentence if you end up killing or seriously injuring the person. Often time the punishment is harsher than if you were to just get into a fight face to face and hurt or kill the person you are fighting. Widely regarded as something we would call a dog act, it is looked down upon and I’ve seen a couple people get the shit beat out them after a failed attempt.

Like honestly, if you have a problem with someone and are too much of a pussy to confront them face to face that you have to attack them while there unguarded and unaware of what’s happening, you should be given the fucking chair. Especially in the US where the knockout game doesn’t even have the pretext of a fight or altercation, it just a random unprovoked attack on someone minding their own business. One of the most bitch-made dog cunt things I’ve ever heard of. Makes me sick.
