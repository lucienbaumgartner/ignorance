ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­oh hell nah ur grammar Bru. "Keep commenting on ur shit" no. I commented on ur page once and u replied. That ignited a conversation. That's how a conversation works. see how u flip shit? And I'm new to Reddit and just joined r/androidsetups, after seeing ur shitty setup on my homepage I had to comment. Don't use my quote and call ME socially unaware and lonely because you're too dull and impetuous to note ur own comebacks. u obviously can't write and that really shows ur iq because just a few minutes ago u were trying to judge and convict me for being an "Indian the way I write". Then u go on to say "Slit your self no one will care" ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤¨ bro what. First of all, grammar aside, after all the shit I said which obviously hit too close to home and really hit ur sensitive spots, the best thing u can come up with on own is "slit your self no one will care". Ur almost not even worth arguing with. There are many stupid people in this world and u are definitely one of them. U really unironically posted that with so many grammatical errors after putting urself on such a pedistol as to call me an "Indian the way I write". I type these paragraphs because, unlike u, I am smart enough to type a long thought out message without sounding like a fucking idiot.
