I am sure that she could not be told anything….it was her way or the highway.  She was also very volatile and vindictive so, perhaps her ‘friends’ felt it easier to just ‘unfriend’ or block her and walk away.  She was tone deaf and unaware of the feelings of those around her.  She was a very selfish individual.
