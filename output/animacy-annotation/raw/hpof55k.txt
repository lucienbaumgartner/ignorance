Thank you, and thank you for your last point! Being so unaware and perhaps ignorant I hadn’t even considered that aspect as everyone I know I’ve spoken to in the NY office are making upwards of 190-200k. I’d immediately assumed as I’m on the much lower end I’d just be a “normal New Yorker” and it’s important to understand your point there’s others not on much! Thank you again.
