The Trojan horse. During the Greek/Trojan War, the Greeks pretended to abandon the battlefield over night and left a large wooden horse as a trophy/sign of surrender for the Trojans. The Trojans rejoiced and brought it into the city square and celebrated. When the whole town was drunk at night, Greekâ€™s best warriors snuck out of the wooden statue (which they had hidden inside of) and began slaughtering the unaware and unprepared Trojans inside of the city of Troy
