I mean stronger legislation is absolutely necessary. I was simply saying that there would be no *accidents*, but the amount of "dark wizards" and other rogue elements in wizarding society is dangerously high and needs more supervision. Ignoring clear edge cases like Voldemort, which would probably be helped more by better mental health care systems, there is still a large number of ways to break the veil of secrecy between magical and non-magical society. The wizarding government really needs to step up its monitoring systems if it wants to keep those worlds separate. As muggle society advances it's going to get increasingly difficult to keep them unaware, and increasingly dangerous should they become aware and hostile.
