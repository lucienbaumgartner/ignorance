If you and everyone around you is fully vaccinated, there is minimal risk involved. The chance of you getting the virus is reduced both because you are protected and the bus captains mostly are too. Then, in the unlikely case you get the virus, there is a 95% chance you wouldn't even have symptoms, allowing you to go about your daily life completely unaffected and unaware. Of course, there is a nonzero chance that the virus can spread further, but vaccination tames the danger posed by the disease to a level comparable to the flu.
