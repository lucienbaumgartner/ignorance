That is what the BLM movement sounds like to people. 

A cop unjustly kills a latino? White guy? Asian guy? Native American? **Oh well.** But a black guy? *Now* they've gone too far!

When you cherry pick one and say that they matter, to a LOT OF PEOPLE, it *really* sounds like you're saying the others *don't matter*. That the other killings were OK.
It's OK if the police keep unjustly killing white guys, as long as they stop unjustly killing black guys??

*Jesus.* They shouldn't be fucking unjustly killing **anyone**. 

Anyone that brings this up is then called racist, stupid, and ignorant. 

**That turns people off to the BLM movement even more.**

Insulting someone and telling them that they're stupid isn't going to make them suddenly agree with you.  

**It feels like racial identity politics, like there's an ongoing effort to divide people even more.** 

We're all in this together. 

Instead of thousand of protesters out each day, there could be millions - *if* so many people didn't feel **insulted** and **alienated** by the movement.
