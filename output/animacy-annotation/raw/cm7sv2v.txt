Hello there! this is my first time visiting this site. seems incredible. i NEED to stop this habit! ive been addicted since i was a child. ive tried before in the past but totally alone and unaware that other people had the same issue. its so damn nice to have others who are supportive and ALSO evidence that quitting can help me with my love life. i am quite confident at the moment...though it is day 1. ive lost 150 lbs in the past but i think this will be even harder...
