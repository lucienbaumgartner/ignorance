&gt; Maybe it is that women feel they need to be defensive of their sexuality when they deal with the public.

I think they're simply unaware and unable to alter their behavior. Add in a certain degree of their inherent "entitlement" mentality and I think all too often women think customers are somehow present for THEIR benefit (i.e. that customers should be grateful that they even condescend to interrupt their "gossip" time) rather than the other way around.
