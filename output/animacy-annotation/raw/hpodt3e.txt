"Humans are omnivores" we are not obligate omnivores, we *can* digest animals but we don't require it to be healthy. Our moral agency allows us to make the moral decision to avoid animal products. Meat is not needed at all for the overwhelming majority of people, and as long as you're not in a rural area with no beans, you can make do without meat. Being ignorant and hypocritical is natural at first, but we have to accept the fact that animal products do way more harm than good not just to animals, but for our planet as well.
