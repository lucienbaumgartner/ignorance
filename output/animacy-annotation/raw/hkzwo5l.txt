Im so sorry you have to be this way. It saddens me that your such a broken person. You having to go this route because you couldn't get a rise out of me. This doesn't help your arguement. The venom that drips from you lips is just lies. Your just a sad insecure person. That doesn't know love. Know that I love you with all the forgiveness in my heart. Last night I prayed for you. My flesh wanted to rip you apart. But I know that is not who I am.My son is more alive and free than you will ever be. You are slave to your oppression. I don't care what you say. You are just another empty echo chamber.  The vile you speak is sewage You writhe and rile in your own pity. The tongue is a two edge sword. Your tongue is as dull as a stick. Your mental state is that of a caged animal. Who wishes to be free. But this is not the way to freedom. I pray you see what you have done is selfish and ignorant. That you find God. My God is strong and mighty. Revenge is the Lords.
