"Spend your money however the hell you want, Heather. But stop whining about struggling financially with premiums and copays."

This. It actually gets to the heart of why I can't read or follow her anymore. She relies on her parents or current SO or friends to do all of the 'adulting' in her life and assumes that everyone else must do likewise.  


No, we all understand how copays and premiums and health insurance (and budgets and yardwork and mortgages/rent and driving and kid activities and cooking ...) work. And what she wrote doesn't add up, even if she doesn't give us the '2.' Any of those individual fancy extras (plane tickets, dresses, hotels, concert tickets) would cover even a high copay. And we all know people who having to choose between paying the rent and getting their prescriptions filled or paying the light bill and taking a kid to the doctor when they get a fever. She doesn't know these people because she is completely unaware and incurious about the circumstances of anyone who is not her. I think that a good bit of that is a function of her mental illness, it affects her ability to understand the perspective of others, since maintaining stability takes up so much energy.  


There are plenty of privileged people who post about their fancy vacays and boyfriends and cute kids. I don't mind that. There are always going to be plenty of people on Instagram with more money than me. It would be fine if she just stuck to her acerbic brand of lifestyle blogging. It's the incessant tone-deaf complaining that I find intolerable. She needs to get an editor with a backbone and some perspective.
