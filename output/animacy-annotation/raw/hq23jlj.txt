From the 1950's to the 2000 the DSM used "Mental Retardation" in their categorization of diseases.   It was never used until then to describe mental illness.  Why did they change it? Because before it was called Mental Retardation the term was "Mental Idiocy", before that it was "Moronism".  None of these words were slurs until they were used in the DSM categorizing system, Then people started using it to describe their friends when they were being stupid.  It has NOT been used for Centuries!!  Now crawl off your cross and stop acting like the vernacular hallway monitor.   The highest rated Mental Illness research university STILL uses it in all their journals and literature.  Because it is an actual medical term.  They even go as far to describe the 4 levels of mental retardation!

So maybe you should know what you are talking about before you open your ignorant and uneducated mouth and start fault finding.   You may wind up making friends as a result.
