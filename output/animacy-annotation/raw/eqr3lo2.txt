&gt; Iâ€™d have kicked him out of our life already

A bit over the top don't you reckon?

My father used to be pretty narrow minded and ignorant. That had a lot to do with how (&amp; when &amp; where) he was raised. Over time the old man has changed his attitude and his perspective on many things.

Surely a serious conversation between father &amp; son comes before kicking the old man out of their life.
