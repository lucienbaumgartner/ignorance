Some people are fucking awful, it's hardly your fault that you have this condition so they're essentially ok with distancing themselves from you and contributing to your loneliness just because they don't get your condition nor are they prepared to even begin to understand it. It's more than understandable that you'd be a socially anxious person and I do blame them for doing it, while it might be hard for them to think what it would be like experiencing no emotion, it doesn't change the fact that they know you're going through it, you deserve meaningful friendships and relationships just as any other person and anyone who contributes to collectively making you be lonely is obviously so self-focused and ignorant that they probably wouldn't make good friends anyway. You deserve much better than that, especially when you're willing to put in as much effort as you do to show people that you care by offering your time to do things for them, you're a sweetheart, keep that chin up, there are people out there that aren't awful.
