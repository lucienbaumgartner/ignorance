I never said anything about burning, I said waste, you can't really recover in a dab rig can you? Some of the vapor does stick to the sides, a volt its like a half inch from the bowl no waste,  if i wanted to scrape the sides of the bowl and mouth piece I get it back.  you considering that someone is lazy just because they don't use the method of YOUR choice then they are lazy, thats assumption my friend and assuming is just as bad pushing YOUR opinion on others just to get your kicks, I get it man you want to be the King of the Dab Rig go ahead to me thats way cool, but I don't think any less of YOU because YOU choose a method, YOU on the other hand have YOUR opinion and choose still to call people lazy and ignorant. That, to me, is trying to belittle and its not cool. Even if you said your not trying to impose your opinion in any superior way, thats what you're doing.
