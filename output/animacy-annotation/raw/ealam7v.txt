Because it’s reddit and I can respond to or ignore anything I desire. I’m choosing to engage with however much pretentious bull shit spewing from your mind that I see fit. This ought to blow your top off...there is no earthly way that humans are the cause for global climate change whether that be warming or cooling. Research on the topic is not only embarrassingly, underwhelmingly minimal provided the 13+ billion year life span of this planet, but it’s also consistently contradictory depending on who is conducting the research. It’s people like you who talk about “settled science” that are so blatantly arrogant and ignorant that give the science itself a bad name. This shit is ever-evolving; to base the earth’s climate fluctuations on the actions of humanity is among the most self-righteous claims humanity can make.
