Personally I loved Katsuhira the most. I loved how unaware and nonchalant he was. The scenes with nori chan were just too damn good especially in the gym and the final episode on the bridge.  I'm so glad it was those two as they just fit so well IMO. 

IDK maybe its because I haven't really seen another anime character quite like him that makes him so awesome.
