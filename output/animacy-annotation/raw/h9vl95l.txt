i think she is mocking what its like working with underserved communities— HCWs are unable to reach patients to give them their positive test results (could be because they aren’t able to make phone payments), meaning patients are left untreated and unaware of their illness. She then makes a mockery of the fact that said patients come back with worsening symptoms and more tests and meds have to be ordered… as if its the patients fault. many people in poorer communities do struggle to make ends meet, this is why they often move around and change their phone numbers a lot. As a PA and a NHSC scholar… she should show more empathy towards this community. Not using her privilege and platform to complain how these patients are an inconvenience to her
