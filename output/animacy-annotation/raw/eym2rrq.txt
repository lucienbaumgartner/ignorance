You could take a page from other cases of people coming out, such as gays or bisexuals. I know that some find a couple of truly trusted friends or family, just so they dont have to feel like they aren't allowed to talk about who they really are. 

It's important to know that the people making you feel shame are the wrong and ignorant, that you have no reason to feel shame for feeling good and loved. There are thousands of people like you, and you dont deserve to be judged by people just because they dont understand the feeling. 

Maybe even try finding people in the community near you to make friends with, so you wouldn't need to come out, but rather can start from a place of understanding. It's always important to have people around you that can let you know that what you are doing is ok, and not a bad thing
