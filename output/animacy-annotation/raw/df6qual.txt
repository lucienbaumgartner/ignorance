Reptiliandude: The current argument submitted before the Assembly is no longer that humans enslave each other through iron chains by those without conscience---but rather---through debt from an essentially valueless artificially created money supply.

The argument is, that it is in your natural nature to be enslaved and dominated by the crowning genetic achievement of their research and development, that is to say, humans without conscience; which the Assembly views as an entirely different subspecies than the majority of you.

Understand that whether you willingly allow yourselves to be enslaved, or accept the mantle worn by the masters of slaves, it doesn't matter by what means such slavery is devised... By such acceptance, you forfeit the right to be free creatures yourselves, and with it all birthrights associated with being born upon this world.

In other words, you can become property.

For the purposes of auditing the human species, and to make this name available in familiar language, I will call the sociopath Homo Toxicus so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

The overwhelming majority of the human species would, by comparison, be akin to something like Homo Somnius: in that you are sleeping, underdeveloped, unaware, and inferior.

The globalized feminization of the male of the species guarantees that there shall be no violent or risky opposition. 

In other words, you are being both castrated and fattened for the slaughter.

If you do not take a stand against this human subspecies, and their plans for global dominance, you will be harvested.

Hundreds of millions of you will be pulled into the void, and vanish without a trace.
