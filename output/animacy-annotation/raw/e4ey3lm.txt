The whole point was and is that ANYONE can run for president, not just senior politicians. I won't go on and on about this, as I am sure you are not open to differing opinions. However, take Obama's campaign rallys and compare all that he said to all that he did or even fought for.. if you look at his presidency you will find that everyone in his administration was pre picked by Citigroup. He had all the help he needed from dems and was a status-quo president. He DID NOTHING for America, other than push a failed healthcare plan through, around congress and a crazy "immigration" plan for DACA "Dreamers", that was nothing but a way to import more liberal voters. Shocker, I'm black and voted obama twice. The reason I and many people dumped democrats was because we are tiered of getting lied to and pushed along. The podesta emails proved they not only don't give a FUCK about people (unaware and compliant citizenry), but will do whatever it takes to stay in power and get rich. Again, anonymous reddit message will not change your world view, but I'll leave you with one last thought, that one day will hit you.. YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR THE OPRESSORS!!!
