Ummmm, you do realize that Rage's music is very anti-facist,  anti-establishment, and is basically anti-everything these people worship?? It's incredibly ironic and dumb that they are so shallow and ignorant that they don't even listen to the lyrics in depth enough to understand that. Not only should they not rock out to it, they should probably cancel it like they do everything else they blindly disagree with.
