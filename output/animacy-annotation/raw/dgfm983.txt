I don't know why I keep being downvoted for hanging out with someone who agreed with me that it would be a "just friends" thing, only for him to get me at his house. I was unaware and naive because I had no reason to be, I didn't see any red flags till I was already there. Hell, I've done friendly things with people I've had mad crushes on before and not been weird about them. 

Exactly! The boyfriend was one of many reasons why I didn't want to sleep with him - he most importantly just wasn't my type. 

I don't get why people are so angry
