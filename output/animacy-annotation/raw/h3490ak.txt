You are overestimating the importance of yourself in this child's life.

In all likelihood, this kid isn't going to remember you.

You aren't going to be hurting him or his mom. You don't have negative intentions toward either of them. He will probably be asleep and unaware of what you and his mother are doing, and what you're doing will be consensual for all people involved.
