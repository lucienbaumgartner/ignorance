Legal doesn’t mean it’s not an abuse of power and easily abusive. You’re 22, you probably think you’re “mature for your age”, but you’re not, that’s not a real thing, you’re young and immature because that’s what a 22 year old is. Maturity comes with time and experience. 

Not all age gaps are problematic, if you were a fully grown adult and say 30, then a person 10 years older isn’t a mismatch because you’re in the same life stage. But at 22 you are easy to manipulate because you have no life or relationship experience. You say you wanted someone mature to marry but you are dating a 37 year old man who’s not mature at all, you are too ignorant and inexperienced to even know what maturity is.

Your boyfriend is with you because you let him treat you terribly because you simply don’t know any better. Someone his age would never put up with any of his shit because they’ve had the time and experience to learn what is and isn’t normal or ok in a relationship.
