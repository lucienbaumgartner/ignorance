Ah. They were certainly beyond a-holes for every bit of that. I'm sorry you are having to deal with unsupportive family while also dealing with your miscarriage. I don't know if you've had a chance to have a frank conversation with them about how much they hurt you, or even if you want to, but I do wonder if they have any idea how much they hurt you and your husband. I figure they are either total a-holes who recognize how someone is feeling and just don't care, or they are just really, really dense and unaware of how others feel unless it is spoon feed to them. Either way they have very poor boundaries and if they are going to go around and tell everyone else your business, including about this blow up I'm sure, then I cannot imagine trying to spend time with them with everything else you have going on. Have some guilt free "you" time if your husband still feels obligated to see them.
