Ever heard of the Dunning-Kruger Effect?

You are incompetent and unaware of it. The fact that you aren't able to get these jobs is indicative of your own lack of skill and competence, but instead, you make up some delusional reality where engineers, scientists, and computer programmers who went to college and got internships and did all that stuff have "no merit", "no experience", and "no education on the job".

Your failures are your own fault, not anyone else's.
