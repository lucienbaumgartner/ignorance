They're banking on the "unaware and compliant citizenry" to take them at their word and not research the truth about these pics. They can do that with people that have been brainwashed. Literally lead them to believe the crimes of past administrations all happened under the current one. 

Young people who weren't paying attention to news and politics or were blinded by their idolization of Obama really have no idea this stuff was happening under his admin. They will believe it's happening now. They won't dig further for the truth.
