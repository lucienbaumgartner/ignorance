He just sounds really young and ignorant. That does NOT however mean that his comments are not hurtful to you or that they don’t minimize your lived experiences. It sounds like you’ve tried discussing this with him already, and that he wasn’t receptive.  Feel free to try one more time, but that doesn’t go well, I’d break things off. It’s possible that with time and life experience his mindset will change, but do you really want to wait around for that?
