This is why i hate how people act like it's so clear cut (for both sides). Its a messy argument to have. There  always seem to be contradictions or exceptions. It also sucks that both sides are so stubborn and ignorant that they dont even want to have a discussion. Atleast for me personally, the more i think about it the more confused i get, and i feel like that's how most people feel but are just too scared to admit it because they'll be ostracized.
