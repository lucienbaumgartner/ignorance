And right there is the perceived victimhood. You can't think of a time you've been discriminated against but if you know anybody that isn't white, go ask them about what there experiences have been like. Start there and then see if you think your point of view might change. You don't want to engage with it because it makes you feel bad. That cognitive dissonence you are feeling is a good thing. It's your concious waking you up to the fact that unless you are part of the solution, you are actively part of the problem. It's ok to be racist and working on it. It's not ok to be racist and unaware and you young man need to take some time and talk to non white people you know and just hear them out.

You don't want accountability is what I hear. You have some culpability in societies ills. Sorry bro I do to. Sucks but guess what you and I both have a closet full of sweatshop clothes that don't fit because we grind up animals on a commercial scale just to throw away a third of them and wrap the rest in 1000 year plastic served by a wage slave all fueled by burning old dinosaurs.

You see a large scale antiwhite movement where in fact if you really listen to what people are actually saying and not what you think they are saying or someone told you they are saying but actually thoughtfully engage with the perspective you could be wrong about feeling attacked and instead see people are asking and crying out for your help but you just don't want to see them as anything but the bad guy.

I know I am not your enemy but you can't actively admit to racism being a big part of peoples lives. You haven't once said anything about the numerous other groups that are oppressed but instead just me me me. And that's what people like me are tired of. Think about others. Please.
