Asking the completely idiotic question of, “Does the military really protect anybody?” is akin to walking down the worst streets of New York, LA, Chicago, etc. with two highly trained guard dogs and coming through unscathed and unaware of any attack that could have happened and then saying, “Those dogs didn’t do anything. Who needs guard dogs?  They just walk next to you and do nothing and cost $10’s of thousands of dollars a piece.”  Ignorance and entitlement at its finest, ladies and gents!
