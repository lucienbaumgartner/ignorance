If not breaking the law is supposed to be common sense, then tell that to all the police officers attacking and  brutally and permanently injuring protesters and non-protesters alike. Completely innocent people walking with groceries are being shot and protesters, violent or not, are being driven over with cars and beaten mercilessly. Armed rednecks protesting at government buildings because they demand their hair and nails done are “great people” fighting for what they deserve but millions protesting for the priceless lives of innocent people are just thugs. 

Here in the USA, the priority lies entirely on military and money. If it isn’t making the top 1% even richer, don’t even bother trying to make it happen. Big corporations take over everything while abusing consumers and get paid for it (ex. amazon, airlines). For everything the the president says there’s a quote of his saying the exact opposite a few years ago. Nothing he ever says is true, his ego is perfectly fragile, and he is a narcissist with a personality disorder. 

No, destruction of property, private or public, is arguably not right, but if you think that is the problem in this country, you have something coming because it goes way deeper and much worse than that. In the end, property/money is not as valuable as human lives and their freedom. This country has been running on the exact opposite principle for way too long.

Additionally, political parties should never have happened and George Washington said that from the start. This country is boiling down to some potent red vs blue bullshit and some people are so stubborn and ignorant that they are capable of overlooking facts just to support the color they like. It’s dangerous, and we shouldn’t be voting for someone just because we see blue or red.
