Once lost a best friend because she became friends with the more popular kids and they didn't like me so I got ditched.

Second one was a friend was very caught up in new boyfriend and felt like I never got thought of first and we just started drifting and I pretty much just bailed so I wouldn't be bailed on again. Pretty shit of me but young and unaware of myself at the time. Ive learned a lot since then and that is one of my biggest regrets
