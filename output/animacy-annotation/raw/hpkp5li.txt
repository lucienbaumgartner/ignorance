yep. I wasn't aware of my racial biases, since I wasn't raised with the kind of overt racism that many here are talking about, but I'm a privileged white man raised by a conservative christian family in a mostly white state, that's gonna come with some bias.   


went and lived in mexico for a few years, came back seeing and hearing things a different way. "funny little comments" about immigrants carry baggage, people don't realize when they make jokes about certain labor, funny little voices, talking about conditions in other countries (incorrectly), and making assumptions about both legal and illegal immigrants, how demeaning and strong those comments are at putting down an entire continent of peoples.   


The perspective I gained there flipped my thoughts on their head. I still don't think i'd say I was raised with racism, but I was raised with ignorance and preconceived thoughts on how others should behave. My family still makes very ignorant and defensive comments when referring to BLM, HBCUs, or other things that they do not understand, and it makes me sad, but idk how long it would have taken me to come around to wanting to understand these things without time outside of white america.   


Living in mexico didn't teach me about the talking points or reasons behind BLM or other movements, since it is pretty far removed from those specifics. It did teach me to try to understand what I don't get, since it opened my eyes to just how much I don't know.
