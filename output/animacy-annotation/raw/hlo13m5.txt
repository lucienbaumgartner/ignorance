lol, you are completely wheeling off the point we are discussing, which is the fact that you should have the freedom to whether choose to be bound by a contract or not and also  be responsible for the making of that choice if you do accept, 

its obvious as fucking daylight that this contract has an unbalanced power dynamic , in the benefit of  OP , for all the reasons you are talking about and more, but if a woman makes a conscious decision while being aware of all of this to accept this contract than she is bound by it and she is expected to do as it says just like OP is expected to hold on to his part of the deal, if not than divorce it is, if she didnt know (these pretty damn obvious) concequences that any child could see and are clearly stated in the contract  in case of incompliance then thats another matter all together, and is completely not what we are talking about

you raging out based on an the assumption, that a woman entering this deal is unaware and unprepared for the circumstances  and that OP is luring out poor women in the middle of nowhere, which is an assumption... and completely irrelevant to the case 

and i also would like to add that OP just stated divorce.... like.... i know its unpleasant but its no where near the hell you are describing ...

so please quit your drama
