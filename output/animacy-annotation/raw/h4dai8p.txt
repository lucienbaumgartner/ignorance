Some people treat the "for educational purposes" statement as an excuse. But subs and forums like this one really are educational.

We shield ourselves from the realities of death and grave injury. The media keeps us safe and ignorant of the brutality of existence. In entertainment media, death is either prettied up or so over-the-top it borders on parody.

In reality, death isn't pretty, and it usually isn't quick. The body fights hard to stay alive, even beyond any hope of long-term survival. The pain and suffering isn't always the most horrifying part. It's the futility of the body's struggle to maintain function. The ones who die instantly are the lucky ones. In many instances, if not most, people take a long time to die.

So why do we need to know this? Partly because we need to face the reality and inevitability of death, and that it could happen to anyone at any time. Also, we need to realize that death is not dignified or pretty. It's brutal and ugly and we need to do everything we can to put it off as long as possible.

We need to take care of ourselves and look out for each other, so none of us end up here.
