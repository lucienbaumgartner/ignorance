The Bible supports Slavery (Exodus 21&amp; Leviticus 25) 

Sexual Slavery, Genocide, Murder of women and Children and kidnapping of female virgins for sexual debauchery
Numbers 31 Deuteronomy 21&amp;22

That's just for starters. Don't let the phony and ignorant of their own Bible's Christians try to make a convert/spiritual project out of you. They don't know a God damn thing about the inconsistencies with basic morality that their religion promotes. 

I was one for 20 years but not always active in church etc. The arguments you'll get get to support these atrocities by Christians 100% guaranteed will be 1 Who are we to question God and 2 You don't understand the CONTEXT OF THE SCRIPTURE, which if any answers are given for these evil misbehaviors and crimes against humanity will be nothing but excuses and self righteous justifications

 and 3 That was the old Testament Jesus did away with all that etc ( New Testament doesn't condemn but rather more promotes slavery) which totally ignores the evil which God commanded and they PRETEND it never happened.
