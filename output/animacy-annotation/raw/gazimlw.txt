OP...are you really this dense and unaware of how things work? You honestly had no clue that writing down her personal lyrics she sang in the shower and then selling them to your friend is stealing her intellectual property? And then to have the audacity to leave your gf at the venue when she as your friend were rightfully on your ass for not paying her the full amount that your friend gave you for your gf’s lyrics — you did that because you knew you fucked up! If you care at all about your gf, give her the ENTIRE AMOUNT, and beg forgiveness, and don’t take what isn’t yours.
