Same with the left. California here.
Liberal and democratic parties have destroyed the state and is a super bad example of how a nation state or government should be run period. Both the left and the right have fault in this as both redline minorities and have never had our real interest at heart. We’ve sacrificed blood sweat and tears for this nation and yet for the most part we’ve been unable to get a fair deal. It’s been an uphill battle for the most part and have had to suffer major injustices and humiliations. Most of you will deny it but it’s still okay in this country to belittle Americans of Mexican descent or tell us to speak English like it’s any of your business. Oddly enough I respect those that respect me. Mutual respect will take you a long way, one day you might run into somebody that ain’t going to be taking that shit one day and that day you will see the world for what it is.. this isn’t geared at you Canadian ice I’m just explaining how it’s not just the right it’s the left that has been super racist and ignorant of its past.
