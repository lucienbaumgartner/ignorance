He got famous for lying about Bill C 16 which would add trans people to a protected class in Canada. He told people that if trans people were protected then enforcing the pronouns of a trans person would become law and people could be arrested for misgendering trans people, which isn’t true, the bill only makes it so that people can’t be harassed on the basis of gender identity and expression. And he basically got a whole bunch of people to oppose the bill which would have helped trans people greatly because of his lies. Either he was oblivious and unaware that the bill would not enforce pronoun usage, which I doubt, or he just doesn’t like trans people and doesn’t want them to be a protected class so he felt that he had to lie about it, hence him being transphobic. He’s also made some self help books which are apparently good and have helped people, and I don’t have any opposition to that, but the guy has directed a lot of shit at trans people for publicity, so yeah he’s bad
