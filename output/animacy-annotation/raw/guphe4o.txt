To claim sharing political ideology means conflict is impossible is so colossally illogical and ignorant of basic history that your posts are clearly in bad faith, which is why you've been getting ignored and will keep getting ignored after this. Your basic trolling is pathetic, and honestly so bad that I'd expect you to actually be a nazi apologist trying to make commie apologists look dumber than they already are.
