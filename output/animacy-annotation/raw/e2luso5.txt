When I climbed, I climbed on solo laners (silver and gold) and support (plat) to currently Diamond.  The amount of impact you can have in the solo lane in lower tiers is actually insane.  People are so greedy and unaware that you can actually just bait and repeatedly kill them over and over.

When I got to Plat, it seemed like people were begrudgingly playing support and they really weren't that comfortable on the role.. and it showed.  I liked Deckard a lot so I started playing him every game.  Ended up with like a 65% win rate on him.  This wasn't because I was some god Deckard player.  I'm pretty sure it really came down to that my team always had someone who was comfortable supporting and the other team usually didn't.  It also let my teammates play their comfortable roles.
