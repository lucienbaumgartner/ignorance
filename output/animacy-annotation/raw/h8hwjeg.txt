It's true that I'm looking at it from a position where I am privileged and ignorant of the backstory of rural China, and visiting non tourist areas of China that I found to be backwards and ghetto even though they were probably rural areas not too long ago. Paved cement and asphalt roads and an urban environment with a giant 5 story mall with traffic lights but seemingly no one caring about the lights and traffic laws or general safety and etc seemed to be the absolute cultural norm was a baffling oxymoron to see. Under the context that most of China was mostly undeveloped and impoverished, it does make sense. 

However, even if it's Western media publishing and pushing this and a lot of China justifiably needs time to learn and maybe I shouldn't care how people think, it still makes it look bad and I perhaps unjustifiably wish it was already at that point where it didn't look bad. It's just my opinion.
