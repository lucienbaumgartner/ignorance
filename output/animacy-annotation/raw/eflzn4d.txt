Technically speaking, even speeding 1-4 mph over limit is illegal in Georgia as the speed limit laws are absolute. But the fine is $0 and no points will go against your license. Georgia’s speeding laws are kind of strange. On one hand, there are numerous anti-speed trap laws meant to keep motorists safe from the state’s 159 counties all looking to catch an unaware and unsuspecting speeders. But on the other hand, going above 75 mph on a 2 lane road or 85 mph on a highway will result in a super speeder fee in addition to whatever fines are issued for speeding.
