Yes! Diagnosed at 40. Made a huge amount of financially and emotionally buggering mistakes up until now. Life getting better though! Feel like I have a roadmap now (neurotransmitters are dogshit, do this to make them better) so that's exciting. 

*Disclaimer:* I'm not a startup CEO, hoping to become the next unicorn, and I'm not a product-based business. I'm a pitch consultant who is doing OK and, once my personal finances are in better shape, I'll be able to live a very comfortable life from my business, while having a decent amount of personal freedom too. That's my goal, so these thoughts might not be applicable if you're slogging in Silicon Valley to be the next Bezos...

Since finding out about ADHD, I've found it easier to split thoughts around this into macro and granular. 

'**Macro' is strategic:** how does your business model fit with your strengths and best mitigate your weaknesses? What 'mindset' work are you doing to fix some of the flawed beliefs you have, either about your own abilities or how much you need to meet society's expectations?

*Example 1 (Business Model):* I am a consultant. I have some retainer clients. That's the mecca, right? Dead cert money! (And yes, it's definitely helping with the debt I piled up while undiagnosed and unaware of the various dysfunctions...)

BUT! I find working for these clients absolutely exhausting. It depletes me so much that I'm left with very little energy to put into scaling and efficiency. As soon as a project goes on for more than 4-6 weeks I'm mentally OUT. So I'm restructuring to try to bring in a steady flow of project-based clients instead. This is absolute madness in conventional business terms. But for me it's the only way I'll be able to maintain this for a long time, and that's what counts here. 

*Example 2 (Mindset):* I tried to do a product business on Amazon a few years ago. It was a disaster. It didn't feed into my skills (beyond a few weeks of hyperfocus), and beyond my overall concerns about the long-term viability of it, I also just didn't *give a tiny toss*. As sappy as it seems, I do like 'making a difference' and I didn't see how finding a marginally better dog pram to sell into the US was going to do that.  'Interest' is fundamental to ADHD. So before you worry too much about productivity, make sure you're doing something that means something to you; that lights you up in some way. As I said to a client of mine with ADHD, there is no point replacing a ladder with an escalator, if the ladder was propped against the wrong wall in the first place.

Honestly? A good business coach could spend hours with you on the macro alone. But even realising it as a category could be useful. (I'm not a business coach, btw. I've just done a lot of work on this)

'**Granular' is tactical:** how do you structure your day? How do you plan? What tools and processes do you use to help you work to *your* best?

*Example 1*: I work best in the mornings. I try very hard to keep all meetings to the afternoon, so I can use my best focus time on deep work. 

*Example 2*: I have certain tasks I will procrastinate on forever (mostly those of retainer clients). So I use Focusmate to get those things done. And yes, sometimes I procrastinate on booking Focusmate sessions. It's never a perfect system. But this work is getting easier, and that's a win.

*Example 3*: I use Trello boards to capture ideas as well as tasks (different boards for each). I have a Trello Chrome extension so I can save sites down to a card, knowing I can reference it again if I need to but it's not creating clutter in my brain. Average # of tabs open is now 15 vs 45. 

There are dozens of tactics you can use to be more 'productive'. I've probably tried 100 or more as when I was undiagnosed I got obsessed with productivity. Some work better than others, and I suspect it's largely based on exactly where your executive dysfunctions lie.

*One very important caveat:* I like finding productivity tools and tips to get useful or important things done. But I think it's also crucial to make time for joy and relaxation and curiosity etc. Some productivity gurus would have you fill your every waking hour with this stuff, which is self-defeating. The point of using these tools to get stuff done is to free yourself from the anxiety of not doing them, so you can create time for fun and joy. 

Anyway, hope some of that mammoth block of text is useful. 

tl:dr - start with the big questions, then focus on the productivity.
