Also, cheating isn't cheating if it is agreed upon. "Allowing her to cheat" literally means nothing. Unless you were to be faithful and unaware of her bullshit on the side, then you're just, again, describing the open relationship she changed her mind about. Nothing wrong with changing your mind - but if that change does not work for both parties, its pretty clear the relationship is over. Yall need to love on. Neither of you can measure up to each others needs. You guys are just wasting each other's lives.
