People “know” which God is real based on which continent they are born in and which religion that culture presents through one’s parents.   You didn’t make any decisions about which God you worship and you aren’t being judged either unless God is stupid and petty and unaware that his religion is a flop in one country due to pre-existing religions that were worshipped before your god was invented, by man, on paper, in one location, in one language, in one era.
