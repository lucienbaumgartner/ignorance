This is absolutely fucking stupid. Gambling isn't illegal, self control is a thing and if your kids have access to your credit cards you're an idiot. We are in the generation of "let's blame everyone else for our problems" rather than owning up to be careless and ignorant.
That being said I still think MTX takes away from Runescape 3 but being able to buy overrides and features to ADD to the game is great. Buying stats is still kinda sad but if you got the money have at it. At the end of the day it benefits the company running the game we all love to play, you bunch of whiny tarts.
