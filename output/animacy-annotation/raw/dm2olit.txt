**4x4: Panama**

Panama is a super fun season. I'm not going to pretend it's incredibly deep (although it does have some great character arcs) but it's just a shitton of fun with Casaya dominating the post-merge and wacky situations and conversations happening every episode. Plus Terry's immunity streak gives it some much needed tension and it does feel like you can pick a side and root for it while both sides get complexity, which is nice. It's a great season. I rank it 8/34.

**4x: Cirie, Shane, Courtney**

Generally considered the 3 main stars of Panama and the people that make it the season it is, it's no surprise that these three have made it to the panama top 4, and the top 50 every rankdown.

Cirie is the most universally liked character and player in Survivor history, and Panama Cirie is her at her finest. She gets the growth arc of Kathy with her own unique twist on it, with her giggle and her dry commentary at how crazy her tribe is. The season really wouldn't be the same without her, Survivor wouldn't be the same without her, she's a proud member of my personal top 10 and is probably a proud member of almost everyone's.

Shane is well known for being one of the craziest and most entertaining people in Survivor history. Between his rants, his nicotine withdrawl, and the way everyone plays around him he's a once in a lifetime character. Personally Shane kind of annoys me and I'm not sure he'd even be in my top 100, but I can see the value of his character and once I rewatch this season I might end up loving him again.

Courtney does not have the status as the other people in the Panama endgame, but in terms of sheer entertainment value she's  one of the best survivor characters ever. The fact that they actually found this fire-dancing hippie who manages to be one of the most unaware and annoying people in history and cast on survivor is amazing. She delievers so much without even trying, and she has quite possibly the greatest jury speech in Survivor history after snakes and rats. Great, great character.

**3x: Aras**

Aras has done pretty well in rankdowns aside from his lowly placement in SR1 due to SURM's love of Terry. There's a bit of contraversy with Aras if he's actually an entertaining winner critical to the success of Casaya and the season, or if he's just boring and it's a letdown that he won with all the wild personalities in Panama. Personally I like Aras a lot so I'm on the first side. I think he's critical to the success of the season by keeping Casaya focused and together and helping them win the challenges, I love his rivarly with Terry, and I think he's also weirder and more entertaining than a lot of people give him credit for (traits that unfortunately did not transfer over into his dull BvW apperance.) I don't expect him to keep making top 4 in every rankdown but it's nice that he has done so a lot.

**2x: N/A**

**1x: Tina** 

Tina's apperance in the Panama top 4 in SR1 was a result of the epic Aras vs Terry wars that were had, with SURM cutting Casaya members early and other rankers cutting La Mina early, leaving Tina to avoid the crossfire and make it all to the F4. Still, I don't begrudge her making it, she's easily the best first boot of all time with a story that actually makes me emotional just thinking about it. As great as Cirie is, I do wonder what would have happened if Tina had made it farther and became more of a figure in Survivor lore, she's an amazing woman.

Future possibilites: Can you believe SR4 is the first time Terry's even ranked in the top 200? I could see him making a F4 but there are always people who are going to be very anti-Terry so it's doubtful. No one else really has a chance; Bruce is fun but he's always going to leave in the 100-150 range as just a side character, and Danielle making 76(!) in this rankdown is really, really high and I can't see her ever replicating that performance again.

I'll do Marq next round
