When I think about White Colonialism, in modern times, I think about how Imperialist Japan was nuked twice, into an unconditional surrender, where they had to swear to my USA, in total defeat, futility, and humiliation, as warrior society, unto a "Hello-Kitty Pacification." Despite that, they maintained the second highest producer of GDP following the US and their Golden Age following the Spoils of War from WWII. To this day the US has bases in Japan.

The same applies to South Korea. Following the Korean War, South Korea had built itself up in the past 70 years and gas established itself as among the most prosperous among the Earth.

During Vietnam, South Korea provided the 2nd most amount of troops following the US, to express their gratefulness for the freedom provided during the Korean Civil War. The Koreans had a 20:1 kill/death ratio against the VC. There are numerous US bases in SoKo to this day, and to this day they are prosperous.

Your theory of colonialism is very disingenuous and ignorant of humanity's broader history.
