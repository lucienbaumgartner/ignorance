I think you should take the creators word- it’s a joke and a Ponzi scheme. Crypto is kind of a popularity contest- and like most popularity contests, it’s the loud, obnoxious and ignorant that rises to the top. Can’t help but also feel like there’s some media driven narrative to pump doge. It is odd that Robinhood started selling “doge” (you don’t even get real doge from Robinhood btw) but even coinbase, exodus, and most crypto exchanges either delisted it or didn’t ever have it because it is a useless money pool. Not hiding the fact that I’m salty I didn’t buy into this Ponzi scheme low when I was thinking about it. 

But people thinking it’s some peoples crypto revolution to invest join a  blatant Ponzi scheme that is basically run by Robinhood is just ignorant.
