Foreign affairs effect everything and we don't talk about it enough.  Geopolitical policies enabled by FDR and Truman in and around WW2 paved the way for the economic prosperity and hegemonic position we enjoyed thereafter.  Domestic policy is important but doesn't exist in a vacumn.  They are interconnected and inseparable.

It is a problem that so few citizens are knowledgeable or even aware of 50% of equation.  As Americans we are too often insular and ignorant of the rest of the world.
