People want a sense of comfort and the will respond like, "I dont want to talk about politics" and its something that needs to be talked about not in a sense of oh which president is better but in that the world has so many social, politcal and economic issues that no one wants to talk about because its not comfortable and they just want to live their lifes in piece, unaware and unaffected by these problems. Which is a even bigger problem itself because if no one addresses it, thebln no one will fix it. And people will do anything to keep this lifestyle, hence why they get so defensive. Also this is just my educated guess so dont quote me.
