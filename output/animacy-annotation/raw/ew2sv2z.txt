&gt; No one is being attacked here

They literally said that anyone not on their side is "privileged and ignorant."  That is an attack, whether you want it to be or not.

They also said it isn't up for argument.  I'm not even allowed to argue, lol.

&gt;Criticism is not demonization. If you want to have anything remotely resembling a productive, difficult conversation, rid yourself of this infantile avoidance tactic.

Criticism is fine.  Intentionally misinterpreting and disregarding the other side's points so you can label them as "anti-women" instead of "pro-life" is not.  I'm sure you'd agree, since you seem to admonish other people for these perceived tactics.

If you want to have anything remotely resembling a productive, difficult conversation, rid yourself of this tactic of demonizing the other side by mislabeling them and claiming they are all "privileged and ignorant."
