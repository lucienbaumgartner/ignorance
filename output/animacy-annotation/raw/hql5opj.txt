I can almost promise I wouldn't be able to resist making snarky comments **every** time I heard that nonsense. It's a big reason I deleted my facebook years ago. Couldn't just sit there and listen to aunts and uncles spout ridiculous nonsense constantly and just getting back-patted for being ignorant and short-sighted.
