&gt;claiming that “our language” shouldn’t follow any “american trends” in choosing whatever words we use

I don't think this is what I claimed. I claimed it shouldn't follow *all* American trends, retaining the freedom to reject those ideas that do not suit us.

&gt;Once again, I am almost completely oblivious and ignorant of the estonian language and its specific nuances.

Well I was referring to the fact that Estonian has no gendered pronouns (*tema/ta*), just like Finnish (*hän*).

&gt;For me it is clear that our world seems to think we are racially divided, although there’s no biological/rational basis for racism.

Okay, but how do you get from this to accepting different standards of rules based on races? I don't see how this could lead to anything good. 

Firstly, it forces one to pick a racial identity and this, in turn, puts pressure to start making rules about what defines someone's race (can't have those of A pretend they're part of B, right). This alone sounds really creepy to me. 

But secondly, it also forces an additional layer of identity politics which takes the focus away from all other problems. We've all seen how stupid it can already become without race, like in Balkans, people who speak the same Serbo-Croatian language and have similar culture can hate each other so much because of religious identity. Why would anybody want to do that again, but based on skin tone?

The world is not perfect, of course. There's more racism than we would like to see. But this "white people can't decide what is offensive to black people" is *not* the solution. Because then, can white people decide what is offensive to them and therefore, which black people can't use? And from here, we usually enter the woke-logic where there is actually no logic at all. It's a slippery slope we don't want to go on, and instead, enforcing the idea of **equality** is what has worked and will continue to work.
