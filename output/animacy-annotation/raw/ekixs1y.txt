Thank you for taking care of our parents and grandparents.  The people like you who caref for mine were very caring, and it is a tough job.

I met one lady at the nursing home who was happy as a clam living in the past, skipping along between her early days as an army wife, later with her kids and when her daughter was getting married.  Another lady always had a feeling that she was supposed to be somewhere or do something but it nagged at her that she couldnt recall what IT was.  I would prefer to be the first woman who was unaware and happy.
