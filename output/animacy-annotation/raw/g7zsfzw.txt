"we all read from the same book" - yeah no.  There's no way you have a wide jewish experience and don't realize that davening, attending shul/synagogue/temple (not even CALLED the same thing), text and interpretation thereof, education of children, and practice, are WILDLY different among the different sects of Judaism.  Reform and Conservative prayer is extremely different than Orthodox, including the texts used; they flat out eliminate some of the more 'problematic' parts from Orthodox davening, and of course there are no mechitzas and women are counted in a minyan and can even be rabbis.  I could go on for freaking days about the differences between Orthodoxy and the other major sects, and even with Orthodoxy, there is a huge amount of variation depending on what \*type\* of Orthodox jew you are and what your heritage is.  Congrats on saying something so insanely inaccurate and ignorant that you have made me ragey.  quit your bullshit, dude.
