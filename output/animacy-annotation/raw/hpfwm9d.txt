Im not sure if you mean about thinhs youre pressured to care aboit, be laid back, or how do people do it. 

When i was 13 i tried to take my life. I woke up in the hospital like dammit i failed. Didnt mean i didnt care. I just cared too much. After therepy i went into high school to not care about what people thought of me. WAYYYYY to much emergy spent there. Slowly you retrain your brain to a chris pratt personality, somewhat.

I just knew after that if i cared i would go down super fast and attempt it again. Its hard bit being ignorant and naive saved me
