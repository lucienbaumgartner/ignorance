I’ve been going to the same bank for years, every teller inside and in the drive-thru knows me by name, but guess what, every time I want to make a withdrawal I still have to provide my driver’s license, shock, which I hand over before they even ask for it because it’s their policy and idgaf. My Gma had the same account at Wells Fargo for decades, same situation. 

I’ll never understand how people are so dumb and ignorant that rules and policies are there for their protection, then throw a fit when a company won’t break the rules and policies.
