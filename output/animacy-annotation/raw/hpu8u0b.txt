I’m seeing a lot of rly ignorant and sad comments about how homeless people don’t want to be helped etc. I work in a psych ward and we’ve had homeless patients who come in and are at first so aggressive and inappropriate and I’m scared to even be near them. But after a few weeks with clothes and shelter and medication, they come to activities and are all aroind more pleasant people. 
Once they leave, it is extremely hard to stay healthy. Most people they know are in the same situation as them or because of their addiction have lost all their friends or families.
It is rly hard situation  as I’ve been stuck on subways with many homeless people and have ppl constantly begging me for money and it’s easy to jusr see it as if they can get better they would. 
A lot of programs out there now are just bandaids or revolving doors and not focused on sustained change 

Sorry for this rant- my thoughts on this are so mixed by the day based on my work
