You piss off the HOA, you're going to have a bad time. Been there done that a few times.

Painting different colours won't work unless the ACC person is asleep AND unaware of what's going on. I can almost guarantee you the little gossip circle of board members knows exactly who you are and are waiting for an ACC application to deny and start the fines.

You need to do things that get approved or don't need approval. In my areas this included a huge solar array pointing right at the HOA president's house and he absolutely hated panels. State law said no unreasonable bans on PV even though HOA bans them. Also included letting a side yard go natural (completely full of weeds blowing into their yard). State law said no enforcement of landscaping beauty standards because of severe drought. We hung up clotheslines and draped them with large comforters. HOA banned them, state law allows natural air drying of clothes. We were also on a slight hill above the HOA head nazi, and were able to aim our floodlights right into their bedroom windows while being legally below the angle required to not be a nuisance according to code enforcement. Oh, and of course I upgraded the wiring to the fixtures and put in 800W halogen floods. They were like spotlights and I'm sure you could get a tan standing too close to them. Code enforcement visited multiple times, perfectly legal. Final straw was I submitted an ACC application for a large (100ft+) wind turbine. State law says they can't stop me. I believe that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
