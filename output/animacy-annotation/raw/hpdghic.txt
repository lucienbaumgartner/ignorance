I could write an essay in reply, but it's not worth my time, so I will focus on one of your claims: "the fight by non-white/women/LGBT people for equality is reframed as 'wokeism'/'cancel culture' (i.e. persecution against cisgender/heterosexual white males, and cis/het men generally) -- therefore a 'free speech issue.'" That's false. Wokeism has nothing to do with the fight for equality. It is, in fact, just the opposite. Wokeism is ignorant racist elitists trying to hurt and crush the disadvantaged while giving the powerful even more power. Hence, "defund the police" as long as only poorer, mostly minority communities are being victimized by the predictable increase in murder and mayhem from idiotically demonizing police and coddling criminals, but "refund the police" as soon as the violence infiltrates wealthy, mostly white communities. Wokeism is ignorant and racist elitists claiming that some of the best human qualities--prized and demonstrated by people of all races--are "white supremacist" qualities. Much of the woke dogma is largely indistinguishable from KKK dogma. I call wokeism "white supremacism masquerading as anti-white racism" and I think that is a very accurate description of this sick, anti-American ideology.
