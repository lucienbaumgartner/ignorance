I don’t know if I can really make it in all honesty. I don’t have any financial support and I haven’t been able to work during the pandemic. Maybe I should stick to my idea of learning the language on my own and then visiting sometimes. It’s just I really want to do something with my life that I can actually be interested and fully engaged in. Maybe I am just too naive and unaware of other paths? I do lack a broad range of interests and I am young and have struggled with knowing what I want to do.
