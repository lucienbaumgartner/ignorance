Also, as a PS to the former - rural communities have broadband Internet now, or at least nearby access to it. They don't get to plead ignorance anymore.

They sure as hell know about any courthouse where there's a Ten Commandments monument going up, because that's something they care about. The only reason they have no idea of the vast wealth of date related to abortion policy in the US is because they just don't give a shit enough to look it up. It does not interest them.

Punishing women who seek autonomous control over their reproductive functions through the justice system is what interests them.

They will gladly vote for a version of Giliad from Handmaid's Tale in America if we allow it. They're not innocent, ignorant and helpless. They fully intend real harm, it's why they have been buying up guns like mad for decades now.
