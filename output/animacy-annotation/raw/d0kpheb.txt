Know your lawyers, know your cases.

I work in a PD office in a sizable jurisdiction, and we have a large pool of attorneys and investigators.

Just as each investigator has a different set of skills and experience, each attorney has a different set of desires and expectations. Some attorneys want total control over the investigation - develop a plan, check in along the way, etc, etc. Some want to throw you a copy of the discovery and say "get stuff, let me know." Others fall in the middle. Some lawyers will lean on you for advice - "what did you think of so-and-so, did he come off as credible, flaky, trainspotty, vindictive..?" Others still may tell you to mind your own business when you offer an opinion, because they're assholes. 

Some of us pick and choose our investigator based on what we perceive the investigators' strengths to be and how we expect the investigation to play out, but many attorneys just leave it up to the department lead to assign the case out, and I'm pretty sure the lead just doles them out in a "who's up next" fashion, which can be a problem. Some cases require some real bulldogging, going out after hard to find witnesses and tracking them down no matter what because they are the key to some exculpatory fact, or have impeachment information, etc. However, other cases (especially things like stale domestic assault cases) require a lighter touch - you want to find out who the state's going to be able to bring in, but you don't want to find someone the state *won't* find on their own, thereby alerting that witness to the case when they otherwise would have been blissfully unaware, and unavailable to testify against the client. Notes and recorded interviews *can* be a good thing. For example, if your "victim" in an assault is suddenly recanting hard, a recorded interview sent over to the state in advance of trial can be extraordinary leverage, and even lead to dismissal. One of my favorite investigators for domestic cases has this ability to get people to do a "soft interview" over the phone while setting up an in-person interview, so she pretty well knows going in if she should do a recorded/heavily noted interview, or just talk with the person. 

Find a way to see a trial. Pick something like a simple assault, and watch beginning to end, and then take the attorney out for a drink and pick her/his brain. A case like that should take maybe 2 days to see beginning to end, including verdict. Know what the attorney and client go through in the courtroom, and be there when a defendant and his counsel stand up and hear the verdict. Take notes along he way so you know what you want to ask about over a drink. This will help you contextualize the endgame, so you know how you fit in to the opening and middle game. 

We joke about the "dark side" around our office too, but never buy into that. When the wrath of the State is brought to bear against an individual, that individual turns to us. It's an arranged marriage, they don't get to choose who their appointed attorney is, but that attorney holds the client's life in their hand. Every conviction, no matter how seemingly insignificant, is the taking of a life one day at a time.  That attorney is turning to you, and depending on you to help save a life. Never forget that if the State does their job correctly, there's nothing we can do to prevent conviction. No matter how sure you are a client "did it," it's the State's job to prove it, and to bring it legit - no conviction is worth the erosion of the rights and protections we all depend on. Prosecutors love to introduce themselves at trial as "I'm Lawyer Joe, and I represent the State." A particularly arrogant (but effective) friend of mine likes to respond, "I am Lawyer Jack, and I represent the State one person at a time."

As far as defaults, I'd say when in doubt:

- Ask your attorney.
- Assume nothing.
- Expect emergencies.
- Always question the official narrative.
- No emails or voicemails more substantive than "need to talk (ASAP/by Wed/this week/etc)," so your lawyer can prioritize the call appropriately, but nothing is disclosed. 
- Immediately inform the attorney if it appears the State is interfering with the interview. In every jurisdiction I'm aware of, this is sanctionable action.
- I ask all my investigators to track contact attempts, because it can really save skins late in the game. Names and rules for the last hearing before trial vary by jurisdiction, but I've managed to pull some interesting shit because I've been able to put my investigator on speakerphone who then lists off all the attempts to contact the witness by phone, mail, and in person, which then resulted in the judge looking at the prosecutor and asking "do you really expect this witness to show or did you just put them on the list because they're in the police report? Have you ever spoken to this person? You have until the end of the week to get them in here or we're talking mismanagement sanctions and a dismissal!" It also may save your skin, too.
- No case is worth your reputation.
- You have an absolute obligation to the client. To that end, while you have an obligation to be truthful, you have no obligation to "the Truth." This may seem like a cop-out, but once you start questioning the official narrative, you'll see that frequently the State is no more concerned with "the Truth" or "Justice" than your average revenge fiend.

Above all, enjoy the work. I think public defense is some of the most fun you can have with your pants on.




(FN1) - I had a client accused of assaulting his ex-wife in the courthouse after a child custody hearing. He was arrested, charged, etc, and the turd actually went to trial despite the fact that the entire courthouse is wired for audio and video. His entire time in the courthouse was on tape, and it never showed him closer than 10 feet. Dipshit prosecutor refused to admit he believed the wrong person.
