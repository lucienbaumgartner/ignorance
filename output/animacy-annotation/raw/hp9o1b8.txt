This is on each practice to hire and weed out the bad ones. I've seen practices where the entire midlevel staff were extremely cognizant of their limitations and quick to bring in an MD when things went beyond their capability. These NPs provided great care from everything I saw/heard and handled the vast majority of their visits independently. This great example of how it should work doesn't happen by accident and in my experience it doesn't take much to realize who the good ones are and put in the effort to make a good team.

There are plenty of NPs in my area that do not use their NP and work as RNs or tried to hang their own shingle and shut down soon after because they've been let go for being incompetent and unaware of it.
