I understand what your saying and perhaps my approach was a little harsh. My point is that no one should be coming to reddit for this. Its simple common sense. I understand people have had different lives/upbringing etc but it is simply irresponsible to own a pet without understanding proper care and when the right time to call a vet is. When the answer is simple really, if you have to ask, you should be asking a vet, not strangers on the Internet. 

Not a single point mentioned from either of us takes away from the fact that OPs dog is suffering, and that OP themselves are ignorant and therefore irresponsible for allowing this to get to this stage. 

So in other words, what benefit of the doubt to you see here? From the picture attached and the behaviour described a child could work out that this needs vetinary attention.
