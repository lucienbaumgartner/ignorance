I'm not on a pill. Sorry I didn't not make that clear. I was on a combination pill several years ago (not certain I was young and unaware) that gave me migraines, i had the nexplanon implant and I didn't have migraines, I used the patch which was a combination type and those migraines were the worst of my life. I was totally non-functional on those days. I have a kyleena iud right now that is just progesterone and I have had maybe one or two migraine days in the past year and a half.

If it not being a pill wouldn't work for you, sorry I am unable to help!
