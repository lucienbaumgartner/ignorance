@thepigfish82 your right Trump made I think 75M in donations to Stop The Steal that wasn't even going to the lawsuit or fight because in those donations it says that you need to make a donation of $1000 dollars for it to go to that claim. Trump has now made in total 100M in donations that could help him in next election if he want to run or used that money on candidates he likes, but Trump mostly will never used that money on others. Anyway it's a scam to make money on the naive and ignorant that worship him which I don't really feel bad for because like you said his a grifter like those sealing snake oil as a super medicine in the Wild West.
