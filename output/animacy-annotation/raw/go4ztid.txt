I didn’t need to quote that part because it is clear from the section I did quote, that that was the case. And they still had to add a caveat that in any medical context the person would need to state that they are not a medical doctor. If it wasn’t misleading, why would they need to pass a fairly comprehensive law outlining when and how the title could be used?

And I don’t sound stupid. You are just a left wing cultist that can’t handle that your argument is stupid and ignorant of all reality and that her usage of doctor is misleading and your exclusion of other doctors is hypocritical. 

Every ‘point’ you have brought up has been something you just made up entirely without even attempting to do any research because a 20 second google search would have contradicted it.
