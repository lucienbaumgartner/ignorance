Don’t think just wearing your outfit is called flexing, it’s just doing what the game includes, dressing up. I don’t know why people bitch about it and cry and karma whore on reddit for it. 

I don’t know about everyone else, but to be fair I see a lot of hypocrites on the main RH subreddits. It’s either overused unfunny memes, repetitive posts, some decent posts, or karma whoring hypocrites. 

The term mochi isn’t funny, just shows how picky and ignorant that people have a different style. Sure people offering 100k for a halo is underpaying, but please for god sakes nobody cares or is interested just tell them real values of halos.

Don’t know why people are so salty over people wearing pixels, really shows how people don’t wanna work for their items and cry over the fact people do work for their stuff. It’s the fact 80% of them would complain about people wearing their “rich” items, and then when they own those items they “slyly” try to slip in some flexes here and there. Yum, hypocrites.

Pretty sure I just moved off topic, but the OP’s og post reason and pretty much the majority is why the main subreddits have gone to shit for me.
