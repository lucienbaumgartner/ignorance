This is my brother-in-law in a nutshell. He once got so violently angry at my wife for "being so closed minded and ignorant" that I thought I was going to have to throw down, and I've literally never fought another soul in my life. He was screaming and screeching because my wife just didn't agree with him, and he believed (and continues to believe) its because she refuses to listen to and understand his point of view.

His point of view is not difficult to understand, though. He's a misogynist white supremacist with a purity complex who believes that people who aren't just like him are being handed free rides while his 30-something ass lives at home with mommy (in her overpriced, underserviced rental unit) collecting welfare that he spends entirely on new-age genetic spirituality seminars and $20 "health shakes". 

He's completely incapable of believing that she could both understand what he's saying and also disagree with it. Listening *is* agreement to these people; anything less is apparently a full-out attack on their rights.

They genuinely believe they have the right to not hear disagreement with whatver shit they excrete from their mouthes. Anything less is totalitarianism.
