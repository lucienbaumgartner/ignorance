&gt;By the time of The Return &amp; Jailbreak she is already a whiny smart-ass.

I know, but it seems like they've forgotten about all of her other character traits. Peridot is a little sneaky, self-important but also very intelligent individual. Watching her hang around the barn as a joke character is not compelling. It was compelling to watch her be unaware and ignorant of her surroundings in the beginning, because it was coupled with the fact that she was new to Earth and its workings. Watching her struggle to understand her surroundings was both funny and engaging because it showed character progression. But her character has basically stagnated since Log Date 7152; she just hangs around the barn with Lapis all day. I always thought it would make sense for Peridot to gain even more knowledge of Earth than Steven (lording it over him a little in the process). She could've used her technical know how to become a computer whiz around Beach City, integrating herself even more so with Earth culture. Maybe she could've opened up her own repair shop, who knows. It would've been a nice segway to get the gems to form relationships with the humans also, something I think the show really needs. It feels like they didn't know what to do with her after her redemption arc, so they just lumped her in the barn with Lapis.
