I would honestly have an issue with this both as the friend staying the night and as a parent. I know my experience isn’t really the norm but my phone is how I monitor my blood sugar since I am a type 1 diabetic and unaware of when I am high or low. So you taking my phone would be the same thing as you taking away any other medical device someone may need. As a parent, my child also can monitor my blood sugar for her own anxiety. Even if this is not the case, I pay for her cell phone, not you. My child’s father and I are the only people authorized to take my daughter’s phone away from her. I agree that although you know you or your family won’t hurt the friend, the friend nor her mother have a guarantee of that. The reason I pay for a cell phone for MY child is so she can contact me at any point she feels she needs or wants to. Honestly all you are doing is alienating your kids. If I were the other child’s’ mother your household would be blacklisted from my child ever visiting.

ETA: YTA!!!!
