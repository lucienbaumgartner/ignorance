Sopranos romanticizes it kinda?

Bruh the sopranos is like the most unflattering portrayal of the mob. Instead of Don Vito you get a fat miserable crook in jersey blabbing to a psychiatrist about his feelings all day

In all seriousness though theyâ€™re all portrayed as very stupid, very petty, very ignorant, and generally incompetent

Their incompetence is a great source of the shows humor
