I agree. You know, it's funny, I was a staunch atheist as a young child, but I've become more interested in religion as I've grown older. I understand it much better than I did before.

I hate the false idea commonly touted by smug, loud and proud atheists that anyone with religious beliefs is somehow inferior or uneducated. For me, I have actually become more connected with Catholicism as I've become wiser and more educated (I'm currently in medical school). That's not to say the two are intrinsically linked, this is has just been my own experience. My ancestors were staunch Catholics, so I initially began looking more into Catholicism to better understand them.

Regardless of one's beliefs, it's important to respect other people. In western countries, we are fortunate to have freedom of religion, including lack thereof. Holding certain religious beliefs (or not holding any) doesn't make you superior or inferior to others. It's an ignorant and egotistical way of thinking.
