This actually makes me sad.  She’s so young and we’ve all known that girl that’s been young and unaware and has fallen into a trap by being consumed with their man so they don’t have many girlfriends.  I was one of them!  I hope she starts surrounding herself with strong women.  I think she has a lot of potential and I would feel bad if the James’s ruined her life!
