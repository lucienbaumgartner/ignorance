That's terrible. MIL works with TRANSPLANT PATIENTS! She comes in contact with incredibly vulnerable people every day and has still gone out of her way to expose herself. Bars, restaurants, gyms, vacations, wineries, shopping, even when we were supposed to be in a lockdown. It's heartbreaking how ignorant and inconsiderate people can be.
