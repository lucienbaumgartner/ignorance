Fuck the Triangle’s Neighborhood Council. Just fucking delusional and ignorant of actual problems happening for a neighborhood that has way too much high volume (especially with The Collegiate School reopened), crime from mugging, homelessness, and firearms, and not to mention the AMOUNT OF SHIT DRIVERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD because of CHEROKEE PARKWAY’S CONSTRUCTION that forced all traffic down my street, and caused a parked hit and run of my now-totaled vehicle and three of my neighbors, with no police presence or support whatsoever? And they were talking about installing deterrents for speeding, which is probably public BS talk. 

Fuck the Council. Someone’s probably going to get hit.
