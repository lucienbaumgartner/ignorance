Dogs are so stupid and unaware that it’s on you to adjust your own actions and stay out of its way to prevent injury. Can’t expect such a dumb beast to have any consideration for you or your comfort/safety.

I was constantly getting hurt by my husband’s dog due to its carelessness before I learned that I had to adjust my behavior and watch where it was going in order to avoid injury. The stupid thing is clumsy and big (2/3 my weight), and it was constantly stepping on my feet out of nowhere or shoving past me to get through a door first. I had to start standing in a near-squat if it was anywhere near me to protect my toes, or plant myself in a horse stance if I noticed it coming in my direction, usually when I’m trying to walk into a room and/or approach my husband. It probably looks as stupid as it feels, but I rarely get trampled nowadays. 

Those are only two examples of how I’ve had to learn to protect myself from constant injury, but hopefully they’ll give you some ideas on how to stay safe around a careless mutt.
