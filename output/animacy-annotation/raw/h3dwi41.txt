There are railings at the beginning and ending, but where people end up congregating is random any based on herding behavior. There's no way for organizers to know where.

I saw 2 stages in 2010. On day 2, we picked our spot because it was close to where my then-husband's cousins boarded their horses. We got there early and set up. We were a large group so people saw us set up so they set up near us.

We easily could have gone kilometers in either direction which would change where the organizers would have to put barriers. 

The race was going through small towns. There would be no way to hire enough security to make sure there was no in locations between approved barriers.

On top of that, the Tour has existed since 1903 and it's always been run without barriers. I think a bigger issue to address is how social media has made people so much more selfish and unaware of the inconvenience and in this case, dangerous to other people.
