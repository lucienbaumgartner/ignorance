Black hair issues? I honestly think Any race can have any hairstyle and shouldn’t be trashed talked unless they came with a complete ignorant and RACIST comment!!! Whites can have dreads. African Americans can have blonde and straight hair !! There’s NO DIFFERENCE. Just don’t come for the white boy if you have cheap weave! I wouldn’t of talked any shit if it actually was DECENT TRACKS!!!
