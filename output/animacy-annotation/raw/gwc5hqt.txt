I had a piece of glass impale my forearm and almost went all the way through. Being young and ignorant of how to deal with medical issues I pulled it out myself (which caused a torrent of blood to flow out and almost made me pass out). A small piece of glass was stuck deep in my arm and the doctor that was helping me told me that when foreign material gets stuck inside you your body will encase it in calcium to protect itself from whatever is there. (This was years ago so Iâ€™m not 100% if it calcium that it wraps it in or something else... or if the doctor was just wrong, which I hope not).
