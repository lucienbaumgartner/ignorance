While that could be the case, I don't see anything in their post that would solidify that theory, lol. It's about peanut butter, and they were pretty much saying that all Americans are obsessed with Reese's or something. I haven't seen one of those in forever and I've been American for as long as I can remember, haha. But yes, it's gotten to the point where so many people generalize Americans as racist and ignorant that the people who say those things could be considered even more of that.
