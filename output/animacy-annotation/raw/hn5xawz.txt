You are not a bad person. You are not a gross person. You are pure, you feel bad for the situation and it's not your fault. As someone whose experienced sexual trauma, I can assure you that many people around the world endure situations where they do not know what is going on, are mentally somewhere else or freeze and are unable to take action. Especially as a child. I can understand how this can disturb you but it does not define you. I'm sure you have done many great things in your life and you don't enjoy this memory. People do crazy things everyday and they don't feel bad. You are not like these people but you feel overly bad for it and you don't deserve to suffer so much with it. Sit with this thought when it comes up and tell yourself, it was an event you did not like but it is in the past and each time it comes up allow the feelings to come but also have a second side of your mind that tells yourself you are not a bad person, you were young and unaware and that it isn't going to happen ever again. You are okay. It will be okay. I understand a lot of people are telling you not to seek assurance but I believe you are also looking for support and you may feel alone, you are not alone. However, it is wise to seek out a professional to help you process this so you can move past it for good, maybe even with EMDR therapy (it helped me a lot with sexual trauma) and you will realize you don't have to carry it with you anymore. God bless my friend. ☮️ Peace be with you.
