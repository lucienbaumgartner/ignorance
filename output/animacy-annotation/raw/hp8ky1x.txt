That attitude will result in you not talking to them. I’m both passionate and think outside the box so I was able to tinker into what works. Again dm me, it’s better to try than never having tried at all. Once you start that self fulfilling prophecy train that leads to the edge of the cliff going it doesn’t want to stop, but ultimately it still has a choice before it’s too late for actually doing something instead of allowing others to tell you what your place is. You don’t want to be labeled ignorant and ignorable anymore because you finally learned. It doesn’t make sense anymore to give someone else the say over what’s obviously different now.
