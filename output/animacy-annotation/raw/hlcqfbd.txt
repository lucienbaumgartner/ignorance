Considering the number of folks killed in drunk driving accidents yearly (in US that's about 11k yearly) and that you're on a widespread generally anonymous internet forum - in a rather niche corner of said forum - it's both bold and ignorant of you to assume the individual with whom you're chatting hasn't been directly affected by a drunk driver. 

I know I'm about 5 hours late here, but please, in the future, shut the fuck up before making egregious assumptions about the life and experiences of those you don't know. Additionally, no one is obligated to have experienced related tragedies in order to form an opinion - especially on the completely unrelated topic of grammar - on a descriptor for an event. 

Most importantly, both terms are adequate in expression here, though in this case it was a mistake for him to make the choice he did, which resulted in an accident. He made a mistake. 

"I'm not pedantic" you said as you argued the semantics of grammar.
