Was it the size of the workforce involved in billing or the upfront charges? The chargemaster prices are definitely absurd, and are mainly there as the "first offer" for insurance companies, meant to be negotiated down significantly. It does suck for people who are uninsured and unaware that you can get a very reduced price if you talk to the hospital though.
