Couldn't agree more. They say the discrepancy between specs is closer than it has every been and is within acceptable limits. I'm witnessing as much as a 50%+ gap between the top and bottom on fights like iron jugg that will produce pretty consistent results from week to week when everyone is within a few ilevel. Either Blizzard is completely ignorant and unaware that these gaps exist, or they are aware and either don't give a shit or do it on purpose. Either way its complete bullshit.
