This comment is bad several ways.  First of all, characterizing the OP's comment as "panic about AI" is both incorrect and uncharitably dismissive.  The OP was quite clear they weren't speaking specifically of AI, that being but one possibility, but of humanity's psychology, in *wanting* such a god-like being.

Secondly, I'm a computer programmer, and you're simply wrong in your assertion that the people who are concerned with AI threat are non-technical and ignorant of it.  Overwhelmingly, the people concerned with AI threat – and the public faces of the issue – are all programmers and deeply aware of what AI really is.  The more one knows about computers the more one doesn't trust or like them, and the more one doesn't trust one's fellow humans with them.

Third, the AI threat folks are *not* doomers: they're hopium addicts.  They think it's possible to save the world from AI threat; that's what they're working on.
