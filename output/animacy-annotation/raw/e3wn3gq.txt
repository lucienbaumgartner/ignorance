People don't have to like him but to STILL call him a racist is unaware and idiotic. I'd like to see the internet past of these people and the shitty things they said. We've all done shit because we're going through something. Sure, that's not an excuse but it's not a reason to punish someone forever either.

Great documentary, really brings light to a lot of things and it looks like a lot of people are turning around. I'm scared to watch the triggering part cus hey, it's personally triggering. But maybe it helps. Also Manny and Nikkie blurred out lmao
