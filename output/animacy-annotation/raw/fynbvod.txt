So tired of virtue signaling vegans. See how arrogant and ignorant that sounds? Wanting better for your fellow man does not require being tied to a vegan lifestyle. If we want people to change, shaming them for standing up for what they believe in because they do not following your own moral code has to be the least effective way to do so. Your holier than thou attitude is not just or righteous. It's dangerous and ostracizing. You will change no minds with your attitude.
