The carefree life. Not worrying about bills and generally being happy and unaware of how evil the world can be. 

I just miss waking up on the weekends, meeting my friends and going up to the forest and making dens, swings and just taking in that fresh air. These days that just doesn’t seem to happen, I just feel like I don’t have time.
