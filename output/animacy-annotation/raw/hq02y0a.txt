I pulled into the grocery store parking lot to see a lady doing this right in front of me. I got out of my car picked up the trash and shipped it back in her window and said she dropped something. She got all ignorant and irritated at me for doing that and started a big scene with her grandson in the car.  I just wish I had my video camera going while I did that.
