Your attitude is exactly what these extreme right folks want. Busy being cynical and ignorant of the danger. Even after a literal attempt to stop a US election from occurring where who knows how many officials would have been harmed if the crowd was able to get to them.

If this were reversed and Obama was in Trump's place trying to steal an election I can't even imagine the shit storm we'd be in right now.
