I'm calling troll. Nobody would actually be so unaware and nasty to make friends wait over 4 hours than actually be annoyed that they left. Especially as despite your shit planning they still apparently tried to find an alternative.
If this is real yta and newsflash if you want to do something with a big group you need to book, it's not difficult. Honestly, even if you had a good excuse (which FYI car shopping isn't) you should've invited them back to yours and brought *a lot* of pizza and beer to make up for being such an awful friend.
