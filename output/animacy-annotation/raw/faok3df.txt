I didn't say they are morally obligated.  

I'm saying that those people being upset at globalism is stupid and ignorant.   That is being realistic.  


Especially when those winning countries are continuing to exploit those other countries.

Again.  The simple analogy here is you taking someone's food.  When they complain and take it back. you get offended and state.  Why should you be morally obligated to let him take his food back?

Also.  how is it a "half-ass" plan?  the method hasn't even been discussed.
