&gt; [people are by and large absolutely dreadful, unaware, and overly aggressive drivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkCwFkOZoOY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12)

You've hit the heart of the issue, for me. Well, not actually for me, (I'm all about self-driving cars. But philosophically I think it's interesting.)

When self-driving cars are the norm, the number of accidents will dramatically decrease. However, the distribution will become more-or-less random. With people driving, car accidents aren't like the weather: an attentive and defensive driver will have a lower incidence of car accidents. Of course there are things that are entirely out of the driver's control, but that universe is smaller than most people like to admit.

This is why car insurance premiums are lower for better drivers. 

With self driving cars, though, it's no longer a factor of your personal responsibility towards being a good driver, it's merely a numbers game of what random combination of factors will overwhelm the computer(s) and cause an accident. While a fender bender is no big deal, what about fatal accidents? Is it fair that if you had been behind the wheel, you would've been able to navigate the situation better, or avoided it entirely?

Personally, I think the answer is "yes it is fair." Sure, maybe you would live in that situation. But you also benefited from a lifetime of safer voyages, and maybe one of those times you wouldn't have been able to avoid the accident. You also benefited from a lifetime other people not getting in as many accidents; while you may be a safe driver, what about your husband? What about your 16 year old kid? 

Still, personal responsibility is one of the more bedrock principles we've built our society on. I'm curious to see how people react to self-driving cars once they become a reality.
