I have 45 years of unmedicated and ignorant of  my adhd-pi.   At 45 I have one hour discussion and take one test and the dr flat out told me it’s not a question that I have it.

Meds have been life changing.    

I have age on my side.  I’m not a twenty year old trying to get stimulants.   But regardless.  I know what my life was like prior.   I tell everyone about my meds and about my life prior.   Hope it helps the awareness.
