Then when will our young ones learn that the world is bigger than they think and we are all different in our beliefs and preferences? When will they eventually understand the reason, that some people uphold their religious teachings with reverence?

This type of thinking is what propagates the death of individualism. It's so suppressive. Like a factory model that churns out products of uniformity. Is it no wonder a significant portion of the population is so insensitive and ignorant of one another's religion or ethnicity? Just because something is non conventional we suddenly turn it into a moral issue and how it's inappropriate.

I'm atheist, and I don't care about religion. But pushing this notion of uniformity just doesn't seem right. This is not a privilege, it's a right. Doesn't matter if this country is a secular state, ethnic clothing does not have to mean non professional or trouble seeking.
