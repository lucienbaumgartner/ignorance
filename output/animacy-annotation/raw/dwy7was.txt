Not having a real answer to a question that may admit that you have a fault, such as:
- What’s one of your weaknesses? (Perfectionism or overwork aren’t good answers unless this is really true and you can talk about their downsides)
- Talk about a conflict you’ve had with a colleague and how it was resolved. (Never having a conflict makes it sounds like you’re unaware and clueless)
