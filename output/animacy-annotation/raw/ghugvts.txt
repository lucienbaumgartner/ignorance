Yes it gets boring sometimes and those memories become your best memories, until you get back in the scene and realise how every user is unaware and unhappy , the negatives that come with doing drugs are so much worse than youd think (memory loss, losing your temper, unable to control your emotions, depression are examples) go easy on yourself. And wishing you good luck.
