It seems less likely to me that the drivers who do that are so naive and ignorant that they're unaware of any penalty, and it seems more likely to me that they acknowledge the risk and do it just because either the risk seems negligible, and/or they really need the ride because they're strapped for cash and/or time.

I've got less sympathy for the former--the drivers who bank on the risk being negligible. Because all it takes is one bad accident and you won't be glad you took that risk then.
