&gt;The law isn't always correct.

Wow! Such wisdom! 

&gt;See alcohol and drug prohibition. They're ever changing.

Yeah, it's almost as if people shouldn't be making laws based on religious nonsense and fucking over poor people... 

&gt;Abortion is not globally legal.

Replace "abortion" with pretty much any other action. 

&gt;That's insane if you believe that.

Does anyone believe that? Has anyone ever implied that to you? Seems like I remember someone bringing up strawmanning... 

&gt;Even states have effectively prohibited it, by not allowing it after 6 weeks, a time frame most people don't even know they're pregnant.

I'm starting to wonder if you even know what the conversation is... 

&gt;That's why it's on the will of the people to decide what they should and shouldn't allow in their society.

Great applause line, but that's bullshit!

I was trying to respond to the whole thing, but FUCK! You're just too damn close minded and ignorant that I realize it's a waste of my time. Abortion is legal, federally, and a vast majority of Americans want to keep it that way! Stop trying to tell other humans that they HAVE to support an unwanted clump of cells. Not your fucking body, not your fucking decision!
