Stop assuming boy.. Someone like Hulk Hogan never had to think much about "racial equality" all his life, since he's from a different time. This world was completely different even a decade ago, let alone decades

&gt;

Everything you think is fucked up now, was normal once.. for people of a different era. And vice vera

&gt;

It's hilariously naive and ignorant that so many folks of this era don't even understand the concept of time. Or, they just don't want to. 

Time changes everything, for better and also for worse. Everything that you think is normal NOW,  will be "abnormal" or crazy.. 30 years from now. Not all changes are good, but change is inevitable 


&gt;

Everyone make mistakes, but the main problem are the ones that doesn't learn.. and just fails to adapt with time and all the changes. That's when "things" happen
