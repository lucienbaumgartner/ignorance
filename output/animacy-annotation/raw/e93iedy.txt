I am no expert on any sort of warfare, all I have under my belt is some reading and documents about wars during the history. But it sounds like you are romanticising war. 

Again, I am no expert but guerrilla warfare worked for Vietnam because the US Army went in completely unaware and unprepared for the hell they were going into. Despite the fact the French got their asses handed to them previously. Jungles, rice fields, underground tunnels and these rice farmers you speak of were often part of Viet Cong, semi-military organisation.

I am not American but I am pretty sure if there was an body able to take on the US Military and win, it would make a short process of militia armed with AR-15s.
