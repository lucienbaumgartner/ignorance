The clip of him on Howard Stern showing the photo of her in her dyed black hair and sunglasses.. “doesn’t she look like a drug dealer’s wife!?” He’s so excited and turned on... in the most ignorant and racist way. When I think of Spain a flourishing drug trade doesn’t exactly spring to mind. Alec probably thinks Spain is the capital of Columbia. He’s been acting like an intellect but he’s a proven moron.
