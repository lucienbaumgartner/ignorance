Someone brought up, that the government could have used emergency powers to buy the milk and work on distribution to the public, apparently it has happened during other emergencies. The current US government is just unaware and incompetent so this didn't happen. 

Obviously think milk is cruel and awful, but it is a sign of a crippled government / economy when it's cheaper for the farmers to waste gallons of milk, but to your average consumer they see empty aisles in their grocery store. People who do consume cows milk are really confused by this action and shows the problems with the subsidy system in place. 

I think however the farmer gets to keep the projected income on this milk even though exactly 0% of it went to consumers. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe thats how their subsidy funding / relief works for farmers. focused on supply side, not demand side.
