Another reminder to add to the mix: 

“Second wives” have so much value. 

Consider this: how many people do you know that got married young, naive, blissfully unaware and obliviously optimistic? (Only to fall apart a couple years later the moment the fairytale got real.) They seem so in love, until they come to the conclusion that they only love each other until things get hard. 

But those who have been through a divorce? 

They’re not blissfully ignorant. They KNOW how shitty a marriage can turn out. They know the pain and the expense and that the person you marry can completely change. 

But they chose to risk it all again anyway. 

Because of WHO YOU ARE TO THEM. 

Your SO isn’t jaded. He’s with you despite being burned once before, because he needed a life with you in it. 

There is so much value in that - remember it next time you feel a pang of jealousy toward his ex.
