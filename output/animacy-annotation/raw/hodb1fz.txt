TBF you'd have to analyze someone's replay down to pixel measurements to be able to determine if one of those was used in the first place. Imagine finding someone that's got such bot game sense, so ridiculously unaware and completely bad at the game that their pitch perfect recoil control makes you suspicious, haha
