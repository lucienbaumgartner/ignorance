Wow..do people really still believe the baseless bullshit the mainstream media is spewing? Doesn't anyone do their own research anymore? This sub is either heavily shilled or many people suffer from party bias and ignore facts. 

Fact: Mueller delivered uranium to Russia on a deal brokered by Hillary Clinton. 

Fact: The Russian narrative was completely fabricated. 

Fact: Seth Rich was the DNC leaker and everything that was leaked was verified. You know...actual crimes like perjury committed by Hillary Clinton when the emails revealed she destroyed evidence after being subpoenaed. 

To anyone listening do your research people. DO NOT trust mainstream media. As also stated in the wikileaks emails in one of Hillary's speech transcripts to Wall Street, and I quote "We want an unaware and compliant American public"
