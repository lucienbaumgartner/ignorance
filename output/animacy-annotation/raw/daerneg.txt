I'm a Trump supporter and also a female minority (Hispanic/Asian) w/ Muslim and gay family members, attended an Ivy League on scholarship, and am now in medical school. Are you gonna label me a dumb white supremacist, homophobic racist? I didn't start as a Trump supporter until well into the general election, but the fact is that many Trump voters and supporters are more well-informed about his positions bc they had to bypass DNC/Clinton campaign/MSM talking points instead of falling on a Clinton default choice based on superficial reasoning and identity politics. Even now, there are many I know who voted for Clinton and regret their vote, wishing they had voted Trump or 3rd party and are glad that Trump won. I don't expect Hillary's herd to be well-informed on the issues because, as her campaign manager John Podesta has said, she likes her followers "unaware and compliant."
