Right. And I think in general it's best to go by what we see, as opposed to theories.

After that, we're completely in agreement until we get here:

&gt;The only reason Trump wasnâ€™t as bad is because he is too foolish and narcissistic. 

Trump is absolutely foolish and narcissistic, but I've already explained why he's worse.

Now there can be a lot to sort out with the incredible amounts of destruction both presidents caused.

But if we're talking just about a damage to the US, even the number of US troops who were killed and wounded in GWB's unnecessary invasion and occupation of Iraq is still a *fraction* of the number of *innocent US civilians* killed by Trump's willfully ignorant and malicious covid-19 "management".

Literally several hundred thousand more innocent Americans would be alive today if Trump had just backed off, let scientists actually run things, and not be a complete piece of shit. And for much of that run, a 9/11 of dead civilians *per day*.
