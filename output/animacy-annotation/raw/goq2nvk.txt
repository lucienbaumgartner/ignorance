There's a few things that went into it.

1. Most of his early insufferability was an act he was trying to put on and failing at. There was always a core of genuine decent person in there, it was just buried under insecurity, and even as early as V1 he's *gradually* learning to shed it. Gradually.

2. While he started off privileged and unaware of the dangers of the world around him, he's been at the emotional center of a bunch of terrible shit happening and it's genuinely affected him.

3. He's had the character development of going through all that pain and coming out the other side of it empathetic and supportive.

There's still a fair bit of bad/annoying choices made in the details about how all that happened, but the end result of the character development so far is unsurprisingly enjoyable, at least.
