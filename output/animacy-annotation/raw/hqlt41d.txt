Beef and fish have always been a superior source of protein. And you should study biology because you have no idea what you’re talking about, ignorant and unwilling to learn.

There are better protein sources than others. Usually the rule is that the bigger the animal the better. There’s more vitamins found in the fat deposits of the flesh/protein in beef than chicken/birds.

Beef is objectively better than chicken, anyone who’s argues otherwise is frankly an idiot. Chicken is trash. Old chicken, modern chicken, doesn’t matter. 

Just go read the vitamin profile of both animals and compare the two for yourself… at the very least…. TRY to educate yourself. My god.
