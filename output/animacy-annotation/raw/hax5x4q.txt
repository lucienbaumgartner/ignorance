So you have a bias in favor of landlords as you were one yourself. And you say the government has less experience than those who make there living in housing and real estate.

Here is my problem with that though. The people currently in charge of housing and real estate (most of whom are private individuals or businesses, not associated with any government) are incentivized to extract the maximum possible wealth from their renters. There are plenty of people with experience in housing and urban development who could take on this burden through a government entity, get paid a fair wage, and not exploit their renters. We should be putting our tax dollars to work for us, to help better our lives. We have the money to do so, it's just that it is currently being spent to support large corporations and our bloated military budget. We're still practicing the lie of Trickle Down Economics, despite knowing it's a failure.

You can say I'm inexperienced, and ignorant of the details, and fine, I'll except that. But I refuse to accept that we have to encourage exploitation of people through any means, including extortionate rent prices. There has to be a better way that works for all people, because whatever we're doing now doesn't.
