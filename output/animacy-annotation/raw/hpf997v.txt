&gt; This is a level of misunderstanding I would encounter with an NT

OK, start your response with an ad hominem attack.

&gt; I have no patience for politics.

Cool. It's nice that you're evidently comfortable enough that you don't have to worry about people politicising others' existence. 

&gt; I have no issue with people wanting to be who they want to be

And yet you go on to display how much of an issue you have with people being who they want to be. It doesn't matter what your personal opinion is. Let. People. Live. No amount of paedophiles trying to legitimise themselves or straight up bad actors pretending they're paedophiles means you can tell people with niche identities they have to stop expressing themselves because you find it hard to deal with.

Gay people would not have won the rights they have (and still struggle to maintain) were it not for identity politics. When you make wilfully ignorant and meaningless statements like "iT'S A seXuaL orIENTATIOn" you're telling queer people to get back in their box and never make a sound.
