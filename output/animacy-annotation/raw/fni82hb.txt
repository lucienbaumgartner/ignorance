I'll tell you the truth I see if you'll tell me the truth you see. What I see is some one telling the poor and ignorant that they are special and some foreign power that is at once inferior and scarry is trying to take what's theirs and is the cause of their problems.The Same thing that works for Trump has worked for Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Pol Pot and Andrew Jackson just to name a few.
