I never said that actors can never get injured. But for wrestlers it's literally every time they have a match, at any point something could happen to end their career.

And yes, absolutely you're right with the second point. It's more like being a ballet dancer and getting into the absolute top tier ballet company in the world, then being good enough to get the starring role in Swan Lake. And if hundreds of millions watched that ballet company.

You don't like wrestling, that's clear enough, but you're being disrespectful and ignorant of the work she's put in to achieve something that very few people ever do. You're getting hung up on it being called a championship - who gives a shit what it's called? It might not be "real" sport, but it takes a toll on the body just like sport does, and requires just as much training as other sports.
