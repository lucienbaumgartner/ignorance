Oh fuck ryan with a massive splinter filled dildo.  But the problem is the hypothetical situation was deemed acceptable at launch. the actual events were such a small part of the over all episode.  They were not jokes made by ryan himself. They were jokes made by Gavin.    


AH and the vast majority of the community hold AH as innocent and unaware of ryan's behavior. If it was removed because of the ryan issue as is hypothesized here then it is just overt paranoia on AH's case.

Maybe it is my own personal view point that if you do something you stick by it. They are all adults and have been working in the entertainment industry for a while at this point. If they thought it was a smart idea to post the room of truths or even make it in the first place. They also had plenty of chance between recording and it being released for them to think about their actions and simply ask the editor to remove that part of the video.  Then they left it up for a year and change.

All deleting stuff that is known does is say "yes I know I'm a massive piece of shit but I'm going to hide it so you don't get angry at me" rather then the actual respectable set up of "I know I was an ass hole in the past and I realize I was wrong and I'm going to own up to what I was but I am changing myself because that behavior was wrong."

&amp;#x200B;

The actual secondary issue that this has shown that actually now bothers me more is how quickly some people in the community have reverted so quickly back to  the general stance of "AH are infallible and you are never allowed to question or challenge anything they do because they are perfect"  that has started to sprout up again.  When that is the same kind of cult like behavior that allowed ryan to get away with shit.

And just to deal with the hyper sensitive take everything in the worse case possible people. I'm not talking about calling them fucking idiots or declaring every single thing they do will destroy RT or is proof of their incompetence.  I'm talking about the healthy degree of skepticism when they do something because you realize they are not infallible and since they rarely if ever give the specific reasons all you have are hypotheticals to reason against.  Similar to when your boss might give you a task to do and only give you 45 minutes to complete it when you are sure it will take an hour to do.

It scares me because it is the behavior of "AH can not be questioned ever" is the exact same mentality that had any one of those women came forward solo without the massive picture leak from 4 chan, it absolutely is the mentality that would have shouted and death threatened (from the really fucked up fans) those people into withdrawing their information that would have let ryan continue to operate and continue to act as a scavenger shit head he is.
