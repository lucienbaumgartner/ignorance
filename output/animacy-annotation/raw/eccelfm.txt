You try so hard to convince yourself that I'm somehow insecure, yet your basis for this abortion of discernment is that I'm completely convinced that believers are wrong and often,  like you,  idiots that can't even conceive of how little you actually know about anything,  let alone supposed creators of the universe.

Do you even know what insecurity is?    I hold you I  contempt for being a blithering moron.  There's nothing insecure about it.

I hold believers in contempt when they area so arrogant and ignorant that they don't even knits how laughable it is to claim knowledge of creators of  everything when you dead bulbs rarely even know what the fuck dirt actually is, or how your own fingers actually work. 

You're ignorant as fuck,  but expect people like me to believe your claims about gods over our own knowledge and understanding. 

Your claims are trash and the totality of your ignorance renders every opinion you'll ever have about god utterly indiscernible from the opinions of a dog on the subject of organic chemistry. 

The dog has the excuse of being literally incapable of learning chemistry or physics,  however. 

What's your excuse for being so damn stupid? 

Provide your evidence or go play with your fellow idiots.    You shouldn't have difficulty finding the company of other mental midgets like yourself.
