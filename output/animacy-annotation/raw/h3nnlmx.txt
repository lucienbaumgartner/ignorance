Of all your preflop options, minraise feels like the worst. I wanna say that ideally your best option is jam - since the other 3 stacks are very short including a 5.5 and 6.5bb stack. When you jam there, SB is supposed to call off incredibly tight. IF villain is extremely loose and unaware of ICM even in this FT dynamic then I'd say don't jam. If you're not jamming, then your next best option would raising 3-3.5x. Limping isn't good when there's ICM pressure. But I also won't pretend to know exactly how we're supposed to play preflop overall. There are a lot of factors involved. I said the raising 3-3.5x is probably the next best option, but do we want to put that much of our stack in play when we only have 15bb and 2-3 guys are so shor? I'm not sure. But we definitely have some hands that absolutely don't wanna fold pre. KJo is probably just a little too strong for us to outright fold. Jam is always option #1. If player type dictates KJo not being a jam then 3-3.5x raise is #2. 

Also, once you do minraise, the 1/2p OTF is kinda whatever. But AFTER that, the turn you HAVE to check. It's not good card at all.
