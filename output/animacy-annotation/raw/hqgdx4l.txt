So true. They treat the horses like shit in this city. They endure brutal temperatures, faint, have wounds and get harassed by drunk tourists and bad drivers. They deserve better.
People who endorse these carriage rides are ignorant and cruel.
Get your ass on a bike and enjoy the city that way. Or better yet, walk.
Savannah also has Pedicabs and plenty of other tourist-y options that donâ€™t condone animal cruelty.
