Marijuana legislation is pretty inextricably connected to race.  It's clearest in the US, when it only became illegal (or even well known) when it was linked to Mexican immigrants and it supposedly making Black people violent and unaware of their place (and leads to Jazz music: the horror).

The US also, unsurprisingly, worked very hard to export its ideals, individually pressuring countries like Lebanon and more prominently influencing the League of Nations ban (after a failed first attempt a decade earlier).

But if you look at when marijuana was made illegal, you'll notice it was criminalized in places like British colonies (and other white-controlled, non-European countries) first, and was only criminalized in Britain itself after the League of Nations ban.  

So, it's most a race-thing in the US, but it was already a bit of a race thing in Europe and then the US put a big exclamation point on that globally.
