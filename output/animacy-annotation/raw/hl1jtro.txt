Which OP's lawyer will no doubt have to argue. The court will have to decide whether the children of an affair who believed and *were* believed by the deceased to be his biological children should be denied any part of their, (granted non-biological,) father's estate by the virtue of their mother's unfaithfulness and a stipulation in the document of a man who is both dead and unaware of the truth of his childrens' parentage.  


I worked in the courts in civil litigation. Estate fights are just the worst, the messiest, some of the most bonkers cases you see. If OP believes that the "biological children" caveat in the father's will means a clean unambiguous determination that they receive the entire estate and the half siblings get nothing she will be very much  surprised.
