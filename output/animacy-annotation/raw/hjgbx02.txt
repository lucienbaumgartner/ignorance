Medical freedom of choice?

What an absurdly silly thing to say.

Free to what? Play chicken with nature? Deny science, deny reality? Risk the lives of others to earn a rung on some strange pecking order?

If these irresponsible fools would only risk themselves, that would be one thing. But no; they would much rather assault and harass minimum wage workers by screaming "MUH FREEDUMBS".

This isn't about freedom of choice, it never has been. It's always been about a slice of society that are nothing more than petulant, contrarian children. Man-babies, inspired by the orange turd of a man-baby who was so stupid and ignorant that he had to be yelled at to how stare at a fucking eclipse.

That's it.
