She's in the wrong but police lives matter is pretty much racist, black lives matter was made as a response to unjust murders by police officers. The response "police lives matter" is done specifically to disrespect what BLM is all about and undermine black people specifically because their black. 

Really shes ignorant and unaware of a lot like all people are and is taking out her frustration in all the wrong ways.
