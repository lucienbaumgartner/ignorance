JoJo did not come of as mean girl whatsoever. Were we watching the same show? She comes off as super over the top and annoying, socially unaware and bratty when she first appeared. It was obvious she was home schooled and JoJo needed some time around other kids. She was always once of the nicest girls on the show. I do appreciate how JoJo is always herself, I think people should always try to be themselves.   
Totally agree about the headache.
