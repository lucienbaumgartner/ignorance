I was appalled by how sanctimonious and ignorant that post was. Like I appreciate the passion for cats and their wellbeing, I understand that people get emotional about animal welfare, but that post so callously tore apart a girl who just tragically lost her cat. In my neighbourhood, everyone’s cat roams freely outside. My cat is the only one around who is never allowed out unsupervised, and my neighbours act like I’m the freak whose being excessively paranoid, like I’m a helicopter parent. I had one neighbour imply that he thought it was cruel how my cat was only allowed out on a leash, and he is a huge cat fanatic who takes his cat with him everywhere. It truly emphasizes how Reddit’s perspective on outdoor cats is still far from the norm, and it’s borderline clueless as to how the real world works.
