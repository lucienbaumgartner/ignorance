So there was this super fun thing when the English invaded Wales where they decided that the Welsh language was "stupid and ignorant" and that speaking it made Welsh people unintelligible and unintelligent.
Wales and Welsh were Anglo-Saxon words for Foreigners/outsiders. There was a system implemented in schools called the Welsh Knot. This system existed all the way up until 1860 or so, the way it worked was if you were caught speaking Welsh you'd wear a knot around your neck proclaiming it. The only way to get it removed was to snitch on a friend speaking Welsh. The child wearing the Welsh Knot at the end of the day would be whipped. The hope was to eradicate the Welsh language.
That's why today you'd struggle to find a Welsh person who can't speak English.
