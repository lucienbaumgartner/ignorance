Hey man pictures this;
So I've just finished smoking my badly rolled cheap ass zoot (I wish one day to have the luxury of buying and trying everything u/smokersdelightuk has to offer, but that's another story, lets not get side-tracked here guys, focus!) I open up reddit and am greeted by the title of your thread, but remember I'm a little high and alot of sleepy so I am reading 'SHOUT AT CC'   
I click on thread but I've got 'Script' disabled meaning I cant read the content, but if you remember I'm high, sleepy and unaware that I have script disabled so I spend a good few minutes scratching my head thinking what the fuck did I do this time to deserve a shouting at! so thanks for that buddy had a good laugh at myself when I realised that I was just being an idiot and reading it wrong.
