No there isnâ€™t, what the organization has done on a whole scale (crusades, inquisitions, witch hunts) were the results of men making decisions and preying on the weak and ignorant. That has nothing to do with what the actual teachings are telling you to do. You can not fault someone for believing in Catholicism or any other religions for that matter because that is their faith structure and it is not wrong, people might make bad decisions but that is not what the religion is telling you to do.
