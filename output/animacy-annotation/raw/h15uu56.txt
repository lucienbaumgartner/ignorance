Sorry, I accept what you’re saying. I used quotation marks because I wasn’t sure if “ability” was the correct word. ESP is real, though, no doubt. 

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts. 

There have times in my life that I’ve wondered if I have some sort of ESP ability. Like a forward sense of dejavu. idk, it’s hard to explain. For example in mid Jan 2020, when covid was still only in Wuhan, before there were any (reported) domestic cases in the US... I was intently following the news coming from Wuhan, and warning my friends and family of the coming upheaval. I specifically remember being at costco, and watching herds of people shopping, all unmasked and unaware of the unfolding crisis ... and I felt this sinking sense of doom, standing there in costco, the thought of mass-panic as the virus spreads, empty store shelves, etc. At the time, it was impossible to convince friends/family that there was any truth to my “gut feeling”, and frankly I was questioning my own sanity, I think. But the “vindication” that followed, a few weeks later, was definitely eery. And there have been other experiences like this... Maybe an ayahuasca trip will help me gain more  inward understanding.
