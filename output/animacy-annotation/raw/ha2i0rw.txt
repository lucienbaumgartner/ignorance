Additionally, this argument of marrying to old men is just frankly tired and old. Forced child marriage is wrong and banned by all accounts in Islam. Forced marriage, period. Back then and up until relatively recently, the whole world’s societal expectations were much different. And people of all cultures, religions and social standings got married much earlier, with a lot of girls/women getting married much younger, right out of puberty. Because biological, once you get your period, you are able to get pregnant. The traditional man goes to work, woman stays home and takes care of the kids and house was more what the household looked like. Now that many women/girls are going to school and working, the application has changed and people get married later. I don’t know anyone that gets married that young unless their socioeconomic circumstances are much different and similar to that of older days past. Regardless, consent is huge. Unfortunately there are evil people out there who do otherwise. Women are also encouraged to learn and go to school and they can work and are entitled to keep all their money. 
This is all besides the point of the main thread but I needed to write this out. You don’t need to be rude and ignorant of facts.
