At some point this breaks down, either you will end up debating with some Muslim or someone from another sect of Christianity who interprets the inerrant word of god in a different way who just denies any truth or citation you will make, at that point you will have to decide your personal values of subjective and objective truths and their worths, not everything can be ‘regarded as fiction’ by any old imaginary friend haver and instantly be fiction in reality because they said so.

Eg: I once argued with a Christian who was so deluded and ignorant of reality that they made the absurd claim of: ‘babies cannot drown, because god wouldn’t let them’, how do you combat this?
 
Eg2: Try and argue with a creationist that hasn’t opened Origin, if you aren’t one, I’m sure they’ll tell you that Charles Darwin was bla bla insert disingenuous nonsensical claim about him being religious and disavowing atheism on his deathbed and include non-sequitur about Einstein’s non existent devotion to religion. How can you combat this foolishness? You either let them believe the BS they want, which is accepting that an objective reality does exist and not every claim made or book written should be considered valid as evidence. Claims are not a path to truth in the same way faith is not a path to truth. Demonstration, reproductivity and/or observation is required, in everything but religion.
