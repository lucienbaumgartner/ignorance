For a level of ignorance check here. I was on the coaching staff for the USAPL IPF raw bench press world team in South Africa I'm a C.S.C.S. and a C.P.T. I have coached ATWR holders. I've gotten 2 WOMEN over 315 raw on bench more than 15 men over 405 most of whom started below 300. And deadlift is what I'm best at programming. There are always going to be dudes like this who think they know best or want to knock you down a peg but there's a difference between hateful and ignorant and just ignorant. The young lady earlier was a teachable moment for sure and you never want to kick someone just for not knowing. This dude is just a guy on gas who has probably never been very impressive at anything so be pretends to know a lot and tears people down. I'm sure people like you would make fun of me and I'm sure some of those people call themselves coaches. I am also sure I'm a better coach and lifter than the overwhelming majority of them.
