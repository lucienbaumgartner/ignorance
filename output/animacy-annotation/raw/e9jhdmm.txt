I feel like the ignorance goes multiple ways though. I read the Simon Wiesenthal Center renouncement and there was no mention of the other people killed by the bomb besides the Japanese. Additionally, there was no mention of how it contributed to liberation, nor was there any mention of Japanese war crimes, comfort women, etc. There's just an overall lack of historical and situational context. Treating it like a black and white issue when there are multiple perspectives, and as many have said, a few of these perspectives are not mutually exclusive. And tbh, Japanese colonization and war crimes isn't exactly known to as many people as others would like to believe, at least in America. I'm sure many schools learn about it in the US, but there are many who grow up without any idea of what the Japanese Colonial Era consisted of. I didn't know about comfort women until college. Again I'm not saying it isn't taught, but it's not as widely taught as others would like to believe. 

At the very least, I hope this situation brings awareness and education to the suffering on *all sides* to regions who are often left unaware and ignorant.
