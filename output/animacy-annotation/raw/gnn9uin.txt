If the law only applied to magazines that were already 10 rounds from the get go then why would it even exist? 

I mean, I know laws are mostly fucking idiotic but come the fuck on, dude. Also taking a handgun on a country wide tour is usually a bad idea for someone this badly informed and unaware of resources right out of the gate.
