This kind of thing seems to cycle over time. 

A few years ago, there was explicit instruction precisely to share your experience and feelings for the express purpose of normalizing the other person’s experience and making them feel not so alone. Not sharing was seen as cold, aloof, uncaring, and even a display of power over the other person. 

For those of us who have been around long enough when that was considered and enforced as the correct thing to do, this suddenly new, moralizing condemnation of it and reprimand to do the opposite is confusing, frustrating….and to honest, makes us view the new moralizers as shortsighted and ignorant of the past. 

In another few years, there will be a new batch of people (or the same people) condemning the now-new ‘proper’ way and enforcing a wholly different kind of response. For those us who do not intuitively pick up on our unspoken neurotypical-centric social rules and protocols (especially those dependent upon non-verbal cues), this constant changing of the goal posts just when you’ve finally been able to get practiced at the ‘new’ protocol feels like a never-ending game of double binds.
