Stage 4 Burketts Lymphoma when I was 31. Absolutely wrecked my life. Student loans, unable to work, etc. Disabled. Receive 1k a month SS. If that gets taken away or even lowered I'm gonna be in trouble. Being in a hopeless situation is bad enough. But the added fear is real torture. I'm not even angry at the GOP anymore. We all know what they are. However, it hurts me that so many fellow Americans are so bitter, mean spirited and ignorant that they do not see or care. I did nothing wrong yet here I am fretting about wealthy people coming after my thousand dollar check and shitty healthcare. I'm really disappointed in Americans and human beings in general. Remember to vote, I guess.
