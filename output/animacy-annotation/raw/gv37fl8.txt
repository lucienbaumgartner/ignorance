This is funding by someone’s equity. If you don’t like the terms, why the fuck do you agree to it? That’s right because you still want that sweet sweet exit payout and a shiny checkmark on your resume that you have built something. You even said it yourself in the second paragraph. The fucking hypocrisy lol

Are you seriously expecting some rich fucks to give you free reign on their money unconditionally?????? Have we reached the era where people are so fucking entitled and ignorant that they go ask someone for money and expect them to be a pushover???
