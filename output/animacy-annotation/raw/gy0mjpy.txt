The moderators here, IMO, do not do a good job.

But I've voiced this several times, and I like them personally, plus they aren't *terrible*, so I'm not really sure what else I can do except offer apologies and say "I wish it were better too."

Maybe I'm wrong and the mods know some 4d Chess Strategy to moderation that I'm just too dumb and ignorant of to catch wise to but ... it sure as hell looks to me like the purposefully let trolls run wild in the sub for ... reasons?

You're not alone in feeling like this is an ongoing mistake.
