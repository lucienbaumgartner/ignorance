The things the neckbeards are missing that the prisoners have are charm, mystique, and a complete lack of empathy. Yeah, neckbeards and "nice guys" often act in selfish and insensitive ways, and I'm sure there are legit psychopaths mixed into that lot, but a good chunk of them are just immature and unaware, and may grow out of that phase in time.

That is, they likely haven't dedicated a lifetime to figuring out how to manipulate people for their own gains, the way that the charmers in prison probably have. The charmers have stories of manipulating others that began long before puberty. Neckbeards usually were regular kids, with their issues manifesting during and after puberty.

These women aren't attracted to these guys for no reason. They're often pulled in by the guy's charisma and the tragic story of a poor, lost soul they could help... then they end up being taken advantage of, as these men know exactly how to get what they want from them.
