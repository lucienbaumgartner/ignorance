I think the Fool puts it quite well in Tawny Man when Fitz asks the same question: humanity needs a mirror. They need a different species that's a arrogant as themselves. Consider the fact that humans are basically animals but how many people keep that in mind, how many humans respect animals and nature in general as equal to them? Quite often, we consider other species and even other people as 'lesser', as unequal to ourselves.
So, Robin Hobb gives us dragons: unbearable arrogant, selfish and ignorant of human needs. 
What else are are dragons than a way to show us our own arrogance and the need to consider ourselves not as above but equal to others.

At least, that's how I interpreted it. Of course, all experiences and opinions are subjective and I don't what to put my interpretation as 'the one' or 'best'. It's one of surely many and equal to any and all of them.
