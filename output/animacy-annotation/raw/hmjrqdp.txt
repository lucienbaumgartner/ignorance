I suggest taking a class. Rhyme and meter are not the only tool in a poet's arsenal. They are merely that, two tools. Like a line break is a tool, assonance is a tool, anaphora is a tool etc. Prose poetry is an art and is certainly poetry. Erasure poetry is also certainly poetry though the source text is usually prose. To narrow the definition of "poetry" down to two tools of very reductive. And super outdated. Free verse has been the main mode of poets for almost 100 years. The main mode of people that spend their lives studying poetry. People that win awards from the critics and most learned students of poetry. 

To put it another way that may help make sense: it's kinda like saying 'only structures using classical architecture can be considered buildings.' 

Or: 'Only paintings and sculptures can be considered art, photography is just a representation of life that exists outside of the camera's lens.'

Or animation is only for children, or hip hop isn't music because it doesn't use instruments... it's a gatekeeping that, to folks who have spent the time studying the subject, seems silly and ignorant of the craft put into the art. Ignorant as in unknowing, not dumb or anything like that. 

Again, I definitely suggest taking a poetry class, you'll learn about the craft of the free verse line break, about the nuance and specificity that free verse allows, the natural language it employs (or intentionally avoids), about sonics employed not just at the end of lines but within them, throughout them. About the variations of sentence structure, the impact of line length etc. There's a whole world of craft in free verse, and to say that only poets that rhyme or write in meter work on their poems is just, well, I hate to use the polarizing word again but it's the right word, ignorant. But again, I'm not using it as an insult, but a descriptor for not knowing something.
