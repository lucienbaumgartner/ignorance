Worse, sorry. Chuds are obviously toxic to non-chuds, and some Trump supporters are winnable to our side. 

Neoliberals explicitly craft their bullshit to appeal to the politically apathetic and unaware, and seem reasonable from a cursory point of view. They have more institutional power than Trumpians (for now, anyway). And I haven't seen one politically educated neoliberal who was "convertable" to our side via discussion or debate. The only way they come over (ie, Peter Daou) is by having their own internal sense of things change. Neoliberals are like the most dedicated and delusional chuds out there in the Trump camp.
