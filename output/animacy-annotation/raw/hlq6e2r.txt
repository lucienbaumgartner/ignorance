I can say that i was not aware leather came from animals and same with wool, although i kind of had an idea that wool came from animals but definitely not leather  


I mean why would i think that, it doesnt seem normal to wear an animal, many people are against wearing furs so i thought it was taboo  


Lots of people are dumb and unaware of how things actually are, as a vegan i have learned the world is an extremely cruel place
