&gt;Sophie and Maisie were both close friends during the filming of the 8 seasons, and had interviews or articles put out about the cliched "toxic fandoms" and depression.

This sounds incredibly dismissive and ignorant of the fact that they were exposed to toxic fans at a very young age - Sophie Turner in particular has been getting hate because people hate the character of Sansa since she was a little girl - literally from the beginning - but you're mad because she won't side with the fans and say out loud that the show that gave her her big break sucks. Also suffering from depression is cliche now? Wow. 

The existence of toxic fans is a fact, not a self-important fantasy invented by actresses you don't like. This thread is itself continuing the tradition of shitting on Sophie Turner, so congrats on consistency I guess.

Fans are allowed to dislike the product (I personally hate the show and stopped watching after the purple wedding), but to imply actors can't also have an opinion? Seriously? 

Also: she's not wrong. Demanding a re-make a piece of media because you didn't like it is in fact disrespectful. I don't mind disrespecting D&amp;D because they suck, but it is a slap in the face to everyone else in the production who did excellent work, since it is 100% D&amp;D's fault the season (and the show) failed.
