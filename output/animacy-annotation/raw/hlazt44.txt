Sober for sixteeen months; went to the mental hospital because of abuse. No money for drinks anymore either, kids gotta have their activities, you know? I haven't eaten anything that wasn't first offered to my kids in 2 years. Don't get me started on the anti depressants; Libido? Nope. I haven't even gotten hard in a year or two... not like we were fucking much anyhow since the kids could walk, so what does it matter?
I used to have dreams and ambitions, now about the only thing of mine likely to get recognized is an obituary referencing an obscure industrial accident at the local steel works. At least the kids are happy. At least appearances are maintained. At least the wife only uses me as an emotional dumpster and the kids are happy and unaware of everything. I just go to work and dig my dirt and shovel away my hopes with the idea that maybe they will have it better. I guess that makes me a good dad, even though I hate myself. Kids are great though; 10/10 would do it again.
