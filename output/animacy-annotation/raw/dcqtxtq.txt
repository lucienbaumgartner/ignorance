&gt; America from being made great again

Meaningless babble.

&gt; I also do not like how referring to people who are against trump as "good" insinuates that anyone for trump is bad.

Trump wants to bring back torture. He's put someone in charge of Education that wants to get rid of public schools. He's yet to show a single ounce of respect for the office, while acting obscenely petty on an almost daily basis. He's genuinely got so many things blatantly bad about him that it's really hard to choose enough to form a succinct paragraph. 

If nothing else, he lies with a level of blatantness that means he could only possibly be A. actively and maliciously lying and aware of it to manipulate people, or B. mentally ill and unaware that he is doing it.

So it's really hard for me to categorize people who actively support him as "good". I get that it's not black and white, but this is a reddit comment not a dissertation.
