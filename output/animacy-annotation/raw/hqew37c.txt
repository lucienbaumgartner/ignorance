That’s awful I’m sorry you’re going through this, I would be livid too. That was incredibly ignorant and selfish of them. My SIL and her family are the same way (they are always sick and don’t feel the need to stay home or make others aware), so before any family gatherings we now just ask everyone if anyone is/was recently sick.
