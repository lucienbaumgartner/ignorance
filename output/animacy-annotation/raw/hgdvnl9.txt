Yes it is

Just doing your job and then asking for a raise is like you waving a flag that says Iâ€™m arrogant and ignorant of my impact on the business.

If you take on more responsibility begin to mentor people to help the company grow so they can sell more widgets or whatever then yes you deserve a raise.

No business worth much, will be in business for long if it is giving you a huge raise just because you have an overinflated ego and time passes.
