Hey I just did a recent increase for my tension headaches (migraines). I’ve been going to the va for treatment for about two years now about my migraines. I finally decided to go for a increase bc I was lazy and unaware of increases. It was at 0% and after rated at 50%. The compensation claim was over the phone and I told him my symptoms etc. pretty easy and was approved in less than a month. 

Good luck. I would suggest to provide evidence. What’s the point of asking for an increase without any evidence. I know some ppl get lucky but if You have been seeing a neurologist there is nothing to lose.
