The friend zone thing is so stupid and men who get upset about this are pathetic. I'm a straight man and in my experience, women will absolutely give you hints that they are sexually and romantically attracted to you. 

A lot of men act like women don't have sexuality or can't be forward. Its just that THOSE men haven't had women be forward to them or had women express sexual/romantic interest. Or maybe they did, but have zero sense of pick up on that and go along. 

A lot of self centered men act like the friend zone is a real thing, because they are ignorant and upset. Its called being friends. 

Have I expressed interest in a female friend and been informed that it was not mutual? Yes. Did I respect them and remain friends? Yes. 

Have female friends expressed interest in me that was not mutual? Yes. Did they respect that? Sometimes no they didn't. 

The point is, you're not in a friend zone. You're their friend, so act like it. Stop expecting something or feeling you're entitled.
