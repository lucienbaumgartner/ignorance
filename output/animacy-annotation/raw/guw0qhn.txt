Listen buddy, you have to understand that a lot of us don't get to easily just go up to a girl and do "stuff". So how about you cut back on the complaining a little because it's making you look really ungrateful and unaware of what you have. You know, I've had girls treat me poorly in the past. I was in an online "relationship" with a girl and she broke up with me for no reason. And what happened to you exactly? You got your dick grabbed and who knows what else and you felt hurt because she didn't want to date you? Please be more aware.
