That in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, the former Secretary of Education under Bill Clinton said in an email that he wanted to achieve an uninformed and compliant citizenry.  This got 0 press, which to me is a bad thing.  
"And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging."
