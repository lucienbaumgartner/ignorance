&gt;Unnatural 

Literally every aspect of modern medicine is unnatural.  It's nature's course to let tumors grow until you die.  It's nature's course to be infected with diseases and die, not vaccinate and take penicillin.  It's nature's course to die of diabetes, not take insulin.  If you think something being unnatural is wrong, then you need to forego the entirety of modern medicine.  And let's not even get into the fact that millions of women take hormonal birth control to manage health issues. 

Many other species have sex for pleasure- for social bonding, out of boredom, in exchange for food...dolphins and bonobos are well studied examples.  Dozens of species also have homosexual pair bonding- obviously this sexual relationship isn't biologically meant for procreation.  It's simplistic and ignorant of biology and zoology to say all sexual activity is for procreation. 

&gt;If you can't do the time, don't do the crime

That's only if you see non procreative sex as something to be punished.  Personally I don't think a human deserves to have their entire life destroyed because a condom broke.
