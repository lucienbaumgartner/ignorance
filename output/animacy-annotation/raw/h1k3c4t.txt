Yes. We give a deep sedative first, so they go to “sleep” before the actual euthanasia drug injection. Quite a few people will stay for that but leave for the second injection. By then, the pet is asleep and unaware of their surroundings, they really don’t know the difference by then. They are just sleepy and peaceful.
