Yo. Listen.

Are you sure they didn't mean: "that's **just** their opinion"? As in, it's not an objective truth, just an opinion, and you can't argue someone's opinion away.

If I think chicken wings are gross but you own a chicken wing shop and think they're tops, neither of us can argue the other person's opinion away. I'm still going to see a dismembered chicken's cooked arm and you're still going to see good eatin' and the source of your livelihood. Nothing to argue about. You might be insulted but it's really just the chicken wings I think are gross, not the people who like them.

Going to be honest, your parents sound like they had an immense amount of patience with you and devoted themselves to their marriage and making a family together.

I scrolled through to see if you ever elaborated on what the insults were (nope) and I'm torn between annoyance and being kinda sad for you. It's both, really. 

I'm more sad and annoyed on behalf of your parents, though. You and your sister (dunno if she's your biological sister, but that doesn't matter) were adopted because she couldn't have children. Infertility and vastly different lifestyles can often be deal breakers for couples. But not your parents. He was a farmer and after a brief honeymoon, went to live and work on a farm (sight unseen) and raise two children that needed a loving home. Stayed together for the rest of their lives.

You stayed there with them until you were 38, and I suspect you might be back there at 51, possibly inheriting the place after they both passed. Not sure I blame you because your dad actually sounds awesome. Just like a really great guy. Your mom did stand up for you against a teacher and probably more times than you are aware of.

But you've been on Reddit for years shitting on them and misusing AskReddit. You don't care about other people's responses to questions, you just want to give your own answer. Over and over. But it's the shitting on your parents and their courtship and their treatment of you that I just can't fathom.

They clearly loved you and your sister and each other dearly and you had a really wholesome upbringing. I could almost cry over how unaware and ungrateful you seem.

Ask a foster kid if they'd like to live on a farm with a family. Or a neglected, lonely kid. Don't actually do that, because it'd be cruel if it's just hypothetical. You had fresh air, food and love and shelter and it's heartbreaking that you've hyperfocused on things like being kidded for eating teriyaki on a stick with a fork by family friends or acquaintances.

They didn't stand up for you? You felt like you couldn't stand up for yourself? Well now you're picking on them and they're gone so literally **can't** stand up for themselves, so I will. You're being an unappreciative self-centered hypocrite.

Also, if someone at work says, "do this" and you say "I can't" or "I don't know how" but they want you to do it anyway, it means you need to figure it out. That's what "you need to learn how to do this" means. Figure it out because no one is going to willingly do your job for you. If an item is 150lbs but you can only lift 75lbs, don't try to pick it up by yourself. That's not what they're asking for. Get a piece of equipment for the task and use leverage to move it. Honestly, do you think refrigerators are built in people's kitchens, or that the delivery guy just waltzed in carrying a fridge in his arms? The expectation is that you at least try to figure it out.

And finally, those plastic plates were probably not paid for. Someone likely decided they didn't want/need them but it's a self-checkout so no cashier right there to hand them to. So you most likely just stole them from the store. Or if they *were* paid for and in a bag, it's still weird not to put it aside or give it to a nearby employee. It was obviously the last person to use the checkout and how awkward if they'd come back in looking for their plates and you've gone ahead and loaded your items into the same bag.

I don't know why I cared enough to write this but I guess I don't think it's too late for you to realize you had it pretty good and you were loved and you were very important to them. You might have some problems but overall sound pretty well-adjusted in spite of that. You're not meanspirited, at least.

It's just disheartening to think of these people who did their best and more than most would and in the end there's resentment.
