I disagree. He doesn't the silint treatment. He deserves to get dumped. He clearly does not deserve this girl and is not mature enough to deal with an adult relationship. He raised red flags that he is selfish, ignorant and disrespectful. If he cant deal with something as simple as a towel, I dont think he can deal with everything else in a relationship. He deserves to get dump and never talk to her again. I kinda hope she finds out this post, read the comments, and get herself of this obviously toxic relationship.
