I have Aspergers, and I've had people tell me that they don't think I'm autistic or that I don't "look autistic" because I don't act like their autistic brother/friend/kid. It's a spectrum, everyone on it is different. For me, it's not apparent right away. I think lots of people don't realize I have it (or just know nothing about it to begin with) and just think "man, she's weird" and avoid me.

Anyway, it's not necessarily a bad thing. My guess is that people see it as the same thing as me saying I'm fat or ugly and wanting to try to make me feel better. It doesn't do that, it just makes them look ignorant and unaware that trained psychiatrists and therapists likely  know more about the subject than they do.

Also, when I finally do explain it to people because it's only a matter of time until I have to explain why I can't order at a restaurant without freaking out or why I can't handle loud music, they completely treat me differently, like I'm some kind of charity case and that they're such loving and understanding people for putting up with me. It's awful. I'm the same person as I was before, you don't have to treat me like a child, and you're not a saint for being friends with me.
