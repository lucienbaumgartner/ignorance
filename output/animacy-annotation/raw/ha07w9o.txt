So many words, yet so little relevant marital, from someone not married and ignorant of the marriage bed. 

Here are your Bible verses regarding masturbation:

I slept, but my heart was awake. Listen! my beloved is knocking. ‘Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.’I had put off my garment; how could I put it on again? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, and my inmost being yearned for him.I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but did not find him; I called him, but he gave no answer. - Song of Solomon 5:2-6 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=SongofSolomon5:2-6&amp;version=NRSVA

That's describing the act of masturbation, with pre ejaculation material, fingers dripping with sexual fluids from the person as they awaited their lover who used their fingers to pleasure them afterwards - all in a state where the imagination was involved. 

Masturbation by a person in a marriage, thinking about their spouse is *not* a sin. 

I rest my case. 

Goodbye.
