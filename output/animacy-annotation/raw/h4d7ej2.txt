Sometimes when we fuck up or it seems like we fuck you over/use you, we’re really just being emotionally useless and unaware of how we feel in the moment. I’ve had a situation where it felt right but then after sleeping together or spending some time with a girl it doesn’t seem right. Maybe it’s my wording or how I go about it but it never seems to end well
