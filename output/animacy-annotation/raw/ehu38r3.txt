&gt;How stupid do you have to be to think any country is going to send a drone strike to every single house in America?

How stupid do you have to be to read what I said and assume this? That is obviously absurd.

&gt; Your level of thinking is so shallow and ignorant that Im sure you would find a way to drown yourself in it. 

coming from someone who couldn't even accurately read what I typed, this means literally nothing.

&gt; I know what your donkey brains are going to say, 

Good lord someone is triggered.

Did me thinking that you Americans are not super brave citizen soldiers willing to fight an army upset you?

&gt; Real life isnt call of duty, ammunition is limited.  

Says the fool who thinks the average American will stand up and fight the fucking Army, Jesus Christ.

&gt; Imagine if EVERY SINGLE HOUSE had to blown up because the people inside said fuck you. Do you understand the logistics of something like that? 

Yes, which is why I didn't suggest that, you complete moron.
