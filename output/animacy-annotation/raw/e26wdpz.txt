It is definitely snake oil to those who have no intention of authentically examining themselves the way that he says we all should.

The bottom line message I gather from him is do not kid yourself about who you really are versus what you try to be to others around you. He is not really teaching anything new, just to be accountable and self-aware. Have logic behind what you do and not just raw emotion; have end-goals in mind when you take a stance, don't just do it because you think "this is what a good person would do".

Part of showing the importance of this message came through showing how unaccountable and unaware that many social movements are; and that obviously made a lot of people upset, when faced with the reality that they are just making noise and being nothing more than a disruption because of how out-of-touch they are.
