But you brought up race. It wasn't a factor until you made it so. If you didn't think race was a part of it why would you bring it up? Im sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I'm not here to try to convince you that you are wrong. Im just expressing how it was a simple miscommunication. Which often happens over text. I really don't want to debate. Im sorry for the way others have treated you. Its shitty. Im sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I know this may be hard and sound ignorant and stupid from somebody who hasn't gone through what you have, but try to assume the best in people. It may give life a more positive out look. Have a goodnight/day!
