It's not that they're not being supportive, it's that in general most people don't have any idea what they are talking about when it comes to fitness and nutrition.  People love to pontificate about things they have little knowledge about.

Why would you take seriously the opinions of people who clearly have no knowledge about the topic?

"Normal" is basically overweight and unaware of caloric density of foods.  "Normal" is also generally not very fit or very educated about the topic.

Personally I don't want to be normal.

We each walk our own path in life.  For now you're walking in the same direction as your friends.  Hopefully that continues.  But in the end it's your path.
