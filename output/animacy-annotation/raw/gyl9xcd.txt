That's just in our DNA to protect our kids at all costs. I'd cover up a murder for my kids. I'd never tell them that, but if anything happens, its instinct to try and keep their lives in the best shape possible.  

Its the driving force behind pretty much everything else we do as parents.  We could basically just ignore the kid for 18 years and then be like "your on your own now".  The reason we don't is basically instinct. It takes a ton of money and effort and time to raise a kid.  They are little shits the entire time, completely ungrateful and unaware of everything you do... but you still do it.

All of those deadbeat parents that don't take care of their kids probably just lack the same instinct.
