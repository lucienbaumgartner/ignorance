Did you see the Wikileaks Podesta email where they detailed the Democratic Party plan to create an "unaware, and compliant citizenry"? Their words verbatim, not mine, but sure I'm the one who was conned. It sure must be nice to be so forgiving and trusting of politicians who talk about their constituents like that. Good luck in the world, friend.
