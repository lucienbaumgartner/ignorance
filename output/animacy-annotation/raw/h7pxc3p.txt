Shout out to you for standing up for your principles. 

Once is unfortunate and difficult for all involved sometimes even forgivable, but 6 times? Nah. Doesn't deserve comforting for that imo. Hope it wasn't a single dude who had to endure all that. Even a single occurrence of such intimate betrayal can fuck someone up if feelings ran deep enough.

Seems like she's doing whatever she wants and using you to make herself feel less guilty about her selfishness, in my humble and ignorant-of-the-situation opinion.

Hopefully she'll realise that she's hurting a lot of the people around her, directly and indirectly, and make some meaningful changes, but such things don't happen overnight, and certainly won't if shes got someone there to support her actions. So again, good on you. 

All the best and take care.
