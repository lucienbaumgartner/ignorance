I hated it at first. But playing devil's advocate I have come to MAYBE understand it. 

When they said they want to force "lane commitment" they may have been referring to Lane pushing commitment. If you decide to push a Lane you are pushing it and be prepared to be ganked harshly.

The way sprint mode is, it doesn't punish pushing, it punishes unaware and bad pushing...hard as fuck.

Now yes I'll agree it's absurd right now. But I can see them toning sprint mode DOWN (not removing ) and adding teleport in. Least I hope it's their plan.

Sprint mode is currently forcing people to play smart and play safe and play the mechanics. If you don't do it, you'll be punished severely for it.

This is by no means an excuse for the current sprint mode. But it REALLY does help you to learn the mechanics of this game if you just accept it's there.
