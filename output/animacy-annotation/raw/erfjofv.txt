I see this on BART every day.  You've generally got two flavors of Fuckmeat:

Fuckmeat #1 is so self-involved and ignorant that they are unable to acknowledge the existence of other people and are utterly unaware of their physical presence and its impact upon others.

Fuckmeat #2 is so self-involved and unfortunately aware that they see every other human being as an impediment to their existence and actively seek to irritate as many of us as possible by standing in front of doors to gain entry COMPLETELY IGNORING the cue that the rest of us considerate, organized persons have formed.

People who don't step out of the way during the on and off-boarding of trains should be required to clean the sidewalks of Market Street with their tongues.

\*\* Fuckmeat Dishonorable Mention is anyone who takes up more than one seat with their body and/or the bullshit they're carrying.

All three richly deserve to go to the Special Hell reserved for child molesters and people who talk at the theater.
