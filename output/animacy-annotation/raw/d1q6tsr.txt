Everyone is downvoting you but I think they forget that downvoting genuinely helpful and constructive posts is pointless.

You are a secondary opinion and you are saying things in a constructive way focused on helping OP come to terms with what happened and giving her an alternate perspective.

I don't like how everyone is disregarding you just because they disagree.

I personally agree somewhat with you that it seems shady but mostly because of what happened after she fell asleep. You'd think they'd begin to sober up after hours of not drinking and simply having sex/expending energy, and instead they were still going at it for lord knows how long while OP was blissfully unaware and asleep.

A drunken "finish up" probably means "stop so we can sleep" rather than "keep going for over HALF AN HOUR." She slept around 0230 (probably a bit earlier) and woke up around 0300. A half hour is a long time to "finish up." That just was unsettling for me, especially  how they completely disregarded OP when she woke up. 

Imagine nobody was drunk in the situation and they were all having a threesome. One person falls asleep and says finish. They wake up half an hour later and the other two are still going. They get up and walk across the room to go to the bathroom and not once do the two ever stop or even slow down to acknowledge the first person. It's just bad threesome etiquette in general.

Also *by this point, blackout drunk OP had sobered up enough to realize how messed up all of this was.* Yet they weren't sober enough to think "maybe sex one-on-one for this long is a bad idea? Nope. They wanted to have their cake and eat it too. They wanted not only a threesome but a solo experience, and that for me would be something I could never erase nor forgive if I were in the situation.
