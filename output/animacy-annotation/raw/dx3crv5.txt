Thank you for being thoughtful person. As an American reading the racist comments posted on this photo, I think it’s a shame there are so many still uninformed and unaware that we are a nation of immigrants. I have to remind myself it’s a good thing, in a way, when they expose themselves to the sunlight. A change is gonna come.
