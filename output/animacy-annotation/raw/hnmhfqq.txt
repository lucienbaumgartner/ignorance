No doubt so long as immunization is minimal worldwide there will still be hiccups. I'm not talking about a world-wide public health approach right now though, I'm focusing on the U.S. We are a wealthy country and we're on verge of a sort of shift in how we are able to fight COVID.

Here in the U.S. we've got orally administered antiviral drugs literally right around the corner. They seem to be effective against all the variants if administered early in the progression of the disease.

Getting to high rates of immunization will take a long time, but more immediately (like within a month or two) these antivirals will be available in wealthy nations and the strain on our hospitals can then be alleviated. This attitude that high hospitalization numbers here in the U.S. are the "new normal" is ... misguided, dangerous, and ignorant of what is coming in medicine to fight COVID.

It's also toxic to advocate for such a position considering the consequences of such staffing strain on our healthcare workers.

Mitigation strategies are hugely important right now as our hospitals have been on the brink for a while. They'll continue to be important, but my main point is we need to be doing more right now. No doubt our government needs to do more to get resources to nations that don't have them, but we kinda have to focus on what our communities can do to make things less bad *here*, because none of us are diplomats.
