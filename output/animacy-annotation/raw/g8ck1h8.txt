Of course none of us will ever really know, but I’ve always thought this too. And idk if anyone remembers, but awhile back Alex shared on her IG stories a video she made as a nerdy ass preteen rapping over that song White n Nerdy..... it seems like she was the ugly ducking in her youth who got hot when she got older.  And due to her lack of close friendships, it seems like she’s always been disliked and has burned bridges to serve her own shallow goals.  She very obviously comes off like she has something to prove.  No wonder she pays such close attention to criticism and freaks out when people accuse her of lying.  She seems very insecure and unaware of how her issues harm other people.  It’s unfortunate that she has a big platform and that harm has possibly extended to her listeners.  I really hope (and wouldn’t be surprised if) she fades away in the next few years and people forget about her.  Girl seems like she needs to do some self reflection.
