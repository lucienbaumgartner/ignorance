You dont really understand the point i was making. Reforming private healthcare to make it work separate from the NHS rather than an appendage would mean it would essentially be impossible to work in both anyway. As the bullshit "work privately for one afternoon a week" and not really benefiting anyone wouldnt work anymore. The private hospitals would require full time staff to run a full service.

The organization of private work in this country is ineffective, inefficient and can only exist in a stupidly bureaucratic country like the uk.

Also your clearly ignore the fact that doctors cant train privately, which is already a massive control over what you can do with a medical degree. If the systems were separate then private hospitals could easily have training programs.

Youre just being unimaginative and ignorant of serious opportunities to do better for yourself. Doctors here never want to help themselves
