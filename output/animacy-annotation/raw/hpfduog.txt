The irony is that, for some of us from a democratizing country which experience dictatorship in the past, the freedom that we have right now is because that democratic movement. I saw twitter comments indicate that some brainless fans who support SD are from a democratizimg country.

Now, the populism is on the rise in every corner of the world and this uncultivated fans do not have enough brain to understand that democracy might be on the  brink!

I cant help but thinking that those fans are exactly children. But if they are, this is very alarming. These children are so clueless and ignorant and they want to trade-in our core demoratic value
