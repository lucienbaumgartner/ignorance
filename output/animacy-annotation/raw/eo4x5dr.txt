&gt;We've currently got a ton of male-focused superhero series and movies. Is it really so bad to have one that's focused on women

Strawman. No one is saying we can't have female super hero series and movies. I watched Jessica Jones even though Kristen Ritter can't act for shit, and relatively enjoyed it. I'd watch a Hit Girl series if there was one. Hell, I'd watch a Bat Girl series. But this is not that.

This is so completely unaware and ironically horrible that I can't even begin to explain, but I'll try.

This show seeks to do to Batman what TLJ did to Star Wars; take a male space/character, neuter it, replace it with a woman, then claim superiority, and this can be seen in the last line "I'm not about to let a man take credit for a woman's work."

This is complete bullshit nonsense crap. Batman, Bruce Wayne, builds the entire hero from nothing as an arguably insane man, builds the bat cave, the suit, the gadgets, fights, risks his life etc. and then this girl who weighs 110 pounds and can apparently take on grown men thugs in fights, waltzes in and acts like she's the shit and she did something. She didn't. She's simply stepping into Batman's already established everything and then going "I am woman, hear me roar!"

Also, her character looks unbelievably shallow and nonsensical. **NO** women who act like her exist. This is a problem I have had with Hollywood for maybe ten years or so, and is actually an issue I have with Emilia Clarke's character on Game of Thrones. 

The Khaleesi just simply is not a believable type of person. She has no depth. She simply stares stone faced all the time and gives orders like she's not worried about anything. Hell, Jon Snow shows more humanity than her, more emotion than her, more depth and complexity and openness with his emotions, and don't give me that crap about her upbringing etc. **NO ONE** exists like the Khaleesi and she's an unbelievable character, and a boring one for most of the series. This Batwoman character is just like that and I don't even need to see the show to know it.

Bruce is a complicated character. He's flawed, arguably crazy and scarred by his past. He has ideals. He breaks down from time to to time. Even Christian Bale never has any moments in his trilogy where you think Batman is invincible or has a full handle on his emotions. This trailer makes Batwoman look like every other typical stonefaced Hollywood "strong female" that has no basis in reality and no females actually want to be. This is what they don't understand.

No women want to be Captain Marvel or Wonderwoman or Batwoman. These characters/comics were *aimed at male readers and primarily purchased by them*, and the girls who did buy them, were huge comic nerds who are not your average girl, especially back then. 

Women do not aspire to be stone faced ass kickers wearing leather with short hair cuts. They just don't. This fantasy appeals to literally no one, and because Batwoman appears to lack any femininity, and is obviously a Lesbian, she won't appeal to male viewers either in the way that someone like Ripley or Sarah Conner or Ney'Tiri does.

Sure, there will be a few people out there who dig this, but it's primarily just a complete middle finger to men from idealogues who have to literally do what Batwoman does in this show--take something already built up by men and reclaim it and take credit for it.

You know what? Come up with something new. Create a complex female superhero and put her on screen. At least Jessica Jones was interesting as a person, despite Kristen Ritter's horrible acting. Hit Girl was awesome. Show me **real femininity** with some super powers behind it or something and I'll watch the shit out of it. But don't just dress a tiny girl up in a Batman costume and give her a dyke hair cut and a lesbian gf and call it a day. That's cheap, political garbage and the dislike ratio here is showing that people aren't buying it.
