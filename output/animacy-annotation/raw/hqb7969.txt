All of them do. All of them.

Your phone is powered by electricity generated at a plant that either releases greenhouse gases or nuclear waste. You’re kidding yourself if you think the energy powering your house is pure solar.

And even if it was, producing those solar panels used energy from fossil fuels.

Oh and power plants are literally one of the worst things for the earth. Fossil fuels fucking destroy the earth. The gas your car uses does the same.

You’re far too ignorant and naive to be discussing this. Unless you live without electricity whatsoever, you have no ground to say we should give up technology.
