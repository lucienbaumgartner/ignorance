The True Crime Community or the TCC is a community with heavy knowledge and interest in true crime. They can be interested in not only the destructive nature of the crimes but the psychological status of the criminals. That in itself is completely fine by most people's standards. As humans, we generally are quite interested in *understanding why someone feels the need to hurt others.* What I'm referring to is the weird, creepy, insulting, obsessive side of the true crime community that seems to deify, romanticise, and victimise school shooters and murderers in general; While at the same time saying they don't condone the actions of the criminals.  


I personally think it's disgusting and is in no way better than going "lol i don't condone Josef Mengele but, like, he's so cute and he's just a poor misunderstood little garbage angel. he just needed help, guys"   


However, I've never been a witness to a shooting before and I'd like to know how those who've had the unfortunate luck to be apart of one feel. It seems to me, that awful side of the TCC is very unaware and insensitive to those who've suffered the psychological and physical damage feel. It's evil.
