**Nazi Literature in the Americas** and **Distant Star** by Bolaño, distinctly and probably intentionally more Borgesian than the other Bolaño I've read. I actually thought that the final piece in *Nazi Literature*, which went on to form the basis for *Distant Star*, was a stronger work. More chipped away, hollow. I enjoyed both of them, although I wouldn't describe either as top-flight. 

I also read **Pedro Páramo** by Juan Rulfo, which is a fascinating novel, although again I have to say that the novel I *thought* I was getting, right up until &gt;!Juan Preciado is revealed to have died and reader's surrogate is replaced by a series of secondary narrators!&lt; might have been a better book than the one I got. I can't really complain though, it's one of those works that seems almost beyond narrative to me, not a prose poem but prose operating poetically, events occurring not to tell a story but to fulfill some sort of primitive function. Slim little volume whose outsized influence is immediately evident. 

I've also started **The Books of Jacob** by Tokarczuk. Not immediately enjoyable - the writing at the very start comes off like a very conscious historical reproduction as it describes the sensations of the market, like one of those podcasts where they take you on "*a guided tour of historical Venice*" or whatever, but by about the middle of the first book everything has, for me, clicked, the book unfolding the way I want it to unfold - a measured, calm prose capable of taking in the heat of a village hearth and the coldness of stars, of dealing with people both profoundly ignorant and little intellectuals scared of implications of subjective sense-experience. It seems like it will be not only good, but actually very good.
