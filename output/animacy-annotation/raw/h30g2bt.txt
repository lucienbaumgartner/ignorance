Damn, your second point is outrageously incorrect and ignorant of you to say. Black people have been racist against me, calling me Jap, pulling their eyes &amp; squinting to say my eyes are small, spreading rumors about me that I eat dogs,  list goes on. White, POC, black, doesn't matter. Any person can be racist, and being one color or another doesn't give them a "pass" for being shitty.
