I cannot agree with more. What really sucks is that most canadians that I know do believe that bipocs have been treated very poorly here, and are changing their views on things, but the rhetoric from the woke is so incredibly divisive and ignorant that right wing extremism is starting to explode. I genuinely worry for the future of western civilization and democracy.  But hey I'm an oppressor so what the fuck do I know, besides 2 thousand years of history .
