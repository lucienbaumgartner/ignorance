I disagree. The main problem is not that so many people pick and choose what they believe is right and wrong. That is something that will never end. 

The main problem is that people tell others that believing something different then them is hateful and ignorant. That is what divides people. When that name calling begins. It takes an opinion and turns it into an attack. 

The woman in this post did not start the hate, those who tell her she is hateful for not believing in something have started the hate.
