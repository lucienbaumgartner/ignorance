Ok but have you considered that you don’t know me. As a famous man once said, “in this day and age, ignorance is a choice and people still choose to be ignorant”. You’re a great example of this. Just because I’m a “kid” doesn’t mean I can’t have feeling, or they’re immediately denied because I’m “immature”. I find it extremely immature and ignorant, that you think since I’m not an adult, nothing can be wrong in my life. That’s kinda messed up man.
