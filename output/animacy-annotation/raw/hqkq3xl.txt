Yeah as someone with an affinity for just getting lost and traveling and making videos myself, it definitely sucks to have him put a bad name in the travel space. It makes people even more ignorant and judgemental to travel. I can’t, as a white 30s guy, talk about going to Southeast Asia without some friend thinking it’s for sex tourism. It sucks but it’s the nature of the world

these problems exist and this guy is not helping anything. He definitely comes off a little slimy in his vids But I figured that’s just how you have to be when dealing with so many Hagglers and dangerous situations, otherwise he seemed like a straight forward dude but what do we know.

He probably won’t ever speak about this stuff because it would be too damaging
