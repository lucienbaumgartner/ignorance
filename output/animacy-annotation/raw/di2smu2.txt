I was at a conference full of professinal people yesterday and as the confrence started some guy was talking on his phone. The speaker started and he was still talking on his phone, 10 minutes later someone else has to tell him to leave the room before he actually left to finish his phone call. How unaware and disrespectful can some people be?
