Yeah funny how quick OP was to turn this into some dramatic BS. Its almost like he wanted to interpret it this way , to make it look like they're being weird and ignorant of his complaint. But anyone with an iphone knows funky stuff can happens when you start seeing blue go to green and vice versa. So either he is greatgrandma-tier out of touch with technology and how things work, or he's being disingenuous and is just thirsty for dramatcizing this. Thinks he could get a free pair out of this or some sht 🤦🏾‍♂️
