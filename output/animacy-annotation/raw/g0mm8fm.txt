It may be helpful to know that autism isn’t a medical issue or a mental health issue. It’s not something you “treat”, particularly at my age. So, I don’t have “appointments” to go to. Being autistic isn’t something that makes you physically or mentally unhealthy (although those type of conditions can co-occur). Moreover, many autistic people are parents. When autistic people have kids, they don’t get automatically evaluated to see if they are fit to be parents. Because autism is genetic, many parents of autistic children are autistic themselves. There’s a lot of stigma and stereotypes surrounding autism. People have simplistic ideas about it and functioning. If you met me, unless you knew a lot about autism, while you may notice something in interpersonal interactions, you’d likely wouldn’t guess that I’m autistic. I likely would disclose because I’d like to possibly foster an autistic child . My point and frustration really is that by disclosing, I have to live under the stigma that people have of autism. Whereas, if I had stayed undiagnosed and unaware that I am autistic, my competence would never be questioned in that regard. Diagnosed or not, I’m still the same person. My competence has not changed and yet now it can be questioned in ways it never was before I was diagnosed.
