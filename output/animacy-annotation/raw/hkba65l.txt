I now kinda love this guy because he's so ridiculous and unaware and stubborn in his narcissism that he's almost completely ineffectual and after any challenge he quickly starts to showcase who he really is

Hopefully his example and his interactions with others may help some people realize that they are prone to believing these sorts of fake "gurus", and who these "gurus" really are under the surface
