Are you unable to grasp the idea that not all pro-life folks like Trump? Does that concept lie in some obscure blind spot in your mind, hidden in the shadow cast by an obsession with Pokemon? Or are you just that rude and ignorant that you're OK with writing off anyone who is pro-life and dislikes Trump? Or maybe, just maybe... you're more interested in sowing discord among the pro-life community?
