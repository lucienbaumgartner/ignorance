This was my mother. My dad died of cancer when I was 11 (he was 50) and my mom had not had a full-time job since before my oldest sister was born 25 years earlier.  She had a degree, but it was in education and she hadn't been in a classroom in that long and didn't have any current licenses or endorsements, so all she could have done with it was part-time subbing.  

She ended up going to grad school and entering a different field, but she did NOT have realistic ideas about starting salary in that field (barely above minimum wage) nor realistic ideas of what our budget needed to be (she still bought food like we were a family of four even though it was just her and me) and she never got a handle on our finances because my dad had always handled the accounts and paid the bills.  And when the money from life insurance started running out because she had spent most of it getting her degree, she fell for a house-flipping scheme and decided to refinance so she could get a home equity loan to purchase another house to flip (SUPER BAD ADVICE).  That was about two weeks before the markets crashed and the recession hit and she was underwater on her mortgage overnight.  Yes, she lost the house.

Long story short, it's been 17 years since my dad passed and the only reason she isn't homeless is because my sister married rich and she's living in a house they had originally purchased to rent out.  But she has no credit, a foreclosure on her record, student loans, and zero retirement savings, and she wouldn't qualify to rent anywhere else if she tried.  She was wholly unequipped to suddenly be a single mother and living and adulting on her own for the first time (she only lived with her parents and in dorms before marrying my dad straight out of college) and she never found her footing.  I still love her and she did try very hard, but she was just too sheltered and ignorant of reality to understand what it would really take to make it without my dad.
