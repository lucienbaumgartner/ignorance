Even though I believe you that these types of fridges exist, I think my disbelief comes from a distrust of LAOP's judgement. 

A person that would have the audacity to take all the beer instead of just 1 (assuming they are correct about how this fridge works), is so unaware and oblivious that I just don't trust their assessment of how the fridge works. There is no signage on the fridge saying everything inside is fair game, and so I think there's a better than even chance LAOP is wrong about how the fridge works, and is completely oblivious about it.

But who knows really? Those are just the vibes I get from this post.
