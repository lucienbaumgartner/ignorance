When I was watching this scene, at first I just thought Deavan must be extremely dumb and unaware of her surroundings..BUT after she mentioned the stolen cell phones for a THIRD time (with a glimmer in her eye) I realized she's just evil and very calculating. 

Deavan was purposely trying to sabotage Jihoon's new job and make him look like shit in front of his new boss...after she hounded him to get a job where he would make more money - she then seemed set on getting him fired. That's a special kind of evil and fucked up. She seems to get joy out of seeing Jihoon  struggle.
