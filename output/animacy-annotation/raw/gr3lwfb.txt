There's no such thing as a communist nation , if you had read theory as you claim that term would seem childish to you. In marxism there are many different schools like analytic marxism, libertarian marxism , marxism leninism etc. You can't make sweeping statements like that without oversimplification things to the point of being wrong. Since Marx and engels were against what you call Equality of outcome any regime that enforces it by definition goes against it. So I am saying in good faith that your statement is inaccurate and ignorant of the works of Marx and Engels.
