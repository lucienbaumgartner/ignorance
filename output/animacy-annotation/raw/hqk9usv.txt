Well, I had it phrased to me in a particular way that may help clarify things.

As an example, if I came to you and told you that I identified at Napoleon Bonaparte, would you expect the people of France to treat me as their emperor?  Of course you wouldn't.  And why not?  Well, the answer is very simple:

That's not who I am.

Even if I were to become fluent in French, and I were to change my legal name to Napoleon Bonaparte, and even if I were to have plastic surgery to make myself look like the how the Napoleon is often portrayed as having looked, it still doesn't change the fact that I'm not the original Napoleon Bonaparte, and it goes without saying (or at least it should go without saying) that I shouldn't be treated as if I were.  Running around saying that people who disagree with me are allegedly being hateful, ignorant, and phobic isn't going to change that.
