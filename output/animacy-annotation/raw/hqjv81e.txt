You are so full of hate . The prices have nothing to do with me , I have the same hardship everyone else has , maybe even more as I am on a very small fixed income . I choose to make my medication a priority hence have to sacrifice elsewhere and do so very well I may say . You come in here with whining and crying about the prices , well we all have already heard it . You can't make a good argument or carry on a good debate so you show hate ? Grow up , and when you do you may just see things a bit differently . Please do us all a favor , stop with the hateful name calling it gets you no where . Actually it makes you look ignorant and hateful . Tah tah .
