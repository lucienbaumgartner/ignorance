exactly, whenever someone is faced with the ugly painful truth they often don't want to believe it...i'll concede the 'general public' is perhaps a little smarter than this but for this age group specifically, i think it's pretty accurate overall, especially for a florida beach anyway. But this is typically what you'll see on any 'man on the street' type interviews. Sadly most people are really ignorant and unaware of most knowledge/history.
