You know, you actually infuriate me so fucking much. You're on almost every single EX-MUSLIM POST EVER. And you say the most blatantly misleading, misogynistic and hateful bullshit ever. 

And by "Arabs regarded women as a peice of property or as rubbish", it sounds like you're talking more about Arab men after Islam rather than before. Women can't do so many things in Islam without an approval of some shitty male according to Islam. 

Wow! Islam said don't kill women because they're human beings, what a miracle. Islam lets women live then asks men to treat them like fucking shit. I don't really see a point in living if the only purpose of your life is to get beaten by your husband, obey him, and pop out 20 kids. Islam strips the joy out of life anyway, but it's much worse if you're a woman. 

And no, you uneducated POS, women were allowed to operate business WAY before Islam. You're literally so stupid and ignorant that you don't even know Fatima had a business in which Muhammad worked. She was the man in the relationship, Muhammad was just another useless pathetic male. 


And your dumbass claim that "Islam gave women rights" can be demolished even further: 

Narrated `Ikrima:

Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `Abdur Rahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, `Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" Sahih Bukhari 5825, Vol. 7, Book 72, Hadith 715. 

Now, are you going to deny what Aisha said? The woman who was alive during the time Islam supposedly "gave women rights" or will you finally leave us the fuck alone?
