Also the answers in the original thread show how much the average wageslave is unaware and clueless of how the rich stay rich and how they make their money. 

So many people tell me "but you would run out of money", as if a multi-millionaire or billionaire was obliged to work hard to stay rich LMAO.

When you are that rich, you don't work for money anymore, money works for you (that's the different between actual rich people and others)

With something like 10 or even 5 million, you could invest in several fields and it would earn you way more money than the average worker. 

That"s why the rich are hoarding real estate, becoming landlords and creating inflation in the housing market. 

People are so much brainwashed into thinking than millionaires / billionaires are obliged to work their butt off to stay rich, I suspect it's a myth that capitalists use to brainwash people into believing that if they work hard enough, they will become rich eventually.
