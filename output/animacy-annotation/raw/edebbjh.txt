You're fine.  If he was so socially awkward and unaware that he motorboated you then this is a life lesson he needed.

You did him a favor because the next woman he does something like that to might not merely use her words.  

For what it's worth just because someone acts socially inappropriate doesn't mean they don't know it.  No one thinks motorboarding is the same as a handshake.
