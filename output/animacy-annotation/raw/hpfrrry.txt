&gt; I’m sorry your delusional for believing all the shit that the liberals feed to you.

If that was true you should be able to easily contradict one cited fact I've shared with you. Only one of us here is incapable of accepting reality, and it's not me. 

&gt;And don’t tell me that the “fine” was $0. 

The current fine is literally $0. It is a matter of law. You are ignorant of the most basic facts in life. 

&gt;At my place of employment, the current health insurance premium was once again increased. 

Sure. And, on average, they were rising even faster before the ACA. 

&gt;I don’t see it.

I believe you. You're ignorant, and determined to stay that way.
