And you could argue she only won due to being on a planet steeped in the dark side allowing her to use the tentacles. She's had 20 years of training by this point aka almost the same amount as Bane since he starts much later in life and has only been going for a little over a year before he destroys the brotherhood and starts the rule.

As for her force feats as a child she's doing that to 2 unaware and surprised jedi not 2 that fully have their guard up or are prepared and her abilities are insanely short scoped compared to Bane who shows an ability to do pretty much anything whereas Zannah is strictly madness spells and soresu.

Bane is also 1 of the few masters who never actively tries to keep their apprentice down legitimately wanting her to be better than him, I don't agree with the assumption that once he's gone she would have all this time she now has to train Cognus afterall who must kill her quite fast since she's also an adult when training begins and has 1 failed apprentice when she starts out in millennial and then another.

There's literally never any deplicted rule of 2 master apprentice jump that makes the rule seem as though it took a huge jump and judging by what Plagueis has to say about Gean and Gravid at least once it arguably took a step back.
