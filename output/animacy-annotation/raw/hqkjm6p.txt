This is a very ignorant and uniformed opinion.

While as a whole property owners renting out their property can cause an increase in property values making it harder to buy, the reality is (with or without landlords) there are a huge number of people that just cannot afford home ownership.

As big as real estate costs are an issue, the rental market is facing major shortages in inventory driving rental prices up.  If you think rentals are expensive as it is they would be dramatically more expensive with a smaller pool if landlords.

Real estate prices are a major issue, but "landlords" are nowhere near the biggest reason that there is a housing affordability crisis (to own or rent).
