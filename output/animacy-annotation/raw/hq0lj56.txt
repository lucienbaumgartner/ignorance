You speak down on Imam Ahmad and disrespect the stance of Imam Shafi'i and still want to preach. You're very obviously not educated about the religion, and start random rants against unrelated people and factions. Try to stick to truths instead of just being a young partisan like so many here.

If you don't mind I'll withdraw and give you some time to grow up on your own. I'm not partaking in a discussion at this level. This is too immature, too ignorant and too random for a man like me. I like to maintain some decorum.

To you be your way and to me be mine.
