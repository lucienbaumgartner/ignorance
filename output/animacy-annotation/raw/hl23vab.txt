I was buying beer in Merida Mexico and they have some odd blue laws. The beer case wasn’t locked and it was like 3 pm on a Monday. The cashier looked over and said I can’t sell you that now. I think he might have said it twice, I don’t think he caught my attention the first time. 

I said ok sorry and was putting it back and this French Canadian freaked out and started yelling at me for how stupid and ignorant of an American I was. Going on and on. Like I had just made the worst cultural mistake possible. 

This other French Canadian jumped out of line from the register and came over. She said it was ok and that she would walk me down to another store to find some. She felt pretty bad for the way this man was yelling at me. I was pretty flustered and embarrassed after being accosted  by this other French Canadian man, so I just said sure. Still stunned and shocked walking to the next store she said she wasn’t sure why they couldn’t sell me beer there. It’s usually just  liquor Sunday evenings the state of Yucatan. 

Maybe it was an election day? I still can’t figure it out. 

Anyway we got to the next store and we received the same answer as at the first store. I told her thanks anyway and we parted ways. 

That is just one instance of my run ins with French Canadians in Mexico. I have a good circle of friends from Western Canada and they can’t seem stand them.
