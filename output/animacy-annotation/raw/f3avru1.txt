I ran into a post that talked about how "America's president is in bed with Putz and Winnie the Pooh" (paraphrasing very slightly).

Regardless of what you think of our president, you have to be *absolutely* politically unaware and inept, completely disconnected from reality, or trying to win some Chinese karma from people who feel "orange man bad" to say that a man who has constantly campaigned against China, has a well-documented "trade war" with China that the media circlejerked about for virtually ever now, and still speaks out against China, is "in bed with Winnie the Pooh".
