The one near death experience I read when the person was headed towards the light she looked around at the earth and saw all sorts of lost spirits hovering ten feet off the ground just completely focused on the ground heads glued facing down. They would be following people trying to talk to them or mindlessly doing other things. She said that they appeared grey where as other fresh souls appeared white. She said that it’s not that they couldn’t move on to the other side, it’s that they were just unaware and unable to break their cycle of confusion and desperation. It’s like all aspects of their humanity had melted away and all that remained is their primary sorrow in the finality of death
