...Yes, they do. Go down to your county clerk's office and request the election data for any specific election. It'll usually have past elections each person voted in (Although obviously not how they voted). They may charge a small fee for it, but that is a matter of public record.

If you live in a small, rural county the clerk may be suspicious and unaware that that is publicly available information, but they are supposed to release it.
