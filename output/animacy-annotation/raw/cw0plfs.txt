&gt; And you didn't even rebut a single point of mine despite me making you look like a fool with your own source yet you go throwing stones.

Because you don't have a point. The article, if you had read it, talks about way more than alt.drugs. Buying drugs from online sources (be it the internet or bbses) has been going on for a long long time. I know, I was there. Your initial comment was so stupid and unaware that it borders on insanity; however, since buying child prostitutes is your vice, I'll forgive you for not knowing the ins and outs of buying drugs through the mail.
