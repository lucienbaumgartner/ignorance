You are free to think that, but there is ample evidence that God LOVES children.

&gt; 3 And he said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 18:3 NIV)

&gt; 13 Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. 14 Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, **for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these**." (Matt. 19:13-14 NIV)

&gt; 37 "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me." (Mark 9:37 NIV)

There's more, but it's obvious that, as the song says, "Jesus loves the little children..."

Re: miscarriages, rather than putting a negative spin on them (we've had four, so I'm allowed an opinion), could it potentially be a positive thing? Maybe there exist children who are so special that God can't wait to hold them and love on them? 

A writer once speculated that in front of the Throne is not a bunch of stodgy worshippers, but lots of small and infant children playing, like a day at the beach, innocent and unaware of their doting Father near them.

At least you must recognize that this is closer to the heart of God than "indifference".
