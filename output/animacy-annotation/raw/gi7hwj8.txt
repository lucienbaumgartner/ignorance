Horrible behavior from both of them (though I'd be absolutely bullshit too if my kid stole my cards) but what really gets me is Jenelle picking up Jace then screaming and crying. I think, to a sociopath like her, she believed she would be seen as a "poor thing" who just loves her kid and is doing her best... but she failed to realize how abusive that shit is to Jace. Had the opposite effect and exposed her for what she is; apathetic and unaware of Jaces feelings and life.
