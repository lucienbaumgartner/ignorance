Hey there, INTJ male chiming in here. I wanted to let you know that the above opinion couldn't be more wrong. 

I'm in a relationship with an INFJ woman and the inferior Se sexual tension between us is palpable, haha. I've never had quite so much cerebral and sexual synergy with someone before, it feels distinctly otherworldly. 

I personally don't understand this meme of simping over ENxPs. I imagine those relationships can be as great as any other, but the Ni-Ni connection that INxJs have together transcends...well, everything. 

Point is, this pairing can absolutely work, but it requires an INTJ with a well-developed Fi and an INFJ with a similarly developed Ti. If I'd met my INFJ at any point in my life before quite literally this last year, I would have most likely fucked it up by being too emotionally distant and unaware of my own feelings. So yes, this is the ideal if you can get the stars to align first.
