People are downvoting this (maybe they think itâ€™s not real?), but he literally tweeted this. He says something almost as bafflingly stupid as this on a weekly basis. Seeing his credentials and willingness to engage on the UAP topic I started following him and listening to his podcast appearances earlier this year - after listening to him for a while, he really comes off as a deeply strange, ignorant and unserious person and I think his involvement here will do more harm than good.
