So the women and children raped by alcoholics/drug addicts are not really hurt? The children eating food out of a dumpster behind a Chinese restaurant are not being hurt because their drug addict mother is too busy getting her fix and doesn't have money to feed her kids? Alcoholic and drugs most certainly DOES hurt more than just the one consuming them. As someone who has been thru and seen both of these and much more your statement is insanely ignorant and very hurtful. If you are true in your convictions against beings suffering and getting tortured to death then educate yourself more. Humans are animals too.
