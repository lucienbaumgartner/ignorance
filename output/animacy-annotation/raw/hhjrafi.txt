Chivalry used to be an expression of courtship when men would try to win a woman's heart by acts of gallantry to try and impress her with their value. Acts such as holding doors, carrying things for her or any other "act of service" was done by men to literally demonstrate to a woman his usefulness to her. It was men's way of communicating not just interest but a little subconscious way of saying *"I like you and I want to be of service to you, please give me your affection."* How the fuck was this intention ever perverted by feminists to mean *"I want to own you by being of service to you"* I will never understand. Chivalry is nothing but glorified simping if we are going to be brutally honest here.

**Women have always been considered to have the ultimate power to turn down any man's clumsy advances** [as this quaint 100 year old film demonstrates](https://youtu.be/AufisRXoV5Y). Here you see two rich men attempting to take advantage of a servant girl - she promptly rejects them *without scorn*, and thus the focus of the comedy is the two men who are thus supposed to be considered the buffoons of the film who have to do all their own cleaning like dolts because they offended the girl who was cleaning for them. 

100 years ago watching these men fumble around trying to do "Women's Work" was supposed to send a message that "women's work" is still work, that women should be respected for their labor because even when men get down to doing it **it is not easy**. Hence the clumsy fumbling around. Today instead of acknowledging this productive point of view to get men to respect what women do instead feminists have undermined the whole damned thing by inventing this bullshit of *"feigned incompetence"* where they would instead accuse these fumbling men of intentionally being incompetent in order to get the women to do the work. The feminists that push this narrative of *"feigned incompetence"* are so utterly stupid and ignorant of history that they don't even realize that *feigned incompetence* is what women historically do in order to allow for a man to approach her. 

The classic [dropped handkerchief](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/73232589_100839748029597_2079809214116528128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=973b4a&amp;_nc_ohc=JvwiGD7F_-oAX97rMQt&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&amp;oh=f3cb6df4c8e59ec3c54bd45b7d61e2e7&amp;oe=6197B38D) device where a woman intentionally creates a very minor scene in where a man can swoop in to give her a service, such as picking up her handkerchief for her. More practically women feign incompetence all the time in order to attract a man who feels it's his chance to swoop in and be useful and thus get her attention. Today it is in the form of acting helpless or incompetent from pretending a task is too complicated for her that she needs a mans advice or pretending like a box is too heavy for her to lift. Turning around and claiming it is men who feign incompetence in order to get women to do the work is just completely fucking stupid considering, first of all, that such a man would probably feel very emasculated if he requires that a woman take care of his ass like she was his momma. That is just not the way men think. This is how I know for damned sure that feminists are utterly stupid and just making shit up or more often just projecting their own shit unto men as in this case, because they have zero self awareness. 

&gt;Chivalry is when a man specifically helps a woman specifically, and he wouldn't even glance at a fellow man who needs help."

No. Chivalry used to - key words: *used to* \- be when men would **give a very specific woman very specific attention that he would not give to any other woman**. It was also when men used to extend women a certain special courtesy on the condition of their womanhood, such as not being crass or blunt in front of women and keeping the less savory aspects of their behavior in check when in front of a lady. Nowadays there is zero reason for men to walk on eggshells in front of women because women are free to walk away if a guy is being an ass or too vulgar for her taste. 

As for those old men did it ever occur to you that they are just insecure about their age more than their gender? Old dudes say the same shit to me whenever I try to help them and I am a man, in fact even most old ladies. In today's culture it is considered polite to refuse help because those who are too eager to get help can give off freeloader vibes. 

Also, the refusal for help in women's case is sometimes a shit test. Women will refuse a man's help just to test him to see if he is really going to help her or just shrug and walk away. The only ones who got this song and dance right are older ladies. Whenever I help older women with anything they never give me any bullshit about it, instead they show gratitude and thanks as soon as I give them any help. 

It is only younger women who socially awkward goons these days, on par with men, and who can't decide on whether to refuse help just to be polite or accept a man's help and risk giving off the wrong signal that she is interested in more than just being helped or if she should truly refuse all help just to assert her *"I don't need to man"* status. And of course this is entirely assuming that a man would even think to try and help her in the first place since most modern men do not believe in chivalry at all and view it as simping and emasculating.
