I don’t even know where to begin with this. How are you all so balls deep in your own biases that you’re admitting you don’t know anything about this issue, that this was your introduction to material facts about the royal family, but are hailing this as a murder? Calling someone a “pillhead” is hardly pwnage. It’s presumptive, and especially with the line about the life expectancy, is using someone being from a deprived town as a reason to disregard their credibility. Wow, what a sick line there. As if the deprivation of the town is the fault of its inhabitants.

Fuck this “murder”, and especially fuck all you complete arseholes that are so flagrantly unaware and ignorant that you announce that the comment was “informative” or new information to you, and still praise it anyway. Check your fucking sources at the very least before you wank all over this utter shite.
