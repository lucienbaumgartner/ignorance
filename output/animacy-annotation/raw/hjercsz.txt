We are talking about the same thing. I once approached a coworker about doing some personal contract work. They knew I was considering other options and I would let them know. When I decided to go with someone else, they went off the rails. HR and eventually law-enforcement had to get involved. My situation was extreme, but a very clear example of how people respond to being offended. Most people are a lot more subtle in how they manage their emotions obviously. I was young and unaware of the signs and ramifications. It was my mistake but a good lesson.
