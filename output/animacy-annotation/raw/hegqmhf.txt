Just want to let you know you are crying and constantly anxious because your subconscious is painfully aware that this man is not treating you the way you deserve. 
It honestly sounds to me like he is just not that into you. When we truly love someone we make time for them, we donâ€™t invalidate their feelings, and we acknowledge and make an effort to respect the things that they respect (birthdays). 
You are probably young and unaware of this, but there are people out there who have no moral compass and will not bat an eye at staying with someone for whatever selfish reason despite not actually wanting to be with them or wanting to treat them well. 
Cut his ass off and find a partner who will respect you.
