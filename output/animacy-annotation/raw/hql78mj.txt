&gt;Calling those who have had the COVID vaccine ignorant and irrational, is ignorant and irrational in my opinion.

I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm by no means calling those who got the vaccine ignorant and irrational. There's a large portion of the country where even I believe that its absolutely the right call to get the vaccine, given the data.   


What I said was that if you are currently vaccinated and **still** scared of covid, you are ignorant and irrational. The reason being, the vaccine works to make covid mild. I have people that I work with that are triple vaxxed and still double mask and are afraid to go to the store. That's nuts imo.
