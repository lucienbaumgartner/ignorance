Don't overthink these things is my advice - seems like there is pressure to last a long time but that shouldn't be your one and only goal in sex, it is very narrow minded.

During my first sexual experiences I'd usually come very quickly, especially with penetrative sex but this was back in the 90's before internet porn and I was quite innocent and unaware of the "necessity" to last a long time and didn't think that way. In fact I had no idea how long sex was "supposed" to last.

I clearly remember one of my first sexual experiences - I was just about to put it in but once the tip neared the target, I was so overcome with excitement I blew my load straight away. I didn't feel the need to apologise, I said something along the lines of "you are so sexy you've made me cum already".

My girlfriend wasn't disappointed either, she felt good about how she'd made me so turned on. And it wasn't game over at that point, put myself inside her and carried on. It wasn't long before I was cumming again. 

We had some of the best sex I've ever experienced, we just worked with each other to make it great, I'd often start with a good licking and fingering session to get her close and then when I did penetrate, she would would play with her clit to bring herself to orgasm quickly which often resulted in us coming at exactly the same time which felt very special.

It wasn't just me that came quickly, sometimes my girlfriend would orgasm the second I put myself inside after a sexy foot and leg massage.

Only as I got older did I start to read and watch media that suggested sex should be more than just the 2-3 minutes of penetration I'd become accustomed to, but by that time the overexcitement of my youth was starting to wear off and I was lasting longer anyway,

Nowadays, I'm still not interested in pounding away mindlessly for 20-30 mins, I find it boring.
