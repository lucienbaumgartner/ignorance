It's an interesting podcast. At the end of the day the majority of people are naive and ignorant of what's going on with crypto, or what it actually is or took to develop (myself included). He saw a shiny token and convinced himself it can change the world. I believe that too but I believe my token is made of metal, while doge is a chocolate Halloween coin.

It's kind of nuts what's going on with finance and post truth psychology these days
