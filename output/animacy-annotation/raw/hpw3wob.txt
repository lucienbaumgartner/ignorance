Jesus fucking christ, are you really one of those "republicans freed the slaves" idiots, literally look at the party switch. Democrats were the party of the south, the conservatives, until recently. Republicans stand for the values that those 1800s democrats stood for. There are arguments (that I don't agree with) but reasoned arguments to some degree for being a conservative, but to make that argument is just distasteful, ignorant, and sad. So maybe you should take an American history lesson and learn a little bit about our political system.
