I appreciate the explanation/comment. Obviously I have seen people post, “ user name checks out,” but I thought it was when a comment was unbelievable but implied to be true and someone took it upon themselves to give credence or to debunk it. So I was confused and unaware of the other meaning, which makes more sense in this case.  I didn’t think they were rude, I was just wondering incorrectly why they were checking the (obvious to me) tongue in cheek comment. There are a ton of Reddit subtleties that I guess I’ll come to learn in time.  Thank you and have a great holiday!
