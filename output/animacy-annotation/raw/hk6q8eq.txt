Not to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to clarify why I think you're moving the goal-posts: you said **"There are no strong kindergarteners"** but then only defended your assertion about 5-year-olds, ignoring that most Kindergarteners turn 6-years-old or older during the school year. You also said **"my best guess is [no 5 year-olds] are even 500."** When I provided evidence that the best Kindergarteners are *way over* 500, you did not take back your original assertion about Kindergarteners, and you assumed, without evidence, that all of those students far, far above 500 were somehow below 500 a few months before. I think there is a plethora of evidence that my statements were completely accurate, whereas yours were pedantic and ignorant of the K-1 championship. 

I suspect that the low number of 5's who have ELO scores is related to the fact that it takes time to achieve an ELO score, and one doesn't enter into tournaments until one is 5, or at the end of the scholastic year.
