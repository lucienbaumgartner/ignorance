My first "love" was at the age of 14 to a young man who ended up being brutally abusive. After moving away from my family to be with him (i couldn't gather why nobody wanted us together) he shattered both of my orbital bones. At this point I returned home with both of my eyes swollen shut and decided that perhaps we just were not meant to be. Fast forward a year past many ups and (mostly) downs, we are living in a tent in the woods so that we can continue in this toxic circus that nobody seems to understand. Something provoked him one night and what I remember is this...
Walking behind him by a fair distance, he turns around and runs full force at me landing his giant foot in my abdomen. I go down and get back up taking several powerful blows in the process, this ends with me in a sleeper hold, after I was unconscious he smashed a giant rock into my head. The damage done was bad....collapsed ribs, ruptured spleen and a subdural hematoma as well as various broken bones in my face. He left me for dead.
When I returned to consciousness I walked out of the woods into a suburban area thinking I was fine physically. My stomach was distended so much that I appeared pregnant. Blood covered me. First responders found me wandering a neighborhood confused and unaware of the extent of my injuries. Fortunately I was able to avoid having my spleen removed because i was unconscious long enough for the blood to impact the wound, they did have to relieve the pressure of the blood in my skull. The left side of my face droops sometimes.
A couple years ago he shot his girlfriend 9 times in their Charlotte, NC apartment with their newborn baby inside, then drove himself to the police station and told them what he did.Hes in prison now. Out of respect for the victim and child who is also a victim in this case I wont say anything more specific than that.
Many years have passed and I no longer have relationships with such a dynamic. If someone abuses you LEAVE.
