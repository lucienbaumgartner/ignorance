In the comment literally directly below you, the man says nothing about my argument, insists that I've been "brainwashed," and goes on to ramble, "You come across as a weak, moody teenager so desperate for a woman's touch that you'll do anything and say anything just to get one of them to notice you.

You're weak. You know it, and I know it."

And the first thing he said to me had no substance, no argument, just a blanket insistence that I was both wrong and unaware of how bad I was for some unspecified reason. So yeah, I called him a dickhead. He deserved it. 

Are you blind? I seriously do not understand why you feel the need to tell me this shit when I'm being inaccurately roasted by an idiot with no position to speak of
