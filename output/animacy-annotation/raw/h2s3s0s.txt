That's why people are staving.  That's why there are droughts happening that are making it look like its going to be a potentially bad growing season for a lot of things.  But you know lets grow more almonds in the desert that is California.  Plants are the answer!  No more efficient food systems in general, which includes meat.  Plants do not have good sources of protein in the supplies that would be needed to feed the world population.  The world doesn't eat grass and straw and the idea that you can just grow something else on that land is naive and ignorant of how farming works.  Just because some math says we grow enough food to feed the world doesn't make it actually true.  Theoretically if it were a perfect universe where everyone was willing to eat exactly the amount of food they need in the raw components of what they need and only that then yes in a fantasy land we're growing the worlds food supply and just not using it.
