Conspiracy minded people know the government is conspiring against us, most of all the CIA.  We also know the CIA has a 600 million dollar contract with Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos who also recently bought up the formerly struggling Washington Post.  The Washington Post also hired John Podesta whose e-mails are possibly the juiciest conspiracy material you could ever ask for, he literally said in an e-mail that they are happy "'producing an Unaware and Compliant Citizenry"  This sub is completely overrun, too many people earning their .02.  

Critical thinkers realize it doesn't make any sense that Russia would be helping Trump get elected when SOS Clinton was the one arranging billions in Uranium sales out the backdoor.
