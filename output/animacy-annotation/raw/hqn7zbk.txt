You’re being silly to reduce your insults to my conspiracy sub involvement. That definitely makes me an easy target on a Reddit thread, but doesn’t define me. It’s your assumptions that I’m selfish, harmful and ignorant that bother me. Not me personally, but me as it represents the reasonable minded human beings in this strange virtual world. Our worth, and contribution in this world cannot and should not be reduced to nothing simply because we have questions, concerns and straight up cynicism towards establishments with lengthy and well documented wrongdoings. Personally speaking, it bums me out to have fellow human beings manipulated to the point of distrusting and disliking one another like this. If we are in fact “all in this together” than that includes me and the millions just like me.
