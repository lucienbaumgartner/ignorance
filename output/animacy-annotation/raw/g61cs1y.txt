It might seem amazing for you or any other person whom likes it but its actually very harmful spiritually and physically for the people consuming it and the people in those persons lives. 

Have you ever witnessed someone having alcohol withdrawals? Its one of the saddest and scariest things I've seen in my life and im 34 years old. I watched my beautiful, intelligent, independent mother drink herself to death by the age of 37. When i say beautiful i am legit meaning turn heads and having tons of jealous women because of that. I grew up without a mother because of alcohol. She passed away when i was 7 years old. 

I remember her being passed out and I couldn't get her awake and we were the only ones home. I was terrified and thought for sure she was dead. She was mean to me on occasion as well and because of being drunk and unaware of what was happening around her she unintentionally let my stepfather molest me at 6 years old. She beat my brother numerous times. Tied him to chairs and would throw picture frames at him and bust his head open. She would put a bottle of dish liquid in his mouth and leave him there for hours. Thats a small example of what she did.

It might seem cool to you and you might think its awesome but I really hope you never have to experience how a true alcoholic has to live. I wish you the best and hope you rethink your choices when you drink next time.
