&gt;what does that even mean? I should give you $5 because its only $5?

Precisely lmao.
It's only $5!!! Expect it's not.

&gt;Imagine thinking your entitled to any product

Imagine defending a multimillion dollar company's shitty planning.
And how am I not entitled to a product that I already put money towards? What?

&gt;There is a supply chain shortage of virtually anything related to microprocessors or electronics.

Yet they still accepted reservations. 
I know about the supply chain issues. Everybody, so why did Valve, a month before release, still expect the supply chain issue to be resolved? 
They're the ones making the orders for materials!


&gt;. I refuse to believe you are actually this stupid/completely oblivious and unaware of whats going on in the world.

I think you should be saying that to Valve, not me lmao.
They were unaware of the supply chain issues up until mid November, not me.
