&gt;Democrats are center-right. Republicans are far-right. Why are you confused about this?

So you agree with me that Democrats are closer to the left than Republicans? Which is what was my original statement was, so I'm not sure why you responded with "No", maybe you are the one confused. 

&gt;Yeah

Once again, ignoring 9/10ths of the things being said with a tangentially related article as some sort of gotcha. The law agrees that Democrats can run the Democratic Party primaries how the Democrats want, that's all that was determined by that court. Not that the Democrats are doing anything to suppress third parties.

Why you trying to deflect so hard instead of answering the question. Why does 90% of America continue to vote for the majority parties if not for them being either ignorant (and that's a lot of people to be ignorant and yet active in the process) or happy enough with that party that they are willing to continue to support it.
