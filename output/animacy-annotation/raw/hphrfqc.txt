The truth is that I understand why these folks are so against the vaccine even though I myself are vaccinated with 2 shots and 1 booster. 

Tbh the American government isn’t trustworthy at all. They’re chasing the bag. They’ve lied multiple times and done some serious shady shit for money for decades upon decades. Everybody knows this already. The entire world knows this. You can’t deny that at all. You can’t trust a single word coming from the American government and it’s mainstream media. That’s the truth. If you tell otherwise then you’re either ignorant and you’re acting stupid imo. 

The thing is. The American government has lied so many times to the public that now when they say something people takes it as lies. So that’s why these people don’t believe in what the government is telling them. 

What I don’t understand is. People have known for years that the mainstream media is deceptive and untrustworthy. So why is it that now all of a sudden when the right says that the MSM is liars you on the left calls them ignorant and stupid? They just protecting themselves from more lies. They really do believe that the government is lying to the them yet again. 

You shouldn’t blame the people on the right. You should blame the American government for lying so much. It’s their fault that tens of millions of Americans automatically assume that they being lied to again by the government. So in some way a lot  of the doubters, **not all**, are actually victims. Victims that had been lied to their entire life.  

I know that I’m going to get downvoted to hell because the butthurt hive mind is aggressive against other opinions but i don’t care. You all are just some pixels on a screen.
