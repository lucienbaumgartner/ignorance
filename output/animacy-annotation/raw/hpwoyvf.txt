[It made WSB go from 2 million following to 11 million. Which gave many a full sense, "trading is easy I should do it too" when reality its not. Its much like the casino, you will win the first few times, then in the end you will lose. Seen a lot in the past year, many just quitted after losing cash.  Not to mention GME thing also helped Wall Street more than it did hurting it. All banks reported high earnings from investment banking, of course theres other factors for it, but reddit did help. Plus the big guys that hold GME when it was like $7 or so made billions, one of them was Michael J Burry (made more than the short of subprime if I recall) who was against the movement.  Edit: Remember the whole Citadel is bad and everyone made fun of them for losing billions? Yeah they made it back, predictable, from the surge of traders thanks to the movement. The movement was really "noobs who don't know banking participated in a movement while pretending to know banking, just take money." Only Wall Street really knew what was going on and who would win. The only best way to hurt Wall Street are taxes, nothing else.

[Yeah I was there for all that, but I don't understand where you're getting all your info from. I don't remember people looking at GME and thinking trading is easy, people were just trying to hop on a short squeeze and make some money. A couple years back when Keith Gill bought his options people actually thought he was a nut job and that he was going to lose it all, but he actually did the research and knew the true value of the company.   Also, how did GME help wall street if it literally bankrupt an entire hedge fund? Archegos fell due to GME and it almost took Melvin Capital out as well. Hedge funds never closed those short positions, any time the price rises they are in the red, the SEC have said so themselves.  I'm not trying to argue or anything but it's interesting to see how people interpret everything that happened. As you can probably already tell GME is about 90% of my portfolio. I believe a short squeeze is possible, but I also just believe in the company. They have paid off all debt, raised half a billion dollars in capital, started opening fulfillment centers, made many other changes within their company, mainly focusing on e-commerce and are currently developing and I believe are very close to launching an NFT market.  It is literally the most manipulated stock in history, but it's a little annoying to see people blow it off as a meme stock or use it as a bad example when it is a rapidly transforming company with a bright future.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpu1fmm/)

[Archegos defunct because of GME? was there some related effect from it that soured VZ?, what Bill Huang (where he had been previously banned from asia trading) had most of his positions tied up in , and he failed to stick to his s/l and management rules until the five banks or so he had options overleverage with, who then had to force him to dump his positions, with the ones that waited and dumped later also suffered billions of dollars in losses alongside him.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpwjyai/)

[No, I’m just sick of seeing these posts made by people who have no idea what they’re talking about. You’re not sticking it to the hedgies and it’s got nothing to do with the 99% sticking it to the 1%. That’s an ignorant and uninformed statement. The ONLY thing affecting AMC’s price is emotion from retail and institutions alike  That statement *could* apply to what DFV uncovered with GME a year ago, but that’s not what’s going on now](/r/pennystocks/comments/rnjv9e/hard_reality/hpt9688/)

[I have a way different mindset…. After living and losing everything in 08/09 I would make a few risky investments that may pay off such as AMC or GME these are not long term plays only risky squeeze plays so I would YOLO @10k. May make millions or lose some. Either keep the cash on hand in TBills or something like Anheuser Bush that is trading low and will do well in the depression that is coming. Cash will be king in a year or two and you will have the opportunity to buy S&amp;P or whatever you want at a great discount.](/r/stocks/comments/ro1kgs/175k_in_cash_how_to_hedge_for_inflation/hpw64kn/)

[Think the most pertinent advise is put your money where it will work hardest (based on actual DD, not at the moment feelings and FOMO).  Will it bounce and recover or is it now priced accurately? That’s the question you have right now.  My personal loss I’m holding is paysafe, where I bought in at 8$, thinking it was undervalued. I still do, so imma wait.  My other is PLTR, I didn’t feel in the next 1-2 years it’s really going anywhere. They’ve had massive growth and massive wins and only gone sideways. It would take an unbelievable event to send that up in that time frame. I cashed out, and bought something with more short term positive catalysts coming up, as well as longer growth outlook (BB, shoot me for loving memes). I don’t even feel comfortable with 2.5 yr DTE options on PLTR based on last years post GME apocalypse event. (Only viable strategy IMO would have been to buy and hold and trade volatility/ theta decay).  I’m still long term bullish on PLTR success, but I’m here to make money (short and long), it’s just it’s catalyst immune right now.  /rambling over   Happy holidays all… if you have days off.](/r/stocks/comments/rnqij1/how_do_you_deal_with_being_down_30_or_more_on/hputc4n/)

[Well it's a bit of an argument to be had there. Are you saying GME will go sub 20$ again? I really doubt it. To the point I could almost guarantee it won't. A new owner who has created a high value company before, a new staff taken from the competition, surely Amazon executives wouldn't quit their job unless this was enticing, a new plan that's already being implemented. A billion in free cash, a new fulfillment Centre. What about the company is failing? As we move to the digital world, gamestop is embracing being a tech company vs a game company. Sounds like a bunch of positives. The 600% gain and potential short squeeze is a cherry on top, not the appeal for long term investors.](/r/stocks/comments/rnqij1/how_do_you_deal_with_being_down_30_or_more_on/hpuj0f7/)

That said, when a simple comment on GME gets awarded and massive upvotes it does imply potential brigading from the superstonks folks and raises our alerts (people spending money to push the message).
