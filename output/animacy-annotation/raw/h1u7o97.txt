i understand your hopes for a bright future for the salvadorans, and i wish from all my heart they will prosper. i really do. but i am not sure someone like Bukele is the right one to make that happen. how can a country or a whole region get out of this hellish circle of poverty, violence and authoritarianism by supporting another violient authoritarian? and isnt it even more blind and ignorant of americans to just pump Bukele right now without voicing concerns for the people of El Salvador because they personally gain from it?
