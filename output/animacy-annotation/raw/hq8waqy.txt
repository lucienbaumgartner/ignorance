My bad I was trying to mock the person I replied to.

The comment  THEY replied to wasn't ignorant it was vulgar. 

Then he doubled down and was snarky to the other person that pointed out ignorant and vulgar aren't the same thing ( confidently incorrect) and the word ignorant doesn't mean what they thinks it means ( princess bride)
