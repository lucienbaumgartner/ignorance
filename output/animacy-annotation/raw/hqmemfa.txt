You are irritating, uneducated and your comments to me are unwelcome. Leave me alone.

"Cancelling" doesn't exist. 

Freedom to associate (or not) does, and I am asking you to leave me alone. I don't wish to associate with you.

Freedom of speech exists. I'm not an agent of the government so there is no violation of the first amendment when I tell you to leave me alone. Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. What you are saying to me is so ignorant and uninformed, yet lecturing and condescending, I am telling you that you and your comments are unwelcome. 

Leave me alone, creep.
