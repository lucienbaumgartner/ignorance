Nobody implied it does justify ignoring Saudi involvement.

The point is you completely disregarded the fact that the training camps where the attackers learned the necessary skills and the masterminds that plotted the attack were based in Afghanistan, giving ISAF forces a perfectly legitimate reason to conduct military operations in the country.

We can of course talk about the clerics from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states that helped to fund Al-Qaeda and other terror groups, but stop acting as if there was no reason at all for ISAF forces to enter Afghanistan. It's disingenuous and ignorant of the facts. 

The financiers of 9/11 **were** targeted with sanctions and indictments anyway, so the idea that we "totally ignored" their involvement is patently ridiculous.
