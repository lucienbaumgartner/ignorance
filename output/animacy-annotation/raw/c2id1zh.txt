If a crazy person thinks something happened, even if it's not true they're not *lying* about it. They're just crazy, and unaware that it didn't happen.

Edit: Yes, they're false rape claims, but unless they're proven to be actually knowingly lying for attention, they could be just crazy, like alien abductees. The second one especially sounds like someone with sleep paralysis and hallucinations making her experience a rape dream as something real. If they're crazy, they're false claims, but not rape lies. /pedantic quibble about word choice
