Ok, let me start again, you are correct that you need not collect something to understand what a collection is, but you also aren't able to be an arbiter of what defines a collection versus what isn't, and neither can I, so I respect you saying the fast growth of OP's sets removing it as a qualifier for being able to be called a "collection". However, I think your comparison to those who are car enthusiasts is not apt, because of the difference of price and scope of the hobby. Like, what in your mind defines when someone can be entitled to call their stuff a collection? Who are you to say what has significant meaning to the owner? How do you know the difficulty OP, or anyone, has to go to obtain "bunch of plastic thing"? Also, you claim that a "real collection" is something other than what OP has, so what is this a "fake collection"?

Also, you started your argument by asserting that OP is unclean and unaware of greater world affairs beyond their bedroom just by the perceived slight of him potentially having an unclean door handle, so that's why we're all jumping down your throat. Constructive criticism is always great, but starting off with an ad hominem argument isn't.
