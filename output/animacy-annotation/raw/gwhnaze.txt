Shiny Team in Sword:

- Raffi the Vileplume; rash and capable of taking hits. He's pretty happy and easily excited, but impulsive
- Artemis the Cresselia; docile and somewhat vain. Kind of snooty.
- Steven the Metagross; lonely and capable of taking hits. Quiet but strong.
- Queen Jelly the Jellicent; jolly and alert to sounds. She gets along with everybody.
- Catherine the Tsareena; quiet and proud of her power. She's kind of like Steven, but also can get excited.
- KƒÅne the Tapu Lele; careful and alert to sounds. Weird compared to other Tapu Lele who are more playful and unaware of themselves hurting others.

Main Sword Team:

- Cinderace; jolly and likes to thrash about. Loves to fight.
- Aegislash; lonely and strong willed. She's affectionate, which is unfortunate because she's a sword.
- Flygon; bashful and alert to sounds.
- Rillaboom; adamant and takes plenty of siestas. Lazy but will fight if he wants.
- Inteleon; modest and alert to sounds. Very sneaky but not in a bad way.
- Falinks; brave and cunning. They kind of spend time with themselves but will fight with others when provoked.
- Duraludon; brave and likes to thrash about. It's usually the one provoking Falinks, which is unfortunate since it's weak to them.
