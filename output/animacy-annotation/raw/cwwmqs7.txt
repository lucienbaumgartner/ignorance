Over the years there have been various explanations why the Kryptonians didn't just emigrate and become super. Most commonly, it's some version of the Kryptonians being complacent and unaware that their planet was in any real danger, while everyone there was happy with their life (save a few criminals who got exiled).

Post-Crisis, I remember at one point it was established that Kryptonians would die if they tried to leave the planet, but the El family had a rare genetic mutation that allowed them to do so, but I don't know how long that persisted.
