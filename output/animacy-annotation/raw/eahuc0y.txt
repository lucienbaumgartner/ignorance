This reminds me something... I was driving at night (around 2am) on the highway. I am talking about a 3 lane, high speed highway. I usually drive on the external lane, but due to the time and the fact that i was kinda tired, i decided to go for the right lane, in the middle of a huge curve. As soon as i switch lane, a car passes me on my left (practically where i was) full speed, going the wrong way. It lasted a couple of seconds, i was so surprised i didn't even reacted. A mile later i crossed three police cars looking for that damn fool, pointing them in his direction. They got him, turns out he was heavily drunk and unaware that he was going the wrong way. I still got shivers today.
