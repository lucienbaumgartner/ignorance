It really makes my blood boil seeing all these democrats flat-out lie to protect their new world order and cling to the "unaware and compliant" people who still don't know about what's really going on.  They are manipulative and they know exactly what they are doing, which is horrible. Just imagine how the USA would be thriving if the media was behind this presidency like they were with Obama- the country would simply be unstoppable. But they don't want that, they want to control people because they are power-hungry perverted sickos and they are protecting the establishment and their bosses who want to rule the world (Soros, the Rothschild's, etc). Watching that "Russian interference" hearing just really bothered me because these people are pushing a false narrative. I remember telling my girlfriend before the election "Trump is going to win, but that won't be the end of it. They will try anything they can to stop him and they are always up to something sneaky". First it was the re-count, now they have moved on to blaming Russia and de-legitimizing his presidency. It's frustrating when you predict they are going to and then you watch it happen before your eyes.
