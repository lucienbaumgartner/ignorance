I absolutely think I’m naturally hyperaware and obsessive. I don’t know what illnesses run in my family because they’re super ignorant and ashamed about this stuff, but I see signs of ocd and anxiety In my mom, dad and grandmother. Maybe that is why I thought maybe this is something from birth that gets compounded if we don’t have support.
