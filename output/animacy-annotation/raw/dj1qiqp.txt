I've been a long time subscriber to Tati for almost 4-5 years. Every morning between M-F, I have Tati and my cup of coffee while I prep to go to school or work. She wasn't only just a youtuber in my book, she felt like family that I looked up to. Like an older sister who was so knowledgeable about makeup wanted to teach and guide me through what was "Hot or Not."

As time passed, I noticed how unaware and ignorant she can be at times. There were times she would acknowledge her mistakes, other moments where she would turn a blind eye. I was already so invested in her because she was part of my routine, and I naively told myself that she'll change, learn, and grow. After my latest issues with her trying to get to a younger audience with the attitude change, and this video with J*, I feel like it's time to severe ties with Tati. I know that she says "fuck the haters," but I hope that she knew that a lot of us viewed her as family. She was part of my internet family, and it's more that just unsubscribing to me. It's like I'm forcing myself to estrange from someone that I loved dearly because they don't understand you, and choose to not listen to your struggles or opinions even though you've been supporting them through and through.

I never knew unsubscribing to someone can be so stupidly emotional. God damn it.

(srs I get being disappointed an all, but why a fucking Nicholas Sparks novel? Christ.)
