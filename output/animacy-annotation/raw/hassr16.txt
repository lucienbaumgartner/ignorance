My mother did something similar to me at a congregation picnic. Do they even have those anymore? I'd walked around some trees near a stream with a boy about 5 years older than me, we were both teens and not in the slightest interested in each other in that way. She heard I walked off with him and assumed the worst. Tore my clothes screamed and hit me in front of everyone. I said I hadn't done anything wrong, she screamed show me your panties and prove it. In front of everyone. I was young and ignorant of these things so I didn't even understand what she meant by that. As usual my father did and said nothing because he never went against her. Ever.

Thanks to her public tirade people in that congregation figured I must be really bad association, because why else would my mother act that way unless I was doing really bad things. So I had no association. 
Thanks BITCH.
