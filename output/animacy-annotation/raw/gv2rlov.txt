Better than not knowing what possible damage you could have done, or living in pain. I understand that getting treatment can be difficult but you absolutely do not have to take any medications you don't want to, even if they recommend it. They will also support you in sticking to whatever treatments you agree on.

I was also so afraid to go to the doctor because I was afraid there was something very wrong with me and I just didn't want to hear it, but you can't hear good news if you don't risk possible bad news. Always remember there's a chance things might just be better than you think; and even if it's not, at least you won't be alone and ignorant of it. 

Good luck to you whatever you do üëç
