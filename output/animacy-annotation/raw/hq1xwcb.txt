&gt; I think it’s almost disrespectful when people keep claiming it wasn’t suicide. 

Nicely put. I felt similarly with the Elisa Lam case. Society was so ignorant and stigmatizing of mental illness at the time that people were more frequently entertaining ideas of ghosts and possession than of a mental breakdown and the seriousness of stopping medication for mental illnesses. I feel like we've progressed since Elisa and Maura that we can talk about these things more freely and take seriously the threat that mental breaks and unwellness pose to our loved ones and hopefully that means more people will get the help they need sooner. I do think society as a whole--even those close to someone struggling with bad mental health--still don't fully understand how serious and nonsensical a bad mental health episode can be. I think there's this concept of suicide that it's ALWAYS something one makes a binding commitment to and plans for. Or they underestimate what kind of really serious harm a person that's having a break can bring to themselves, whether accidentally, intentionally or even indirectly (i.e. pissing off or scaring someone so much that they hurt you).
