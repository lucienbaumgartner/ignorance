I find it super obnoxious when people use rape and other atrocities to justify being an asshole. My heart goes out to anyone who has to deal with it. But you get she’s literally wrong, right? Objectively? No opinion involved? Why do you think, just because “men” do bad things, you also should do those bad things? Like generalize an entire gender? It’s just ignorant. Eye for an eye makes the world blind. If there are men out there that want to generalize women, or generally behave toxically, let them. Why stoop to their level? Why is every defense you have for being miserable and ignorant, that men are bad? Get the fuck outta here with this toxicity
