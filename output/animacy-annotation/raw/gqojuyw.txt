My mum is Scottish and I can assure the difference in teeth has nothing to do with dental hygiene.

Americans are obsessed with straight white teeth. Kids get braces young, there’s whitening is big business. When something is a strong beauty standard- the population with work harder to achieve it.

When big butts are a beauty standard, you see ppl working towards that. When pale or tan skin is, ppl follow suit. 

Bright white, perfectly aligned teeth is only becoming a global beauty standard due to American influence.

The colour of the teeth has a lot to do with the amount of tea adult Britons drink. You would notice children’s teeth are less stained. Also the paler the complexion, the yellower the teeth appear. It’s why they often use darker completed people with bright lips in tooth related ads.

These kinds of assumptions are why Americans get labeled ignorant and unaware of anyone outside themselves.
