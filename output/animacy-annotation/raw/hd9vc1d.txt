Technically no one is 'white' as white isn't a place, so doesn't have a shared collective culture. People who claim it does are racist and ignorant of the cultural differences between "white" countries. See Russia and America, or Australia and France, or Britain and Hungary... "Whiteness" can't be a culture when there's nothing shared between these geography and culturally separate places.
