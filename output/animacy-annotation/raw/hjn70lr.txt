&gt;	No, the point is you have to die with debt so that your assets get a stepped up basis rather than taxed when transferred to your heirs. 

Completely wrong and ignorant of probate law. The estate can't convey until your debts are settled, which means the loans are paid back from asset sales *before* the basis steps up, which means full capital gains taxes are paid.

&gt;	The bank gets additional 'debt owed', which is a positive balance in their books. 

So is having cash. Obviously banks are in the lending business, but that only works because they get paid back.

It's only a "debt owed" *if you're going to pay it back.* If you're never going to pay it back it's an operating loss, not a credit. So it has to be paid back. And it is - from taxable asset sales, either now or at some point in the future.

&gt;	The only 'loser' is the government in the sense that they won't see any taxes from billionaire personal consumption

But they will see taxes, both sales and other excise taxes *and* taxes from capital gains when the assets are sold to pay back the loans, which can't *not* happen.

&gt;	You don't even need to be wealthy to access a form of collateralized lending.

Indeed! Collateralized lending is available to everyone, as is *uncollateralized* lending in the form of credit cards and student loans. It's hardly a "billionaire trick" to get someone to lend you money to pay for your lifestyle consumption, it's just really stupid.

&gt;	You can borrow $10m a year to do whatever you like with and still have $0 in recognized income

Well, yes. Because you *do* have $0 income. Like, you're describing a situation where your income is literally zero dollars.

Most people would like their income to be a lot higher than zero. That's hardly an *enviable position.*
