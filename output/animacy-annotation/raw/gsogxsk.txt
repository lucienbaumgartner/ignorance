I understand your pain and the behavior of that manager is just on the same level as an animal, just stupid and ignorant.

That being said, we can't change how our society thinks about selling sexuality. It's not the most prestigous and honorable thing to do, from the viewpoint of even most people in the world probably.

Thank you for telling your story, it was interesting.
