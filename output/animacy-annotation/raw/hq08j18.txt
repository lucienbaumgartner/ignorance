Realistically though, it's still the same dynamic. A lot of the times, in abusive relationships, the woman feeling like she can't live financially without the support of their abusive spouse, is a large part of the reason they stick around. It doesn't matter your tax bracket. You could be broke as fuck, in a trailer park, and still hold that power dynamic over someone. To dismiss that is pretty ignorant and close minded. I make $25 an hour, my fiancee $14, and even thinking about trying to pay the bills without her extra income is a very stressful thought. Think about being the person making half the wage of their spouse and their spouse using that leverage against them in an abusive way. Then think if you don't have any friends or family to fall back on. People legit can feel trapped. What do you do? You honestly don't think money is sometimes the reason why people stay? Grow the fuck up.
