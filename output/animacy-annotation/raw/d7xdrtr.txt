**Please** do this, everybody who has sons or is going to. Take it as seriously as the talks you give your daughters.

My rape occurred in early adulthood, but in retrospect, the danger signs that night were all over the place. I didn't recognize any of them. Nobody had told me what they were. I walked straight into that situation, wide-eyed and unaware, and my ignorance did not turn out to be bliss. My perp was a serial sex offender, so he had years of experience and might have succeeded in his objective in any event, but I made it very easy for him.

One of the principal reasons that so many sex offenses against men and boys occur is because we're completely clueless about the very real dangers that exist. Male rape and sexual assault do not make up the majority of cases by any means, but they're extremely common just the same.

Talk to your sons about this. More than once. A single conversation isn't enough.
