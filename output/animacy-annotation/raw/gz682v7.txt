Fair enough, but I do think a very large number of people who consume and express anti-vaxxer beliefs are simply people who are very afraid and unaware that their ignorance of a topic is not a good basis for strong beliefs. 

I believe many people who might hold vaccine fears or anti-vax sentiments do not reply in threads like this for fear of ridicule. The most opinionated people voice their opinions publicly, and those opinions are ridiculed but without research it just looks like a standard internet argument. 

My hope is that with research and evidence included in responses to misinformation that the people who are simply lurking will be effectively inoculated against misinformation. 

Have a great day!
