&gt;She has an opinion that many people share, just like you do. 

We're talking about a fundamental respect for how people live their lives and experience their identities, *which harms no one else*. 

You're right it's not "black and white", in the sense that you can treat it as a neutral nonissue, you can be mildly opinionated, or rabidly pro-trans or trans yourself, and those are all okay, but being *against trans people being able to live their lives as the gender they identify as* is an ignorant and damaging position. I don't cede any ground to any position that diminishes the rights and respect of trans folks.
