Go to r/politics or r/economy and it’s nothing but pure hate. It’s not political bias or political jabs it’s legit dehumanization. Conservatives are uneducated and unaware of their impact on the environment. There is a genocidal undertone in all of the major subreddits. Anyone that questions the vaccinations shouldn’t just be alienated but rounded up and killed type stuff. It’s got to get to an inflection point. Something has got to give and they’re the only ones talking about harming people for having a different political view.
