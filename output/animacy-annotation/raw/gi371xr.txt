Sometimes when people mention my weight I feel like asking, “Why do you care”?

This is the year that I’m trying to get rid of my disordered eating for good.  I relapsed once yesterday and weighed myself and saw that I was up 2lbs which is probably water weight.  My day was ruined yesterday because of the scale.  Today, I went back to not weighing myself again.  Also, I’m trying so hard not to count calories.  

I have been restricting and watching what I eat since age 10.  People have been commenting on my weight since age 5.  Both of my grandmas and my parents and some of my aunties used to tease me as a small child for being “fat”.  I started puberty at an early age and also received negative comments for that.  By the age of 9 I felt so much shame, disgust, and disappointment about my body.  

I am at the point where I am sick and fed up with body comments.  People have commented on my weight when I’ve gained just 2-5lbs from my period.  It’s damn annoying.  Honesty, I never ever mention my weight, diet, and size to others.   Ever.  Even as a small child I was so innocent and unaware of my body until ignorant adults pointed it out.  I just want to live life and be happy without negativity about my body.

Thank you all for the advice.  I’m really appreciate it.
