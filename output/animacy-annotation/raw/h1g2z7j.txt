Ages ago, my grandmother had told me stories about people who lived their entire lives in a 3 or 4 block radius. Like everything they needed to survive was right there in their neighborhood.

As a result, they were known to be xenophobic, tribalistic and ignorant of even simple things 8 blocks from their homes.

We're seeing a very similar phenomenon.  Most of the people we hear and see online railing against even the most logical changes and policies , are simply too wrapped up in their worldview bubble... and fed copious amounts of propaganda that they can't understand why their views are considered askew.
