Well written, I completely agree. Been getting "help" for 4-5 years and I'm still not living a normal life, in fact I'm worse to when I was ignorant and unaware of my mental health. I am the worst I've ever been in my fucking life. Tried 10-15 meds and nothing works, and if it does it stops working or the side effects are too painful like nausea. It's like once I found out I was fucked up my life just went right down the shitter. I was forced to face my demons and I HAVE NOT improved or had relief. I'm not happy with the mental health field, I'll just say that.
