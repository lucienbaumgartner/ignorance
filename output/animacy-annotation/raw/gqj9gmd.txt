My personal belief is that bringing an unwanted child into the world is immoral and irresponsible. To me idea that every fertilized egg deserves a chance at life is selfish and ignorant of reality. 

Children need stable, loving environments in order to thrive. If my mother hadn't wanted me, I would have preferred that she choose abortion.
