Because some people abuse the "iT's tHE WiLd WeST" or "i pLAY hOW i wAnT" excuses just to be dicks in an online game.

Dicks who blow your wagon (no problem with that) but when you leave they chase you down and constantly kill you until you hit parley.

Dicks who join the train event where you are supposed to shoot the bandits and protect the goods (it literally says that) but they won't stop lassoing other players or blocking the train's path, preventing players from completing the event.

Dicks who join the protect the animal event and throw dinamite sticks at the beast so nobody gets a reward at the end.

Dicks who see an unaware and unprepared fishing player  and shoot at him with a carcano from the distance just for chuckles and jiggles.

Dicks.
