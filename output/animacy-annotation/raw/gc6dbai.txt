I honestly don't really believe this person. Sounds like a junior whining about how superior they are to the seniors without really understanding why something is the way it is. Incredibly common (and I was guilty of this to a degree as well). The general attitude and the insults tell the story for me. Maybe what they're saying is 100% true but experience tells me they're near the beginning of that Dunning-Kruger graph. Not calling them dumb or anything, just unaware and too eager to criticize (and get that sweet karma).
