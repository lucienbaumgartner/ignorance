I don't understand why you put this rant on gender that nobody asked only then to shut anything that doesn't echo your opinion out the door. 

My one and only point is that I am against the idea of assuming that gender is \_only\_ a social construct is flawed and ignorant of biology and psychology. But like I said at the beginning, going further would lead nowhere. 

I still am not sure why you even decided to start a dissertation of gender only to then shut any opinion that clashes with your own.

&gt;I am not looking for your input on gender as a social construct

Nor was I looking for a defense on something I didn't attack, I only implied I disagreed with it. At least I can get out of the way and not continue this, but I do like pointing out the hypocrisy of ranting your opinion and then shutting out any discussion.
