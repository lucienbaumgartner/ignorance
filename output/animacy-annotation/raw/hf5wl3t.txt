The argument has been had a dozen times before, and I've already made points a dozen times in the last two months that prove that this logic is false and ignorant of the truth

I'm not inclined to repeat it all in a big long post, friendo, but I'll shorten it to "invasions should be fun and engaging for both sides". DS3 invasions already reached the point that you can't viably win against psuedo competent players when you're outnumbered (I dare you to go to Backyard and see how fucking dead it is because the ganking drove everyone into the arena) and it's just not a reasonable argument to expect players to learn how to invade when you need a invasion specced build to even stand a particularly good chance. 

If we are entering a new game with the same general mechanics as 3 but it's now faster, it will force an even more stagnant meta that focuses on instantly killing the host to assure victory, and that creates a situation where both sides are not going to enjoy the experience. I would much rather a situation where invaders are free to invade with whatever build they want, then needing to be a parry king with strong running lights and the same four rings to have any reasonable chance of success.
