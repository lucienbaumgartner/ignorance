Its not about hating, I just being respectful of a religion, even some foreigners come and try to hug and take selfies with lord buddha statues at relic temples and that's very disrespectful that they will be taken off premises and banned from visiting the place. It's common sense to behave in a respectful decent manner, you don't go hugging and jumping on alters when you go to a church and putting on Jesus  masks. I just think people should just be more mindful of basic human decency like these and just not do things like that cuz you know you asking for trouble when you put on religious masks and start acting around, so I understand why a lot of people might have been offended and very disappointed. Not hating on them, they are overall good people and very talented,  just think it was a very childish and ignorant of the idol to do that, anyways hope they learned from their mistake and it never happens again. Wish them best of luck on their future works.
