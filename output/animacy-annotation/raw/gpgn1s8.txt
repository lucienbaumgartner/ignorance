This isn't the first time that in-universe rules have been cited to excuse out-of-universe actions. Yes, the lore was written to be internally consistent. If it hadn't been, it wouldn't be successful. People are good at sussing out lazy, inconsistent writing. We'd think Tolkien a hack if the orcs had been written as nice people but then constantly did evil things. Of *course* there's a logical reason in the setting for them to act the way they do.

My point is that *Tolkien* decided to write the entire species as evil. Or, really, more that *game designers* for the last *fifty years* have elected to continue that pattern, making the default members of monster races unabashedly evil, all while dressing them in the trappings reminiscent of, remaining vague in the interest of keeping real-world politics to a minimum here, Certain Groups of People in the real world.

Why do Orcs have chieftains or, especially, khans? Why are the Good races always the civilized ones living in nice European (or, in some cases, tropey Japanese or Arabic) villages? Why are the Evil races always the ones in straw huts and caves? Why are these analogues somehow permissible to so many?

Honest to God I feel like *I'm* caught in a trap here, pointing out that RPG world design has been for generations lazy and ignorant of how it analogizes evil in-universe societies and cultures with very real Earth societies and cultures. The LG lunatic shouting at the CN masses who just want him to shut up.
