I agree, except for one thing. The reason WHY the word monkey is used in idioms, or better the imagery has a huge overlap with how racists view black people.
The imagery is excessively used by racists, in and outside of the context of idioms. But, you are correct, by far not exclusively in that way.

So from that clarification while it is faulty to project from such a term to racism automatically, given in the context it is also more than "just a gaffe" that this imagery is chosen. The problem with people is that they have freudian slips, where the equally usable "muck it up" gets transposed when reaching the m.

The very least this shows is that he is entirely unaware and inconsiderate towards checking the obvious context in which his words will be judged.
