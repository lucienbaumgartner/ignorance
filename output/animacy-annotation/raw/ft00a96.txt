It depends on what your Dad thinks a home server is. If he thinks it is a place to store files on and host websites, Minecraft, gaming, and media servers, then yes, he has the right idea. If he thinks it is a magical box that magically boosts your internet speed, then he is completely wrong and woefully unaware and what a server is.
