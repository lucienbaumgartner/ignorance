I am glad you found your way out.I know that couple of my friends are still struggling because they are not ready to accept that some of their closest people in their lives are so rigid and ignorant that are willing to abandon my friends simply because of this.Oh the women serve the men part you mean? I have had dealt with that all my years back in Iran.I was like my virginity doesnt define my worth.I will just have sex to piss off God.If a God will punish me for enjoying what he has given me then screw him!Things are changing there but still all very male dominated country with religion enshrined in constitution.At least in the west we get liberty ensured by law.
