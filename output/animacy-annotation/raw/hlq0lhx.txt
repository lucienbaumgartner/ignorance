Broooo are you kidding me right now? Ok fine, here's you fucking screen shots with, how many things saying THEY FUCKING EXPIRE??? 

[14 ITEMS, DUMB FUCK. vS 2 THAT DONT. ] (https://i.imgur.com/nyWKXzt.png) Get your head out of your ass.

&gt;over something this critical.

my god, its not fucking critical, what's critical is you getting your head out of your ass and stop making excuses for people who are abject idiots, including yourself. If YOU had been playing when the event started, you would of read that all the items will no longer be usable after the event ends, mr. "So how new of a player are you?". 

Let's be honest with ourselves, the fact they expire has *little* to do with why you keep engaging with me, you made yourself look a fool and wont back down until you think you've "won" when in reality you dont have the reading comprehension or critical thinking to just accept that oasis is ending and the items wont be usable. 

Trying to pretend that you're here to set me straight or help me with your diagnosis is just sad man. Accept the event is over, understand you're making an argument from a position of simply being incorrect and ignorant of how the game and real life operates.
