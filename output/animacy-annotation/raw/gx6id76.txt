Be who you wanna be! Your hair is your own, nobody can tell you you're wearing it the wrong way. I know she doesn't see it that way, but the things your sister is saying really aren't any different from white supremacists who say other races "shouldn't do white people things". It's toxic and ignorant of her to control you like that.
