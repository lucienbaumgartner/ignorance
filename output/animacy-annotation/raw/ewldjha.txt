What do you think fire making is? 

plus.. your alternative of "we are naturally adapted" only results in much high higher death ratios. You don't even need to look at the past, any current society that has weaker infrastructure, in many cases even pre-industrial, you always find the same outcome: lower life expectancy, more impacts from catastrophic climatic events, less defense to disease.. etc etc

Climate change is a serious problem. Not something we will just adapt to by walking around with less clothes or by moving into the degraded nature of the developed countries. That solution is so privileged and ignorant that is even painful to read.
