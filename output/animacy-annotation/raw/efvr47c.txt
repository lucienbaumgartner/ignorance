Jeeze thats a lot.  

&gt; On What Causes Us to Leave the Faith

THe first cause they point out is misunderstanding context (surprise surprise), and turing our belief into a house of cards that tumble if one is removed.  The example is the literal 6 day creation, if that is shown to be false then everything else must be too.  I think this is an oversimplification and a rather insulting one since he admits many former students and leaders in the faith are among the apostates.  There may be some but most of us end up challenging what we were told it says by actually going to the source and reading what it says and studying it.  This is very close to "ExChristians only leave because of what a particular church or christian did," we're not that dumb.

&gt; In reality they were only rejecting a doctrinally bloated take on Christianity they mistook for the real thing.

See?  Insulting.  Such a thing may have put us on the path of doubt, but you never end up at the end of a journey after the first step.

&gt;  I couldn’t agree more.  I regularly encounter people who left the church because of particular beliefs or practices that are far from what I would call mere Christianity.

Ugh, get a room you two.

&gt; The second factor is unmet expectations. 

Again, same with the first, that may be a factor to get us on the doubt train, but it is always a long journey.

&gt; One of the most common expectations that deconverts have is that the Bible is completely error free. And not just that it is inerrant but that it must be inerrant or else it cannot be the word of God. Somewhere along the way they were told that in order for the Bible to be the word of God it had to be free of error.

Jee I wonder where we could have gotten that fro...OH YEAH THE BIBLE.  There is some interesting metal gymnastics going on here to try and reinterpret what it says, the very thing they are accusing us of doing "incorrectly."  

&gt; The third factor is that we have not done a good job of communicating the content of the faith in what Charles Taylor calls “A Secular Age”. 

This is annoying.  First he says that we leave because of what someone says that is an incorrect assumption or interpretation of the Bible, so the fix is to offer a correct assumption or interpretation of the Bible based upon what they believe it is.  All of it is subjective...unless its what they say, then that is objective.  Par for the course of apologetics - they are correct and everyone else is incorrect because they accept it so everyone else must too.  They just cannot fathom why what works for them doesnt work for everyone else.

&gt; Solution to Christians Leaving Faith Pt.1

Blah blah blah - they need to be indoctrinated with the correct interpritation, which is theirs obviously.

&gt; To illustrate your first point, some research suggests that autism is positively correlated with a tendency toward atheism.

Wooooowww.... Really?  I get what he is trying to support about a social system playing a role which it does to some degree, but then to throw out what is essentually considered a "defect" as the cause for atheism is another insult saying we are mentally deffective to not be a Christian... Im getting angry.

&gt; as far as correct belief is concerned

There it is, they are correct, and everyone else isnt. Why?  Because they believe so.  You cant convince these people of it any other way.

&gt; There is more to being a Christian, however, than just being saved.

No shit Sherlock.

&gt; There is also the matter of what the Christian community has identified as the boundary markers for correct belief.

Pot calling kettle black....there is a lot of that here, that the solution is to make sure we all understand the "correct" version and that would solve everything.

&gt; No doubt some would say that a biblical conception of God is precisely what brought them to the place where they could not believe in him anymore. As tragic as I think that is, at least they are rejecting the God of the Bible, not the God of their ill-formed theology. 

Wait...soemthing I agree with, is he going to make a valid point that...

&gt; s I mentioned previously, many deconverts reveal in their deconversion stories that the catalyst for leaving the faith came as a result of being disappointed with God, or at least the concept they had of him.

Nope.  Fuck.  Its not being "disappointed" with god or the concept of it, it is not finding anything worth while or realistic to accept the claims of it existing.  Sure the god of the Bible is an asshole and douchebag, but that doesn't negate the existence of such a being - I know many humans who fit that bill.  **We arent Misotheists.**

&gt; In reality though, they had a significantly unbiblical conception of God

You assume to much.

&gt; Yes, if people think that this life is simply about being as happy as one can be, they are bound to be disappointed. From a Christian perspective, the primary focus of this life is about becoming holy not merely happy.

This is a common theme with apologists, they assume that we think that nothing bad should happen or that Christians should be perfect and coming to the realization that isnt true makes us reject the dogma.  No.  The Bible says nothing of the sort, and many of us are far more knowledgeable about that text then they are.

&gt; I understand there are former believers who did have a more or less biblical conception of God and no longer believe in him for various reasons, some moral, some intellectual, some existential.

Wait is he going to admit that he was wrong about...

&gt; But deconversion narratives reveal that for many that was not the case. 

**Jesus Fucking Christ** who the hell is he speaking to?  In most cases that is *exactly* the case.

&gt; Instead of rejecting the God of the Bible, they rejected a distorted version of him. 

They seriously cannot accept that some people just dont accept bullshit as gold.

&gt; Back in the 1980s, I was a big fan of the Christian heavy metal band Stryper. And in one of their songs, “Reason for the Season,” they actually sang, “Everyday can be a holiday when he is with you.” Um, don’t tell that to Job!

...wait did he seriously just say music is a contributing factor for... *sigh*

&gt; The solution to Christians becoming atheists (Part 2)

Ok, 2/3 through... I can do this...

&gt; Former believers sometimes explain it as analogous to an adult trying to believe in Santa Claus.

In some ways yes, in others no.  We dont start wars and live our lives around who is right, Santa or Krampus.  Fundamentally though both a myths with no basis in reality from an empirical aspect.

&gt;  It’s easy for kids to believe in Santa because their understanding of the world is so primitive and ignorant that the Santa story can fit within it without much difficulty.

Similar to how our ancestors who primitive and ignorant in many aspect of reality? Hmm...

&gt; Somewhere between 6 – 10 years of age, the idea of an overweight man sliding down all the chimneys of the world in one night, with a sack of presents begins to feel suspect. 

Because no one in reality can do that, the math doesnt add up, and there is evidence that he is not the culprit of the deeds he is said to perform... wait how is this different from religion again?

At least he does admit they are similar as far as the process goes.

&gt; First, we need to do a better job of doing apologetics.

Well, you're doing a terrible job as it is, so try harder?

&gt; So much internet apologetics and even published works at the popular level are unhelpful.

Well at least he admits it.

&gt; Individuals who leave the faith should be leaving because they found the best of Christian thinking to be lacking, not because a self-styled apologist let them down. 

Again, that is *exactly* what happened, who the fuck did this guy speak to in his research!?

&gt; To counter the negative affective influence of our secular age on faith formation, we need to immerse ourselves in another culture; the church.

Yeah entrench yourself further within an echo chamber that refuses to answer or acknowledge what is happening... great solution. /s

&gt; Do you see that as a danger?... Theoretically I suppose it is. 

Not theoretically, realistically.

&gt; Thanks Randal for taking the time to chat with me. It’s been a pleasure.

If you say so.

**TL;DR: Bullshit.**
