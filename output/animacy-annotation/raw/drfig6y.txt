#I always have a funny feeling about any drug besides weed when getting a couple pills. Especially when it's coming from someone some girl knows. Not being sexist because I've met female drug dealers who were legit as fuck but more girls are unaware and more girls get ripped off and fucked over and never realize it. Mainly because dudes are dicks and like to act like they know more about drugs like it's some wild knowledge that they didn't learn from their older brother or cousin or some shit lol.
