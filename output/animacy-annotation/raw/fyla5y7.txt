It’s tough for sure.  We chose not to test...I preferred to live in a blissfully unaware and hopeful state and just did not want to see a negative test and spiral into negativity.  I think it would have absolutely been a blow to receive negative news on beta date and be unprepared,  but we were fortunate to get positive news and it was a really special memory for my husband and I to receive that “congratulations” call from the nurse and both find out at the same time.  Of course immediately after the call, I ran to take a test because I had to see for myself!  Good luck to you!
