Well my husbands exwife is clinically diagnosed bipolar 2 with traits of narcissistic personality disorder. 

The diagnosis was finally given only after She was forced by two custody court judges to Undergo psychological evaluations and treatments. 

Prior to this, years and years ago, when she and my husband were still married she had one doctor diagnosis her with bipolar so she found a new doctor in different area and acted like she was perfectly normal. 

Those documents came to light during custody hearings after everyone involved was being ordered to sign for release of medical records. 

I knew she was not right from the first few times I met her. How? My own mother whom I haven't been in contact with at all for 20 years or so due to my abusive childhood was bipolar with borderline personality disorder so I had experience with these types. 

My husband never said anything about his exwife being crazy or high conflict all he said was she was "difficult" at times. 

I actually asked him first if she was ever diagnosed and he told me he remembered one time a doctor did but it never went anywhere from there and she remained untreated and ignorant of her own diagnosis because in her words "there's nothing wrong w her it's everyone else"
