Even if people "know" about social issues, they don't really see the world through the eyes of oppressed characters due to the lack of representation of their struggles in mainstream media. That's what they're trying to do. 

Also, I've seen many people here saying that Sam's racial problems are unreliastic, because this isn't true in today's America. Many, many people want to stay ignorant and unaware of the issues and want to believe that everything is fine, so that their perfect bubble doesn't break.
