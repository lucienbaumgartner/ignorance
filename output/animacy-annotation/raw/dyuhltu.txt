You have parents, they took you in. If you did something good or achieved even the littlest thing and you tell them, they will probably be very proud of you. These are the people who could be foolish, unaware and stupid but always with good intentions towards you. How many people in your life can you say the same thing about?

Be grateful for everything they have done for you despite their behaviour. Everybody is flawed. It's highly likely that you have some of their negative traits yourself. Try to give them some love and compassion. Thats what they need, not your criticism. They can't change at this point in their life. 

Try this one day, maybe tomorrow as it's mother's day. Do something nice for them on that day, and for the whole day swallow every harsh thing that you have to say and just be nice. See the effect. 

And you will know what to do.

Edit - I'm living with my parents too. This approach has helped me
