Moderate Dems took the house in 2018 and the White House in 2020. Moderate Dems are competitive in blue and purple districts. Progressives got like one extra seat in a D+28 district and helped paint the party like crazy, police hating communists.

As far as Bernie goes, you can't say he wasn't hostile to people whose support he needed. Twitter has fuck all to do with it; he was just antagonistic, uncompromising, and unaware that he did not have the support he needed. It's not a made-up argument; it's just what happened. Unless Bernie lost because he was too nice or too good of a candidate lol.

As far as progressive success goes, winning 1-2 seats while losing 30 races is not something to be proud of. You only win in the safest of districts and put swing-districts more out of play for Democrats. Socialists will not fucking win in Michigan or Florida, we know that because we saw Sanders get **ABSOLUTELY SLAUGHTERED** in Michigan, and Florida when he wasn't getting the Anti-Clinton vote. 

And Twitter is not real life; which is why online progressives are so confused they keep losing. If you surround yourself with people calling Warren a snake, or Pete a rat, or Kamala a cop, you forget that most people don't feel that way. 

All in all, you sound like a 19-year-old who learned about politics from posts on r/murderedbyaoc. Personally, I think she should try to primary Schumer and see just how popular her ideas are outside of the safest blue districts.
