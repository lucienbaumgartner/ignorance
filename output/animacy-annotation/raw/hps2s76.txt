Lmao is this idiot actually implying black people in africa DIDNT sell the slaves during the trans-atlantic slave trade?

African tribes would sell other africans,who they had captured,as slaves. Thats not just africans,thats how it was on every continent,by every culture,every race. Jfc,this guy is so ignorant and braindead.
