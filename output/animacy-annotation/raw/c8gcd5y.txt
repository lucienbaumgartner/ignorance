Completely disagree with anyone who calls him a "sellout." Macklemore is a person just like you and I and true fans know that he writes honestly about his life and views and is true to himself. He has a hit song about thrift shopping but does that mean he is a sellout if he wears designer clothing? Of course not. Everyone likes nice things but the problem is when consumers are blind and unaware that they are being marketed to, and dont realize that a brand is something that only has value as a result of the company's ability to create a desire for the product. Macklemore does a great job in creating awareness and bringing a sense of consciousness to his fans. I think this doing this ad was a clever move for Macklemore as an independent artist. It actually seems silly on the NBAs part to use a song with an "anti-consumerist" message in their promo video, but ultimately this is great for Macklemore as it helps build his fan base and get his message out there, while also making him a few bucks in the process.
