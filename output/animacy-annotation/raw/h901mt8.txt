What's your point? My point is software meant for different hardware configurations than the original software count as ports. You started getting upset over some PC and console nonsense when really a there's no difference except a console is a standardized gaming PC with no options to upgrade the hardware. I can and have run windows on an Xbox. Point is you're wrong and different gens of consoles are also ports. It's always been that way and you're 100% wrong and ignorant of PC architecture and software design which you accuse me off.
