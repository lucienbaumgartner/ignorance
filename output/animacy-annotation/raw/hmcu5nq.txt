I believe everyone has the power and capability to heal themselves and clear themselves of energy. And the power to revamp their own energy. It’s just a matter of educating ones self and utilizing discernment and intuition. If one is unaware and needing guidance, of course it’s wise and okay to seek out help from energetic healers. There are many types of modalities that are out there to help you. It’s up to you in learning more about your energetic and emotional bodies, and what they are communicating to you about what they need.
