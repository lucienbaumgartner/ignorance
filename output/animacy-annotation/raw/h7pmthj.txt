No. When venomous snakes bite in defense they let go and run away, when a venomous snake bites prey it normally doesn't retreat, it stays at the same distance so it can strike again if it needs to. The cobra in this video if you watch closely, was likely not looking for beef with the cat until the cat swiped at it. Watch in the video how low the cobras head is and how it starts to turn left before the cat swipes, if the cobra was hunting the cat it wouldn't have been so relaxed and unaware of the cats' location.
