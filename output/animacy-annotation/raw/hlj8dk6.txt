Freaking hell, you just reminded me that I’ve been getting so many videos/posts claiming things like “babyganics sunscreen caused behavioral changes in my kid” and then that person shills Rodan fields essential oils. Or “bath and body works lotions are PCOS and thyroid disease in a bottle” while shilling some obscure pyramid scheme. I think the worst offender was this lady claiming all drugstore hair products are bad while shilling monat (has lawsuits for hair loss) in the same breathe!

Just the other day I had my uncle’s super colorist wife try to shill anyway vitamins because “they’re natural.” EVERYTHING is a chemical! Cyanide is natural but you don’t see me ingesting that!  It’s always the super uneducated and ignorant that fear monger while being the biggest hypocrites.
