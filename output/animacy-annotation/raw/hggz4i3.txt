Yeah I saw ðŸ’€ . Honestly didn't wanna comment a high rating at first in case I'd get dragged by some salty person. Like they tried with you.

I've come to realise that people don't want you to say you're attractive especially if you are. Like it's okay for others to say you're attractive but never for you to say it about yourself. Society just doesn't want attractive woman to perceive themselves as being attractive. They'd much rather she perceive herself as being ugly because it's more comfortable for them to know that she's unaware and oblivious of the power her beauty holds.

There's nothing threatening about a beautiful woman who doesn't know the power she possesses. However a beautiful woman who knows that she's beautiful. God forbid that happens! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± . How dare she!!! 

Misery loves company. People with low self esteem can't stand to witness someone with confidence. They can't feel good about themselves so therefore neither should anyone else! They'll do what they can to bring you back down to their level. The Inky reason someone would try to knock someone or something down is if it's above them and out of their reach.
