My kids would/have too, but most won’t face this and there are times when people think they are okay with walking away (many different instances), but guilt ultimately ends that okay feeling.  I’m not going to completely throw out Jeanette, as the writers completely fucked it, as they didn’t portray a sociopath or a psychopath, but yet want to have her suddenly act like one, but it only be one because of the pressures or confirmation.  And now they’re even saying they didn’t hint it at all and she is ultimately a good person, so why are the writers so hell bent on defending her, unless there’s a way she has shown that ultimately the good prevailed against the evil.  And while kids may know they should, should not do something, they still do stuff that ultimately harms someone at times, does it mean they are completely bad or that they made a terrible decision because of whatever reason.  There’s plenty examples of truly amazing kids, doing something that even causes the death of friends, but ultimately they’re not evil, they just are naive and unaware of what real consequences there are.  If Jeanette is just a pure sociopath or psychopath, I wish they’d written it showing her behave as one and stop with their articles about her not being a bad person, but a good one that made a bad decision.  

She didn’t take the money though, even though she could’ve walked with a hefty amount and many would’ve supported her doing so.  And who knows if it was her idea, or her fathers, considering he was losing everything too.
