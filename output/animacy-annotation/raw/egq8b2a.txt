It's so strange to see people get upset that people are upset about this issue. Like, they aren't upset about the issue, they are upset that there is someone upset about the issue. 

"They're just little girls doing gymnastics or yoga."
"This isnt porn, you're overreacting"
"Just a bunch of trolls in the comments, not real"
"This guy just wants money, hes just a youtube actor"
Etc etc

How does one acquire tunnel vision like this? What was their upbringing like? Who are they? Do you know someone that has these same opinions?

I wonder if I were to sit down face to face with these people and have a conversation, would I be able to understand them?

I dont think so. What is wrong with these people? How can one be so self-righteous and ignorant that they believe this is all some type of money grab? That they believe there is nothing here? That youtube in no way should be held accountable?

HOW DO YOU PEOPLE EXIST? What is your logic? Please help me understand.
