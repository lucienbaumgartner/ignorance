It's an interesting but at the same time kind of useless question to ask yourself because being young implicitly means being not experienced and unaware of a lot of stuff. I believe that the love you can experience at that age is of a special kind and well not many are so lucky to had already figured everything out about themselves and life in general so to be able to handle a relationship in the best manner. At that age people usually don't set a lot of boundaries, don't have so many expectations or ulterior motives. It's easy to be in love and to feel a connection when you're so young, it truly seems like you will be together forever. This naivete and openness to the other is pure magic and sadly it doesn't last. If you're lucky enough to be already grow out of all the confusion and egotism of the adolescence then you could experience the best relationships of your life otherwise you probably screw up. Sadly it just the way it is, no one can truly teach this in advance (or maybe they could and even do but you wouldn't listen anyway so)
