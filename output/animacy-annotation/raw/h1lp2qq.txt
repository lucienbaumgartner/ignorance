That is disgusting and ignorant of your family/friends to say and do. It is your identity, you are your own person, and it is your prerogative. You only need come out to someone when you feel ready and safe. They are not you. I am so so sorry. I know it really really doesn't feel like it, but you WILL get through this. You've been strong enough to make it this far, I know you can.
