The average George's World player seems to be naive and unaware that this stuff happens. Yes, this behavior happened back on the old Reddit TS with mods who - guess what? - have since moved on to George's World.

So I am really inclined to believe RangerPL. I've been kicked from the lobby and even during a match while on the opposing team by the old Reddit TS (now George's World) mods, so I'm really not surprised if they still exhibit this behavior.
