How many hours a day do you spend online soaking up this type of bullshit? Are your parents involved in your life giving you any type of guidance? 

People don’t just turn into morons that thing every Trump voter is a Nazi overnight. It’s likely the result of neglect and some sort of trauma. I can’t imagine the mental hoops you’ve had to jump through 

Can you specify what has led you to be so inept and unaware of the world around you?
