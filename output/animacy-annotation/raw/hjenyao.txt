I remember reading that but guess I overlooked what was most significant to you. Being sick takes a toll one you and we typically want others to care for us when we are sick. 

I can't say I know dude well enough to know he genuinely appreciates you, but grief can also cloud perspective. I used heroin for about a decade to numb myself to the pain but even when I wasn't high, I was often still numb and unaware of things happening right in front of me.

Communication, patience and time will help
