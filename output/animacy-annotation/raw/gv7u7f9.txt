To be fair being label bigoted doesn't mean you are a bigot. Me saying you said bigoted things does not inherently mean you are bad.

A bigoted person is unwilling to change. Like a racist being unwilling to change.

Saying some racist or bigoted things, being uneasy, going off your previous life experiences or what you taught is normal.

The point is what makes someone a bad person is unwilling to recognize if people take issue with something you said and are labeling you a bigot for it, perhaps you need to look at why they said that, what you said, and listen to them.

Yes people are reactionary, hell I said you were bigoted. But I don't think you're evil.

I think you are nervous, uncomfortable and have preconceived notions and get nervous about some influence that might be directed towards your child.

At best I would say you are defensive and ignorant of the topic which leads you to say bigoted things.

Reading your other replies its clear you are not doing it in a malicious but cautionary way based on your preconceived notions.

I like to extend benefit of the doubt, but this shit is getting old(not you) every decade a new topic the right decides to fight before we have to drag them back to sanity and force laws upon the state through things like federal changes.

Every decade. Looks like the right is making trans the 2020s trend. Sigh.
