&gt;your remain vote ? lol.

Yes. I voted remain.

&gt;Yea, you're the one who has excellent knowledge of economics. You googled "brexit long term economy impact" copy pasted the first two links, obviously without reading them.

Yeahhhh, no. Of course I googled that to give you a source, because you're too lazy to search for any yourself. I clearly read them because they both mentioned positive growth following a deal with the EU.

&gt;It's severe cunning-kuger effect in your case, not just cognitive dissonance.

&gt;you're painfully stupid and ignorant

That appears to be you. You're just trolling this sub, farming for karma, at times being bigoted, and just throwing around insults. You have no understanding of anything that's going on, to the extent you probably think that corbyn is pro-remain
