Circumstances determine the difference!  If OPs wife is gonna wig out every single time a woman innocently TALKS to OP, then I would DEFINITELY give him a pass!  If OPs wife has a meltdown because some random woman LOOKS at him while he is TOTALLY unaware and oblivious to it then the PROBLEM is OPs wife.  She desperately needs to see a therapist to deal with her jealousy and "trust" issues before OP decides that he's tired of being accused of something he's not even doing... cheating!
