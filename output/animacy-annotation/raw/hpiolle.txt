Hey I appreciate your post. I think your brother who would talk to you that way is being really ignorant and unsupportive. You should totally feel comfortable entering whatever relationships you want. That loving someone would make you feel warm inside is so important, and so much more important than anything anyone says about you or your relationships!! Like honestly it's weird what your brother said in part because of the ages involved but also because of the content of what he said. You shouldn't let that influence your relationships at all! You should feel comfortable to love and be with whoever you want!
