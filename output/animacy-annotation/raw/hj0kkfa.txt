Dude. Saying that to a Muslim guy- no matter what context it is in comes as unaware and a closeted islamophobe. He might lack awareness but he’s 25- in an industry where religion lines are blurred. 

Stereotypes are wrong- and Simba should be aware of it. It’s the same like how he said- you’re a woman if you aren’t a man of your words. 

Being dumb and unaware doesn’t excuse one.
