Building a wall "is ridiculous, ignorant and complete nonsense". I really don't care what you're interested in. But of course your double standard is showing and of course you'll not say anything about the invasion and colonisation of america, because you don't want to face the fact that your forefathers would have been "illegals" too and wouldn't have had any rights whatsoever.. its okay dude I'm used to typical conservative reactions like yours. You just close your eyes and ears when you have no arguments.
