Ok check this out. My position is you’re a lot dumber than you think you are and that you will not argue in good faith. 

Contention 1: I honestly believe you were born sometime after the invasion of Afghanistan. Which means you couldn’t possibly have the law, political expertise nor foreign policy expertise to debate meaningfully, or to argue in good faith why Biden voters are ‘directly responsible’ for the Taliban take over. 

Contention 2: For one to so confidently say: “This is what liberals voted for when they voted Biden.” In the wake of current events they have to be profoundly ignorant or dishonest person to say that. Do you seem to remember Biden saying “when I am President I vow to leave Afghanistan and allow the Taliban to take over.” The thing is that anybody that was alive for 9/11 and aware of the political climate knows that once Afghanistan was invaded and the Taliban was routed that they would return after we left. The only surprise here is it happened so quickly. This was always going to be a shit show, am I directly responsible? Absolutely fucking not. Only a person who is dishonest and ignorant would say that. 

Contention 3: You’re whole “I guess 4 years of orange man bad..” just shows you’re a petty vindictive bitch that got their feelings hurt the last 4 years and has been waiting for a “see orange man not so bad huh!” moment for a while now. 

Contention 4: Your opinions are fickle and implanted by a right wing propaganda machine that’s used to stoke the most impressionable and ignorant of us. That being said I’ve heard it all and it’s all bad.

Now are you going to cross examine me or do you even know how to debate?
