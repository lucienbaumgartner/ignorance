Being in a fraternity has been interesting, but I definitely do not regret it at all. In the past, there have been other gay males, but at the current moment I'm the only person that is out in my fraternity and it has not really been a problem at all. 

Going into college I thought it might be a problem because while my college is liberal, it definitely is more conservative than the average college and thus waited a few months before telling people. When I did tell them, the response was awesome! Everyone was very accepting and I've made some of my best friends in the past year than my entire life and I couldn't be happier. 

When I got in some people threw around homophobic slurs and comments, most likely not because they were homophobic, but because there were unaware and insensitive. However, if they ever said something like that around me, they would apologize immediately. Overall, it has been a great experience and I'm glad to normalize LGBT people to a stereotypical 'alpha male' dominated organizations like fraternities.
