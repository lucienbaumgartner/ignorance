&gt;Counterpoint: wearing a mask isn't simply to protect you from becoming infected, it is also to protect unaware and asymptomatic virus carriers (a non-insignificant percentage of the infected population) from spreading the virus.

This isn't really a counter point, it doesn't change the doctors findings any.  It is definitely something to think about before you don't use a make though.  

Excessive wearing of masks is a issue you should keep in mind.  [At least one person has crashed their car because of it](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/driver-crash-passed-wearing-n95-mask-long-police/story?id=70346532#aoh=15899967749431&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) I'd venture to guess it's probably a good idea to remove it in the car at least.
