I find it very disappointing seeing some friends and people I know commenting on different platforms such as IG of them not believing in Covid because they just want to go to the gym or party etc.  It's been over a year now and people all over the world have been killed or affected by this virus and there are still people who are still so selfish and ignorant that they want to put their own interest over someone else's life.  I mean, how can I still be friends or talk to someone who does this?  

People of Reddit,  I just want to know has a similar experience happened to you and how have you dealt with it?
