I mean yea not completely but he still was which is okay, that is a part of what makes him human. And I absolutely agree with the cure btw, not only that you don't need the brain but even let's say, hypothetically that they did in fact make a cure then the world would still be shit, the fireflies would monopolize it and not to mention a large portion of the world is already turned plus there is no proper way to distribute the cure anyway and so on. Overall imo I would probably do the same as Joel ESPECIALLY since Ellie was unconscious and unaware that she was gonna die, she should AT LEAST have the choice.
