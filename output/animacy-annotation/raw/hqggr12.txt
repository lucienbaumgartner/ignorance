My thing is this - even if you're vaxxed and boosted, you should still mask up outside for the sake of immunocompromised people and be cautious. That simple. If you're doing all that and you catch it, it's not like you were reckless and didn't get vaccinated or touting "FOMG IVARMEKT'N" or Monoclonal Antibodies([which Texas ran out of, BTW ](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/587466-texas-runs-out-of-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-effective-against)) to be defiant rather than being responsible, so I wouldn't be mad at someone in that case. 

*Oh, and the "internet objective" parties can save that whole song and dance where they try to hide their anti-vaxxer argument behind people with legitimate allergies to the vaccine and other actual medical conditions because of a FB-based-quasi-religious argument. At this point, you're just being ignorant and childish.
