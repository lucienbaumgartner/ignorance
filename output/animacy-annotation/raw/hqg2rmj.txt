You state she needs to educate herself and seems ignorant. Then you state it is your belief when people hate and say nasty things they are extremely uneducated. You further say you hope one day she will do better in the future. This leads me as a reader of your comment to believe you think she is nasty, ignorant and uneducated. If I have misunderstood your comment then sincerely I do apologise for coming off as rude. 

You also say she could save herself by donating to a trans cause - but most in the UK are pushing for a narrative she does not support and finds rather dangerous. Yet, she said herself clearly she loves and supports Trans and will match with them if needed. What more can she do when her passion is protecting womens rights? Again, I didn’t see you input another reason for your dislike of her. 

Maybe I should be more diplomatic in my approach but I don’t wish to bend on what I see as very clear Very damaging movement. I believe the way she has been treated is vile and shows the horrendous state of this movement. 

Sometimes it’s difficult to take the passion out of something we find ourselves defending. I will try to be more civil going forward in the future.
