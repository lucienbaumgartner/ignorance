It sucks, but some people have red lines in their judgment of people that can instantly turn someone they really like into someone they refuse to even talk to civilly.  For some, it's a political issue.  For some, a social issue.  And for some truly despicable people, it's religion or ethnicity.

Bigots can be nice people to those they (think they) are not bigoted against.  There are plenty of stories, real and fictional, about people who are virulently antisemitic and unaware that they're extending kindness and warmth to someone who is Jewish.  I'm reminded of a Jewish American friend who endured a party full of people spewing the most antisemitic and anti-American ideas, thinking he was European.   Then he was driven back by someone who assured him that he didn't hate my friend even though he knew he was an American, since at least he wasn't Jewish.)

It's good you didn't lie to protect someone like that just because things seemed good before his bigotry revealed itself.
