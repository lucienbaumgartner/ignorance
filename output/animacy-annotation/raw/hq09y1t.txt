It's strange to me because most vaccinated Republicans seem to still be okay with people not getting it. Here I am seeing a lot of the vaccinated sound like democrats

&gt;Iâ€™m getting the feeling this is part of a Democrat push to try to make Republicans look ignorant and anti-vax.

Most republicans I know are not anti-vax just anti-covid vax
