I thought the same for a long time but after reading about it in so many different cultures, I realized that it was a choice that the women made originally so they could have time for themselves and their daughters. It was more of a personal/sacred time for them but was turned into the 'women are unclean &amp; we can't have them part of society' by ignorant and vengeful men later on. 

And women were like 'Okay, whatever you say buddy... '  lol
