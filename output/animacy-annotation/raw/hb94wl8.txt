So happy this has happened, as an Aussie, I grew up on American media, we all did, so naturally the fearful and ignorant of us always look to the yanks for subtle nudges on what to do, and like clockwork, gps here have seen an increase in people asking for horse medication. You lot are all so predictable. Have you ever thought maybe the thing that causes you to see the world as totally crazy and demented and “out to get you” maybe has some part to do with your own personal inadequacies? Has that crossed your minds once? That it’s actually you? Have you heard of the word introspection? Anyways good luck to ya, I hope you all deal with your own shit in good time, strong individuals make a strong society, and you only get strong when you stop blaming others. Join a soup kitchen, donate, do something good without expecting anything in return, you know, like the bible says? You lot slurp that shit up don’t you? Or at least you say you do, frankly i’m not sure many of you are very honest people. Prove me wrong I guess.
