You might choose to learn about these, but there are absolutely no obligations for others to do so. There are plenty of expats in Shanghai who don’t know anything about how Chinese politics works. By the way, you might think it’s an insult to call me CCP slaves or whatever, but it doesn’t actually work because I don’t care and I don’t even agree with everything my government does. All you did is showing how ignorant and prejudiced you are. You’re absolutely intolerant of anything you don’t like.
