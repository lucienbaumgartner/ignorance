You haven't seen Barcelona matches then. Or Juve. Looking better than your shit companions "have you ever played" - lol. What are you, 12? Stop with the low blow insults. You're trying to use Basketball logic to football. 

Real had the best offense in all of Europe and got second place and a Semi of the CL. And I'm confused why Douglas would be considered the centerpiece of Bar√ßa in your opinion for you to bring this opinion. 

You seem highly dismissive and ignorant of what you're talking about, and you don't want to be convinced. You just want to whine.
