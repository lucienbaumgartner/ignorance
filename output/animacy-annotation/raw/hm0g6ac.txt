I disagree

The comments remind me of King John, completely delusional and ignorant of whats actually happening. Its a recap of s2 from Seraphinas pov, idk why so many people are complaining about it. The need to complain about lack of what the royals did in s1 is nothing but a bias excuse to hate on them due to the recap discussings Johns descent in madness.
