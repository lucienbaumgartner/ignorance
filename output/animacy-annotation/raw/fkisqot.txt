&gt; I come into this world from somewhere, thinking and aware and conscious

On the contrary, we are assembled from an intractable number of elements and molecules obtained from our immediate surroundings, slowly formed in the womb, completely unaware and unconscious. Progressively, consciousness develops as our brain develops. It doesn't appear spontaneously. It's not a "soul" that is suddenly implanted in our being. Our consciousness arises. We don't suddenly awaken fully conscious. We didn't previously exist until we did. So no, we don't "come from somewhere". I don't believe we are "going somewhere" either.

As a conscious being, I am not concerned about ceasing to be conscious. I have plenty of experience with not being conscious. It happens to me every night. It also happened when I was put under for surgery. During these episodes, the conscious being that I am ceased to exist. These were non-events. I didn't suffer in any manner during these episodes when my consciousness did not exist. I do not expect to suffer in any way once my consciousness is gone again tonight while I sleep, whether I awaken or not.
