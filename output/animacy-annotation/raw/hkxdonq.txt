No, they're not at all helpless.

This is what the assassinate rogue ability is. Coup De Grace is meant for more when someone is entirely at your mercy.

In 3.5, the guards would be unaware and flat footed (denied dex to AC) if they haven't noticed you, meaning you could get a full attack off on them (which would probably kill them.)

There's no real facsimile for this kind of depth in 5e, 5e is meant to be easy to play and in spots like this you can definitely feel the rough edges where you want more out of a system that doesn't have more to give.
