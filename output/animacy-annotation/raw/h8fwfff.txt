&gt;actually likes gm cracking down on fan content

# CITATION NEEDED

TTS is going on hiatus voluntarily. To date, I know of exactly **ONE** fan video that was yanked off YouTube and that was due to lewd content that wouldn't have flown under YouTube's own rules, let alone GW's. Otherwise everything is still up and still monetized. I really want to know where all these vast swaths of fan animators getting slapped with C&amp;Ds are at because I keep hearing about GW is cracking down on fan content but all my lore channels have new uploads, I can still watch TTS and WarHams, and I'm getting ready to watch the latest episode of 40k in 40 minutes.

Where is this mythical crack down on fan content? What jewels of fan creation has Games Workshop robbed us of that we are clearly ignorant and unaware of?
