&gt;But moreover, the concept of "sacrifice" is completely lost on the younger generation.

This part is what *really* pisses me off. I'm here now, having been born and raised in the USA, and I sacrificed so fucking much to get where I am now. I went hungry day after day. I got stuck in the deep winter cold for just as long. 

You want to say that only immigrants have dealt with sheer, absolute despairing poverty, then try me on for size, cause motherfucker, I went through hell, and it was cold, muddy and reeked of piss and shit.

And to finally get out of that hell, I had to go through fucking well 5 years to even get my ID so I can get financial aid to get into a community college. *And it took me to get a misdemeanor charge to get noticed by my state government enough to get that fucking ID.*

You're right that the American dream is alive and well, but if you think that it's possible without some help and some goddamned common sense understanding that the people in the US do not have life handed to them on a silver platter. Some of us have it almost as bad as people in war-torn countries, and if you check out some neighborhoods, *actually as bad.*

Both your comment and Ted's "get a job" fuckery are callous and ignorant of the shit some of us in "the greatest country on earth" actually have to live through.
