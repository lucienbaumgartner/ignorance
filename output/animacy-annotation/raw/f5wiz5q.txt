You have to be pretty dumb to not inform yourself, ignore science, and believe the whole world of educated people are just being duped by a conspiracy that you have all figured out. Your doctor is too dumb, that must be it lmao. 

You sound uneducated and ignorant. It's always the uneducated and ignorant that think they know better and think worldwide conspiracies involve thousands / millions of people are surely the most possible answer.
