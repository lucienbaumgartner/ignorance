For my playgroup: Broken car extracts.  
Want to get out quick after a rough dorms fight or a great container fight?  
First person to pay the car usually gets a timer, for the rest its a coin toss.  
Interaction works, money is taken, but the extract doesn't get triggered.  
Highly frustrating.  

Otherwise:  
*desync issues  
*spawns in direct or almost direct view of other spawns  
*Raiders, particularly on reserve behaving completely unpredictably:  
Walk into a raider, standing still with their back turned to you. They seem completely frozen and unaware of you. Sometimes they just ignore you until you shoot, other times they 180 noscope you in the face within a split second. No way to react to or expect that.  

One more thing that is less on the devs, although they could implement a penalty:  
Scav on scav violence. I have a garbage toz with no attachments, a paca vest and a gas mask. I run into a scav and just go about my day. Mikael Robokop over there decides that this is the loot he's been dreaming of his entire life, so he unloads his pistol on me and i'm forced to kill that idiot. Now its a coin toss whether I get attacked by AI scavs or not, if he hit me (i think?).  
Give aggressive PScavs a longer timer, xp penalty or something.
