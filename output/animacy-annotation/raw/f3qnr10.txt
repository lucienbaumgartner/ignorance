I’m not mad at you and I understand that Im saying thing people don’t like. But I am not taking crazy pills. People want help in those communities.

Rural communities are not only affluent conservatives and people who are racist. There’s a ton of people in them who are ignored. Including large Hispanic populations.

I sat and watched a ton of people get harassed out of education because teachers don’t care and the schools wouldn’t support poor students. I saw and understood the cycle of drug abuse and poverty that people couldn’t get out. Old people dying because they couldn’t afford healthcare. All the black teeth from meth and court dates and foster care abuse my friends had happened. 

I had to see my friend live in a hotel his mother also worked as a hooker in. I had to watch him throw away his talent at piano because he sold drugs to pay rent and got arrested. I have another buddy who should be a lawyer. He could pass a class but got kicked out of our HS because his home life was so fucked up he couldn’t go to school.

And yes, I’m not nieve that there’s a lot of people with problematic views on race and everything else. But what the do people expect to happen? You lock a bunch of people into terrible circumstances they don’t have a chance to work on understanding those things. 

And what about when it’s generational? How do these fix themselves? These people are supposed to woke themselves out of failed education, lies, and being lied to by media that wants to keep them angry and ignorant? 

That doesn’t fix itself.
