Your "technically" is literally ignorant and redundant here, because there are many different avenues in which Israel purchases weapons from the US. It's not just through one fund you Dumbazz. 

The US and Israel have a "you scratch my back..." type of relationship, which is what everyone in this post is pointing out, but somehow you're the only one here having difficulties trying to comprehend this.

Stop projecting and learn how to read. Not my fault you're illiterate and slow
