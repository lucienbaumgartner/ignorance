Yes. One time. And twice. And three times. And four. Just because I only typed about one experience doesn't mean it's the only one I've had. Also, deaf people aren't the only people who use sign language. 


Congrats. You've proven yourself to be a wildly uneducated fool who makes assumptions far quicker than he could critically think. 

Your opinion on this subject is worthless and I'm not wasting another second on you.

Edit: Went to block you and saw that you're active on /r/ProtectandServe and that you're a police offer. 

What a surprise that you're extremely dismissive and ignorant of anything that you don't consider "normal". I had no respect for you before but now? Oh boy.
