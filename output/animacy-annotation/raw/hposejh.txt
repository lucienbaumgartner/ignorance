Lol you reject Christ and Krsna, who are both people, not religions. You can say, 'nuh-uh determinism' all you want, and you're still just wrong and ignorant of the Truth by choice. It's not my responsibility to convince you. You have been told the Holy names. You can choose to look in to them. If you cannot appreciate the wisdom of Vedanta, or the teachings and life of Christ, you're going to suffer in ways you can't imagine - but that's your problem. You're still wrong, and you still have the option to choose to change.
