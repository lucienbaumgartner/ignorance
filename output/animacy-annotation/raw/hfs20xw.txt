The British Empire mainly cared about money. The American Revolution was a mistake.

Firstly, it was inevitable it was going to happen. However, the time in which it happened was the worst.

For a reason, the king then didn't want the colonies to expand and decimate the native population, he set up a limit east of the Appalachians. After the US got its independence, none of this mattered anymore and many more atrocities happened. 

One thing that I don't like is that modern Americans forget about that. The British Empire chiefly cared about money, but the Americans having its independence too soon in time was a worse turn of events to the world. 

However, if they had proved that they were indeed the country of the free and whatever, they would have been better than that empire then, but they weren't. It's an irony, how do you call a country of freedom if you destroy other people's freedoms?

The British completely messed it up, they should have given them representation.

The British Empire was a very ambiguous force in the world, it was mostly driven by self-interest. I think a lot of Brits know that the Empire made bad things alongside few good things.

However in the US, Americans are completely oblivious and ignorant of the bad things their country has done in the past.

Every country, the US, the UK, should know and acknowledge that they have done bad things in their past, and strive to be a force for good now.

Those times are gone, there are so many problems in the world. Now the US has taken the baton and is making mistakes based on self-interest, the UK has made somes mistakes, like entering the war in Iraq, unfortunately. I hope the US becomes a better country for its people and doesn't do any more mistakes in the world stage.
