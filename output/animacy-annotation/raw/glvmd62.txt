&gt;Many of these decentralized nations were not rich or sophisticated relative to those colonizing at all. Those with no contact to empires of Europe or Asia had no basis for an economy other than local bartering. Nothing near the level of the state-sponsored merchants of Europe.

The way Europe did things is not the definition of sophistication or complexity. Do some reading of actual history and archaeology of the Americas, not just trashy pop history Guns and Steel nonsense.

&gt;And why I argue about their innocence is because it portrays them as the victim; that purportedly such civilized societies were conquered and exploited, and ultimately ruined. Often that view is not so accurate given modern developments in these regions.

And here we have it, blatant colonialist apologia

Yes, actually, these societies were conquered and exploited and ruined. Not right from the get go! In North America especially there was a long period of mutually beneficial trade for some time. But yes, attempted genocide (for example the clearing of the plains, where bison were intentionally hunted to near extinction in order to starve the Indigenous peoples and "get rid of them") and the advent of diseases absolutely were bad fucking things that ruined and destroyed their societies.

&gt;If you read my response I literally explain why I don't feel as bad.

As I said, no one cares whether or not you feel bad. You're making stuff that has nothing to do with you or your feelings into being all about you. It's petty and self important and ignorant of you. Acknwledging that genocide is a bad thing isn't about you at all.

Anyway, I'm done. I won't be bothering with any more responses from you, you are clearly very ignorant and kind of racist. Have a good day!
