That’s why the 2A is considered the worst written amendment. It’s got strange commas in it, and it’s difficult to parse out exactly what they were trying to say. There’s a grammatical argument about what is the actual subject of the sentence. It’s just bad writing. And if you think the constitution isn’t internally discrepant, have I got news for you. Your arguments are *astonishingly* misinformed, and reek of elementary right-wing talking points that you should consider might be wrong.

The Heller case clearly shows the constitutional permissibility of regulations on firearms. So you’re aware, “regulated” in the late 1700’s meant “practiced” or “trained.” That destroys the idea that there is no need for training or checking the ability of a person to use a firearm. It’s also just absurd to interpret “shall not be infringed” as a carte blanche for unlimited weapon ownership.

You’ve cited the idea that firearms are the way the first amendment can exist. This overly machismo, violence-justifying outlook is juvenile and ignorant of history. You’ve got the classic right-wing argument of “look at how dictators took over in this (conveniently non-white) country,” which again, is a hilariously oversimplified and inaccurate view of history. Most dictators in the 20th century were elected, and those that had violent rises to power usually did so with, wait for it, an armed following. Guns don’t have anything to do with free speech, dictators rise and fall regardless of gun laws.

Look I can’t educate you on *all* of the inaccuracies and falsehoods in your argument. All I can do is implore you to consider that you may be completely in the wrong.
