i think it's totally reasonable that someone would come to the same conclusion as yourself if they were coming in fresh and unaware of the drama their team causes.  It's really not aimed at you as much as the people nuking the other responses and inevitably my own.  i wouldn't even say anyone is particularly tied or passionate about this subreddit as much as tired of the toxicity constantly spread by the other subreddit.  i'd rather have to scroll past a couple box openings and have nice conversations with people than deal with all the baggage that comes with their more frequently maintained content.
