Like this is clearly a fake post that doesn’t understand how morning sickness works. It’s about random aversions and strong cravings for random things. Bland foods like crackers or toast may help settle your stomach, but they’re not like medically required if you want to eat something else that is more palatable to you. Like when I had morning sickness, Taco Bell (of all things) was the thing I irrationally craved and was the only meal I could reliably eat and not throw up, even though by no means is Taco Bell an easily digestible or nutritious food. Leafy greens and beans and whatever would totally make a pregnant me gag. Morning sickness also ends around the end of the first trimester. If his wife is still vomiting profusely at 5 months, she should really go see a doctor and see if she has something more serious like HG (which may be helped with a prescription medicine). Also I had to have a C section, and was eating whatever I wanted a day later. This whole post is so stupid and ignorant of how pregnancy works that it must be a complete troll.
