Am I right in believing that countries with stronger community bonds, equitable and evenly classed societies have faired better? Britain now more than for centuries is more selfish, inconsiderate, less mindful and ignorant that has greatly contributed to our tolerance and propensity to vote for Eton educated corporate politicians. IMO.
