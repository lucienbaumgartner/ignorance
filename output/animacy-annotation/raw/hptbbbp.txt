As a conservative I've never got comments removed or banned, except on a few more left leaning sites and subs, which simply disagreed with my viewpoints. Which I also think it's ignorant and ridiculous. But I also completely understand and agree, that some far-right idiots are crossing the line and comments need to be removed. Rightfully so.
