Yeah he was a trip, all around.  One of like only 3 or 4 really sad folks I ever knew in 10yrs.  Fuck it, story time, here's a rundown:

* *poopy pants kid we've been talking about,* nuff said 

* *The idiot weirdo-thief that couldn't drive* - **idiot** Fresh from tech school airman, first job is learning the vehicle he's assigned to, first step is vehicle familiarization - tasked to learn three numbers: 3,000gal water, 500gal AFFF, 500lbs dry chemical agent.  Aided in task by twice daily familiarization checkouts with the entire crew including the NCO/civilian crew chief*(FD)*.  Over two weeks of duty later and he had yet to recall those first three familiarization items/numbers.  **weirdo-thief** While deployed several of us living in the flightline fire station had started "losing" sets of PT gear.  Disappearances got so bad and far up the ranks that the entire station was raided by the NCOs, including locked lockers.  This dude had stolen like ~15 *sets* of PT gear from A1C's to TSgt's, much of which wouldn't fit him and all of which was marked by the owners with laundry tags.  **couldn't drive** This airman drove his sedan to work and backed it into a parking space every single day.  When his training finally*(much later)* reached Driver/Operator, he began to drive cone courses on the ramp daily.  This is designed to make you accustomed to driving gigantic heavy crash-fire trucks and prepare you for actual vehicle license testing.  He had no other problems, but he could not back up to save his own life.  He turned the wheel wrong way every single time, I'm talking 5 times in an hour everyday for a couple of weeks or more.  He backed his car up daily, but couldn't understand a fire truck is exactly the same just bigger, and always turned the wheel the wrong way.

* *That poor sheltered kid* - This young airman was the type who was quite sheltered and ignorant of the world.  I want to be clear that there's absolutely nothing wrong with innocence, it's simply a truth relevant to the situation.  TDY to SE Asia that provided ample free evening/nights and some bar-scene to spend them in.  We all know how some of those "bars" can be, and how they really work.  This guy didn't, and never understood why this "waitress" was so enamored with him or that he wasn't *really* buying her overpriced watered-down drinks or ever dreamed that there was a connection between that and her going home with him.  A week or so after returning from TDY he was heartbroken and down because the lovely girl that showed him the world suddenly had no interest in maintaining contact.  That was about when the situation changed from a possible teasing hint here or there about what the reality was, to a deadpan serious sit down talk with his closest buddy and his supervisor.  It never became relevant at that level for me, but I decided then that when I became an NCO I'd be sure to expose young airmen to knowledge about the bright and dark sides of the world they were about to face.  Poor dude, I mean it was kinda funny to us young'ins, but it also wasn't and was sad in a very real way.

* *The incompetent MSgt* - New MSgt PCSd in and fairly quickly took over as one of the shift Assistant Chiefs, as per usual.  Though I was an NCO at this time, I was never privy to the specifics of why he was quickly removed from the position and "demoted" to Station Captain duties - generally assigned to TSgt/SSgt.  Within a couple of months he'd demonstrated the inability to do what amounts to scheduling and babysitting.  He was now put in the Crew Chief's seat on a truck - generally assigned to SSgt/SrA.  Several training fuck-ups over a few weeks later and he was placed in the Driver/Operator's seat on a truck - generally assigned to SrA/A1C.  In less than a week he had backed the [Engine](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/6c/d8/096cd8ab46c2e815288e8c4db8e95cd0.jpg) into the Fire Chief's command vehicle*(SUV)* - **twice**.  I was amazed watching him be position-demoted that far, but they stopped there and did not put him on the tailboard with the kids fresh from techschool - the only lower position left.  They invented a new "Assistant Chief" position*(Special Operations)* and sort of *went along* with the idea he'd expressed among some of the station that he was just being familiarized with our station, SOPs, people, and equipment simply by refusing*(properly)* to address it.  The newly created position's primary duties consisted of what were previously minor duties of the MSgts in other sections*(Training, Supply, etc)*, and they always looked over his shoulder - hell I*(SSgt)* was even tasked a couple of times with "checking his homework" so to speak.  The thing is - he made rank because he retained information extremely well, perhaps he would have made a good academy instructor, he simply could not perform under any semblance of stress or something.  He was always a klutz fumbling hands-on things as well as mental.  In a practical application sense he was incompetent.  How he had ever passed practical evaluations as he progressed, I can only imagine was a tragic disservice done to the AF by some prior NCOs that didn't care enough to fail him - or maybe something had happened to him that affected him in such a severe way... who knows.
