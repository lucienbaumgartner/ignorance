The government spending just continually increases.... Your statement is idiotic.

Obviously each proceeding president will spend more than the previous.... 

Joe Biden spent 600 Billion more in his 1st year in Office, than Trump in his previous year.

That jump is a 500 Billion greater than any previous president taking office.... 

This argument is stupid and ignorant of the understanding that the Government is just a continually growing monster.
