because it's impossible to determine intent. Was it underthrown, or was it a comeback route or back shoulder throw that was completely impeded by an unaware and excessive contact by the DB?Which is why they are very generous when it comes to "receiver in the area" on throws, even if they are simply throw aways. You can ground it at your running backs feet clearly and intentionally, but in the spirit of the game, The ball may of slipped and you just threw a bad pass, so they cant prove intent therefore can't call grounding.Same issue here. There's no way to actually prove intent.

The only thing they could do is allow more contact from unaware DB's  that are just playing the player and not the ball. Which just reverses the abuse of rules the other way, allowing DB to intentionally create "incidental" contact to avoid getting beat on plays.
