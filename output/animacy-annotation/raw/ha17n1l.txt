I find distorted guitar riffs in music made after 1979 very annoying and unaware of reality. It's like some thirteen year old kids making noises at 2am next to your door, you feel annoyed but c'mon... They're just kids. So you keep your composure, wake up, go to the door to tell them to stop disturbing and go to sleep. 

You open the door and you find that the noise came from a group of guys in their fourties, talking like they were in their early teens.

What do you do ?
