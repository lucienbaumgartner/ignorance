Honeys character is the leading therapist that has no real experience, no real knowledge outside of the bubble of her home and the 3 or so other places Jill takes her.

However Honey THINKS she knows everything. Not in a bad way, but when someone has a limited view of the world, they are able to familiarize with it well and there comes a point they think they know everything and are a master because they don’t have any idea a bigger world exists.

In The Who’s a good therapist episode, Honey literally talks to the other dogs about how they chose to be together, unlike her and chief, and that’s when we find out that Honey is under the impression that because Chief and her are the only dogs in the house, that that is all her life is ever going to be. Honey does not see past the walls of the house.

So when she finds out that some dogs “chose” to be together it’s prying open her small mind, also when she sees the coyote, and when she meets the Big Cookie lookalike at the beach who says she lives the van life.

Honeys entire character is one that is originally shown to know everything and has it under control, but she is one of the most insecure and unaware of what’s ACTUALLY happening.

Just remember that’s not a Bad thing, it’s just her storyline. Chief is her foil of not really understanding what’s going on, but doesn’t pretend to because he just wants to have fun and enjoy his time.
