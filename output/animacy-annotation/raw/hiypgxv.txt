I called myself an Apache helicopter when I was an egg. Was still unaware and unwilling to admit to myself... Now I call myself a train because it causes me too much anxiety and panic overload when I admit to myself outloud that I'm trans, and train is as close as I can get without spiralling too far into the deep end.
