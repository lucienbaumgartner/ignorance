I don't think there's anything truly horrible in the recent emails that hasn't been discussed here already. 

1) Media helping Clinton "cheat" in the town hall and interviews. 

2) Media helping Clinton get out her story and shape public opinion

3) Dems having poor opinions about Jews and Christians. 

4) Manipulating an unaware and compliant citizenry through propaganda to get their votes. 

5) planning how to take down political opponents.  This might include Trump's sex scandals.  

6) trying to minimize the fallout from her private email server scandal- deciding which top secret emails to release and which to delete


I think most of it is just hardball politics. 

I think looking at the process is revealing because it makes one wonder how much your opinion depends on these media and political forces- spin.  


The really damaging stuff for Clinton still has to do with deleting those emails, I think.

Edit- oh, I forgot- taking money from unsavory sources.
