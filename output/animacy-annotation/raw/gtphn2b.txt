False but ok. We may have our problems but that doesn’t make it third world. You are obviously ungrateful and ignorant of the real world. Be glad that you don’t have to worry about stepping on an IED on your way to school, be glad that you don’t have to be a chai boy for the ISIS, Taliban, Al-Shabab, and even the Afghan local police. Be glad that you don’t have to worry about being strapped to a bomb. Be glad you aren’t forced Into becoming a child soldier. Be glad that you aren’t forced into slave labor and human trafficking rings, be glad that the country you live doesn’t allow abusive child labor. Before you say some shit about me “assuming” your life. I could already tell how spoiled you are comparing America to a third world country. Kids in third world countries would kill to live in America, If America was so terrible why are there thousands and thousands of people trying to come here everyday. Don’t get me wrong I don’t think America is the best in the world but i definitely know for a fact it’s not third world.
