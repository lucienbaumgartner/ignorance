A few things.

Firstly, whether intentional or not, you have just downplayed the atrocities of the Nazis. The Holocaust, the second world war, and the terror that the Nazis brought should never be summarised as 'a bad decade'. Also, the Germans also sought to play the Empire game; so your claim that the Germans 'had a bad decade' is offensive and ignorant of the facts.

Secondly, British and English are not the same thing.

Thirdly, by focusing on the English, you are revealing an ignorance of how involved the Scottish were in Empire building. The Scottish had an extraordinary and disproportionate (based on population) impact upon the Empire.

Fourthly, you seem to imply that the British Empire was unusual in some fashion. It wasn't. The British Empire was simply larger and more successful than its rivals in conquering new territories, extracting wealth and resources, and funneling that into the industrial revolution. There is a reason why so many of the technologies we take advantage of today find their origins in Imperial Britain.

You should check how the Belgians treated their subjects in the Congo before trying to claim that the British Empire was somehow unusually different.

Finally, what was also just another Tuesday for the British was the abolition of the African slave trade and the dedication of significant resources in achieving it. It's interesting how easy it is to cherry pick facts to suit an agenda.

This is not to suggest some defence of the British Empire, but that analysis and understanding of it should be taken with the proper context. Implying some exceptionalism on behalf of the British Empire is wrong regardless of your reasons for doing so.
