Thank you for the citation, but this doesn't seem to be a genuimne problem. Something that can be addressed, like the article says, on the sale end. No one is actually getting hurt, so it's kind of misleading to label it in the manner you, and the article did. No one is actually getting hurt. They are simply unaware, and uneducated on consuming cannabis. 112 out of every 10,000 isn't really an issue, especially when people are just freaking out, because they didn't know what to expect. Not an actual medic problem. This is an easily solved minor issue. Not a major factor to even bring up in a legalization/ decriminalization conversation.
