No, and neither is the NFL. This isn't a difficult concept to grasp. They're employees of the Patriots. Even if the owner, HC, and their direct superviser are all shown to have been uninvolved and unaware, that doesn't absolve the club as an entity from responsibility for its individual employees actions. Suggesting otherwise is being intentionally obtuse. When I was working as a traveling sales rep, if I had gotten into a car accident while on the clock, would I get sued or my employer get sued? Hint: the company gave me a company car, paid for my insurance, and disallowed me from using another vehicle while on the clock for a reason. That's just how liability works. Ultimately an organization is liable for the actions of its individual employees even when those employees act alone.
