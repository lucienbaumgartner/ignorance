I believe so, if we legalize it, it will be consumed and used significantly more often, and constantly. marijuana as you probably know is a super additive drug, and it is known to impair the brain, eventually lowering your IQ, ability to focus, memory, all for a few hours of being “high” and having dopamine being released to pleasure you for a few hours or more. And everyone will use it, and it’s especially bad for younger individuals. Just because it’s illegal for them to have possession of it or use it, doesn’t mean they are just not gonna do it, it’s gonna be bad considering there is gonna be marijuana available everywhere. You see what’s happening with teens and vaping, they are getting it from their older sibling or even parents. Just imagine that but instead of getting lung cancer or some other cancer prone disease, you become really unaware and unfocused because of years of use, and you lowering your IQ eventually because of using marijuana most likely on a daily basis because it’s highly addictive.  My uncle does marijuana, and has a hard time in his daily life with his wife, because of his constant addiction with marijuana. He has a terrible memory and is really slow, to respond or do anything, he also sounds really uneducated even though he had gotten a degree to be a doctor, he had almost became a successful doctor when one day he tried marijuana, at first he was completely ok, but he just kept doing it and kept doing it, and eventually turned into an idiot.
