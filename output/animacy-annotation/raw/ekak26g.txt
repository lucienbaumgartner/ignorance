haha oh man. feel free to read any dictionary, ever :) I am sure you will refuse to, though, because the words in your own head will always take precedence over fact or reality. I've met people like you before, it's actually sad. You are so dogmatic and ignorant that you become a caricature of what you emphatically say you hate - a hypocritical failure. People will sometimes listen, because of the volume of your voice, but it's all just nonsense.

What is sterilization? inability to reproduce. What is one form of this? vasectomy. Is vasectomy reversible? it can be. Can a vasectomy be used as a choice for an individual who doesn't want to be able to reproduce? yes. is sterilization evil? no. do you understand what I am saying? no. have I spent far too much time arguing with a fool? yes. will you pick up a book and educate yourself? hopefully, but I know my guess.

I seriously hope that one day you learn how to *learn*.
