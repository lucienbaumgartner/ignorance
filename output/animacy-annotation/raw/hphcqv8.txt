I use to be happy go lucky, albeit quiet and shy around people I didn’t know well. I would say also a bit sheltered, naive, and unaware of a lot of things. So I really think it’s me transitioning into adulthood, put into new and unfamiliar social situations that I don’t quite know how to “deal” with yet, and beginning to understand myself and other people
