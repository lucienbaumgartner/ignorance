But since that's apparently the rule, here you go: You'll probably notice a big change after season 4. She seems to finally be fully over Adam and onto his manipulative bullshit. She even works with Taylor through the same attorney (albeit briefly) to oppose Adam's request for joint custody of both girls. Meanwhile Adam continues to be a miserable douchebag who makes almost no effort to see Aubree, who spends most of her weekends with only his parents. Chelsea doesn't even through Adam (deservedly) under the bus when Aubree talks about Adam not playing with her, or not following through on things he promised to do. Is she perfect? No. But she's about the only parent on this show I haven't watched call the other parent a shit head in front of children who are old enough to understand what they're talking about. In the world of low, LOW standards for parenting that is this show, that's pretty good.

No, I don't like Chelsea. Her baby talking is maddening and she suffers from a severe case of bump on a log syndrome. She's also exactly like a lot of the women I knew living most of my life in the Midwest: utterly disinterested and unaware of anything outside her bubble. She's not the brightest bulb on the marquee either. But she does a better job not using her daughter as a hostage or openly slamming her child's other parent as said child gets older and is better able to understand what the adults in the room are discussing. My point is there are plenty of things to dislike Chelsea for: I just don't think slandering Adam in front of Aubree is one of them.
