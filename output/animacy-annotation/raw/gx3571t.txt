He's misinformed and ignorant of reality. Canada has quite a few disease research facilities, and vaccine (and drug) manufacturing facilities. None of them came up with a human-tested vaccine early enough and none of the big 5 wanted to manufacture *in* Canada because the facilities available were not large enough to produce millions of doses rapidly. (That's changing over the next 18 months though as a large facility is being joint ventured right now.)
