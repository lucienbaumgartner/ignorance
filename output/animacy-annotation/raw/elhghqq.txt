You can get it all back plus a lot more. In my 20s I dated a girl for 3 or 4 years.  I thought she was the one.  We bought a house together, went on international vacations with her family, planned on marriage, all the things.  1 month before I bought the ring she wanted, she ended it, and started dating women (I'm a man).

She ghosted me basically.  I was hurt, confused, and very damaged.  I would have dreams where we were still together, then I'd wakeup and believe my life was the nightmare.

It took me 2 years to put myself back together.  I've since learned that it doesn't need to take that long, but I was young, inexperienced, and ignorant.

That process of losing the most valuable thing I could imagine, and then rebuilding myself gave me an emotional strength that I don't think I could have learned another way.

This girls decision to leave isn't your problem.  It's your reaction to this circumstance.  Get busy making yourself better, and you'll never care again about the decisions of other people that you can never control.  It's your job to control your actions and never again give this control to another.

You're worth it.
