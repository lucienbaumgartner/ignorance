Thank you, I grasp the poem better now. I was scan reading it the first time. I guess I was so taken in by the beauty of the words and sentences, that I ignored meaning behind them and the darkness they were portraying. When I did get to the end, I felt a little lost and betrayed as it had quite a shocking impact on me. I feel as though if I was the girl in the situation, I would be quite naive and unaware of subtle darkness hidden by the beauty and be baffled, betrayed and terrified when faced with the truth at the end. Itâ€™s hard to believe a person can hold and be so dark.
