**Here's the OP:**

##Was I wrong to out my boyfriend to his parents after cheating on me with his bestfriend?

Throwaway account and also sorry for the wrong grammars because English is my second language.

2 months ago, I caught my (18F) boyfriend of 2 years (19M) having sex with his best friend of 9 years (19M) during a sleepover in his house while his parents are out of town. We got into an argument over this a few days after and decided to break up with him. I always knew he was gay but was afraid to admit it because i've seen him act gay with his best friend a few times like one time when they make out with each other and he said it was just a joke. I was so angry and ignorant that I decided to called his parents while they were out of town that time about what happened.

His parents are pretty religious and conservative so i'm not surprised if they are homophobic.

When he found out I outed him, he started sending too many texts on me of how he will be in deep trouble with his parents that they found out he is gay and when his parents came back home a few days later, he got beaten and even got kicked out of his parents' home and now he is currently staying with his best friend's house whom he cheated on me. I haven't heard of them, ever since.

I am not homophobic, I am still gonna be okay with him if he is gay but I guess this is the reason why he got in trouble with his parents

Edit: Thank you for the answers, I realize now that I am indeed wrong
