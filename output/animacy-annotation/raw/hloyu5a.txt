I spent 7 years trying to get through my degree. I dropped out twice. I eventually left and told my friends and family that I graduated. That was 3 years ago.

I'm one class away from my associates and maybe 10 credits from a bachelor's, but I was unmedicated and unaware of my condition. I also shame spiralled from barely late assignments and being late to classes or missing them entirely. 

I could go back now, but fortunately I got into a relevant field with chance to move up. I will eventually

My best advice is to take at least a year off and get a full time job in your field of choice. It's not impossible and you will probably find that many of you coworkers either don't have a degree either or it's completely unrelated to the job.
