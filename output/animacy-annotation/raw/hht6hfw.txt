I think the general consensus is that Rae is kind of a victim. Whether it is through her manager for giving bad advice and pulling this deal through, or the company for giving her fluff research. Raes intention throughout seems to be to make a good legit product. 

BUT, noone is praising her for missing so so many red flags. In fact, I think most people are settling on that she was just that dumb and ignorant of the scientific process as well as what procedures products like these should go through before they hit market.
