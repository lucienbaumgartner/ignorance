Might wanna double check those claims. I'll give you some key phrases and words to look up

1. Podesta "wet works" RE: Scalia 
2. I have the script for this movie, all I need is the actors
3. Do you think I'll play dominos better on pizza or cheese? That walnut sauce last week was fantastic
4. " Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and, almost 7) so youâ€™ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure"
5. "demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging."

There are many more. I don't have all day to list everything.
