Still IN.

Y'all I think I just had the littest practice. This evening I was doing a 1v1 drill with this kid I knew very well, he had tremendous handles and an ever better finish, though today was different(For me that is.), so the drill was to guard the opponent all the way to the post but not attempt to steal the ball. 

Let's just say that he managed to get past me, don't get it wrong he wasn't faster than me parse but he was shifty, the interesting part was when he was right under the rim whilst I was at Half court and I felt this massive wave of concentration hit me as I sprinted and chased him down. He was about to finish it with a layup when all of a sudden I came from beside him and spike the ball out of sight whilst we were both in midair, (yes I said spike referring to Volleyball spiking cause that was the motion in which I hit it in.). That day AKA a few hours ago I felt pretty tall even though I'm 149cm tall. 

Lastly I accidentally hit a three stylishly, we were doing the Question mark drill where you either do Layups or Jumpers but the consequence was that if not all of your teammates hit either one before the timer runs out, you'd be forced to run Suicide runs(you know what those are.)So at first I missed the layup(I can just hear the roasts...) but then when it was time to hit Jumpers was when I shone accidentally, see the Coach but a restriction to our Jumper where we could only shoot from behind the Black line. Me being stupid thought that I was in front of it somehow not aware of the fact that it looked like I decided to flex, but I then hit a wet shot on my first attempt and totally redeemed myself of that trashy layup. I was insecure about my shot because the Coach was right in front of me.

How do I know this? An acquaintance/teammate of my told me what I did in full detail, me unaware and fully oblivious decided to go with it and I just made it look like it was on purpose.
