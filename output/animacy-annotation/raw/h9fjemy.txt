2) well, we Catholics *do* give a shit. The current pontiff and the Church have condemned the use of fetal stem cells in the development of testing of vaccines/medicines. We believe abortion is wrong, and "benefitting" from abortion is also wrong. 

Concerning this particular issue, where most (maybe all) Covid vaccines have been developed with / tested on HEK239 (fetal stem cells believed to be from an aborted child), the amount of cooperation the average recipient of the vaccine has in the abortion itself is so remote that it is not considered a sin to take it *as long as the recipient does not assume taking it is a green light for justifying the morality of how it was developed*. I don't expect you or others here to like this but to just dismiss the concerns of people so casually is quite insensitive and ignorant of the concerns of Catholics who both want to follow their conscious concerning abortion and also "do the right thing" in making the choice to become vaccinated in the midst of the pandemic. 

Yes, there are a lot of ignorant people who think the vaccine *contains* fetal stem cells, but being this flippant towards their beliefs isn't going to help them want the vaccine. I say this as a conservative "trad" Catholic who has taken two doses of Pfizer.
