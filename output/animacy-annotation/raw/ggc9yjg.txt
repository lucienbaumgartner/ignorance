Yeah. They are an easy target for 100 different, including how naive and unaware of their suroundings most of them are. They are not used to watching their backs at all times and trying to see where the threats are a block away. I am not saying people shouldn't visit, but they have to be extra careful and never treat it like the USA or Western Europe. Crime here is not the petty crime you might be used so, if used to any crime at all.
