&gt;you're just blindly following Stone and Parker, who made an episode of South Park denying global warming.

Which they fully admitted they were ignorant and wrong about and made an episode in opposition to the first as an apology. You sound like you just hate them for the sake of hating them, honestly.

&gt;Okay let's talk about the final speech in the movie, about how America is a dick but we need dicks. Are you claiming that speech was satire? If so, why do Stone and Parker also restate that point later?

I think it's an incredibly nuanced point and you shouldn't base your stance on it off a comedy movie made entirely of puppets. Also, they clearly mock the US policing the world throughout the movie by highlighting how far away from the US all the places are that they go to. They even make a mockery of how high and mighty the US thinks it is when they go to "help" a place. This is showed both when they blow up Paris and when they go to Cairo. Multiple times they show how stupid or prone to violence the team is also. If you don't see how the movie is making fun of the US's policies then I can't help you. Once again, you're missing the forest for the trees.
