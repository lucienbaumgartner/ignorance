Yes, they had political factions and tensions. The US and British intelligence agencies manipulated those tensions and factions to their own benefit. And not just in Iran before 1953, but across the middle east, throughout the cold war. Again, you're ignoring the meddling, and pushing the blame on the people that were manipulated. I'm not making the point that they were all dumb innocent and ignorant of what was happening, but I'm saying that if the US and britain had left the middle east alone, maybe the twin towers would still be standing.
