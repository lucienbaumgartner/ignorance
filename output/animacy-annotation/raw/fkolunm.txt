If you're not scared, you don't understand how bad a situation we're in. We're still on the click-click-click climb of the roller coaster. The most likely scenario is that half the country either already has or will contract the virus.

We have no idea how many of them will get sick, because (as the South Korea numbers show), a LOT of young people have COVID and show zero symptoms. Without the SK government's intensive testing, those young people would be out in the community, spreading COVID. Instead, they're at home or hospital getting treatment.

**In America, all those young people are untested and unaware that they're sick. They have no idea they're spreading the virus.** In a few weeks, those young people might be fine or they might be fucked, but one thing is certain: the people they've spread it to includes a lot of older folks who will not survive the summer. The older folks who get it die. Not a few here or there. Like 10% for the 60+ cohort.

The lowest, serious estimate of death toll from COVID in America alone was 475,000. To put that in perspective, that's about 160 9/11s this spring and summer. And that's not the worst-case scenario. That's the scenario where we shut down the country as best we can and try to ride this out. God help us if we wait any longer to do that, because at that point, you can expect deaths in the millions.

Like I said. If you're not scared, you're not informed.
