here let me correct this.

i can just imagine wes and maisy watching this years from now and being traumatized at how much was shared of them in their most vulnerable moments. how their own mother sobbed to a camera and then went and filmed them naked and in the hospital, sick and unaware of the fact that millions were consuming images of them. you're a terrible momma colleen. sending so much judgment.
