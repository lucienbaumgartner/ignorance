The kicker....

&gt;To know that some members of Congress — along with the former President, Donald Trump, who Brian and I once supported but who can only now be viewed as the mastermind of that horrible attack — are not acknowledging Brian's heroism that day is unforgivable and un-American.

Hate to be cynical with someone's grief, but only too late did they realize there would be very tragic consequences for being so misinformed and ignorant of what they were supporting. 

Not going to lie, I lost a little sympathy at that point. Over 400 thousand Americans are dead and at least 3 million suffered ***needlessly*** because of how Trump dealt with the pandemic.
