This will be the main justification for it imo. Conservatives can die happy and ignorant that the preventable problem we created is just God doing his thing. Honestly I'm more frustrated with liberals lately. I hope I'm just in a weird bubble, but I know tons of liberals that agree on how bad climate change is, but spend all their energy talking about socialism, and how terrible the rich are. It just comes off as so selfish when they know alleviating climate change will be costly and probably delay things like UBI, but prioritize UBI now because it will benefit them.
