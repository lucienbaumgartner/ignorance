I really need to read up on this, or start paying more attention, it seems. I am so blissfully unaware and ignorant to either side of this. Right now, me knowing what I know at this stage in my life, and what my lifestyle is. I honestly do not see the problem with Uncle Sam or big brother taking my picture, or filming me when/wherever. I don’t care. It’s really sad too that I can’t state my honest opinion of this face and not get butchered by people who call me “part of the problem”.  And trying to have a grown up conversation without it devolving into snarky comments, is just exhausting.
