&gt;I’m the ignorant one?? 


You linked FEC laws as evidence of her charity breaking the law, which isn’t regulated by the FEC

At least admit to that ignorance before you inevitably move the goal post. 

&gt;She literally stole our primary away from the candidate who had the best chance of beat Trump 


How did she do this?

What does this have to do with YOU BEING SO DUMB AND IGNORANT that you thought the FEC regulates private charities and foundations. 

If you wanna talk about how primaries work sure thing. But no laws were broken there either. 

I agree the party is better without her. But we are also better with out ignorant shit bags spreading fake bullshit because they are too stupid to fucking inform themselves properly.
