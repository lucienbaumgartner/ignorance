Well the anti-SJW shtick belongs to the right wing nowadays. It went from SJW = Reed manspreading kill all (white) men and anti-SJW = woah wtf is wrong with you chill your tits you crazy person to SJW = anyone interested into equality and proper treatment of everyone, especially small groups of people who are often unfairly mistreated by the majority and anti-SJW = everyone who is against equal treatment.

I don't know when it happened but basically the right made that term their own. They use SJW to paint everyone with basic human decency and empathy as crazy and overreacting (which SJWs were before) which in turn would make them same and rational as they are anti-SJW.

Nowadays if you use SJW unironically or outside of a very specific meta context you are either completely unaware and missed what has been going on or rather right of center. Well or you are using it to bait more of that group into watching your videos or read your content. Either way just like the Pepe memes have been taken over by the right so have those terms.
