Source am half asian and born and raised in the US: 

I expressed to my cousin who lives in Taiwan and has his whole life that I thought it was weird and ignorant that my mom didn’t want me dating certain girls based on race - he basically went on to say “oh yeah. That’s completely normal. We don’t like blacks, Indians, or people from the Middle East/Arabic”. I was shocked that he said so nonchalantly and matter affect. So I guess that’s kind of the unwritten rule in Asia? I dunno
