&gt;	India is quite like Europe. Many different ethnicities, cultures, and languages.

In a sense, India should never have been one country. Whether it was Muslims, Mughals, or British, someone else always conquered and united the nation. There were a few home-grown unifiers but none whose rule lasted more than a few generations. India is and always has been defined as in opposition to its traders (as are many countries) or conquerors.

It is today one country for geopolitical reasons, but it would be incomplete and ignorant of the vast diversity to think of India as exactly like one country. Having lived in many countries, and having been foreign to most of them, I observe that India has the greatest amount of intranational diversity.
