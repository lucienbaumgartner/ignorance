YTA. He lost his WIFE, college sweetheart and best friend in one PLUS his entire in-law family whom he has known for 8 years. You try and justify this with your pain but you are so self involved and unaware that you don't see how much you AND your toxic family have hurt him over the past three years.

I feel bad for the spouses of you and your sisters. I hope they know that they aren't really considered family.
