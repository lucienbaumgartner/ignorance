&gt;Thousands over how long? Roughly 200 a year for the last 20 years.

Only on the last act of aggression of the apartheid regime which you so desperately try to defend, 2139 people died of which most were innocent civilians and 490 were children. I don't doubt the incapability of your frontal lobe any more if you fail to see the murderous character of an illegal occupying force and preposterously try to play down the numbers of the ethnic cleansing that is going on.

&gt;Yet you don't.

Yes you as OP fail to bring the nuance of the reality of the conflict into your post. This was your responsibility and you failed to do so. The sad truth is that you therefore are part of the aggression that comes from the 'us versus them' mentality that almost is a synonym to this conflict. Or are you so ignorant and unaware that you never heard of Northern Ireland where the people who identify themselves with Ireland showcase Palestinian flags while those who identify themselves with Britain showcase Israeli flags?

&gt;Do Jews get context as well or only Muslims? Can Israeli talk of the context of hundreds of terrorist against against Israeli cities?

Shows how little you know about the conflict. The Israeli apartheid regime never cared about who was a Muslim or who was not. It was never a religious conflict to begin with. If you want to spin this lie, you better take it to another sub. The Israeli government doesn't care if the Palestinian which they massacre is either a Muslim, a Christian or whatever faith or ideology they choose to follow. Every Israeli that kills a Palestinian is a terrorist, for Israel is an illegal occupying force on land that was not theirs to take.

&gt;Which criminals do you prefer? Fatah? Hamas? Assad?

I prefer none of them, but your answer shows enough about which of the bunch you have chosen to pair with. You are a lunatic and I strongly suggest you to get your mental health checked.
