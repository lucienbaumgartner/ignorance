This is a bad response though.  Your saying "these things are bad to teach your kids, so that means the same is true with religion.

Essentially we can simplify your argument to "Since there are some bad things we can teach our kids, anything we teach our kids is bad", and hopefully you see why that's a silly stance.

Yes, teaching sexism and racism is wrong.  That has zero bearing on our conversation.

&gt;Altering a childâ€™s entire life over your own beliefs is abusive and ignorant

That is what all child rearing is. From politics, to religion, to how people are treated.  It is absurd to say that this is abusive.  You need to go by specific case by case with things taught to determine whether it's abusive.

If there really was a God, that sent people to hell for lack of faith, wouldn't it be abusive to not do everything in your power to stop your child from going to hell?

&gt;the list goes on and on.

No it doesn't.  None of that has anything to do with the indoctrination of children in to faith.

&gt; Sending a kid to straight camp (which for sure is religious)

Sending a kid to straight camp is obviously more harmful, but that is not what we are discussing now is it?

That argument is like me saying "whats more harmful, me gouging out my childs eyes if he refuses to be an atheist, or letting him keep his eyes" and then using that as an argument against teaching kids to be atheist.  Absurd.
