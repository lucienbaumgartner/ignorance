It's crap like this that makes my blood boil. I've seen firsthand what it looks like for people to die all alone, with tubes everywhere in and on them. You can tell these people about    
all the horrific things that happen and they're so selfish and ignorant that they're willing to sacrifice others for their own benefit.  The crazy part is, they're literally willing to die on that hill. Pathetic.
