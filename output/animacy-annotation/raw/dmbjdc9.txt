&gt; "we want an unaware and compliant citizenry

Hi, I went and looked up the quote you referred to, and it's fake news. You got duped, man.

Here is the leaked podesta e-mail in its entirety:

&gt;"**Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens
&gt;United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money
&gt;isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the
&gt;electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats
&gt;and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas,
&gt;free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and
&gt;running.** JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his "George" magazine saw
&gt;celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its
&gt;time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development
&gt;pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are
&gt;dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general?
&gt;Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump,
&gt;Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the
&gt;poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the
&gt;conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all
&gt;been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
&gt;to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
&gt;strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
&gt;some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
&gt;demographically-inspired messaging."

Now, if you actually **READ** the e-mail, here's my rough translation of it:

"We're fighting a losing battle with TV NETWORKS who produce an unaware and compliant citizenry." The guy is mocking TELEVISION. If you read the whole paragraph, you'll understand the context for that quote. You cannot cherry-pick the quote without the context. TELEVISION produces an unaware, compliant citizenry; not Hillary Clinton. **The guy says, in a sarcastic tone, "We all thought the problem was Citizens United/Koch Brothers" BECAUSE THAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM**
