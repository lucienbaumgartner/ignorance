If there was, sure, maybe... but there isn't.

And in a broader sense, the Acosta thing is just a smokescreen.  Look at how the president handles the entire press corps.  The most powerful man in the world is so insecure and ignorant that he's apparently compelled to be openly insulting, hostile, and bullying to the reporters asking questions.  They, too, are just trying to do their job, and they are asking questions that we, the people, want asked and answered.  They represent *us*.  They *are* us.

Moreover, his gaslighting and open hostility towards this media boogeyman has inspired violence and threats of violence towards news professionals across the country.  It's the definition of irony that the most prodigious purveyor of so-called fake news is the man that lobs that phrase at anyone he disagrees with or who dares criticize his eminently criticizable behavior.

It's narcissistic, toxic, unconstitutional, and unAmerican.
