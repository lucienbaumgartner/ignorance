Honestly. I won’t press this person anymore. I think they’re like 15, and Gen Z are pretty stupid and ignorant of history. I use to work with a Gen Z military glorifier who thought America was the good guys who saved every country we colonized, and I told him about how our military is just a terrorist colony with red white and blue colors, and I told him about how he doesn’t actually pay taxes if he gets a tax refund, and he sat there every time calling me a liar and I asked him how?  

The lyn-z thing though is just such a wild accusation and to keep defending it is some hill to die on.
