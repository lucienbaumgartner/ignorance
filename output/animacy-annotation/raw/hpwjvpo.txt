I'm really good thank you, even better than i was before. You can't really explain it in words but guess i understand the concept of death now. I'll def be more careful now, won't eat more than 10g, but I actually was aware that I could get into the bad trip like that, I'm just really ignorant and reckless dude so i didn't care too much. The only thing i regret is not doing it when I'm home alone, never know when your psychosis starts hurting other people
