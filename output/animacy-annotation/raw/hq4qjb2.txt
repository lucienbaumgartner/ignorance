You should have said that to his godamn face. He can be rich but who gives a shit anyway. Take this as a lesson and give an oath to yourself. If you see any bullshit and fuckery which is arrogant, ignorant and disrespectful in the future you'll get it nuetralised on the spot in future. Prepare for that situation from now and work in yourself. That's how you'll grow and improve.

Being nice, humble and considerate is great. But the fuckery of the ignorant ones would take toll on your mental health unless you experienced enough to control your thoughts and emotions. Don't let the ignorant fools get away without any resistance. Even if you lose it doesn't matter show some resistance that their fuckery isn't tolerated on your turf. Your self esteem and balls would grow for standing up. You'll have a peace of mind and contentment which is important.
