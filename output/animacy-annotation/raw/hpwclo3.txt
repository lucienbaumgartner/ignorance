Oef. A 14 y/o girl having issues wearing a bathingsuit, now that's unheard of....


Dude I can understand ignorance, but if anything listen a bit more to your wife. Almost everyone here will call you the A because of being ignorant and insensitive to your daughter. I'm gonna go a step further.

Your wife afterwards told you you were out of line and you dismissed it. For some reason she didn't find the courage to stand up for your daughter in the moment and seeing your response at a later point...well I van guess why. Now your daughter actually tried to communicate with you (her mother didn't even try anymore) voicing her feelings and emotions and you shut her down dismissing everything. And this I'd where you are the biggest A possible. Any kid should be able to rely in their parents and you only showed your daughter that her dad isn't to be relied upon.

You better try your fucking best to repair this, since you do want her to come to you when she gets in trouble or whatever! Don't be one of those "if only I had know this" parents.
