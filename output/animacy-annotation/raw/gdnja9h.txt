1: play is how children learn and unrestricted play environments where children have to solve social issues is key to their development under the age of 7... if your kids went to childcare 90% of their day would be play because childcare experts know that play is best.  They would also spend much of their time outdoors because leading experts realize how much growth children get social, emotionally and developmental from in outdoors. So your argument that they are just playing and running around is dumb.
2: you sound very entitled and unaware of how the world works. Some people don’t got to college and that is okay. Your children will grow to resent you if you put this pressure on them and demand they do something that makes them money instead of something they love. 
3: you sound like you don’t understand the concept of compromise which is the key to marriage so maybe you should reflect on you being a terrible wife to your husband in this situation.
