Jesus fuck how are you SO ccontextually unaware and literally incapable of deciphering simple English? Your ignorance literally knows no bounds. Can you even read without frothing at the mouth every two words?

I said AT MOST 20 people. Look up the meaning of the word "speculation" you moron. Beyond that, I mentioned in no unclear terms that the leak itself highlights who exactly has acccess to the document. And beyond that, where's YOUR PROOF of YOUR STATEMENT that hundreds of people had access to the contract? So again, shut the fuck up and go read the actual leak for ONCE in your miserable sister-fucking life, you inbred mongoloid.
