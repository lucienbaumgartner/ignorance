Same here, and I completely agree. I’ve noticed it since I bumped up to 300mg. It’s like I’m completely separated and unaware of what is going on around me at all times. It’s awful. And the scary part is, I’m completely dissociated, no memory of doing things until I cognitively realize I’ve been totally out of it in an autopilot daze. In the past I’d dissociate frequently, but not to this extent by any means. I’d describe my previous experience with dissociation as more passive, self protection, and a coping technique. This is aggressive, comes on without any warning, and there’s no reason for it. All day every day for the last week, I’m in a complete haze. Two days ago, I started taking the meds at night. I’m not sure if that has helped or not yet. I’ll keep you updated if you’d like. Since I’m almost on week 6 of treatment, I’m going to give this two more weeks and if things don’t start getting better, I’m going to have to find a different med.
