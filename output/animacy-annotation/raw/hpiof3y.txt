Honestly who gives a fuck how they make *him* look. He’s not dating you for your scars, he’s dating you for **you**. If other people only see the scars, and not the person they belong to, then that’s on them. But if wearing a coverup makes you more comfortable then you do you. 

I think sarcasm is great way to respond because it makes people realize how ignorant and ridiculous it is for them to talk/ask about something that has no effect on them. Depends on what the scars are and how sensitive you are about the matter. 🤷🏽‍♀️
