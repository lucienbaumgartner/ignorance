Let's unpack that. What if you were born a vegetable incapable of intelligent thought. Would you still be trans? If this is all in your brain, what if you weren't sentient anymore?

Now, unfortunately for you, the main detrminator of your behavior, interests, and even sexuality is your sex, which is a trait that would persist in describing you even if you ceased to be sentient.

All you are really holding onto in your skull is a bonsai tree of feminization porn and misogyny carefully maintained over the course of years. If you get dementia in your twilight years, you will abruptly forget you ever considered yourself to be transgender. And if you get SRS you will, as some nurses have witnessed in others, wake up every morning screaming "where is my penis?!"

But feel free to give me the whole spiel about how transgenderism is innate and visible in the brain, ignorant and unaware that those same traits are also simply markers of homosexuality.
