Yes, a deadhead named Kurt died smoking Persian.  He collapsed forward, stopped breathing, and his companions walked away, afraid and unaware that just a few minutes of artificial respiration is often all it takes to save someone from opiate overdose.  A while after, some kids found him, came up to our booth looking very shaken, they couldn't believe what they saw.  Being relative grown-ups, some friends and I went over, saw, confirmed, called the authorities.  I knew his face, had for years, but didn't really know him, though a lot of folks on tour did.  He was cool to touch, had been there a while, and a deep shade of asphyxiated purple--I prefer to recall him from a younger time, six or so years before, when he was fresh to tour.  He wore a black leather jacket back then, over his tie-dye, in an era when you never saw those two fashion styles together--it was a striking blend of hippie and street-tough, kind of a harbinger of where a certain element of tour heads were headed.  I guess he was ahead of his time. 

Yeah, that memory shaded the weekend a bit, fit in the worst way with the aforementioned bacchanalian swamp that the campground became after hosting what came to be called Shakedown Street for five days straight.  But for the most part, it was a great party, and I had a lot of fun, sold a bunch of food, had a beautiful girlfriend that summer, lots of great music, Jerry was healthy, and then when tour got back to Telluride, played my then-home-town, tickets were plentiful for all, as no one had predicted and despite everyone's fears.
