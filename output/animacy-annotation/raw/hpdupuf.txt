If its one thing I have learned over the past two years, is that an extremely large majority of people in my circle are selfish, ignorant, and arrogant.  They are wildly uninformed about the things plaguing this nation, and unless information is spoonfed to them they will not seek out any additional info.

It is disturbing to watch these people unravel to such an extent, and that I have never noticed these things which may have been subtle before, but are front and center now.
