No. You are NTA. 
I’ve lauded my ebony locks repeatedly over the years. It’s a matter of where you were brought up. 


You know that 1990’s pizza joke?
What do you call a brunette &amp; 3 blondes?
 Regular price, 4 bucks, 4 bucks, 4 bucks. 
Back in the day Miami humor. 


But seriously, your SIL was being hyper-sensitive, and she did have a point about people being discriminated against based on looks - it happens. 


It’s fantastic that you like yourself, and you feel blessed to be you, and all that that entails. Your SIL sounds burnt out and stressed. Maybe you can take some time to build bridges with her by babysitting more (I’m not sure if the kid is hers), or maybe helping her make her signs or something. Help her relax. She’s also obviously under the impression that you’re privileged and unaware of it. Take the time to lovingly show her you are aware of your blessings, and you two being family is one of them.
