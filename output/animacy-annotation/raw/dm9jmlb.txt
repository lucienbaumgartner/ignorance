Skepticism is always healthy, I appreciate your reasoned response.   

&gt;without evidence, it would be an assumption to say they're colluding.

&gt;If you ARE right, then it would be one of the largest breaches of public trust in history,

The bombshell that the MSM, on a wide scale, takes orders from the same people who control the politicians has already happened.  Wikileaks exposed that in the Podesta emails.  Nothing came of it except demonizing wikileaks.... [cnn even claimed it was "illegal" for anyone *but* the media to read the emails that implicated them and 60+ other msm "journalists"](https://streamable.com/6g5v) ....  Now [John Podesta is literally *working* for the washington post.....](http://observer.com/2017/02/washington-post-hires-clinton-campaign-chairman-john-podesta/) 

"**And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.** This problem demands some serious, serious thinking – and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."[Verbatim from the Podesta leaks....](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)


&gt; does it really boil down to money? 

I think so.  Why else do Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper make 30 grand *a day*, it's not because they're beacons of truth.
 
Orwell says it best:
&gt;  Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.

&gt;  Speaking the Truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
