Iâ€™m hoping we can keep any counter-protest both polite, PG, and weapon-free. Remember: weâ€™re the good guys. 

The people protesting are for the most part ignorant and unaware of how theyâ€™re not helping their own cause by being where they are. But earlier this week they werenâ€™t necessarily confrontational (for the most part), though how much of this was ignorance of the meaning of my sign and how much of this was mutual goodwill towards fellow silent protestors is unclear.

Edit: of course if Ryan Reynolds wants to show up that would be great. But maybe in a green lantern costume or something. ðŸ˜‚
