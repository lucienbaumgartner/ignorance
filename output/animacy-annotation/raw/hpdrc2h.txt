NTA. 

If your fiancé cannot or will not rein in his dad (who appears to believe social media is real life wtf?) your marriage is going to involve a lot of befuddled old man rampaging around behaving badly and misjudging people because he’s ignorant and arrogant - an unfortunate combination on the best of days.
