First, Shapiro is one of the few public figures that maintains a list of all the [dumb things he’s ever said.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/so-heres-giant-list-all-dumb-stuff-ive-ever-done-ben-shapiro). That shows he acknowledges he doesn’t know everything and is willing to publicly own up to his mistakes. Whereas, most public figures shun responsibility and double down on their mistakes.

Second, people could (and are) selling their beachfront property now, despite rising sea levels. This shows that statement is not ignorant. People who purchased homes before the rising sea level threat was common knowledge are able to sell, and anyone willing to buy assumes the liability of purchasing that property. They’re free to do so.

And no, I don’t believe the “greatest threat” is a social democracy. Don’t put words in my mouth. You’re so arrogant and ignorant that your opinions seem hollow and meaningless. If I were to speak for myself, I would say I believe the greatest threat would be the moral degradation of the nation.

But I do also believe *socialism* is a threat. And no “Democratic Socialists” have explained clearly what the difference between their policy and socialism is.
