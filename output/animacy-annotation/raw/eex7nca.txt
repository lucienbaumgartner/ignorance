When are we going to wake up? Nothing from the left has been a bottom-up, spontaneous  grassroots phenomena but instead top-down meticulously planned operations of the kind intelligence agencies used to foment unrest abroad.

It is only a matter of time before they score a major victory in this information war. The left only needs one incident of an individual behaving 'badly' to create from that imagery a powerful psychological weapon which will be deployed by all their media assets. In this instance we got lucky, Nathan's stoicism composure saved us. Imagine the situation with someone less composed. Their actions would immediately be used to smear ALL of us.
