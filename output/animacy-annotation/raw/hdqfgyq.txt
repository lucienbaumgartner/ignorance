I have ADHD, I'm aware of how it works. But y'all really want to come on here and ignore everyone whose not on the low support needs side of the spectrum. I didn't say people with ADHD have zero struggles and autistic people have all of them. I said autistic people have more debilitating symptoms and acting like they don't is just ableism. Have you ever actually interacted with an autistic person, gone out in public with them, been on a trip to the grocery store?? 


Again, nobody deserves to be told their life isn't that bad and to deal with it. But you can't completely ignore that autistic people *do literally deal with more issues* because of their diagnosis and society combined. Do you know anyone with ADHD who went through ABA?? No? Like it's literally torturing autistic kids into acting neurotypical.


And sure, theres a bit of overlap BUT. With ADHD, you can be sensitive to sound, right? It's not going to cause ur brain to shut down or go into overload where you start crying, screaming and destroying things because you're overstimulated. With ASD it *does*. Listen to autistic people. ADHD is hard, obviously. But maybe we should stop comparing ourselves to autistic people, and telling them,, ya know,,, I don't know anything about what it's like to exist as you but I know my symptoms are just as bad.

It would be like me telling an mtf lesbian my life is just as hard as theirs because people don't respect me (afab nby lesbian) as a lesbian either. It's a completely different experience. Unique for each of us. And trans women are more likely to experience violence than I am, so it would be really disrespectful and ignorant of me to say those things. I have the privilege of most people believing me when I say I'm a lesbian bc of how I look. Just like I have the privilege of my ADHD symptoms going largely ignored by friends and bosses/ coworkers.
