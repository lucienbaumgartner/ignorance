This is a fallacious statement, because you have no substantive way to prove a correlation between social rejection and suicide. It's also ironically incriminating because anyone willing to kill themselves over people's opinions probably does not have a solid mental state to begin with.

Even in extremely welcoming countries such as Sweden, studies show that suicidal thoughts amongst transgender individuals are still higher than the general population despite government efforts to prevent discrimination and harassment. 

Dr. Paul mcHugh writes: "Transgendered men do not become women, nor do transgendered women become men. All (including Bruce Jenner) become feminized men or masculinized women, counterfeits or impersonators of the sex with which they ‘identify.’ In that lies their problematic future."

But isn't surgery supposed to be a medicine to the ailment? Statistics suggest it actually makes things worse: "Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers." Consequently, to say that social rejection is the root cause of the high suicide rate is logically inconsistent, statistically weak, and ignorant of evidence suggesting otherwise.
