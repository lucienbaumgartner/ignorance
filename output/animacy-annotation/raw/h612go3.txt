I think people join reddit everyday and do not subscribe to all the subreddits offered. I think cross-posting and reposting is part of the reddit eco system. What you may notice as a repost, which I do all the time as I've been on reddit on other accounts longer then 10 years. I however understand it's the nature of the beast.

Why do you care? Fake points on the internet to be cool? Similar to buying a Louis Vuitton bag, another bag will suite you just fine but some people will spend the unneeded money.

If your upset and unaware that people cheat the system and profit off it, boy do I have a boat to sell you.
