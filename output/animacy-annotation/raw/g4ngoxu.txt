I think you’re the one totally missing the point. If you think it’s sexist and dehumanizing to write about someone with a loved one who gets raped that says way more about you than the author. Why would that necessarily be sexist? Perhaps you’re projecting the way you would handle such a subject onto the author in this case, since you have literally zero knowledge of who they are or how they would handle it. Whether it’s cliché or played out is not a valid argument to not attempt a subject. If you think that, you have no idea what writing is about or what can make it good and valuable. Literature is not about original ideas, it is about perceiving and expressing the truth of circumstances. As long as you can do that there is no subject that can ever be clichéd, not least due to the fact that no two stories are actually the same, just as no two situations in life are ever the same. Categorizing all stories wherein a character’s loved one is raped as the same (which you must in order to claim that the subject is ”cliché” and ”played out”, or else those claims would be nonsensical, which of course they are) is so incredibly reductive and ignorant. That kind of thinking has no place in writing. Stop trying to censor legitimate stories because you’re uncomfortable with them.
