My symptoms presented themselves later in life which is another indication of mildness. I went undiagnosed for a number of years until I hit a crisis point and then went on meds. I was able to solve my crisis with some life changes and then tapered my meds down to nothing against medical advice.

My current psychiatrist is supportive of my choice to manage my symptoms without meds. In my case the side effects of the meds were far worse than the schizophrenia symptoms. Many of the symptoms that people think of as schizophrenia such as being checked out, socially unaware and slow are mostly caused by the meds.

There is an ongoing debate on whether schizophrenia is degenerative. If untreated, will it get worse and worse?

But I think the bigger question to be asked is, "What is schizophrenia?". Schizophrenia is entirely diagnosed based on the statements and behaviors of the patient. We have theories and guesses as to what it is but at the end of the day there is no blood test or MRI used to definitively diagnose it. People will call it a chemical imbalance, but that's like saying a novel is poorly written because the ink on the pages needs to be rearranged.
