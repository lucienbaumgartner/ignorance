I would stop this type of thinking. You are worth more than looks. You can do some therapy to build your own self esteem and worth. You are a wonderful mama. You are a valuable person! You work hard.
Have you ever thought maybe he uses the lack of compliments to hurt you? He can easily hurt your pride when he refuses sex. Is it control? Was it just stress? He knows you need words of affirmation, you would flourish with some compliments or attention. Is he just average and ignorant of your needs? Is he overwhelmed? Does he do anything that makes you happy? Or feel good? If he does meet some of your criteria..
Maybe you can both go to
Marriage counseling. If not I would suggest you go to therapy and work on yourself. You need to realize your important. People would love to spend time with you.
Enjoy your company and see you as smart. Join some
Groups to enjoy your hobbies, play instrument, sew/knit, book club, the gym..whatever your passion or want to learn. Foreign language? Music? 
you give it sometime to improve and if it gets worse you can always find someone special to meet your needs. If you have tools to deal with situation, you may want to divorce?
This may be a bump in the road that will not matter. Your relationship will be stronger. Possibly more children? 
Good luck! Search what you want for future. You have grown and feel like he is not meeting your needs.
Possibly r/deadbedroom or whatever itâ€™s named can give you some tips.
