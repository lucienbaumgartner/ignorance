Knowing the answer, I asked why the lightning network was necessary. I got responses ranging from the expected scaling problems to “Bitcoin is the only block chain”. 

Then, I pointed out that when the coal mine explosion (or whatever it was) happened the network hash rate went down by 40%. That wasn’t news, but the fact that just a handful of miners in China actually DID represent over 50% of the hash rate didn’t go over very well. I got awesome responses like “you’re confusing miners with mining pools”. As if even if what they were alluding to was true, and it was actually miners all across the world connecting to *pools* in China, that that somehow made a 51% attack impossible (when it’s just as easy for a pool that is commanding the hashrate to conduct the attack as it is for an individual miner).  

It was, and is, clear that the majority of people on that sub and investing in BTC have no clue about it. They are indignant about it being the best and ignorant of its problems. That isn’t really their fault, but the community is perpetuating it. They don’t want people to be knowledgeable about these things and they are actively suppressing facts, just because it makes Blockstream look bad.
