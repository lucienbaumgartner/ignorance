I wish I could see these moron's faces when confronted with  the objective fact that most rich people are right wing libertarians just like them.

[This Gallup poll proves that most rich people are right wing "libertarians."](https://news.gallup.com/poll/151310/u.s.-republican-not-conservative.aspx)

&gt;PRINCETON, NJ -- Politically, the wealthiest 1% of Americans -- those in households earning $500,000 or more annually -- are somewhat to the right of the remaining 99%, but more in terms of party identification than self-professed ideology. One-third of the nation's "1%" identify themselves as Republicans, 41% as independents, and 26% as Democrats. This is a mirror image of the "99%," a third of whom are Democrats, with 39% independents and a quarter Republicans.

Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox News, identifies as right wing libertarian. They melt like little babies when you mention Koch industries or the Koch brothers, while mindlessly repeating propaganda from the Cato Institute, Freedomworks, and Young Americans for Liberty.

Imagine being so dumb and ignorant that you think that CNN and MSNBC are socialists. Yeah, as if they really love Bernie Sanders. I wish that MSNBC and CNN would treat Bernie Sanders the way that Fox News treats Libertarians such as John Stossel and Greg Gutfeld.

This is what you get with KiddieFoxNews dolts such as u/ExNihiloAdInfinitum ...These people are the next generation of Glenn Beck and the Tea Party Movement. Morons don't even see that their ideology is corporate sponsored, fake freedumb and liburty.
