&gt; If Magnus is no longer motivated for it, he should just play it without the exhausting preparation , but still give the challenger a fair shot.

How is that better? If he showed up without having prepared properly he would get blasted by everyone, it would be a huge stain on his legacy and besides the man hates losing. The WCC is a huge undertaking, and it’s clear he doesn’t like doing it anymore. I don’t see this as “the others aren’t worth it” and more as him being so fed up with the whole thing that the only one who could motivate him to push past that is Alireza. Saying it publicly probably wasn’t the smartest idea, but it’s pretty understandable why he feels that way. My take on Magnus isn’t that he’s arrogant, he’s just a bit socially unaware and very blunt, which comes off as arrogant since he’s the best. I’m pretty sure that if he was second best he’d had no problems admitting that.
