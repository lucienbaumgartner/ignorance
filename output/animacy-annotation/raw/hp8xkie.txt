Yes, yes, and as a Brazilian, the only time I saw somebody robbing a store was during my first and last weekend in Oklahoma City: a crazy guy entered the shop screaming like hell, got something in one of the shelves and left screaming. Oklahoma City is no different from a mediocre big Brazilian city: poverty, bad infrastructure, backwardness... Why am I telling this little anecdote? Because the douchebags that say things about countries that they can barely identify in a map and defend walls are the ones who live in American cities or settlements that don't differ very much from a Third World city.

By the way, Brazil is full of ignorant and wild people and I witness terrible things all the time, but don't tell me we have cartels, drugs and sex trafficking as if US were Finland.
