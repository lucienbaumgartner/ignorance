No.  Every report of his behavior shows him to be extremely manic, and he seems to have had some massive decline in intelligence that unfortunately occurred after he had already passed his boards.  I would not be surprised (to throw something out there) if he had abused amphetamines or something and suffered a stroke causing some focal loss of cognitive ability while sparing enough that he could come across as relatively normal in the day-to-day.  His actions are not those of a killer but someone who is very, very dumb and unaware of consequences or how their own behavior appears to others.
