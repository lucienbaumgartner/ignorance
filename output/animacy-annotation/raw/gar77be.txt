Yeah I’m not the first person to say it and I won’t be the last, either. Just like the crew fighting tooth and nail to convince me they’re the victims of reverse racism won’t be. I didn’t invent the concept or definition. As the right wing terrorists like to say, “feelings aren’t facts”. 

Again not you, just in general. I shouldn’t have to coddle anyone because they are white and unaware of what that means as far as power and control go.
