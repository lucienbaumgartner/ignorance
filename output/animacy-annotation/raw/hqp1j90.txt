Many of us are so disgusted by the economic mismanagement foisted on all of us by ignorant and corrupt government.  It is like having cancer and choosing chemo or just a pain killer.  Many of us are sick of never choosing chemo.  Our children will inherit a dead, corrupt, ineffective system that may well turn quasi-communist.

We say No!  Let the children inherit a strong nation!  Bring on the medicine!!
