I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not? I’m not going to justify your response with an argument of conservative ideology through history. It’s 100% irrelevant to our discussion. 

Again, you said that you adopt an attitude of non judgement. Yet here you are, criticizing an entire political group. There are an insurmountable number of reasons why someone chooses to side with a certain political group. I’m sure many of those people most definitely have similar political views to you! To call every single conservative a monster or terrible person is extremely naive and ignorant of you. 

And again, I am not interested in arguing conservative ideology or politics with you. I’m trying to have a conversation/debate/argument about how judging people and jumping to conclusions can cause a slew of issues. 

I am very much not interested in reading your rants about conservatives, I thought we could have an interesting conversation. But again, reddit proves to be blindly ignorant :(
