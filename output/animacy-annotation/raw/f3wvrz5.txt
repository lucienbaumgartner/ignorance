Yes yes yes! Haha I was so stupid and ignorant that I actually thought this kind of discourse is what I would find in a sub calling itself critical of gender. Then I read it and realized it js all just hate speech and a lot pf people insisting on ENFORCING outdated notions of gender which is weird.
