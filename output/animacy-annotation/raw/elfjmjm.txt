I used to live relatively close to Breendonk in Belgium, a former Nazi prison camp/concentration camp. All students would make the trip in the last year of my high school. It was by no means the worst of the camps, but it’s still absolutely harrowing.
They have a register where you can look up names of prisoners who used to be locked up there. My last name is very rare, all matches in that register are certainly related to me. I didn’t recognise any of the first names, but fuck me, seeing them appear was like taking an ice bath and getting slapped in the face at the same time. I’m not a minority or have any of the traits, religious ideas, etc that the nazis particularly detested, so it always felt somewhat like a horrible horrible thing that happened to “other” people, something unrelated to myself. That’s naive and ignorant. That experience brought it close to home real quick.
