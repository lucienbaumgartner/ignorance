Here in Norway a monitor actually costs the equivalent of 400$
And the windows license costs aroudn 200$
Keyboards and mice respectively cost like 50$ each
But steam isnt gay in Norway

Conclusion: Maybe this particular peasant is Norwegian and unaware that things have other prices in other parts of the word. In other words, i see where he's coming from.

He's still a retarded peasant for not being part of Gaben's holy legion.
