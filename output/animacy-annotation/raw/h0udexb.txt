Throw the whole man out. Just the whole man. Of he's so blind and unaware of himself and his actions that is not going to change... And the idea of coercing you into a relationship you aren't into by threatening to cheat, and demanding that someone be exclusive but never equal or equitable is gross AF. I highly suggest that you add an up to the break... Just break up.
