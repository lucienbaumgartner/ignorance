Tell me where it was that I said that it was justified. 

110 years for just about everything committable by the average person is absurd and ridiculous. I'm just saying that he absolutely is not just some innocent truck driver whose brakes failed. He's an incredibly ignorant and dangerously incompetent driver whose decisions and/or instincts led him to making every wrong decision and multiple died as a result. 

As for any malicious intent, it's not my place to assume existence.
