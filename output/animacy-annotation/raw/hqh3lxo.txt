Forgive me if I sound ignorant and dumb...

Not trying to get too personal, but, you're female, who looks like a male? And they straight up told you they won't hire a *male*? 

I think that does boarder discrimination.

If your partner appears female for work but is non-binary, would they suddenly fire your partner if they showed up to work as a 'Male'? 

Also, I don't know for sure, but I believe that if it's a private daycare, (and a Christian one at that) they can choose to hire whomever they want, even if it seems discriminatory..

Did your partner put non binary on their application? Or Female ? Do you mind me asking what you put on your application ? 

... side note, I do want to point out that I have been working in the field of early childhood education (preschool) almost my whole 29 years of life, and it is incredibly rare to see a *male* with young children. In my personal experience, the few men that have came to sub at our center, or volunteer, or whatever, they were phenomenal. They were great with the kids, and the kids loved them. Not every family has a male/father/uncle/brother, so it is extremely beneficial for children to get that experience and exposure from school since they don't get it at home, even if it is just a few hours.

Society may believe that women are more nurturing, and blah blah, but regardless of your gender and upbringing, or the clothes you wear, what children really need is a connection, someone who cares for them.

If that center truly needs another staff member, they'll consider you, regardless of your gender.
