When menopause started for me, Hopeless Despair would overcome me—and a few minutes later I would have a hot flash. This happened over and over, several times a day, and I’d be overcome each time. Even when I became aware of the connection, I never remembered it until afterwards.

Unfortunately, this continued regularly for five years before tapering off for the next five years. Hormones are powerful, and ignorant of our suffering. I just am starting to learn about IFS. I send you hopes for insight, love, happiness, and peace.
