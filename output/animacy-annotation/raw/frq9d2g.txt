You have used a link of one woman to represent basically everyone you don’t agree with. Thank you for proving point 2.

I actually have made no statements in this thread about feminism, representation, or racism or any of the topics common to ‘SJW’s. The only argument I’ve made is that one side is far more prominent than the other.

You’re just saying I’m intolerant because if I disagree with you, I MUST be intolerant and angry and ignorant. That is literally identity politics.
