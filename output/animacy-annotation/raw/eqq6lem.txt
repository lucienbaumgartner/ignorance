That's some neat mental gymnastics you're pulling off there. And the obligatory "look at how bad Trump is" aside at the end is really helping with the partisan upvotes.

&gt;his 'we' here is a general 'we' as in America itself, or at the least the media/political class. Not himself and John, or himself and the democratic party.

And? The media and the two parties collaborate 'to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry'. The relevance of such a situation remains the same whether it is just the DNC 'conspiring' to do so, or the entire 'political class' as you've put it. In the US partisanship is a game for the masses to play, not the 'political class' that always converges on key issues and only diverges on (relatively) irrelevant BS.

Regarding the rest of your comment, I implore you to re-read the key part of the email:

&gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. **The unawareness remains strong** but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. **This problem** demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

The unawareness remains strong. In other words, 'the unawareness' is not the problem at hand. Sure, it's possible for one to screw up a sentence when writing e-mails and write something you did not intend to, but what we have here is three coherent sentences that match all too well. At the absolute least you cannot deny that he perceives the US citizenry as unaware and that he finds it a good thing as long as they vote for the right candidates (hence the prior consideration of Clinton being an 'entertainer' herself). 

**I wonder what kind of "civics and policy-driven discourse" can one lament the loss of if one believes the people were unaware and compliant to begin with. Mind telling me?**

He laments Trump and the turning of the electoral process into reality TV, and when it comes down to compressing the problem into fewer words it turns out that a lack of compliance is the problem. It's dead obvious that he's only concerned with the loss of control due to Trump's game-changing campaign. Obviously, Trump is a conman and having such a president for an extended period of time will be a problem for most Americans. But you have to understand that the 'political class' experiences problems differently from the common Americans, and that him lamenting Trump does not *at all* mean that he is lamenting the betrayal of higher democratic ideals.

&gt;I think it's really apparent with the rest of the email that he is LAMENTING the fact that America has dropped the ball when it comes to civics and policy driven discourse.

*"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum -- even encourage the more critical and dissident views."* 

Trump has yanked the public out of this limited spectrum of acceptable opinion that you called 'policy-driven discourse' (hah). Obviously, it's a shame that the discourse he introduced himself is a counter-productive dumpster fire, but at least it's free from the traditional, centralized narrative control system (that you somewhat seem to glorify).
