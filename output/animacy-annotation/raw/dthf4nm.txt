I used to go to pub trivia and literally stopped due to this. Our group would be, shit you not, 4 OR 22. 

Attempting to get exact numbers (or even a ballpark) was met with such indifference and willfully being obtuse about *finite space in a crowded bar* that I just stopped going. 

It was really off putting how causally unaware and indifferent they were about what the workers were going through, and how much harder we were making their jobs by being like "maybe 50, WHO KNOWS WILD CARDS!!" 

It felt so gross and entitled. I would get told "relax" a lot, because I suppose I was being too uptight about other people's time and trying to make their life not as hard as possible? I dunno.
