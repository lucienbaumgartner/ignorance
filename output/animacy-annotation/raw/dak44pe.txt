I think maybe I got a bit heated and made it sound like I'm a bit more militaristic about this than I actually intend. I don't mean to support actively threatening these people the same way they are threatening us, but instead to make sure that  we are capable and prepared to respond in kind for when they continue to perpetrate the same kind of violence that they've done time and again. My idea of making them afraid is not to make them fear for unprovoked attacks like they've been doing, but instead that they should be made to fear that their victims will not stand idly by and allow themselves to be trodden upon. That when these asshole *do* commit their next terrorist attack, they do so with less confidence and more fear, that their targets will be ready and prepared for them, not unaware and unarmed and unwilling to fight back. I want them to be afraid that they don't have the power they seem to think they have, to be afraid that they are reviled by people of every color, creed, orientation... to be afraid that literally every demographic this great country despises these thugs and bullies and criminals because they are the antithesis of what makes our nation great. That they should be afraid of resistance in every corner and in every endeavor until they are forced into obscurity or oblivion.
