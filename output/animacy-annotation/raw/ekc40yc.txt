The reason we are survivors is because we have lived through hell and continue to live through hell everyday for years, even the rest of our lives due to trauma. This trauma causes a lot of people to commit suicide. We survived that and now tell the story. I’m sorry you’re so childish and ignorant that you compare sexual assault to “being bitten by a cat.” I pity people like you who have a complete lack of emotional intelligence.
