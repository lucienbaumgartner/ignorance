I've seen it a couple of times and it never fails to takes me off the story because of how forced it looks. I thinks it's particularly present in sci-fi, anime and games and I often see it paired with another male-serving trope: "Born sexy yesterday", where characters are depicted as childlike, innocent, naive and unaware of their own sexuality while everyone else (specially the autor) is certainly not. Not sure if I'm allowed to post links here but "Pop Culture Detective" has a video with the name of this trope that further illustrates, Leeloo, the girl from the movie The Fifth Element being it's primary example.
Another quite recent example of the 'naked girl helper' trope can be found in Metal Gear Solid V with Quiet. She is a sniper who have the ability to breathe through her skin so to remain silent when sniping so she ... goes around in a bikini, and of course to ad salt to the insult is mute.
