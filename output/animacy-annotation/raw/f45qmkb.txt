In a comment a few days ago you said this;

&gt;Classical liberals

It's quite evident you are of a right-wing leaning.

And you are against liberals?

Assuming we use the classical definition of Liberal, which is the essence of the ideology behind modern Liberal Democracy and capitalism as is, a right-wing non-liberal ideology means you are either a Monarchist, Fascist or right-libertarian.

Now the odds are you are just politically and historically illiterate and unaware that the entirety of the Conservative party is in the classic sense of the word Liberal, but odds are you are just ignorant and are using the US pop media definition as a vague nonsensical insult.

Either way, that comment alone portrays a none zero chance of you holding a fascist, or fascist adjacent ideology.
