Girl, you need to delegate. Why did you not say anything when you came home to everyone sitting around? 

If you expect to have help getting things situated for dinner or for guests the next day, YOU NEED TO STATE THIS EXPLICITLY. I give my husband specific tasks: "Hey, I need to go to the grocery store because I'm going to cook X and Y. Those things can take me a long time, and there are a lot of tasks to do to get the house ready. Can you do A and B please?" And then I give tasks as I go along "Hey while I get X done can you please do Y so there isn't a huge mess in the kitchen?"

I don't do it in a bitchy voice. I'm just asking for help and letting him know what needs done. He's usually game. Sometimes he sighs as we all do, and I acknowledge that he's done a lot of tasks and appreciate his help. Sometimes his help comes in the form of staying out of my way or keeping the kids occupied--video games work!

Sometimes he feels I've sprung tasks on him when he was expecting a different plan for his evening. Fair enough. We work it out by negotiating, compromising, and working together. If you don't have a partner that acknowledges your needs, then you're in a shitty marriage. 

Does he help with the kids when you're out as a family? Like, is he involved with them? 

You need to put your foot down. He might just be unaware and happy to 'get away with' not helping because he doesn't understand the emotional burden it puts on you. 

Your kids are plenty old enough to help. Unplug the gaming console and tell your kids to get off their butts and help you put shit away or they won't have any more video games. Take charge.
