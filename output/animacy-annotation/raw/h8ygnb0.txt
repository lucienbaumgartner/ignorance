Am UK too and agree and feel the same way you do. Just when you thought American's (some - not all ) couldn't get anymore arrogant and ignorant of the world outside ~~their state~~ America , they start chatting shite about this horrific ( and rare for us) event. I swear they think the rest of us humans of the world live on Planet America and we and our cultures are mere NPC's. This is not normal for us at all , our last one was over a decade ago - thank fuck.
