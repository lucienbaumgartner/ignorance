&gt; Rule #2 No Off-Topic or Low Quality Content
Off-topic and low-effort content can flood the subreddit and drown out meaningful discussion. As such, it is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to:


&gt; Posts not related to competitive mode / Fortnite esports


This post is offtopic and low quality, it's literally a picture of his stats followed by him commenting to describe the same stats.  I'll refrain from telling people to stop posting offtopic spam on this sub if the mods ask me.  I could just report it but I hope that they're simply making a mistake and that they just weren't aware what this subreddit is for.  I've had a few people that genuinely seemed unaware and likely won't do it again.
