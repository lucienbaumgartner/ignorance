I need to apologize- until just now I hadn't noticed that you had no poops.  I am going to assume that this means you are new to this sub.  As such, I am also going to assume that you don't know that it is quite a tradition among us to label *everything* as OC.  Yes we do it on purpose.  Yes it triggers new people.  Look through posts on the sub, a whole ton of them are labeled as "OC."  I'm sorry that I didn't realize you were new and unaware that we intentionally label everything as OC here.
