Calling a [legitimate dialect of English ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English)  \(called *AAVE* or *African American Vernacular English*) primarily spoken by black people “*hood rat speech*” and “*internationally wrong*” is not only **insanely racist** it’s flat out wrong.  I’ll let [this blogpost on Language Jones](https://www.languagejones.com/blog-1/2014/6/8/what-is-aave)


&gt;	It [AAVE] is emphatically not bad English. It is a full-fledged dialect of English, just like, say, British English. It is entirely rule-bound -- meaning it has a very clear grammar which can be (and has been) described in great detail. It is not simply 'ungrammatical'. 


Maybe, instead of accusing other people of being uneducated for speaking a different dialect you should instead get yourself an education on the topic of linguistics. Because right now, essentially all your doing is screaming to the world “ I am so incredibly uneducated and ignorant that I legit think everyone else, including Webster’s dictionary and the entire academic  study of this topic is wrong, and not only that but I use my blantant ignorance to inflate my ego and make myself feel smarter. Please don’t listen to me!”
