Nothing is assumed or taken for granted by me and I think I made that clear in my post but that's not the relevant part..

Your point about slowing down though is good. I'm trying to calibrate and learn this which is why it's helpful to post here.

In the past I have attached quickly and then found out things that I don't like, and continued pushing through anyway in spite of it. Even getting into relationships. Then later I worry because we're not aligned meanwhile they're happy and unaware that something is bothering me even when I express it.

But I've grown a lot since then and concluded that it's better to just be upfront about the things that are important to me rather than just read between the lines all the time whilst people pleasing.
