i recently posted that i was unhappy and unaware that i would be recieving a welcome bag instead of a monthly bag. i was unaware until after i had signed up, but i reaches out to ipsy and they said apparently i was already shipped the october one, not a welcome bag and that i wouldn’t be receiving this. anyways, a lot of you requested to see it so here it is! it is pretty nice, except it wasn’t tailored to my profile, as the only thing in this bag i don’t have set to “rarely” is eyeshadow. i’m not a huge skincare fan.
