&gt; The thing is US is by every possible measure a lot more "predatory" than China. US is in a war almost every year.

This entire sentence is wrong. I'll explain why for one China is contained they don't have the power to dominate other countries because of US security guarantees. Taiwan wouldn't still be independent if the US went back to its isolationist ways for example. I'm not sure what news wars the US has gotten into lately but you'll have to expand on that. 

The rest of your comment is so opinionated and ignorant that I'm just going to let someone else take a stab at it I don't have the energy for that but I will say I just about disagree with everything said after that. Also you're a Chinese spook and a bad one at that. Lol
