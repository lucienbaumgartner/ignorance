It's called freedom of speech. People everywhere are gullible and ignorant, that started with the Clinton' Administration to dump down America and was very prevalent with the eight years of Obama. All the academic challenging standards have been removed from the k-12 curriculum and college/university programs. I left being a college professor because required standards and failed poor students. I was denied tenure because I wasn't student oriented, and not realistic to the students abilities. So left for software.
