You are giving them positive reinforcement. You're giving it to them for following your rules. The positive reinforcement is all of those luxuries you're not giving them when they break your rules. When they stop following your rules you stop giving it to them. In Pavlovian terms that's negative reinforcement, that is to say the removal of positive reinforcement, while what you're avoiding doing is positive punishment, that is to say the addition of punishment, as is right and proper.

Anyone who'd think that the removal of a luxury is a form of positive punishment would have to be pretty damned entitled and ignorant of where they come from.

Pretty damned hard to be the asshole in that situation. Furthermore anyone who'd be reinforcing that behavior would most definitely be the asshole and I would implore you to demonstrate this to then by bribing anyone that they're rewarding for things detrimental to yourself to do things detrimental to them.

Confining people to places and actively depriving them of what they'd otherwise be able to get for themselves is positive punishment though since it's actively making someones existence worse then the default state it would be in were you to not exist so depending on what you mean by grounding you might be the asshole.

You really should have known better then to allow idiots near your sensitive and valuable equipment though. You wouldn't have trusted a drunk person to avoid spilling shit all over a computer and that's generally what children are. Mentally impaired human beings.
