I'm confused and ignorant of how this works. So she got 7500 shares in Q1 let's say,  ur she didn't actually use the option to exercise a buy with those shares in Q1 and if she did all she could buy was 7500 shares @ 14.04? Do I have that right? Why didn't they just give her 7500 shares @ 14.04 instead of just giving her shares and saying use these to buy if you want to?
