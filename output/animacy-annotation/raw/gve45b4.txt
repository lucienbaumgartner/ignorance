Holy fuck that's some good history right there. However, I disagree with one statement:  


*We've been warned so many times... We've made the same mistakes so. many. times.*

***And we never seem to learn from them..***

&amp;#x200B;

The mistakes were made and the lessons were learned. It is being intentionally repeated and *directed* in order to manipulate the resulting benefits into the hands of those in control of the rigged game.

The game is based on forcing everyone into debt, charging interest for the privilege of having been loaned that debt, ensuring that you have a sliver of a chance at relative comfort but never to actually win (ie. gain control of the game), and keeping the population divided and ignorant of how badly they are being fleeced.

I have to say that I'm not surprised y the corruption, but I am shocked and dismayed at how long I and others have been successfully duped into believing that our system was more fair and equitable than it really is.

Debt to GDP ratio is leveraged to the max. There is no more wiggle room and the game is about to burn the house of matches to the ground. If there is to be any hope of coming back from this it will have to start with a currency backed by physical goods.  


You wouldn't happen to know if gold still exists at Fort Knox now would you?
