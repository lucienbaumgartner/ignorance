I'd just have to say that social constructs are not necessarily "sociocultural fiction." These terms shouldn't be used as synonyms for one another because the word "fiction" minimises the significance of certain social constructs. Morality, for example, may very well be a social construct, but it's not "sociocultural fiction." Morality is a complex system that is very real and that has a very real purpose. A moral system is a rulebook consisting of principles that draw a distinction between what is right and wrong or what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour or what actions are more virtuous than others. It's very real. The fact that it's subjective doesn't mean it's not real or that it can't be reasoned. Read any serious scholarly book about morality, and it will within seconds become obvious how much reasoning goes into establishing a consistent and "good" moral system, so much so that you wouldn't be able to properly understand the best of philosophers without sufficient background in philosophy. Peterson's lazy remarks just demonstrate how unaware and unfamiliar with philosophy he is.

And when it comes to his statements about patriarchy in the West and logical consistency within arguments, I really hope he was just trying to (and failing to) mimic and mock this idea of what feminism is that he has created for himself in his head.
