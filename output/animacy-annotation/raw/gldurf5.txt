I also like how despite Gene Roddenberry's not-so-subtle injecting his personal philosophy and beliefs (That he didn't exactly to follow himself in the slightest) into the early seasons of TNG, there are still moments where characters make arguments against it so you occasionally get a balanced view of things. Take Offenhouse for instance when talking about his accounts, Picard tells him he's basically being silly and unaware of how much time has passed and whats change and that personal wealth is no longer relevant:

**PICARD:** *'That's what this is all about? A lot has changed in the past three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We have grown out of our infancy.'*

**RALPH:** *'You've got it all wrong. It's never been about possessions. It's about power.'*

**PICARD:** *'Power to do what?'*

**RALPH:** *'To control your life, your destiny.'*

**PICARD:** *(Picard scoffs)* *'That kind of control is an illusion.'*

**RALPH:** *(Offenhouse smirking like he was hoping Picard would say that)* *'Really? I'm here, aren't I? I should be dead but I'm not.'*

He's got you there Picard, his wealth and acquiring of 'things' is what brought him to the 24th Century in the first place, without being able to buy a 'ticket' on the the cryogenic satellite he'd be long dead by now. So he *literally* was able to control his life and his destiny by, in essence, buying a ticket to the future with his personal wealth which is far from an 'illusion'.
