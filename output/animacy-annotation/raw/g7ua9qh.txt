How do you guys feel about subs that aren’t made political purpose, turning into a political propaganda machine for the left? 

It’s concerning because they might influence unaware and vulnerable people on Reddit. 

I get Reddit is left leaning and that’s fine, but the blatant left leaning informations could be perceived as the truth by default or from the perception of the popular vote. As we know people don’t bother trying to do their own research outside their bubble. 

Also I’m not against what’s goin on because of my political views. If the right did the same thing on Reddit to the same degree as the left, I would also be concerned.
