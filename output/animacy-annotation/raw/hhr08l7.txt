Smaller and skinner skins give for better movement and angles, and you can see over your skin better for edits and quick pumps.  With a bigger skin with a lot of colors and things hanging off the skin your eye can get distracted in technical fight and you could lose it due to distraction . And in case of some pros there are 100s of thousands on the line. As for the pickaxe, pros tend to use the ones that make the least amount of noise when pulling out and swinging. Over all itâ€™s aesthetic and how comfortable you feel moving around in a skin. I personally feel much slower and unaware of my surroundings with a big skin and a back bling. So I prefer the girl skins with smaller bodies and skinny figure.
