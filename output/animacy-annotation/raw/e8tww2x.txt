Listen man, white people do some fucked up things. That is not an excuse for the systematic racism that exists today. 


The majority of us white folks are fighting along side you. Trying to make changes with you, for all of us. The racism you see on TV an read in the news, it absolutely real, and we have a long way to go until shit is right. Those cases that we see are cause by a minority of white folks that are completely fucking ignorant. 


Trust me, I get it, this woman needs to face jail time. I get that when you posted this you were unaware she was face any sort of legal repercussion. When people bring it up after the fact and call you out. You gotta fess up and say, sorry I was unaware and mistaken. Otherwise it comes off badly and looks as if you are ignoring facts to purposely chastise white people in general.


I understand the anger, it would piss me off too, if I was on your side of this. Preferential treatment because of skin color is absolutely utter bullshit and shouldn’t happen. So let fight this shit together, positively, and better ourselves. Just because we don’t have the same skin color doesn’t mean you aren’t my American brother.
