Not at all, if you so determined to have the abortion, the three days is not gonna affect your decision at all. Are you so blind and ignorant that you not can not see that there are people out there who are in distress over there Situation and might make irrational decision over a spur of the moment. 

This is a major decision and every one should be free tho choose as they want, but there is nothing wrong with putting a safety net up. there are so many scenarios where this can go wrong.
A rational decision will not change after a three days, but one made in emotional turmoil or under pressure will probably change, so having that time to think it through is good thing.

It is there to protect people. And just because you are a strong willed emotionally stable person doesn't mean there are others who don't need that litle bit of a think pause. You just feel like you wont need this pause and make a fuss about a rule that might inconvenience you, well its not just about you.
