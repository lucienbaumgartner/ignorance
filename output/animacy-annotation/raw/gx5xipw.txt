neuralink/AI 

just to name ones off the top of my head. hes not just a scientist. hes an entrepreneur, a businessman, a father, a design engineer, a visionary, and much more. to say hes just doing the same thing as any other scientist is both completely dismissive and ignorant of his work (the neuralink has been classified by the FDA as a breakthrough medical device ALREADY)
