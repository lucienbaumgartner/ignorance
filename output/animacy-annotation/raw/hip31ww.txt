Every time this type of discussion comes up I question the sanity and self awareness of this community. 

It’s a compounding and self perpetuating issue because of how bad the average/typical player is and how unaware and unapologetic they are about it. Someone that’s smoking opens, leaving their man open, or turning over the ball is disproportionately more likely to do that the entire game than that to be a rare error. Since there’s no real point in messaging/talking after the game if the win is what you’re concerned with, it makes more sense to address it early and provide them with the awareness they lack. 

The thing with this is, even as someone prone to have a bad start here and there, it doesn’t happen unless you’re actually bad. That’s the part that gets lost in all the negativity. It’s a valid take and legitimate criticism an overwhelming majority of the time. 

Then there’s addressing communicating with randoms; they don’t listen. You can tell them the open icon, to switch/hedge, where/how to move off ball. It doesn’t matter. People play how they want to play. Which is why people don’t get on the mic anymore and why people are so quick to get on bad players. I don’t know anyone that actually plays the game that can constantly lose games because of one awful player and remain positive without simultaneously being that awful player having their mic and inbox flooded with negativity. 

I’d like to play the game where teamwork, communication, and cohesion happens and a bad start isn’t indicative of a bad player an overwhelming majority of the time, but it either doesn’t exist or isn’t 2K.
