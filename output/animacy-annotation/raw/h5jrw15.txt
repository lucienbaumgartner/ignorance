The American South has always been a festering wound, in a metaphorical sense. An incubator for all sorts of infectiously horrible things to grow from within. 

At least now it is also a festering wound in the literal sense too. Imagine being so god damn wicked and ignorant that your demographic becomes a bioweapon at the behest of none other than Donald fuckin Trump. For absolute shame.
