Lmao sorry that I had a typo writing but I fixed so you can now understand the point. Lying by omission is a real word look it up. He doesn't owe his family an explanation and OP probably should not have called his family but as I stated before since medicine is not 100 percent there is always that small chance of transmission. Is she just supposed to have sex with him without knowing then? When would the appropriate time so say anything be?? After sex?? I'm so sorry that stating facts makes me ignorant in your eyes. Yeah where he is coming from its probably hard and I feel for him but it still doesnt excuse him never mentioning it if he wants sex with her. Obviously you dont need willy nilly mention it on a first date but you sure should mention it sometime before you start having sex. I'm sorry you find it so offensive and ignorant that you just have honest talks in a relationship. Theres plenty of people who would be okay with him having HIV and many who wouldn't hence why being honest is IMPORTANT. Have a great evening luv calling me ignorant doesnt change facts.
