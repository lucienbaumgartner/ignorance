&gt; It's not a case of special pleading or any other fallacy

Well you're half right. It's actually much more like constructing an entirely new category of metaphysical concept with no actual sound external justifications whatsoever that *oh just so happens* to specifically fit the idea of a god better than no god. And is completely undemonstrable in any way and therefor also unquestionable and unfalsifiable. How convenient and not at all suspicious. lol

So, is there a name for the fallacy of just constructing a completely unfalsifiable idea out of whole cloth and then acting like it actually and justifiably applies to reality?

I'm not sure. I spend less time trying to memorize jargon and history lessons and more time just actually making sense of things on my own, quite frankly.

You seem to believe that you have a couple thousand years worth of well justified arguments to support your position. Oh how ignorant and arrogant you must think I am then.

Except... none of your guys' arguments for 3000 years have ever amounted to anything more than navel-gazing. Literally. I'm sorry; I can certainly understand how you must probably think I am just like a cave-man with no idea what I'm talking about lol

But believing that you have a good argument here does not actually make what you have a good argument here.

Why should that which exists be anything like the God of classical theism?
