It depends on what you mean by "worst". To me, it can either mean the most despicable character or the one who is most poorly developed by writers. In the first category, Peggy wins every time for me. In the second, I always felt the Luanne deserved much better stories. I thought she was always written as stupid when in fact she's really just uneducated and ignorant of many (but not all) things. She's shown to be a gifted auto mechanic early on in the series, something I always hoped would be developed but was essentially dropped by writers. I really wanted her to end up owning and operating her own garage.
