If the label really bothers you, give him some time. My husband is bi but only realized it and came out after he met me. Fifteen years later, I transition, and he gets to kind of explore that side of himself. But unlike me, he's never been in the queer community before, and it's been a bit of an experience for him. He can get embarrassed to say it and he doesn't know how people will react. Obviously this is still exciting for him because he's bi so he's more inclined to push through embarrassment, but your partner may become more comfortable with the label over time.

That said, I don't know, this is really hard. I've gone through periods with more or less interest in him (obviously, we've been together over fifteen years lol, that's a whole chunk of time to be with one person.) Personally though, my interest in my husband has never been higher. I'm so much happier being able to be an out queer man, I love that people see us that way even with our kids in tow, I am way more interested in sex than I ever have been, and having his support has made me more keen to be with him. I'm not a particularly... Dependent or romantic person either. There have been many times I've wondered why he even stays with me because I'm a inclined to be a independent, moody, distant, asshole. ðŸ˜‚ But I think... I don't know, man. Like. I get wondering what else is out there, if you're just with them out of convenience or because they were there. And that's really really hard. Have you considered couples counseling or something like that? Is he aware you feel this way? Or does he seem happy and complacent and unaware of any of this?
