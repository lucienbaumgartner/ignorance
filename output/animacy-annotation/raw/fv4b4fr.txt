Ugh I went to one of these schools. It is fucking sad and eye opening to see peers from my class reflect back on their discomfort and bullshit racist experiences. I was so unaware and ignorant. I feel ashamed of my school and myself. 
Thank you to all who shared their stories, that can not be easy, but is certainly necessary to continue to show why the BLM movement is so important.
