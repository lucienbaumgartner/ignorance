No I mean there was a diverse group of people with varying goals - I've done my best to participate and learn in various anti racism protests, teach ins,  for many many years.

The reform the police group was always challenged by those who pushed post police alternatives - of course many of those people didn't necessarily mean complete abolition, but there were some who did have plans that encompassed such things - others who had gradualist approaches.

There's a whole spectrum of values and views.


Yes right wingers will bullshit and lump everyone in with an extreme view, and represent it by trying to associate it with people they paint as young and ignorant.

That doesn't erase the real diversity of views on possible types of reforms and their varying scopes
