Same thing, I’m from a small, very middle class, private school. Since we’re from the province, everyone knew each other and we’re nice to one another. We would even lend each others’ gadgets so no one felt left out. We also have social awareness but did not have the right tools (eg critical thinking) to process our thoughts on certain issues (this is why some of my schoolmates grew up to become DDS). My boyfriend came from a “rich kid’s” all boys private school in Metro Manila. Social awareness is deeply ingrained into the curriculum of my boyfriend’s school since elementary because it’s a Jesuit university (I ended up meeting him in college). But a lot of them are still sheltered and unaware of ordinary Filipino life. The contrast between my school and my boyfriend’s is immense.
