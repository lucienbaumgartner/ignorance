You don't even know what I'm talking about from such a vague statement. I was actually speaking about how the older generation need to shut up and listen about how the world is. Listen that being non straight isn't a disease or wrong in any way, that gender roles are pointless and any other things they seem to think are diseases/wrong/newly "invented". So really in your example of their "experience", is that their experience is that being phobic and ignorant of anything of what i mentioned is completely acceptable and of theyre old enough their experience is that these things were either illegal or forbidden.
