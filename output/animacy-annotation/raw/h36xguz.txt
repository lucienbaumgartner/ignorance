Looking great! Nice visual and graphics, especially for only being three months in! 

My main criticism would be directed towards the enemy's behavior. They seem mostly non-threatening and a bit sluggish and unaware of you. 

But overall very solid. I'd say you're off on the right foot. Can't wait to see more.
