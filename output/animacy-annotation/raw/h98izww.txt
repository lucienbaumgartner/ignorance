Of course, I agree with you on many things. There are far more than looks and age in a meaningful relationship. That doesn't contradict what I'm saying here. But we also have to understand that we are in many ways animals and we're attracted to certain things. Sure once we establish a relationship, we can build meaningful thing and go beyond superficial things.

Yes those things may seem rigid, but we are rigid in terms of what we're attracted to. Again, it's nature and you can negotiate attraction, regardless of how ethical or unethical some of those things tend to be.

As for OP. Look, let's imagine a guy meets 2 women, 1 is 20, has had 1 ltr partner, is maybe naive but with good standards and is not willing to trade her looks and body for quick validation, wants to build a meaningful relationship. 2nd is 25 yo who has never managed to build or maintain ltr, has mental issues, has had many sex partners. At the stage of trying to meet a guy, any man would undoubtedly chose the 1st one, hands down. It has nothing to do with mysoginy it's about the qualities men are attracted to. You can't negotiate that. Period. All I'm doing is pointing to what the person doesn't realise. And personally I'm a bit pissed off that people have turned so narcissistic and ignorant of how things are, they are being told lies that they believe in, and when their unrealistic expectations get crushed they suffer. This is why we need to start looking real at life, without bloody sugar coating stuff.
