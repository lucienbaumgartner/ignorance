You could've done better than a 33 on the ACT; that's so disappointing. A real straight-A student would have prepared and at least score in the 99th percentile. I got a 35, so at least I can sleep at night knowing I didn't **underperform**. Just imagine the admissions officers that will cringe when they see that score.

Do you see how offensive and ignorant that sounded? A-'s happen, Bs happen, and Ls happen. That's just life; we live in an imperfect world. Grades are not everything, so they don't define you. Some A students are dicks, some B students are the nicest people you'd ever meet, and some C students will be more successful than you outside the classroom. People on here are aiming for the top, so all you're doing is making them feel insecure about themselves. You're not going to get far in life with that mindset, so I recommend you change it now before life forces you to change it later.
