That's okay of they don't have exemptions for the immune compromised.  Why?  Because they're protecting their well being as well.  

I, as vaccinated person can spread the virus, but I'm far less likely to do so.

I, as a vaccinated person, don't have the mindset of you anti-vaxxer nuts who remain selfish and ignorant of this disease and many others.  I take precautions by still masking despite being vaccinated.  I don't visit places that are crowded, low volume enclosures, with poor air flow and air exchange.  Fundamentally, I understand the gravity of this pandemic and what is required for me, as a productive and responsible member of society, in order to both survive and ensure the well being of others.
