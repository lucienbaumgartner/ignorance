Of all the example for "capitalism good" you are giving the US, which is the fucking worst in that regard? Hence, the major shift to the left of the (younger) population? (by left I mean, going more normal European center-right/center-left).

&gt; At least it doesn't punish successful people, like, you know, kulaks and so on. 

You are comparing 2 ideologies for economics systems by...giving an example for one of the ideologies with one event in history of a dictatorship that didn't abide to that ideologies' ideals?

If you think that capitalism doesn't punish successful people by using force/violence, then you are more naive and unaware of what is happening in the world than I initially thought. Your very own examples are examples of such events, lmao.
