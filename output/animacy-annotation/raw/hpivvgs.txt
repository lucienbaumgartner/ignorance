&gt;cars are pieces of heavy machinery that maim and kill a ridiculous amount of people a year

And they’re also a necessity for at least 90% of Americans to go about their daily lives. As a rough guess, I’d estimate about 10-20% of Americans enjoy or have a moderate interest in cars beyond an “it gets me from a to b” viewpoint. 

To be so aggressively against a necessity of modern life is not *technically* wrong but *is* pretty ignorant and antisocial in-and-of-itself
