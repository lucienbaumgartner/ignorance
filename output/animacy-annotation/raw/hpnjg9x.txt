It's a very nuanced issue but clearly you are too ignorant and biased to understand that..The accelerated change is small and will likely happen over decades and there is nothing we can do to stop it, only slow it down, slightly....we adapt far quicker than climate changes....now we could debate those issues but what isn't up for debate is every decade for the last 50 years climate zealots tell us the earth is on the brink ..if you want a good laugh go watch an inconvenient truth...Al gore's climate movie from 2000...all these supposed top (well paid) researchers were saying new York and Miami would be under water by now...and that climate change would cause mass famine in the US....yet none of that was remotely accurate..the US produces more food now than it ever has..and last I checked Miami isn't under water...if you actually step away from your clear personal bias you will notice they have a habit of being wrong every single time.
