Did you even read the full quote? The paradox of tolerance literally states that you must match like for like against the intolerant.

They use words, you use words. They use fists, you use fists. They use knives, you use knives. All in an effort for it to not reach the point of using guns.

Escalation of conflict is not something that the tolerant do, it's the intolerant and ignorant that first resort to it.

The intolerant and ignorant attack, the tolerant defend themselves.
