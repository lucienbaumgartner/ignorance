How can be blame her for her stupidity? He also made her too ambitious, to where she wanted the power that the serpent promise the fruit would give her. And he made her naive, and unaware that being deceived is even a *possibility*. The same reason you can dress in a cow suit and walk up to a bunch of cows grazing. They never have encountered something that looks like a cow that isn't a cow, and they aren't creative enough to realize that it is a possibility.
