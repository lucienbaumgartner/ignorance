This is one of the most frustrating videos on YouTube, I stumbled on it a few months back and just wanted to punch the guy in the face. 

1. You won’t just beat the best player in the world. 
2. You can’t just memorize the best moves engines show because chess is so large you need to understand the game outside of memorization. 
3. He is so stupid and unaware that chess is large that his “algorithm” never finishes, no shit. 
4. The disrespect to make magnus come out (probably paid yeah) and then to not engage even studied for a minute? 
5. He claims he had magnus on the ropes the first 8  moves or so and tries to make magnus seem like he was nervous. Nah dude he said you were good through 8 moves cause you didn’t make any obvious stupid blunders and he was being nice. 
6. He has a punchable face and voice. 
7. His whole mission is stupid and based on winning useless bragging rights. 

If anything, I would have just memorized one of magnus games where he tends to follow the same lines pretty deep and mastered one single line and prayed. Magnus isn’t dumb though he would probably play unconventional moves to avoid issues with this dweeb.
