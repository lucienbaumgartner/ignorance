NTA. You did the right thing informing your husband. So he is not caught in the middle and unaware of all the facts. You enabled him to have all the information. He made up his own mind to confront his mother. It would be unfortunate if she guilts him into backing down. You need to talk with him and come to an understanding of how you will stand together on this. Or seek counselling. If you don't stand together, she will use the gap to drive you apart and destroy your marriage.  You have the text message as clear evidence of her mindset. that was enough for your husband to act, and you should continue to hold to the facts. You were sick, and she sent a "sick" text expressing considerable hatred.
