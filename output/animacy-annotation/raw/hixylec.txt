&gt;victims are deserving of being stolen from

Yeah, because they were not smart enough, whether in hard rules or soft rules, to not be stolen from

For example when a large company is hacked and had data stolen from them they deserved it. Because they SHOULD suffer the PR nightmare of having the data stolen so that they understand the value of other people's privacy. Just because you are lax on hard security does not mean it isn't your fault when someone tries your door and clears you out. Do your due diligence.

Honor among thieves is to break your system and take a little bit, like a tax, but not to actually harm and destitute you. This is actually beneficial because it creates the proper incentives for people to do their jobs right. Laws are useless if not enforced, and crime is a natural enforcement strategy.

For soft rules I mean stuff like social engineering. There is no excuse to remain naive and ignorant of other people's character. Without learning to navigate soft rules you would stumble on yourself through social situations in your personal life and be a burden onto your friends and family, a "victim" of your bad social skills. Being grifted by conmen who prey on emotional weakness encourages people to develop emotionally and interpersonally, and subsequently become productive members that contribute to their communities socially instead of just carry an entitled victim mentality that drains others and pity mines them.
