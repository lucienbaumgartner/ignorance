&gt; but the most vulnerable people in vic do not have to pay for it

I guess it depends on how you define "vulnerable".

To me, a vulnerable person is anybody that doesn't have ambulance cover and isn't aware it is required.

That includes new arrivals who have moved to Victoria and therefore are not covered by foreign travel insurance (because travel insurance only covers you for complete return journeys, not a one-way move).

Or those who have moved from interstate and are completely unaware and unprepared for the large disparity in ambulance call-out fees.

What about the poor who are not on a form of social welfare and who aren't aware of the necessity to pay if they should ever need an ambulance?

My point is these people are all vulnerable - and the worst part is that the bill shock would be presented at a very low point in their life if they were also suffering a medical condition that necessitated an ambulance.

Let's face it - Victoria is full of nasties. You could be the healthiest person in the world but unlucky enough to be bitten by a snake.

Surely a state with plenty of natural risks to life should provide a safety net for everyone?

Of course you don't want people calling out willy-nilly - and some form of charge is possibly appropriate - but I think $1,100+ is crossing a line of reasonableness.
