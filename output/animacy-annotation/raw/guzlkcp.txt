"How he tried to become a dictator by being against authoritarian lockdowns"

Hmmm.....makes sense I guess?

"How he let 500,000 people die from COVID"

Trump isn't the president moron.

"How he sided with white nationalists"

Oh I see how you could think Trump is still president. You're really fucking dumb and also don't know what Google is.

"How he took children from their parents and put them in camps"

I truly don't even have a response to this one. I can't imagine being this stupid and ignorant of how the world around you works. I'm glad you live in a sheltered, gated community where mommy and daddy keep you safe from all the bad guys in the world.
