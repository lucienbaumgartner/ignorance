People in this sub are so fucking dumb and ignorant that they always forget Gon`s Strongest strenght: His intuition + Natural Animal instincts. 

"HJUR DUR KILLUA CAN DESTROY GON"

"HUR DUR KILLUA JUST KILLS GON LMAO"

"HUR DUR KILLUA DOES NOT EVEN NEEDS GODSPEED"

"LMAOOOO SPEEED = STRENGHT""


Shut the fuck up.

Pre Gon-san Could just predict Killua's Attack and Just uses Gyo in his Vital Body's Part. But i Wont lose my time discussing with Killua's fanboys who says that Speed is the most important thiung in Hunter x hunter. You guys Compare FEITAN to the F Silva and Zeno, i wont lose my time.
