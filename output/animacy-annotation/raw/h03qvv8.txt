Yes, it is certainly possible. Especially if you have DID. I also have DID, this is why I know. If this was happening, the most likely scenario would be that an alter who was created to take the abuse switches in while it happens and that protects you from the memory of it. This is why DID happens in the first place, a defense mechanism to keep part of you functional and unaware of the abuse. I don’t know what your situation is, but I hope you’re able to get out of there as soon as possible.
