&gt;By stating that 'white males' as simply pissed off that they can't rape or lynch black people anymore is so insulting and ignorant that it's actually harmful

This is literally what 'Make America Great Again' means - turning back the clock to the good old days when men could slap women's asses in public and black people showed deference towards their 'masters'.

&gt;What privilege they did have was won through collective action and an understanding of their own class position facilitated by mass industry which brought them all together 

On top of being white men, their privilege comes from the fact that their parents fucked in the richest country in the world. There are over half a billion people in the world living on less than $1.90 a day. So excuse me for not caring about the racist dickhead complaining about not being able to pay off his widescreen TV because 'Mexicans stole his job'.
