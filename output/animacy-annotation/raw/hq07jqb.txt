NTA - "Still happy and unaware of the shit storm  of emotions about to rain upon him" I know you are pissed, but I had to point the best part of your rendition. 

Why your husband set his Mom up for failure is mind boggling. He half hearted gave you a gift card (I know you asked for it but he could have added something more personal). Then had his Mom give you a cookbook that would pretty much be for him also? I hope that rain was sizzling hot.
