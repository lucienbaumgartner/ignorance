&gt;	Not only that but you’re flat out wrong. The jim crow era didn’t start until after reconstruction so it wasn’t “the entire time after the Civil War.”

You're right. Less than 10 years later. I should have said "basically the entire time since the end of the war"

&gt;	So not only are you so fragile and ignorant that you have to veer off into inane non-topical arguments to defend yourself emotionally, but the inane non-topical arguments that you make are bullshit also

Fragile? I think you're projecting there.
