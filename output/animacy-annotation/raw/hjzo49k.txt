There are expensive things in crypto, even overpriced things. But that doesn't mean there aren't any cheaper and more affordable things as well.

If the only exposure you got from NFTs are 300k monkey jpegs, it's understandable to think it's only "for the rich" but that viewpoint is very narrow and ignorant of the rest of the ecosystem.

The "sci-fi dream future" is already here, like it or not. Anything else is ignorance at this point.
