&gt; If one knows that a word/phrase is harmful to a marginalized group of people and continues to use that word/phrase regardless, then yes, that person is in fact propagating harm against that group of people.

I think the whole point is that they do not "know" this, although the use of "know" seems to assume that they have correctly identified a fact. So, rather, the whole point is that they do not *think* this.

&gt;Are you gay? Are you a woman?

I'm not sure why you're asking me this, it definitely has no baring on the assertion you quoted. I'm scared you may be wanting to make a personal attack on either my gender or sexuality, so I decline to answer.

&gt; You realize you're judging me by saying this right?

No, i'm not. I used the conditional "if". *If* you are the kind of person that tries to smear people by labeling them with some of the worst traits humanity has to offer: homophobic, sexist, etc., without so much as a shred of evidence, but based entirely on a few innocent words, then yes, I think I can quite rightly judge you.

 Plus, I'm not sure why if I were judging you, it would have any baring on the validity of that judgement as we can all distinguish between a good judgement, and a reckless, unaware and offensive judgement.
