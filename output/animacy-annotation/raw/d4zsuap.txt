Been commanding multiloot squads for a long time now, as the scene has gained significant popularity and exposure the inevitable mixture of attitudes has occurred. 

Some players just like to relax and go at a soft pace, making decent gold without much thought or effort, it is a game after all. 

Others only find things enjoyable when they are done at their most efficient (or as close to as is reasonable). They strive for excellence even if it is just a game and are entertained by how close they can get to the optimum.

The nature of multiloot squads however is that generally having a substantial mix of both groups of people will lead to players in the second group being disappointed whereas those from the first group would remain unaware and happy. More vocal people in the second group try to prevent this from happening by advocating techniques to shift the squad towards their interests. 

Fortunately it is up to the commander to decide what type of squad they want. If you want a laid back group, just say so, if people still insist on spreading dissent then kick them. If you want a more efficient group then perhaps change your lfg details, maybe write a concise explanation of squad rules a few mins before meta starts and feel free to kick people who refuse to co-operate.

Just be prepared for hate whispers whichever way you go, you'll get a bunch over time (I'm a group 2 btw).
