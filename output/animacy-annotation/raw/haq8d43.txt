Like others have said, if we look away from the government and from what atrocities it commits not only abroad but to its own citizens, you see a nation of kind and welcoming people, albeit somewhat deluded and ignorant of the wider world. Friendly people ruled by a bunch of ruthless sociopaths. 

The collapse of the USSR was a disaster for the USA - it left it without an opponent, a solitary global hegemony. Before 1991, any war, any intrusion in a sovereign nation’s affairs could easily be excused as “a fight against communism”, so a new boogyman had to be invented. Between 2001 and 2021 it was “the war on terror”. And from the looks of it, China will be the next opponent.

Internationally no one likes the American government or their foreign policy - it’s intrusive, it’s disrespectful and antagonistic. And it doesn’t help that in the US it often is portrayed as “we wagged our fingers to them foreigners and told them to do things right”.

In simpler terms, the US can be described as a dangerous lunatic with a gun. Best not anger them and give them what they want, because they can and have killed before for less.
