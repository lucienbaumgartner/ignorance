Ask then. Stop throwing your hatred of HIV+ men onto others . Your comments are hurtful , biased and ignorant of the fact there is an enormous population of pos men In urban areas of the U.S. they are not unworthy of love and marriage . And while you’re at it volunteer at an AIDS project near you. See it from their viewpoint . Perhaps broaden your vision a bit? I can’t believe  you’re gay. Where were you in the epidemic ? in fact , please block me . I don’t want to know anyone like you with the hatred you hold for other gay men. I hope you have more compassion if your friends become pos . They will need you
