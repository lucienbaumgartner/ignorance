Quite honestly I don’t understand how being able to love who you love is offensive to people unless they’re literally making love. In public. Right in front of their face.

Previously in the thread you said that the West is more sexually liberated than other parts of the world, don’t you think this should be taken in a positive way where people actually start to educate themselves more on their bodies, other sexualities and the different types of people in the world rather than keeping themselves unaware and uneducated to the point where they are intolerant because of their lack of information.
