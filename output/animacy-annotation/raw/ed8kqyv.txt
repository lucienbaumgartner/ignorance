The problem is that this shouldn't be a fight. You shouldn't need to flip both houses of congress with a supermajority in order to fix such an obviously compromised president. I don't just mean compromised in terms of foreign adversaries having leverage, though that is concerning. I mean also that he is clearly so childish, narcissistic, and ignorant that he is making snap decisions that anyone in any party *should* be able to see are damaging to the United States and its allies.   


People of both parties should be lining up to show this guy the door. The fight should be over exactly which partisan hack should replace him, not over whether he should be replaced.
