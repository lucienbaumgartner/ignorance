Reading this made me feel really sad for you, OP. And angry as well - you were robbed of that dress, of feeling good about yourself, of having fun. It was very selfish and ignorant of your mother to do that stuff, it really feels like projection on her part. 

I don't think it is silly to complain about it at all, no matter what age you might be now. You were actively sabotaged and part of you was never allowed to live. I completely understand how crushing it must have been for you then, and how much it sounds like it affects you to this day.
