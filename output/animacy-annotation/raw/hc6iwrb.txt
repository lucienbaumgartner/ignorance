You're making tons of unfounded assumptions and sweeping generalizations that do not track at all with  my experience doing research over the past year and actually becoming a real estate investor myself.

You do not need 20% down, that is false, and there are programs to help poor buyers including again no down payment options.

The expensive homes where you live are not "the only ones that are going to hold value." That's frankly pretty pompous and ignorant of housing prices. Relatively few areas are actually depreciating it's not that difficult to pick them out.

People do exactly what you say and buy reasonably priced homes in small cities or developing neighborhoods or even rural areas and make good cashflow from them. Or having the homes they buy appreciate and trading up. I talk to them every day and I see the math and that's why I became one of them.

Maybe where you live and with your situation it really isn't a good idea to buy still. But it's an example of a thing plenty of people could do more easily than they think and can be a great vehicle to build wealth. But what do I know, I'm only actually *doing it* lol
