sped - teaching from home this week. in a weird way, I was almost relieved during my live sessions. it was like, for 10 minutes I could read my kids a story or do some mindless counting activity with them smiling a little too close to the screens, not really getting much out of the exercise but just really happy to see their friends on camera... just happy and unaware of the chaos going on. idk.. sometimes distractions are nice
