&gt;&gt; No. You're incredibly biased and ignorant of military reality.
&gt;
&gt;But I'm still right... Bias or not, you have admitted this. It's advisable that you just accept your idiocy by now.

Europe fundamentally cannot help Ukraine militarily. You are 100% incorrect for thinking they can. Russia will destroy any shipments that present a threat 

All you do is change the topic. But that doesn't change that Europe can't help Ukraine. And you seriously don't understand how national defense works

First of all, upgrading a soviet era tank missile system fundamentally shows they can't develop one on their own and relied on Soviet-era hardware. Second of all, that missile system is 100% redundant to a Russia tank brigade supported by air cover and infantry. It would be destroyed from the air before the tanks were within firing range. Ukraine doesn't have an airforce capable of securing it's own airspace against Russia, it doesn't have the stealth technology to evade Russia, and it doesn't have the capability of developing it themselves.
