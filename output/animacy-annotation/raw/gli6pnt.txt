Sometimes the Romans killed because it was kill or be killed, sometimes the Romans killed because it was more convenient than leaving a potential enemy alive (i.e. the Genocide of Jews after the Kitos Wars or the eradication of Carthage) and sometimes the Romans killed for fun like in the colosseum. It's a lot easier to summarize the 3 on top because they all fell within a century or less, whereas the Romans and Byzantines lasted over a thousand years. Like any global superpower that lasts a long time, they did some good and a whole lot of bad. 

To answer your question, saying Romans were as bad as the CSA or Nazis is just untrue and ignorant of the ancient world and how warfare was approached by not just the Romans, but by their contemporaries as well which were a far cry from the neighbors that Germany annexed.

The post is just a joke and I thought it was funny but there's a lot of misinformation in this thread
