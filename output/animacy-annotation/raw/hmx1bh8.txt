You seem very angry right now. If you're not, it sure as hell seems like it. And considering you've been quite upset to several people in responding comments so far, it's hard to tell it's not an insult when it sure seems like it. People can't discern tone over the internet. 

&gt;I'm done dealing with you two. You're boring and rude and unaware of what discussion means. Hopefully you post somewhere else so I can watch the downvotes flood in

Boring? People trying to have a discussion with you is boring? And you have quite consistently been the rude one on this entire damn thread, nor are you aware that you're being so damn rude. Nor do you realize that you singlehandedly turned what could've been a calm discussion about the pros and cons of the map for the various killers into a salt fest that's been spurred on by you. 

Nobody's been rude to you, in fact we've been trying to stop you from being rude to us. We know what discussion means. You're the one who attacked people for not agreeing with your point of view from the very beginning. 

I'm watching you get downvoted to shit right now, but you don't see me saying anything about it.
