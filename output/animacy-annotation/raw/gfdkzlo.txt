When shitty players band together with other shitty players, they tend to be far more prone to shitty behavior than if they were on their own. You asking a tank to use cooldowns in expert roulette sounds like a reasonable thing, and if that tank was on his own I imagine the rest of your group wouldn't just votekick you for saying that. But because he was with his friend he probably votekicked you for spite.

There's not much you can do about it, it's the mentality of "you don't pay my sub" and "don't tell me how to play", and it doesn't matter how petty and ignorant that is, if there's 2 people together with the same mentality they control the votekick and you get to suffer for speaking up.
