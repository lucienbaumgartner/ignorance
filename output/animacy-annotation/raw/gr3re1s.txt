You were talking with bunch of people convinced by the ruling party that other parties are useless because they don't rule right now. Opposition can only voice their objections and that's ok. It doesn't make them useless. PiS propaganda is astonishingly effective in creating an illusion that they are the only reasonable choice. Polish voters are inexperienced and unaware of those tricks  so propaganda works.
