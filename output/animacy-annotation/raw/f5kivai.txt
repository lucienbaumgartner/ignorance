When people say things like that I want to scream. It’s awful and ignorant that people would comment things like that to any marginalized group, let alone one that is still actively subjugated by many colonial federal governments.

I’m Canadian, and not directly Indigenous myself, although it has be very important to me to be an active and respectful piece of the Indigenous community. People who say things like “First Nations people don’t have it that bad” should really take a look at Canada’s Indian Act. It is a document enacted shortly after confederation that literally dictates every aspect of Indigenous people’s lives and exactly how the Indigenous people of Canada should behave in order to be good, “civilized”, law abiding, (read: white) citizens.
