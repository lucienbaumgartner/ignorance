Transwomen have been allowed to compete in women's sports at the Olympic level since 2004, yet not a single transwoman has medaled in that time.

From Google:

"In 2021, the IOC approvedÂ Laurel Hubbard, a trans woman, to compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics in weightlifting. Hubbard became the first out trans woman to compete at the Olympics; she did not complete her lifts and won no medals."

Of all sports this supposed "male strength" should apply, it would be weightlifting, and she couldn't even get the damned bar over her head. This point is such drivel and ignorant of the actual world around you.

BTW, my degree is in Biophysics. ;)
