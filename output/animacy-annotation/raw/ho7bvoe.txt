evaluating avy danger isn’t objective by any means. you can dig a test pit that shows no signs of sliding only to trigger a d3 on an adjacent face. you can bomb the shit out of a hill only for it to slide when the first skier drops in. risks were high today but even professionals make decisions that were poor in hindsight. calling them “morons” is classless and ignorant of how easy it is to make mistakes in avalanche terrain.
