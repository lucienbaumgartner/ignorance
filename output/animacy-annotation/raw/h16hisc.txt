person without chronic pain and fatigue: you just need to reset your body and the pain and fatigue will go away! :)

Honestly takes every bone in my spiteful little body to not reflexively tell people to eat shit when they talk about my illness because it seems people are physically incapable of not saying something stupid and ignorant that gaslights me into thinking I caused my own illnesses.
