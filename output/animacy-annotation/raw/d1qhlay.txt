I'm not claiming that vaginal wetness is the ultimate sign of sexual arousal. Not at all. 

I am saying that self-reports are not the be-all and end-all measures of human experience *especially* regarding motivation. People are quite good at knowing and expressing what they like and dislike. However, they are absolutely abysmal at describing their arousal and motivations. That's why physiological measures of arousal and motivation, like skin conductance responses, EEG, facial EMG, cardiac, etc., are used by emotion and motivation researchers.  

People may lie about their motivations, but it's often not a case of lying, but of being unaware and unable to verbalize because motivation goes on below conscious awareness. 

Of course self-reports have value. But they are just one form of data, not the last word. .
