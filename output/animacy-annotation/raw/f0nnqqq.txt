She recruited over 1000 new members to NXIVM from the ages of 30-42.  The article mentions she opens the book up with a story about her being branded to engage the reader.   It would seem that would now make her the main victim of her story.  I likely will not read this book, however, it would be interesting to see how this story is told from her perspective. Does she understand she created a lot of victims, even though she claims “she never lied”?  And even if she didn’t lie, turning a blond eye to a crime you are an accomplice to is not “something to hang your hat on.”  Not recognizing something like the group you join and remain with for 12 years is a sex cult and you are recruiting the women needed for this would seem to be negligence at the least.  Of all 1000+ recruits, did no one ever mention being victimized to her?  

I don’t know all the considerations that went into her actions, but am having a hard understanding how she could be so naive and unaware that she is innocent. Maybe I’m biased.  Send some perspective this way.
