**Survivor U.S. Season 21 - Nicaragua**

**Russian Survivor community ranking - 35/40**

**My personal ranking - 32/40**

**My ranking of this season's players:**

**20. NaOnka Mixon (587 out of 590).** This one is another universally hated player. Socially Inadequate and unaware of her own disgusting behavior. At some point I even wondered whether she was a former drug addict because that's how they behave. Rough, rude, what else... Female Ben Browning. But Ben didn’t at least quit, so he’s little higher in the rankings. She tackled a girl with a prosthesis instead of a leg, all for the sake of a clue to a HII - in our culture that is disgusting for almost everybody. Another moment of my total contempt with her is that she didn't give up her reward, although she already knew that she was leaving - it's also a shitty act. I was extremely pleased to see how contemptuously the remaining participants and members of the jury looked at her when she was quitting and especially liked the laugh of Fabio when she suggested that her torch also should be snuffed, like the torches of all other eliminated castaways. 

**19. Jane Bright (515 out of 590).** At first I felt sorry for Jane and how her alliance kicked her out, but then I started thinking. And I realized that Janne acted like a sore loser. And I don't like sore losers. She's just one of the many people in this game that were betrayed. At least her alliance told her openly that they would vote her out, not blindside her as a fool. Fabio won immunity, what can you do... Somebody had to be voted out. Why act so childish? There is, of course, one circumstance that doesn't sit well with this, and the name of this circumstance is Dan. Why didn’t they vote hime out... He would've never won a challenge, but Jane could do it... 

**18. Wendy DeSmidt-Kohloff (445 out of 590).** Brenda was very different in her two seasons. In the first season she tried to apply Parvati's strategy of flirting, for which I didn't like her very much. However, she left earlier than I thought (Brenda's name was known to me before watching Nicaragua, so I thought she had reached Final Five or Four), and maybe didn't have enough time to influence me any more. Caramoan - I was sentimental here. Brenda has shown up with any words, by and large, in three or four of her last episodes, and I personally felt nasty when Dawn voted for her (I don't think she would've ruined her zero game if she didn't vote for her). You'll probably say, well, Brenda got Dawn's jaw out of the lake, you know, Dawn doesn't owe her life after this. No, of course she doesn't. But I still think that she could have not voted for Brenda at her boot Tribal. Especially considering how badly she was freaking out when she lost her teeth. Brenda - one Lowe! 

**17. Dan Lembo (423 out of 590).** Of course, Dan is one of the most trainwreck challenge competitors in Survivor history. And of course he made it so far into the game because he happened to find his place in the right alliances. This is on one hand. On the one hand, I was rooting for Fabio (because I wanted the underdog to win this over strategists), and Dan totally bashed both Sash and Chase at the Final Tribal Council. But still, really, I can't put a man who is not able to, like, jump and walk fast, high in my rankings. 

**16. Shannon Elkins (414 out of 590).** Objectively, I know, Shannon s\*cks. Well, like on the first day he told Chase that a woman can't win Survivor. Then, when things didn't go according to his plan and his alliance crubmbled, he dug a grave for himself at the Tribal Council. Why didn't I put him lower then, you might ask? Maybe I'm not a fan of voting out physically strong tribe members in the very first stages of the game, when you need to keep the tribe together. And secondly, Shannon planned to kick out Naonka - the trash bucket of Survivor. 

**15. Jill Behm (406 out of 590).** At the beginning of the show I couldn't differentiate between her and Jane (Jane and Jill, you know), although they are very different in appearance. Was feeling sorry for her to go in the way she actually went. Didn't like very much when Marty betrayed her in exchange for an idol (but, again, what can we say - he did not vote for her; a good one, Sash). 

**14. Jimmy Tarantino (385 out of 590).** When I look at Jimmy T, especially at his official cast photo, I really think that about fifteen or twenty years ago, he would've probably kicked Ozzy's and Joe's asses. But the time flies and sometimes it doesn't have fun. Jimmy was a way too self-centered, he didn't listen to anyone, he had hard time accepting other opinions. Of course it's difficult to live with such people. That's why I knew that the tribe would kick him out early. 

**13. Tyrone Davis (345 out of 590).** He's almost the same as Jaison from Samoa, only a little more fun and had a little bit of stronger spirit. But, oddly enough, he left much earlier than #346. Well, if I remember correctly, he didn't want to help cook the chicken, however stuffed his face in it. 

**12. Sash Lenahan (314 out of 590).** Some kind of a "delicate" Boston Rob from "All Stars". Sash made a lot of moves, alas for him, they were mainly of the burning bridges type, and this totally set the jury against him.  But, it seems to me that Nicaragua is one of those seasons in which there was an outraged bitter jury, led by the Survivor trash bucket - NaOnka.  Of course I'm not upset that Sash lost because, you know, Fabio won and I like Fabio, but still ... There is also a dark story with Jane and her mortgage... Well, let this dust sit on Sash's conscience. 

**11. Chase Rice (309 out of 590).** I personally have a neutral attitude towards this player, and I don't get mad over the fact that he lost the final, but... still, was it fair?  What can you do if the only person that was not in the majority alliance won all immunities at the end and they had to kick out their own allies? I understand that Jane and Dan were upset that they and not, let's say, Sash were expelled from the alliance. But you shouldn't be a sore loser in such circumstances - you should understand that there were a very few choices left.  Nicaragua for me is like Guatemala and Fiji - it's another confirmation that people who behave like assholes in the game turn out to be the same assholes in the jury (right Lisi, right Judd?). To underline everything that was said, Chase would be a fair winner, but I'm still glad that Fabio won.
