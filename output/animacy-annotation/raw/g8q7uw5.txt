Murdered by words? More like murdered by ignorance and lies.

I would normally not comment, but this is all so wrong and ignorant that I simply can not let it slide without correcting a few points:

“**Destini Robinson**” is either ignorant or lying. Seeing as that they took the time to look up a Greek word, it shows they have the capacity and will to do actual research, but not the honesty of presenting facts, so I say they are lying about the Bible to push an opinion.

1. Leviticus was NOT written in Greek. It is part of the **Hebrew** Scriptures.
2, Arsenokotai is Greek, NOT hebrew, and it comes from árrhēn, "a male" and koítē, "a mat, bed", in other words a man in bed with another man; a homosexual. This includes men of all ages.
3. The actual Hebrew word used in Leviticus 18:22 is Zahar, which just means “male”. There is no reference to age. Saying it specifically means “young boys” is a dishonest outright lie.
4. Stop appropriating Jesus. He is not your Teddy bear. Jesus never spoke about gay people, true. Why would he? It was never accepted and it carried the death penalty. Why would he even bring up the topic? 
5. Jesus did however define marriage as being between a man and a woman (Matthew 19:4-6), and condemned ALL extramarital sexual activities (Matthew 5:27,28; Mark 7:20-23). Adultery and fornication includes **but is not limited to** homosexuality, beastiality, pedophilia and any other sexual activity outside of a marriage.
 
“**Sunshine-tattoo**” claims to be a Jew but does not seem to know the basics of Jewish and Greek history.

Pederastry was a socially acceptable thing in Greek culture at the earliest during the archaic period, beginning in the 8th century BC. Leviticus was written **almost a thousand years before** that period, in the Arabian desert, with absolutely NO Greek influence what so ever. I think this must be ignorance on their part rather than outright lies.

In the second case they are more on point. The people of Sodom were way to carnal, and they didn’t show hospitality to strangers or respect for the angels. But it’s also a case of illicit sex.

&gt; “the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, ... They called to Lot... ‘Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, **that we may have sex with them**.’” -Genesis 19:4,5

Instead of honoring their guests, they wanted to gang rape them. Whether that condemns homosexuality, gang rape, or just being inhospitable, or all of the above, I leave to you to ponder.

What you do with this information is up to you.
