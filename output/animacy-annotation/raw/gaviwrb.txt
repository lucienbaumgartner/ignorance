I wpuld look for another nanny shes obviously not raising her own child to a standard you would like so how do you expect her to be working well with your kids. Shes obviously lying to you and downplaying the situation which is a huge red flag because non of that is normal behavior for a 5 year old. Any person who works with children and has experiance with child development will tell you this isnt something you just leave alone because they are kids you try to correct behavior. 

She seems inexperianced and unaware of this so I would find a new nanny. Also maybe set up cameras (obviously tell her) so you can see how it actually is. I personally hate cameras when I work but if you have issues going on when a nanny is downplaying certain things that are obvious issues it should make you think about what shes not saying to you thats going on or what else shes not doing.
