NTA- so much missing information here. From your description of events and how you arrived at the name sounds like you were young and unaware of any of the implications of the name. I can see how some would think it could be appropriation, it would be like a non-muslim family naming a child Mohammed, and to be honest I don't know enough about Hinduism to know if they would use the Krishna as a given name for their children.
