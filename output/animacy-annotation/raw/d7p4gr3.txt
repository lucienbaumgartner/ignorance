Yes! This is the kind of person who doesn't do randomly nice things for their partner as they have to ask for it first. Also the kind of person who tallies everything they've done for someone and doesn't think of what has been done for them without them having to ask. 

I gave my ex a lot of unasked for physical attention, back rubs etc. and received nothing in return unless I asked for it. I don't want to have to ask for things like that every time. Just choose to do something for me because you appreciate me as a human being. 

People show love and affection in different ways, yeah. But part of a healthy relationship is knowing what the other person appreciates and makes them happy, then doing it. Some people are just so unaware and unwilling to put thought and effort in if it means changing their actions in any way. If your partner feels loved by verbal affirmations, they're not going to feel very loved if you're only showing it through gifts. Gotta change things for each partner because shit's about compromise - you'll never find someone who's happy with you 100% from the get-go. You've got to change for each other a little in different ways.
