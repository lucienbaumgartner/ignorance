Yes I do. I did not feel anything related to romance or lust but yet it's a pure love and intense feeling. I was unaware and confused about it completely. 
I developed lust feeling with my karmic which I regret about. But I realised soon that it's not love. TF connection is pure and he said me once that he respects me. I wish we could be together and wish the same for all of you whoever is reading this.
