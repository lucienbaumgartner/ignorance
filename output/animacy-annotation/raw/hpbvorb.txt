&gt; CRT and sex ed

Dude, you need get off of right-wing propaganda. No one is teaching CRT to middle schoolers, and actual CRT, like that talked about in *colleges* is nothing like what Fox News pretends it is. Sex is is usually opt out. I feel like you don't know the first thing about what schools do before you've already decided to pull out your future kids from them. 

Evolution is a fact. It real. It's what happens in reality. You are trying to hide from reality, but the cool thing is, reality keeps going whether you believe in it or not. 

Keeping your wife "controlled", your kids ignorant of science, ignorant and afraid of sex, isolated from their peers, indoctrinated that they exist just to give you ticket to heaven, that's just fucking terrifying. I hope you have some sort of wake-up in your life before you go through with creating this hellish childhood you have in store for them.
