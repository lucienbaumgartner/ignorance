You contradict yourself in you post by saying that your parents are decent people but then say they called you complaining about not spending Christmas with them and then invited themselves over to your house when your wife has just gone through one of the most important, traumatic and vulnerable times in her life. He body will be healing at that point and she doesn't need extra people around when she is caring for a newborn. 

Also are you trying to hurt your child, its a bit idiotic to allow people to your house with a newborn when a certain contagious virus is going around. How can you be so ignorant and clueless. Your priority should be your wife and newborn not your mummy and daddies hurt feelings.
