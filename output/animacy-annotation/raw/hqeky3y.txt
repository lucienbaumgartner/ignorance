I did Google for it... But maybe I should've looked harder.

I did thought it was an innocent question, it's not as if I don't like the game, I just thought it was strange Support isn't responding. I'm sure there's a legitimate reason for it, though. Only wanted some insight.

Looking back it WAS foolish to open a post saying "I stopped playing because they won't pay me to play"... Hence I recognized my mistake.

I would say it was ignorant and freakish. But not lazy at all... Lesson learned. I'll do better next time.
