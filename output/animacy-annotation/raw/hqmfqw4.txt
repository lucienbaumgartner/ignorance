A bit different but.. my first grow I thought was a fat failure when I opened up the first uncle bens and saw a chalky green mess. Being kinda ignorant and curious, I still proceeded to pick the parts around the contam and put them in coca coir. Everyone told me to chuck it, burry it or burn my house down etc but somehow I managed to end up with a rather healthy and potent first flush haha.
