I hate kids honestly,most awkward thing in my social interactions is the way i talk to kids 

I don't know how to talk to something so irrational and unaware of itself

Idk,go on hate me but,i avoid those kind of interactions 

My best advice would be stress management,control you stress levels to avoid lashing out at those kids
