&gt; Would you agree that people protesting and being in the streets is inevitable? 

Yes, because unfortunately there will always be a small minority of the general population that is sufficiently callous and unaware that they believe their personal beliefs are more important or somehow protect them from an uncaring and harsh reality.

When it comes down to it, I believe we should support the population as a whole, and in this case the opinions of the majority are quite clear. Unfortunately for that small number of people who want to protest, that means not letting them put everyone else at risk.

What annoys me most about the protests, all the threads on this sub and others is that those promoting protests seem to have a completely callous, uninformed or indifferent attitude towards the pandemic. It has shifted and altered the lives of most people on the planet, changed our economy and our futures in a way that will be written in the history books. It has killed hundreds of thousands of people and will likely kill hundreds of thousands more until an effective vaccine is found and the largest vaccination campaign in human history is undertaken. The pro-demonstration sorts seem to be of the attitude that the virus isn't that bad, that it won't affect or kill them, and that those that it does kill or maim are faceless and therefore don't matter. They seem to feel its their right to risk the lives of others for their own causes and beliefs. Its a callous, reckless and dangerous mentality.
