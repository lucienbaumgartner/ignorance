Ima just be the dick to say it and let you know that you needa git gud at math/comp sci, whatever. You got a dragon dildo up your ass for the semantics of this poster's opinion and if youre continuing to live your life with a "anyone who disagrees with me is trying to offend me" attitude then youll just be backing yourself into a corner forever. Constantly whining about why things cant be your way. 

You try to count but like do you know about mathematical sets? Like how one group can be D/E and another group can be F. You put those two groups in a system, it becomes...binary. Its math. Not discrimination. Take a cold shower and cool off hot head.

Ps. Please dont reply. I dont give a fuck. And also please click my profile so you can self validate why im a hateful blah blah blah. My best friend is gay. My closest friends are trans, poly, straight, etc. Im a loving guy. But youre just angry and ignorant of math. (Ignorance just means you dont know something, its not an insult fyi). Okay plz be safe n has good day. ðŸ‘‹
