My thinking is that Francis planned to abuse cap space since he knew that teams needed it, and there was no point in giving it for free to teams. Everybody talks about how good of a superstar team he could have put together, but he had literally no prospect pipeline before the 21 draft. So being able to potentially draft prospects that are closer to NHL ready means a lot to Seattle probably.

The dumb part is that teams remember how they got scammed by Vegas, and weren't interested in it happening again. Throw on the fact that Seattle's not the only team with cap space that can make cap space deals, and suddenly Arizona's made out like a bandit.

I'm sure that when Francis took terrible players from teams, he did it because he thought that teams that weren't willing to bite now would bite a month later... but teams worked on solving their problems before then. If Francis had actually negotiated, he could have likely gotten all those picks that went to Arizona. Want another 1st round?  Offer to take Tarasenko and flip him to another team with retained salary. Want a 2nd round? Flyers offloaded Ghost along with a 2nd and a 7th for a team to take him. I get the idea of what Francis tried, I think it was just incredibly dumb and ignorant of what other teams could do.
