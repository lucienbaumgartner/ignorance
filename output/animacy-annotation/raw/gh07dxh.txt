Cut your parents interaction with your daughter if they will not respect your wishes. 

My philosophy with my child was to let him be little and unaware of the adults’ business. Once he hit about 12, he and his friend would discuss religion. He only knew of my family’s affiliation.

Once he became of age, the JWs started showing up at our door when his father and I were at work. He had already had a distaste for the religion due to the lack of love shown to us. My mother had begun shunning me, and him in the process. He wants nothing to do with that part of the family either.

You have an excellent situation for severely limiting contact—physical distance. Methods of communication can be monitored easily, too.

My mother was much like yours. She could not wait to take my unborn child to the meetings. She was never allowed overnight visits even when she was still speaking to me.
