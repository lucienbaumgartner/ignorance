Exactly my thought process. He doesn't care for the lives of his cartel goons cuz they're in the game and they know their place. Whereas his Pollos employees are innocent and unaware of the bigger picture of him. My main question/hope is that he is sincere about caring for his civilian employees on an emotional level/"don't hurt my staff they do right by me and I want to do right by them" vs "this is gonna blow up in half of my face if any of these civilians get fucked up bc of my cartel life". I'm sure I'm being a little redundant haha
