Honestly, I couldn't even get past the start of the video with him already man handling the poor kitty so calmly. Reading the comments describing what this horrible man does made me glad of that fact.
There's something always so hard to watch about people who mistreat animals, more so than having to watch people hurting people. An animal is so unaware and defenceless, you have to be a truly cruel person to mistreat animals in such ways. Hopefully the man gets removed from his position and banned from being near animals, this behaviour is disgusting.
