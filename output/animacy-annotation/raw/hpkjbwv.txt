Lebanese here with divorced parents, I moved 5 hours away with roommates for a job then moved in with my boyfriend 6 months later. Only my mother knew about this.  I didn’t tell my dad. My dad thinks I’m living alone now. 

My sister did the same recently, she moved out of my moms house and in with her boyfriend like 20 min away. My dad thinks she still lives at home.

It’s not our fault that our dad is too ignorant and intolerant to deal with the fact that we have our own lives and make our own decisions. This is the safest way to deal with the situation. He doesn’t support us financially or even emotionally and barely talks to us so I guess that’s what he gets.
