&gt;	Probably because Bernie wasn’t electable across the general population

Primaries say otherwise. Biden only won because clyburn used every ounce of political maneuvering he had to win North Carolina for Joe. Add to that buttigiegs failure to concede early races that stole important media coverage from Bernie, and it’s pretty clear that joe still almost lost when the entire deck was stacked for him.

&gt;	but has zero track record of actually doing the work and getting meaningful change implemented at the national level.

I mean this is just radically ignorant and false. It’s all public record, which you’ve clearly never once attempted to look at because then you’d realize how fucking moronic what you just said is.
