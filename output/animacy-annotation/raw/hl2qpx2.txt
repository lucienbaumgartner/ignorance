Maybe it's time to look at a new way. I don't have all the answers. But BTC can't sustain infinite growth given many challenges it still needs to overcome (Tether, endgame fees, inflow needed to sustain growth, and valuation sanity).

Number go up is great, for things that have a reason for number going up. Assets have failed in the past and gone to zero. There's plenty of bodies paving the way for other assets and so on. To believe there is zero risk of BTC failing is immature and ignorant of the past. 

If its successful and one day trades in a reasonable range as to provide some cushion from the past volatility then great. If it becomes the world reserve currency great because it would probably have to solve other things. BTC is a neat idea, but not without risk despite the masses claiming its risk less. 

I'm not anti bitcoin. I'm anti ignorant people buying in on nothing more than cloudy dreams sold by other participants. Bitcoin still has some growth potential and use cases. But it certainly can't and shouldn't have exponential returns from here. The early adopter phase is long dead yet people still say you're still early!!! Give me a break.
