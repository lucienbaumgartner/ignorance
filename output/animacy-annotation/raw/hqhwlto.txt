When cretins equate communism and nazism (and like this guy form Spain say communism was actually worse), what exactly sort of rhetoric do you think you legitimize? There are communist parties virtually all over the world. You people wouldnt even know where to start actually describing any of their politics or ideology. In Kerala, India a state with over 35 million people, the communists have like 60% of the legislature and are in charge of the government. To equate them with Nazis is a disgusting form of fascist apologetics and absolute braindead rhetoric (lets be honest, most people literally dont even know Kerala existed probably). All it does is legitimize actual far right neo nazi and fascist parties as being somehow as normal as left wing parties are. I dont care if it triggers you but there are plenty of popular and large communist parties all over the world in governments even other than the socialist states: Nepal, Japan, India, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, Austria. Lets not pretend like any of you people even have an ounce of knowledge on them, equating them as "just as bad as Nazis" is incredibly ignorant and dumb rhetoric.
