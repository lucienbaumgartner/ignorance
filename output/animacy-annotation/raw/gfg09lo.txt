To understand even so many years later;  that you have loved, though unaware and unrequited, is better than to have remained ignorant of your own inner self. Awareness is bittersweet poetry to the heart. Thank you for sharing it with the world. Thank you for letting me see through your perspective, so I may better understand love. I hope you reconnect with them in harmony, even if it be brief and platonic. The open ended silence is far worse to feel.
