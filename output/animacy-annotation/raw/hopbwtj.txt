I’m saying the city can’t just get up and spend millions of dollars tomorrow to fix a minor traffic inconvenience. Your cherry picking my words. And if you actually knew how city’s and road work you’d know there are budgets, contracts, appropriations, and actual civil needs for things before they happen.
 
Actually get out of Reddit basement, take a drive around town, and you’ll actually notice road work happening and other problems in streets that need fixing. More so than a minor traffic swelling because people don’t want to get out of their cars for over priced chicken tenders. And before you complain, city budgets and ongoing or planned road work is publicly available information. All published online. You’re actively ignorant of how tax dollars are spent and government work happens, when you can inform yourself. Easily.
 
And yeah, do you think it’s a bigger issue than the people who make decisions for the city road work projects? Go to city counsel with a petition or signed agreements and make a case it matters. Get involved in something you think is an issue instead of hitching online. Or supposed signs that I’m sure don’t even exist.
 
I’m short. Your misinformed and ignorant of the things your complaining about. Short sighted and narcissistic that some minor inconvenience is a problem compared to other projects happening or that need to happen to city streets. And your a clown to think screaming online like a child will do anything. 
 
Welcome to the real world buddy. Things don’t change because you scream for mommy to fix it. And people smarter than you have other issues to worry about and fix that are more important than you not understanding traffic. But please, continue to whine! You’ll accomplish nothing and wake up one day ashamed.
