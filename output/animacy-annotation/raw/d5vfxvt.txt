lmfao you are so socially unaware and devoid self-awareness you're literally autistic.I actually was an EMT before medical school, so try again, and this profession needs me because I'm not some autistic jackass who only cares when im being written a check. Quit being so god damn polarized, there's a difference between needing to be a patch adams type (I never watched that stupid fucking movie) and being such a money grubbing bastard you won't answer serious phone calls about patients' needs even if it's life and death unless you're getting billed about it. That is what most doctors do and is so fucking unethical. What's shit is doctors are always wanking themselves off about how altruistic they are then they pull this bs. Most of medicine = greedy assholes with giant egos who think they're the second coming of christ.
