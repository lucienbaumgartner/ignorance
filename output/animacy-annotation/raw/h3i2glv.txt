Well, it would ideally be within that new difficulty that the numbers are tweaked heavily. Damage, blood loss, stamina drain, terrain, the whole kit and keboodle.

Ironically I found MGS V to be harder when it came to moving around undetected, the low ammo for the tranq gun and the lack of feedback concerning how hidden Snake is, such as no camo index.

DS honestly should be a grueling experience. The idea is one man is trekking across America to reconnect it, fighting the living and the dead. But one bola gun and a ceramics container later and the camp is yours.

One hand over your mouth and you're invisible to the BT's. Both hands on the straps and you'll never fall.

One of the things I love most about DS is the potential for a run to go sideways, creating a number of organic scenarios and detours that makes a delivery of Resin's into literal life or death.

Problem is, a lot of the time I have to force that to happen or be willfully careless and ignorant of my situation. I figure Koji Pro wanted a more casual game so that players weren't also turned off by the difficulty of what is essentially a pretty unusual game for the AAA space, but that is something g the DC needs to address.

Because nerdy Ludens like us with those 1000 hour culmanitive files need to be slapped around more in the game. We get off on it.
