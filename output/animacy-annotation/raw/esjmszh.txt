oh my time to shine! 

So my very first job ever was when I was 16 was at Denny's. I was a hostess, seating people at tables, getting drinks, and answering the phone.  This Denny's was in Utah during the 90's and so it was the only game in town past 7pm.  

So we were always, always, hopping. People would call the restaurant asking about wait times because we had lines out the door on the weekends, and this was before cellphones, so people would call in and ask to page friends or family. And I was really clueless, socially unaware and incredible naive. 

So it's Friday night, and we are slammed. Line out the door,  phone ringing nonstop. I pick up the phone and it's for a page. "Hi, this is Carl. Carl Mioff. I'm looking for my brother, Jack. Jack Mioff. Could you please page him" 

So naive, clueless me picks up the intercom, and in a restaurant full of over 70 people called out "Jack Mioff up at reception please, Jack Mioff".

I was Mo' to this dude's Bart Simpson.
