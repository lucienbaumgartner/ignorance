cuz it's a gimmick.


It's literally poor man's magicians and comedians. Except it actually costs more.



Like, watching a preacher after 2 years of doing comedy more than 5x/week, I was just thinking "fucking hack, do you even practice? Why are you reading your notes?"


But their audiences are unaware and subject to authority so it works. :/


If I had no moral code I'd just become a Joel Olsteen tbh.
