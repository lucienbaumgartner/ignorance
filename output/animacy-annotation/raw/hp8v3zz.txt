Our family is all triple vaxxed.

We aren't canceling. 

At this point, we can either wear our n95s and trust the tech, or admit that we'll never have normalcy again.

If its as bad as delta, I'm looking at a sub-1% chance of getting it and having long COVID, a hospital stay, or death. I'm just as likely to slip on ice and hit my head and end up in the ER.

The only real difference is that I can infect others if I get it and I'm no longer amenable to altering my life for strangers beyond wearing my n95 in public and staying home if I'm notified I was in close contact or I'm symptomatic.  

The chances that omnicron gets thru my mask and vaccines to infect me, that I'm  asymptomatic and unaware, and it gets thru my mask again to infect them is small.  It basically approaches zero if they're boosted; same with them having a non-mild case.

If they're not boosted?  They made their choice.
