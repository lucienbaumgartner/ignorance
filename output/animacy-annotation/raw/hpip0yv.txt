Reminder and a warning: If you are unaware and uneducated to what the Muslim cannot bear to not know, DO not argue, and at all times prefer educating yourself than talking to uneducated apostates, and BEWARE be very wary of suspicions that induce doubt in your religion.

Ibn al Qayyim may Allaah have mercy on him said:
"People have entered hellfire from three gates:
1. Lust that begot preference of sin over the worship of Allaah
2. A suspicion that induced doubt in the religion of Allaah
3. Anger that created injustice over Allaah's slaves"
