Well thanks to Wikileaks we know that the Hillary Clinton campaign was interested in keeping the general population unaware and compliant.

 &gt;And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging.

Thank God we elected Trump to keep a functioning democracy.
