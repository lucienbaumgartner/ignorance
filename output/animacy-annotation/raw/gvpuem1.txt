Yeah.  Every kid is different, but three seems like the worst possible age to try this with and I wouldn't do it with most 3 year olds.  They're the exact wrong combination of fast, curious and unaware of danger.

A little bit older when they can start to listen? Sure.  Younger when they're less mobile? Also sure.
