If you think 2042 is not that bad off, you are literally blind and ignorant of what's actually going on. 

The fundamental core systems within 2042 are beyond fucked. You'd literally have to scrap the entire game, it's not fixable. 

This piece of shit was made as a battle royale originally and pivoted half way through development towards normal battlefield ideals because they panicked. They fucked this so hard, and from such a basic level of development that not even 4 other studios helping them was enough to fix it.
