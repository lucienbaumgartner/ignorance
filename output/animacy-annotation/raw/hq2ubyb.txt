I'm so sorry for your loss. I just went through the same thing in September. I was keeping tabs on my dad daily who had covid he lived 45 minutes away( I had covid as well), he kept telling me he was feeling better each day. On day 8 I heard him cough on the phone for the first time, so I broke quarantine to visually verify his health status( he was a stubborn bull) well needless to say, he was lying to me everyday I checked up on him. He was lying down in his bed naked and pale and unaware of my presence.  I struggled to get underwear and pants on him. When I finally got a response from him I yelled at him for lying to me.( I regret it everyday) He was a mountain of a man, 6"3 and pushing 275 lbs. And I struggled to get him Into my car. That was the longest car ride of my life, I tried to converse with him to keep him conscious, I'm eternally grateful to have spent those last hours with him. I've watched people die before. But as you know, when it's your father it's a different pain.  Back in January I jammered on and on whenever we would woodwork or meet about gme and the blackswan event coming. Just like your father he finally started to grasp and understand, needless to say he became invested, not in just the company but the movement. I hold for him, I hold for you, I hold for all of us.
