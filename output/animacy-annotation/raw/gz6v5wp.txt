Believe it or not, Spain was thought to be like that not so long ago. Capcom, japanese as they are, knew little about  the Peninsula. A clear example I can think of is when Leon mentions "Cumbay√°" at the very beginning. Now that you mention the aspect of the villagers, poor and ignorant, that was how most farmers/rural people were until pretty much the 1930's and even then there wasn't much of an improvement (not to speak about what came after the the civil war) I do find more similarities with a Latin American Spanish than the one from the land of Don Quixote. Though I see your point.
