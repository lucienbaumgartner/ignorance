Probably the most foreign idea I'd bring is the concept that not all California's are loathsome folk. 

Spending my upbringing in Tahoe taught me one simple truth; it doesn't matter where they are from, some tourists are fantastic and some are the most obnoxiously entitled and unaware people in the world. I think this applies to transplants, too.

That said, the "fuck outsiders locals only" sentiment in the Western US is so painfully unaware and annoying to me. None of us are native to these lands. Best case scenario for acting "local" your or my white ass ancestors showed up around this part of the world ~150ish years ago and probably committed some unspeakable atrocities towards the true native population. More likely (in my experience), the person probably moved to Tahoe 5 years ago from VT and is now the most outwardly vocal "fuck outsiders" voice around. The real kicker? They almost certainly work in a tourism-related business and the very thing they loath keeps putting food on their plate.


Sorry, unprompted rant over. I hope I have an excuse to come back to live in Idaho one day. It really does hold a special spot in my heart. It breaks my heart to see Boise look the way it does now, but I personally think it's all about taking a small approach to how a place is going to grow instead of sticking your head in the sand and pretending it isn't happening.
