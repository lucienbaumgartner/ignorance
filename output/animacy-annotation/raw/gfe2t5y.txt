This is your right to see fucking as you giving a part of you for someone to use it. Some of use prefer to see bottoming as "taking a dick and using it" and some others prefer to see it as sharing an intimate moment.

Saying that bottiming IS giving your hole to get used is not right. It's not consent. Bottoms are not object. 

Saying that you personnally like to be used by a top who doesn't give a fuck about you is fine. We all have our preferences. But don't make your preference a rule, especially when that rule may be dangerous to those who are still young and unaware of how sexuality really works (and there are plenty of people like that here).
