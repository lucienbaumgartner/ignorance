Whilst there's not much on it, I reckon there's little chance he got them all. Because even *He* wouldn't know where they all are.

Terra is basically a world that's been built up, bombed, irradiated, built up again, bombed, irradiated, repeat ad nauseum for millennia. To the point that the whole crust is going to be a composite of civilisation ruins pancaked atop one another. And amongst those composites are going to be all sorts of Dark Age of Technology goodies, like gemstones within a rockface. From simple tools, to ancient weapon systems.

Heck, remember that during the Horus Heresy the Salamanders first operation was to tunnel beneath that particularly annoying hold out civilization during the wars of unification. And they found those enormous caves run by ancient machine insects maintaining some sort of void shield, rebuilding each other and unaware that their purpose was long since made redundant.

There's got to be thousands of places like that all over Terra.
