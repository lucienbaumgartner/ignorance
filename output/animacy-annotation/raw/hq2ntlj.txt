Mate the creators are literal trans women. But if you want textual evidence then here:

Back in the 90s trans women had two options, take the red pill (estrogen, which came in red pills) and accept the truth of their transness but having to deal with an ignorant and hostile society, or take the blue pill (anti depressent, again in a literal blue pill) and smother their minds in an attempt to ignore their transsness and go on fitting in.

People freed from the matrix chose new names for themselves. Agent smith keeps dead-naming Neo as Mr anderson.

Neo gets refereed to as Alice a lot as well.

Agents being able to be anyone is a metaphore for how everyone else was ignorant of trans stuff and any one of them could turn to be phobic to such a degree that they where murderous (look up the trans panic defense)

There was literally going to a char called switch who was male in the real world and female in the matrix who got cut due to executive meddling.

The more recent reveal of it being trans isn't retroactive shit, its that the Wachowski sisters where closeted for a long time, but now now post 2012/2016 they are out of said closet and they can talk about it openly.
