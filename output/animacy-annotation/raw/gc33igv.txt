She was a nightwalker. She would exactly know in her sleep where the keys of the house were. Open it and walk downstairs to open the main gate, which would obviously be locked. She would sleep next to me with eyes left open. She would almost speak about everything in her sleep. 

Quite at the beginning when I new and unaware of her sleep issues I would answer all her questions she would ask me in the night while sleeping next to her. I realised much later that she doesn't realise she was doing all of this in her sleep and absolutely unaware. 

She wouldn't remember a thing next day in the morning.
