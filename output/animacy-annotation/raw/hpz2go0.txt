It's a 7.5/10 for me
There are a lot.of good things and it had a strong start but there are also noticable flaws,like
Deku's issues not being addressed or laid out on the table,his trauma, emotional and mental health not being addressed or laid out,1-A having little to no reaction,mourning,or anything like that over Midnight's death,SNS being a plot device simply to nerf Shigaraki and buy them only a little bit more time
The Deku/AFO conflict lasting literally 1 and a half chapters,the fact that deku's issues and trauma was solved with the power of friendship, Talk-no-jutsu,A Bath and a nap,Deku and All might's reunion being reduced to a cheap non-funny joke/Gag.

There are a lot of flaws and such,I did love Bakugou's apology, Deku's fight with Lady Nagent and 1-A, Uraraka's Talk-no-jutsu speech,and Tenya's moment.

And the VH arc had a strong.start but 1-A appearing with Talk-no-jutsu and the power of friendship is when things went south.

My review.


Also the fact that 1-A is still somewhat Ignorant and naive to the dangers of bringing deku back to UA just cause they miss him,and forget that AFO is incredibly smart and intelligent, and such.
