This was already the path we were on pre-Covid. Covid just accelerated it. And, the idea that unemployed people using their stimulus money to fix up their homes is the reason for the lumbar shortage is breathtakingly stupid. Iâ€™m no Biden fan, but to blame this squarely on lockdowns and unemployment stipends is utterly myopic and ignorant of the economic policies over the past 4 decades that brought us here.
