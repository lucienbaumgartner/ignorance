It's gone back to a 2G lockdown here in Bavaria, but it's lenient for vaccinated people and people that are unvaccinated at this point don't follow rules anyway. It's looking likely that stadiums will be restricted again. 

People also just seem tired and ignorant of further restrictions, it feels like the general acceptance for lockdowns has gone down. Feels like it might not get better.
