Aight i see it was a mistake to try and talk to you since you seem unwilling to listen, nor understand reality and how society has been and continues to be, my bad. I wrote a long explanation of how and why youre wrong and then deleted it because I dont think itll even matter since at first I thought oh maybe you were just like naive and ignorant of who dennis prager is, but as it turns out you're this type of person so no matter what I say you'll probably never listen. Ah man, this sucks and you think im a teenager, yikes as though knowing racism exists and white people arent subjected to the scrutiny that is placed on other groups of people is idealism in some way. 

Tbh ill be real the whole "privilege depends on the person" sounds moreso like something a teenager would say, after being confronted about some "edgey" joke, cause in an ideal world it would be so but we live in this world where we arent there yet (coughs in hate crimes and racial bias still existing for minority groups). Like idk what else to say except like learn more. Im under no obligation to teach you why what you said is wrong in specifics, and i dont really feel up to the emotional heartbreak when you inevitably dont listen and continue on your way. So read, and educate yourself of whats happening right now and dont just take information from someone thats not from within the community the thing is happening to. Learn that privilege exists, learn how it exists, understand that it is real and shouldnt exist. I will not respond/read any replies on this thread, im done.
