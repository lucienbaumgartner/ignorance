Yes, 475,000 deaths is not Trump's fault; they are all due to his grandmother.
If you stop believing that your talking points are data, and you take a look at the facts it would be obvious.
Pandemic simulation in 8/19, intelligence agencies warning him of a new virus at the end of December, China notifying the world they found a new virus at the end of december, China publishing the genome map of the virus the 1st week of January, China locking down Wuhan at end of January and on and on. Opportunity after opportunity to do something about the virus and all he hang his hat on was closing flights for Chinese; its laughable, he closed the doors of the barn after the horses escaped. And all he could do is whine and whine and blame others. I have never seen a person in a position of authority whine so much about his apparent misfortunes.
Trump is so dumb and ignorant  that he did not realize that this had to be dealt with by doctors, and THAT cost him the election.

Farmers not going bankrupt? I guess the taxpayers, $50 billion Socialist hand out he gave to the farmers to compensate for his failed policies with China are not enough for you.
Wake up and smell the coffee. Putting aside the media's talking points might help.
