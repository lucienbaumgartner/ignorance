I know that the British Ordinance survey uses that specific phrasology "purely geographical" and its interesting (to say the least) as the Irish Ordinance survey do not use it and have been explicit in not doing so. Pretending a term that infers posession of an entirely different country is "purely geographical" or in other words "non political" is to be willfully obtuse and ignorant of the horrifying historical context of the British Empire and colonialism. It's Anglo- centrism quite plainly masked as 'innocent geography'. 

For clarification; Britain refers to England Wales and Scotland. The United Kingdom refers to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
Therefore, the Republic of Ireland is not 'British' under any and all interpretations of the word.
