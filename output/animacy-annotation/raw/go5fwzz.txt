I'd be a leader and not try to start a physical fight I have no chance of winning over a comment made during practice so I'm a beta male?

You've got the understanding of human interaction akin to a toddlers.

My argument is based on my experience leading people in the Navy. People from completely different cultures, people who have conflicting points of view.  Shit I had to get people I knew were hard core racist to work along side the people they hated.  You don't get the job done by picking fights any chance you get so you can "show them you're alpha".

You're argument is that of a child, which I assume you might actually be, so it's easy to mock. If you are a kid then its likely you're just very confident and unaware of the knowledge you lack, experience should help change that.

Again, you're still being an open hypocrite. Declaring that I cannot say a thing about you, yet you can say a thing about me. Its a basic concept here, I can assume things about you based on what you wrote and you can do the same. 

For instance it appears, very likely, that you've never been in charge of people nor have you actually been in a fight.
