Are you aware that FMF protested at parliament and negotiated with Blade? Are you aware that universities are government funded? We don't need to agree on the best strategy to solve this. I agree destruction is wasteful. A huge part of this problem is that the privileged are willfully unaware and uneducated about how most of South Africa lives. We choose to ignore the glaring disparity and lack of access. We don't even try to help even the playing field. We use our privilege to fuck off to Europe while the poor fight for themselves. It's not enough. We need to use our privilege and access to fight for a better system. The same people who complain about FMF also complain about BEE. How are we supposed to appoint qualified black candidates if there's limited black access to education in the first place? I will not applaud for the "genius" of using generational wealth and privilege to ignore our disparity.
