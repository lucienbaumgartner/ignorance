They didn’t do it out of the goodness of their hearts. And yes the whole white saviour thing made them feel entitled to do it. But they did it to extract resources, point blank. You can feel differently by saying that’s just the way the world works with power dictating things, but trying to say that they did it with any regard for the conditions of local populations is just laughable
