Neither myself nor anybody else has an obligation to change anything about themselves to suit your desires, it's quite arrogant and ignorant of you to try and force others to change in such a way. You could have easily blocked me, hid the post, or just scrolled on. The more you get offended by my language the more I am encouraged to be insulting and disgusting.
