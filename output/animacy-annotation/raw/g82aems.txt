 Last night I went on to the sex offender registry and went through the list of names to find the most vulnerable one. I found one after around 2 hours. It was a 32-year-old man 130 pounds and had diabetes. I knew that he would put up little resistance since he was weak and legally not allowed to own a gun. That night I drove over to his house and scouted out a couple of potential entry points. I finally decided to push in the hall fan in one of the 1st story windows, and I waited until all the lights in the neighborhood were out before doing so. Once I got inside the house I looked around for any potential animals. I had completely forgotten to check if he had any dogs, but luckily I didn't see any. I started down the hallway and went up the stairs. I stepped on the edge of each step so as not to make any noise. Once I came to the bedroom, I saw that his door was wide open and that I could see him laying there quiet and unaware of the fate that was to befall him. I pulled out my knife and stepped quietly into the room. I walked right up to him and reached over holding the knife to his throat. By this point he was awake, but he and I both knew that if he screamed I would cut out his vocal cords. I sat there for a while feeling him quiver under my arm, but then I knew what I had to do. I raised up the knife and stabbed him as much as I physically could. After around the 12th time, I knew he was dead, but part of me wouldn't let the other part stop, so I kept stabbing into his chest with all my might. By the time I was out of breath and exhausted I had stabbed him 54 times, and I was covered head to toe in his blood. All the blood and gore gave me a boner the size of the Eifel Tower, and I proceeded to fuck the body. Ever since then I've been fantasizing every night about my next kill.
