Antisocial behavior is not the sole definition for a sociopath. Calling people sociopaths because they are antisocial and you don’t understand them just makes you sound angry and ignorant of psychology. You don’t even need a psych degree to grasp the fundamental concept that putting labels like that on people without actual evidence just further stigmatizes mental and personality disorders and further alienates others.
