When she started hanging out with my sister more often and kept a huge troublesome secret from me that involved my sister. It caused my mom alot of trouble too. Moreover, she "advised" me on how I should guide my sister as if it's all my fault when I was unaware and totally aware of how they share secrets. 
After confronting her,  she acted as if I broke her trust. 
And then ignored me in person when I tried to sort it out and tried to make a joke at my expense with my sister. 
She had been a good childhood friend but it had to end especially when there were signs that we began talking and reminiscing how long we have been friends for.
