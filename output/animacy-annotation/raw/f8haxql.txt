I one time saved my brother from drowning in a lake and almost drowned myself. He started coughing and panicking and the most i could do was give him my arm for support and calm him down by telling him to calm down and breath. i am not a strong swimmer myself but i was taught not to panic in life or death situations. My first wave of adrenaline started to go away and i started to drown myself. Thankfully i hit a second wave of adrenaline and my feet moved like a motor. We eventually made it to land and i was so thankful because i was for sure we were both going to die that day. I asked him later that night why he followed me into the lake and he tells me ironically he tells me he knew i wasn't a strong swimmer and didn't want anything to happen to me. I was 16 and realized how unaware and selfish i was to try to do something so dangerous and try to swim across a lake and not expect my older brother to follow me to make sure i was okay. Since that day i put myself into situations that can harm the people around me. Moral of the story think about the others around you before you decide to do something stupid.
