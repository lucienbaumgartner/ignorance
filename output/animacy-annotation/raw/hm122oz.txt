I come from a very unsafe place. Somehow nothing horrible ever happened to me but my general rule was don't have earphones or headphones on while in the street, because you need to hear what's around you and also because it gives the clue to others as to where you are carrying your phone. Always keep your phone/wallet out of sight as well and when on public transport always keep your bag on your lap. 

I've had my phone stolen off me multiple times however every single time it was because I was too drunk and unaware of myself. It was easy for them to just bump into me and take it out my pocket. Nothing ever happened when I was sober.

Also as a girl having creeps ask me for my number or stuff, just keep walking and ignore them. If they follow you keep to public areas or go inside a shop or something
