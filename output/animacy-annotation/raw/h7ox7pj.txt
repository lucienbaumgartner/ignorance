Counterpoint, if the offense is full of nothing but possession receivers that with nobody being a significant threat downfield (like we would be rolling out Higgins/Boyd/Tate) then defenses will crowd the LOS, drop safeties down and the offense will be significantly less effective. Its not just about an embarrassment of riches, its about the fact that there is an entire field stretching role that is pivotal in an NFL offense that was completely absent from the team a year ago. 

You're also ignoring that they spent a 2nd, 4th, and 6th rounder on OL while also signing a former pro bowl OL in free agency. And they fired their old offensive line coach and brought in a new one. 

Everyone simply breaking it down to Chase vs Sewell are extremely naive and ignorant of the totality of the Bengals issues roster-wise. OL and WR were our two biggest needs. We've been extremely aggressive at OL adding 6 new linemen this offseason. To act like we haven't addressed it and that we're doomed without Sewell is so fucking dumb it makes my brain hurt. We literally just spent a top 10 pick on an OT 2 years ago and oh by the way, he's pretty fucking good.
