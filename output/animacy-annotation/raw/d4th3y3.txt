Mmm...just the unaware and unobservant. 

I've seen some very poor people live as if they were rich and believe they are rich, and some very rich people live modestly. 

I've met plenty of people who have delusions about how much money they'll make if they just *follow their dreams* and plenty more undersell their skills and abilities. A major reason the rich are rich is because of good spending habits, and the same applies on the other end: sometimes the poor are that way because they make poor choices.
