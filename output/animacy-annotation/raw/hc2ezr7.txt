&gt;I also enjoy the power dynamic of you being helpless and unaware of what's going to happen, while I get to decide when and how things happen

This is the bit that I find chilling. It kind of doesn't jive with the concept of safe words. you're not locked in there but he considers that you're helpless, and gets off on that... I really do hope that you can negotiate a safe word for you and that it works.
