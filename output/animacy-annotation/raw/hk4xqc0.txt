Absolutely delusional and ignorant of history. Mate I am a liberal and I know damn well what an extreme left idealogy encompasses. 

Just going infinitely to the left does not equal human progress. If it did humanity would have reached perfect peace in the early 20th century. Over 100 years of countries trying some form of communism have shown us just going to the extreme left is not the answer.
