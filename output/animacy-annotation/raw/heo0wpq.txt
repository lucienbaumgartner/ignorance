Not necessarily. Dragons and Elves can still be actually afraid and unaware of the harmless nature of DM and of their own hypocrisy -because again they're not just afraid of losing their upper hand in the balance of power, but also of being chased and chopped off into pieces.

But yeah that would be extremely complicated given the effort the writers put in telling us how DM is evil.
