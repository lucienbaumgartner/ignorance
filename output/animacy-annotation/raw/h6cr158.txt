Im not going to shame someone to their face, and I understand how hard it is. At the same time I think it's bullshit. If you choose to take care of an animal you understand that they (usually) won't outlive you. It isn't easy, but not everything in life is.

To me it comes down to respect for your pet. It's the same reason I'm incredibly gentle with bodies, they can't feel it, they don't know what's happening, but out of respect for the life it had I'm going to be gentle and kind.

A sedated animal might not know you're there but the principle remains the same. It's part of what you should do if you can. If I was brain dead and unaware of my surroundings I would hope that those who care about me would stay.

I don't care if this makes me a cold and callous person, but choosing not to be present for a euthanasia because it makes YOU uncomfortable makes me judge you. It's not about you.
