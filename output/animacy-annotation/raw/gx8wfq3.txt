Tell him that if he doesn't get tested it could harm is health now and later if he ends up having it and doesn't treat it. Tell him no sex until you're sure he doesn't have it (and if he's likely to lie ask for diagnostic results on paper). Otherwise, if he continues being hurtful and ignorant of your health and boundaries, I say it's time for you to go. Just my opinion, but I went down that road before too, and it didn't end well. 

Take care of yourself first and foremost.
