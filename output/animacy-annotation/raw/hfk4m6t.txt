This is my fourth year participating in Inktober using mini-magnets, but my first year posting the pieces to Reddit, as well as my first year trying out the [Obscutober prompt list](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTVzeEICqi-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)!

An entire month themed around obscure words just feels like such a perfect fit for the magnets, I couldn't resist! :D
