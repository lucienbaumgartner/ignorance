OK so you are not ready to break up with him yet. You need to though, and you know it.

Right now you need to start disentangling things. Keep separate finances and have things ready so when you have the energy to leave it’ll be easier.

Also, use this time to figure out how you got into this. Has this happened before? Is your normal meter broken? Were you just busy and unaware that ppl like this exist outside of prisons? (That was my issue— how I got my JNMIL). Make sure it does not happen again. Learn the signs of manipulative people.

And use birth control!! People like this will try to trap you with pregnancy.

As for you being a just no.. no. You are having a normal response to being stuck with a crazymaker.
