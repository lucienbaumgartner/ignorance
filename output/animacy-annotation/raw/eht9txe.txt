Enlighten myself?! As a parent who lives with autism EVERY SINGLE DAY? As someone who has personally experienced some of the things you have mentioned? As someone who has deep fear that the teasing and stigmatism will get through and my son will think about harming himself? ENLIGHTEN MYSELF?! You are a bigot and a moron. YOU are the problem. Handicap? How about the handicap of being so narcissistic and unaware that you would tell the parent of an autistic child to enlighten themselves about.. autism?! You're a halfwit.
