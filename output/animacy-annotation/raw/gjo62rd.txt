&gt; All the left does is support government.

lol. Yeah, all those left wing protests against the Iraq war, the constant protesting from the left of Obama's expanding drone program when he was president, the constant complains from Democrats that Obama's health care reform was a corporate giveaway, the left's unquestioning support for all things government just goes on and on, eh?

You live in an alternate reality. 

&gt;Youre not a fucking revolutionary if youre a socialist that wants a stronger government 

Lol, the definition of socialism is directly tied to a strong state that benefits the people. You are deeply confused and ignorant of basic political definitions. It's not that complicated, the left argues for a strong, functioning government that supports the people, the right argues against this. Whatever lie you have been fed that says the left are supposedly opposed to good government is laughable.
