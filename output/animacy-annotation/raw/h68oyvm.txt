lmao they're not, they're just like the nazis and alt-right, only on the opposite side. They take away space from the not radical left and turn it into r/TheRightCantMeme. Thankfully no country in the world is currently what tankies want. Oh wait, no, we already have a dictatorship with backward views. Many in fact. Which is what you desire and the alt-right is exactly the same. It's sad you're so privileged and ignorant that a dictator of all things is your imagined saviour.
