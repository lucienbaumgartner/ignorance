&gt; Itâ€™s pretty arrogant and ignorant of you to say these logistics and finance concepts are bullshit. Tesla would have to take a hit every quarter because their deliveries grow every quarter so the pipeline would have to grow as well.

Dude, this is simple:

Let's say that every quarter there are 90 Units of Tesla Effort (30 per month).

Every other car company in the world just expends one unit of Effort per day.

Telsa expens .75 per day for 2 and a half months and then the rest in the last two weeks.

This is just bad management.  This is why no other company does this.
