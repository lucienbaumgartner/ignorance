My problem is that kda, prestige, and play time all amount to experience. Literally everything we do in life, we do better when we're more experienced with it. This is like me saying "hey, I can change a light bulb in my car just as good as a mechanic who's been doing it for 30 years, I must be as good as that mechanic!" Crytek ignoring experience in the game is pretty ridiculous and ignorant of people with low play time.
