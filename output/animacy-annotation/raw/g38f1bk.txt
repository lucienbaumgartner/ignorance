Yeah, I doubt this one very much, I've interacted with 3 two year olds. One didn't talk at all and just poked the floor with random things. One told people to die and swore quite a lot because her mother was young and unaware that the kid would repeat every swear word she said ever. And one mostly stared and spoke a little bit. 

I couldn't see any of them saying something like this unless they just managed to somehow randomly put the words together.
