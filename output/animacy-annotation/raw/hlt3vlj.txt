This post and many comments remind me why Genshin players have this stigma about them. 

Shame on all of the people saying, “At least you were brave enough to confess, you’ve got balls” like it’s a good thing. This wasn’t brave, it was socially unaware and awkward. This was not a good thing, and her visceral reaction to your sudden, and unwelcome display of affection is proof that you did something very wrong.  You absolutely should not take this approach again in the future, with anyone. You’ve been given great advice already, learn some self control and don’t dump yourself at others feet, it’s an awkward situation for all involved.
