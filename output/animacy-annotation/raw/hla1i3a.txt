I don’t disagree with you.  However I think what is happening with Tim‘s outbursts or a clear indication of how dire the situation is. 

Tim also has the burden of knowing.  

I think a lot of these people like Tim pool, Joe Rogan, Luke, M Malice, etc etc. are seeing their home be usurped by a totalitarian government step-by-step.  What’s terrifying and likely fuelling Tim’s outbursts are how unaware and wilfully ignorant the public is about it.  If the hearts and minds are already won it truly gives the feeling of no hope. 

If United States of America can’t figure their shit out soon they will fall and the East, notably Russia and China, will rise.
