Imagine being so biased and ignorant that you will refuse to acknowledge dozens of peer-reviewed sources because you once read a study by a renowned economist (whose name you can't even spell) that you didn't like (and that you also can't even link), only to then go on to refer to the unpublished and non-reviewed commentary pieces by someone who literally lost his position at academic institutions after major controversies surrounding his scientific misconduct and fraud as good and factual sources of information. The irony is just palpable. 

Please don't go around accusing people vastly more knowledgeable than yourself of their "inability to reason" when this is how you conduct yourself. All of your points have been refuted and you failed to make even a single valid counter-argument to u/ManiacalHurdle1 his claims; instead going off on some hypocritical tangent about how he's the one in a bubble when the facts and evidence clearly contradict your faulty talking points. A very impressive amount of cognitive dissonance indeed.
