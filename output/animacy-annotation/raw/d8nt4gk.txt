&gt;&gt; as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.  

&gt; does anyone disagree with this?

I sure do. It's perhaps not surprising but I'm deeply offended that they talk in terms of unaware compliant citizenry. Compliance and ignroance is not a thing to be cherished or pursued in politics.

But: who wrote this stuff, and is it Hillary's way of thinking or just some random insider?
