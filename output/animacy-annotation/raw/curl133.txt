This is tricky because clearly that person is NOT skilled in conversation, and may even be a narcissist and unaware that they are doing anything impolite. 

I think the assertive thing to do would be to interrupt their flow, and say "Sorry to interrupt, but we've been hearing from you for quite a while now, and I'm interested in getting to know more about the other people in the group, so can you (turning to someone else in the group) share a little about what brings you here?"  
 
This does 2 things. Firstly, it interrupts them, secondly, it gently calls them out on their dominating behavior. If they are an astute person, they will get the message. Sadly, my guess is that they were not an astute person, so there is a chance that they would take offense and either re-interrupt, or get really indignant. However, that is on THEM. Everyone else in the group would be silently thanking you, and perhaps one of them would even step up and say "Yes, time for us to hear from someone else."
