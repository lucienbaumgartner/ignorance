Remember in infinity war when they were trying to remove the stone from Vision’s head, how they were saying he doesn’t need it to live?  That could be some of what is happening here. Wanda could be compensating for the damage with reanimating him, but the parts of Vision that are Vision are still there and with her help, can function. It would explain some of his behavior quirks, like how he runs and hides when hearing a loud noise in E2 and why he sometimes has autonomy and full use of his powers and sometimes doesn’t (like with the gum). 

I don’t think Wanda is entirely aware of what she’s doing, like she’s lost in her own grief fueled fantasy of what she wished her life was. It’s kinda like she’s having a psychotic break (not unlike in House of M). Wanda also mentioned in Infinity War that she doesn’t fully understand her own powers yet, which is how she is both aware and unaware of what she is doing and what is happening to her right now. 

My money is Vision is dead right now, but Wanda will realize she can fix him by the end of the season... and he will leave her. Her rage and grief will make her the villain in the Multiverse of Madness, which apparently this show will tie into
