You are advocating for women to be let off of crimes. That absolutely has something to do with men. If I'm going to be sentenced for a crime as a man that you as a woman would be let off of by virtual of biology alone then I'll definitely have an issue with that. So you can't say that this has "nothing to do with men".

By the way, the criminal justice system is definitely in favour of women. Women already get more lenient sentences than men for comparable crimes.

You're describing the problems that hormones cause women. Do you think that men don't have similar problems? Do you not care about that at all? Can you not see how your view is divisive and ignorant of the suffering that we all as humans experience? You say that men don't understand womens' daily struggles. Do you think that men don't struggle? Do you think men don't have mental health issues? Do you think we don't wrestle with our hormonal influences and animal instincts? Do you think we're not told to "suck it up"? This last point is particularly galling to read. Boys are taught to "man up", "grow a pair", "boys don't cry" and all that bullshit. This is why the suicide rate in men is much higher than in women. We're taught that our feelings are unimportant, that we should just get on with it. And then you want to tell me that women are told to "suck it up" as though you have the monopoly on suffering and receive no support. Newsflash: life sucks for everybody except a very small number of people, and I would argue on some level even for them. Women are no more special or important than men and vice versa. Everybody struggles. Everybody suffers. Everbody experiences turmoil, anguish, pain and suffering. We are all bags of hormones struggling to get through the day without losing our shit. So please, don't condescend my by suggesting that men don't understand. Of course we do. Most of us possess empathy just as most women do.

So there you have it. Now you have some clearly much needed insight into the experience of men. If you still think that men's experiences aren't important in this discussion, and if you still think that menstruating women should be let off of crimes but excessively hormonal men shouldn't, then you're just a fucking sexist.
