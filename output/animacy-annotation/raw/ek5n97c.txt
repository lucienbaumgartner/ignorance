Before anyone says anything research has to be done. And yes that seems absurd but prolonged exposure to loud noises are dangerous. He did not say that and I can see why people reacted the way they did hearing that out of context. If you watched his whole rally he does go on to explain his reasoning. Rather than ridiculing him, you guys should do research. Trump has a higher approval rating than Obama and has done alot of things for the black community including pardoning peoples sentences who were unfairly treated in their court case and passing very important laws. I’m not pro trump but I’m not an idiot. You guys shouldn’t be either. You have the internet which is all of the knowledge humans have ever had and you trust some dumb news channel that was probably paid for and definitely bias. You see how idiotic and ignorant that is right. Yeah sure what he said was downright idiotic ,but you can’t tell me you’ve never said some bullshit to sound smart or prove a point. There is this micro scope on every little thing trump does that is “bad” or retarded yet no one focuses on the good he’s done for america and the people. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed jobs are being made everyday hundreds of thousands of Americans are getting employed. 

BUT NOOOO trump say noise make cancer I dum dum hahahaha funny orange man.
