I feel a bit shitty for being...well, shitty in the last comment, given your totally rational response.

I agree with everything you've said here, and don't think the results of the presidential election were falsified in any way, nor do I believe the congressional results were questionable.

That said, I do think the governors are often disrespectful and ignorant of the governed, and I'd like to believe this will at least make a couple folks go, "Hey, maybe we ought to consider not ruining the lives of those farmer folks, even if they are a minority, because I guess they outnumber us"
