As a westerner, you have no right to judge other people's beliefs. The story of Yakub and how he created the evil white race may sound preposterous to bigots on first glance, but we can assure you that there is countless evidence backing up this hypothesis. Attempting to dismiss someone's beliefs as "fake" without doing proper research and study just shows how ignorant and hateful you are. And no, looking through your racist aunt's Facebook page does not count as doing your own research.
