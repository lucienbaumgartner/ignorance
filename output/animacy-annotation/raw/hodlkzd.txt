Trying talking about this with women you meet and looking for experienced, self-confident women to start.
Here in America we are taught that we should be sexy and ignorant of sex, adventurous and prude, etc. It takes a second to get over those shitty messages and actually figure out that it is great and awesome to be and want whatever you want. Self confident isn't necessarily loud and in your face, BTW - self confident is more easily identified by not needing your opinion.

You may have better luck looking for women who have already graduated their twenties, or OLD and saying just what you said here.
