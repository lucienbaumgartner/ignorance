I don’t think players on the Thunder desire a “tanking” mentality. I think our athletes have a competitive spirit and this “tanking” mentality only damages the franchise.

This draft lottery only proved that “tanking” is an unreliable and frustrating tactic. 

Nobody likes to lose. “Fans” that desire losses are misguided and ignorant of the business aspect of the NBA.
