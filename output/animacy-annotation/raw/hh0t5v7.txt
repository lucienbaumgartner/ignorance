The underlying concept is a farce based on first-world luxury and absolute cluelessness about how instincts work because the speaker's world has never needed to allow them to surface or even present their existence.

Literal frozen-mountaintop life-or-death scenario, that line is drawn so far left, it's not on the paper.

North American "poverty" (so, $26,500/yr for a family of 4 - LITERALLY $72 PER DAY - holy shit that would feed/clothe/house a family of 6+ in the Midwest) that line is drawn just to the right of the horse for the vast majority, and the rabbit is in the wrong damn place as a manipulation. The rabbit is the gray area, the horse is not.

The entire exercise is completely stupid and ignorant of all logic and reason.
