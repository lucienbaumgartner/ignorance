Calm down angry child who doesnt have a clue.  
If they never pretended to be multiplayer why did they act confused on twitter when 2 players were in the same location.   
And they also claimed it would be nearly impossible for players to bump into each other. Which is saying it was multiplayer as you can bump into players in single player
and the interviews where they said you could play with your friends.    
And the cases they put a sticker covering the multiplayer bit on the box      
But carry on being rude ignorant and wrong 
  
&gt; Or more likely that of your peers because you come off as a young ignorant one. So really itâ€™s your brother or uncle or dad that led you wrong.  
  
The only one coming across as a child is the one blinding sucking off a games company with zero knowledge of what they are talking about having fun being a mnachild :)
