TL;DR of why it won't work: You have to squat in front of your opponent with your knees off the ground and your feet square while you wait for them to react. As the offensive wrestler, you're the one forcing the defensive opponent to react, but in MMA that reaction will be a knee eventually and you'll get kneed in the face like the finish of Aldo/Mendes 1. 

LONG VERSION HERE: Basically this takedown is not just one takedown, it's an offensive chain of moves that ends in a takedown. Ruth has refined his movements and angles to a point that as soon as he shoots he's set a trap and you have to get all the way out of it from the beginning, or you WILL fall into it. The takedown that Ruth hits in this video is the FOURTH option in the series of offensive moves from what I can tell. 

This takedown requires the aggressor (Ruth) to be non-committal in the forward motion of his shot, but extremely committed to the level change. Basically the exact opposite of what you want in MMA. What Ruth does in this video is change levels and then lazily make an effort at one leg or the other. The entire idea of this series, and honestly wrestling in general, is to force your opponent into committing to a weight shift when you don't have to, and then take advantage of it. Also, it forces the defensive wrestler to think, which is something you DO NOT want to be doing while wrestling shot defense. In defensive standup wrestling, you train for everything to be action-reaction. What Ruth does is take advantage of your wrestling instincts by changing the terms of the action-reaction scenario. It forces the defensive wrestler not to just react on instinct like he has for the last 15 years, but to think, and make a few decision along the way. Those include: 

- To sprawl or not to sprawl?

If defense sprawls, Ruth has shot lazily enough and from far enough away that he can get out from under the sprawl without much effort, spin around, and finish the takedown. If defense does not sprawl, he comes to another decision.

- Which leg is this dude attacking?

If the defensive wrestler just kicks his leg back like he did in the video, it puts all of the weight on the foot that he didn't kick back. Ruth has a TD finishing style where he just spins rather than chases, and he's naturally a long limbed person. So Ruth's best case scenario is for the defensive wrestler to essentially just post his leg out there and let Ruth spin around it. His other option is to give Ruth the leg he originally shot at, and put all of the weight on the back foot. This leads you into the typical high inside single leg finish options. That probably would not have worked for the defensive wrestler though because Ruth had already made the decision to run this series as soon as he changed levels, and the defensive wrestler was being lazy and unaware that Ruth was not committing to his original shot. If he would have been on top of his game he would have realized that Ruth was too far away for a good shot to begin with. This leads to a final question: 

- Do I move forward or backward?

After Ruth got a hand on the defensive wrestler, he still had the ability to defend but he only had two basic options, barring any crazy shit. He could have gone forward and try to spin clockwise around Ruth, or backward and spin counterclockwise, since at this point it was obvious that Ruth was going for a low finish rather than a high finish so he shouldn't be worried about his balance. The thing is, Ruth has practiced this finish so many times, he already knew that the guy only had two options. He planned it that way. 

Ruth feels the defensive wrestler try to go forward first, this is where you see Ruth try to grab the far leg so that his opponent would just fall on his knees for the easy finish. Ruth missed the leg though, and as soon as he missed he knew that his opponent's base was super spread out, and all of his weight was set to counter-balance Ruth's forward finish, so he takes him backward. Common sense right? As soon as the defensive opponent realizes he's moving backwards, he posts a hand and tries to rely on Ruth's body being there to not put him on his back. Ruth realizes what's happening and spins out from under the defensive wrestler.

So to recap:

- Ruth set this up by faking a shitty shot

- Defense didn't realize that the shitty shot was a fake, and reacted with shitty defense

- Ruth realizes this and immediately gets to work taking the guy's balance away

- Ruth is very good at using his body. Most tall guys let their limbs get stretched out before they're useful. Ruth stayed tight until he knew he was in deep on the leg, and then reach his big ass arm all the way around the defensive wrestler's waist. When someone has your groin stretched all the way out and then reaches around your back to grab your far hip bone, they have more strength in their arm than you do in your entire body.
