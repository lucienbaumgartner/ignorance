No I'm talking about equal opportunity, obviously equal outcome is not possible medically given the variables of health from individual to individual regardless of race, what this is about is breaking down perceptual racial biases in how people receive treatment in a medical system that has been historically racist, which is opportunity. 

You are wrong to attribute income gaps to IQ, that is proven false, particularly in places like the US where there are massive socio-economic divisions that date back to 400 years of chattel slavery Jim Crow policies, with deeply ingrained racism that denies equal opportunities in almost all areas of life in our highly segregated society. IQ tests are racist tests created out of the eugenics movement, and they ignore the socio economic factors and how they play into mental development and education.

Black patients are statistically more likely to have their pain discounted than white patients, and are more frequently turned away and have their problems ignored as exaggerations than white patients and have higher rates of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. They used to teach that Black people had higher pain thresholds and therefore were given less anesthetic or none at all and were subject to harsher procedures. There is a mountain of evidence for this and historical literature in medicine espousing these views. 

Your empty Jordan Peterson inspired rhetoric about equality of outcome vs opportunity that you cribbed from some social marxism lecture is bunk, just like the man who told you to clean up your room and stop jerking off to get your life together while he overdosed on Benzos and put himself into a coma. 

You're not too real, you are actually really wrong and frankly your race IQ stuff is straight up racist and ignorant of how inequality and structural racism effects development, which is the exact kind of thing and thinking this effort is trying to address in the medical community.

You yourself are prime example of racial bias, which screams out from every sentence you just typed.
