&gt;	Hell she's admitted that much of her activism is about power and restructuring the global markets into communism more than anything about pro-environmental policies.

Source for such a claim?

&gt;	She conveniently ignores China and India

She spoke at the UN and guess what? Both China and India were there.

&gt;	the two largest contributors to global warming

Can we please ban mentally retarded idiots who believe such bullshit? Your claim is proof you are a brainwashed fool who repeat things you read on Reddit comments without ever checking if they were true.
The fact that you are so stupid and ignorant that you have never checked in your life the countries most responsible for climate change is proof you should never vote. 
The idea that you could believe that India is “one of the two largest contributor to global warming”  disgusts me. It really does.
India contribution is relatively small.

But do you know which country is the historically most responsible country for climate change? The US. The only still outside the Paris agreement and with an elected president who is as mentally retarded as you and who thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax.

&gt;	However if she were king of the earth, she would stop all fossil fuels today, resulting in deaths of millions...so maybe that's her solution.

Yes sure retard, that’s what she would do.
Shut the fuck up and get out of here, you uncultured swine.
