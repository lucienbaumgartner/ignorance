&gt; If 1% of Twitter isnâ€™t enough for a sample size, then why not and what would be an appropriate amount?

It is not about the quantity is about the sampling. Was that 1% chose randomly? Do you have their basic stats? (# of followers, # of following,average tweets by day, political composition of the people they follow, engagement on political tweets) compared to the Average twitter user to ensure this is a non-biased,population representative set?

Imagine being this ignorant and confident. The reddit special.
