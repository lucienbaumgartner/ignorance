Really? I love it. And the fact that all he has left is his money and a bosom is beautiful.

When I hated him 3 years ago and we were all luffin about what his eventual fate would be nobody ever thought that he would literally be doing "shows" from cafes using a chef and his phone after being first demoted; stripped of his salary ( used to pay his intern and sidekick to replace him );having to pay hacks to accompany him every single fucking show before being fired for filming Roland shitting. 

You couldn't make this shit up - and the fact that he remains absolutely unapologetic and unaware that he was always the problem is pure comedy. I literally giggle out loud on the way to the bakery sometimes.

I hope this bullshit goes on forever.
