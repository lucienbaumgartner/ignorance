Seriously, so many people just go out in their vehicle traveling at a speed that they seem comfortable, completely oblivious and unaware that they are creating dangerous situations for every other driver who has somewhere to be (and therefore feels like going 15 under the speed limit is a bit too slow).

Couple that with people overreacting to the slow drivers (because they've been taught that letting unfiltered emotions affect their behavior is somehow acceptable), and you've got a recipe for disaster.

Furthered by traffic lights timed to demand attention, in a city where it's not illegal to use mobile devices. 

Springfield driving is a fucking nightmare.
