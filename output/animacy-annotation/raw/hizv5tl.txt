I would if I could. I'm disabled, on DSP but once my partner moves in, I'll lose the pension. Gov says he earns too much . So just like that, zero income for me. If I want anything, from now on I have to ask my partner. Its patronising and ignorant of modern cost of living and damn certain it leaves people at risk of domestic violence.
