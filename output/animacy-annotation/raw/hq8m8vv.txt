I'm from a family that literally breeds dogs lol. Pit bulls largely descend from the British Bull-and-terrier, which was bred specifically for "blood sport:" bull-baiting, rat-catching, and, eventually dog-fighting. A specific proclivity for continuing to attack in the face of pain (being "game") as it were, was prioritized. This carried on for over a century and a half, and now we're here, where dog-fighting is largely illegal and unpopular, but the dogs remain. 

The vast, vast majority of pit bulls will be sweet dogs their whole life. But ignoring their history - or what you're doing, implying it's a racist fiction - is simply ignorant, and unhelpful.
