The problem is that you've convinced yourself out of exploration. You're uneducated and proud. Fine!

But Rationality is a dirty word on your tongue. Max Planck:

 “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”


You won't understand this quote so I'll explain it to you: 

People will believe what they want in the face of overwhelming evidence. You await evidence failing to realize that you're so closed and ignorant that no amount of evidence will change your mind. 

I'll be frank. When you say that you don't have to climb through them all, you're correct, but you don't even know 10. Probably not even 5.
