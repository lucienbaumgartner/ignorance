This part struck me: 

&gt;I don't think Sharath owes me an apology for his grandfather's sexual violence. . . I never hoped for an acknowledgment statement from him. I worried that it would do more harm than good, by either maintaining the problematic hierarchical power structure or by creating a false sense of resolution. It is sad and ignorant that teachers were looking for him to say something which would make it safe for them to discuss things openly, or miraculously resolve the issue.

This is precisely the dynamic that is being created in Shambhala, where those that remain teaching, practicing, serving, paying, and attending retreats somehow think that the fact of acknowledgment from people in power is tantamount to *doing the work*. 

Karen Rain writes—again, switch out the names and you have Shambhala—about the subsequent internal work in her former community: 

&gt;The narrative around Pattabhi Jois's sexual violence has been controlled by the enablers, the people who profited by ignoring and denying his actions. Even now when teachers are talking about it more openly, the conversation has remained internal.

Not A SINGLE Shambhala event has occurred, to my knowledge, that centers the voice of a victim of its abuses. I would love to be corrected in this regard. It's shocking. I hope people who still feel like they need to remain involved can start to put out feelers to leave, because this rotten environment is in a state of collapse. I hope the people who have left are finding the support they need, and I know they're not going to find it within their old digs. That's for damn sure.
