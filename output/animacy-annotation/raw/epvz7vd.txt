So you make up a bullshit argument, and then lie and say it's my argument? Pathetic. That's your argument. Don't shove it in my mouth. That's the worst kind of shitty internet arguing on your part.

When I say "competitively", I just mean "actual multiplayer against humans", as in multiplayer where you intended to win, not just to faff around. I'm not saying you need to be a "ranked pro" or some shit.

Your opinions are bullshit because they're the opinions of someone who has only played part of each game, and has relied on the fact that they're playing against bad AI, not against actual humans who are playing smart.

That you think the difference between C&amp;C and Shogun 2 battles, which operate in fundamentally different ways, are "window-dressing" is the product of pure ignorance on your part. It's basically on the level of saying "All novels are the basically the same except for "window-dressing" because they have characters, a setting, a plot, and a beginning, middle, and end!" (which isn't even true, but anyway). I'm saying your opinion is ill-informed and ignorant. That you see a game where you mine resources to build units, and where rushes are the best tactic in many cases, as the same thing as a game where two well-matched armies come to battle fully-prepared, and where manuever and battle-line and so on are the best way to win, typically, as the same except for "window-dressing" is pure ignorance. It's not clever or insightful. You haven't "cut to the heart of the matter". You've ignored the matter entirely and said just made bland and wildly inaccurate assertions.

This is particularly funny because you claim SC2 is your favourite of these games, yet if you're even slightly competent at SC2, you know perfectly well that "finding balance between those roles is how you win" is absolutely NOT TRUE for SC2, especially not in multiplayer, which is how the game is DESIGNED to be played.
