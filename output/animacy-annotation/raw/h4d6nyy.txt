It really isn’t, it is defined by Encyclopedia Britannica as “ [ intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of colour. Critical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they function to create and maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, especially African Americans.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory) “. It is a racist, backwards ideology that is regressive at best. It defines people by their race and postulates race is the most determining factor in most things, in the US today, this is unfounded.

It’s hateful and ignorant of historical nuance to subscribe to CRT
