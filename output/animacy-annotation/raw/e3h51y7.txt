Congratulations!!!  People with these Mullerian duct abnormalities only have a slightly larger than the average public risk of things like miscarriage. Although, they are much more prone to preterm deliveries. Because each uterus is not the same size as an average one. So it fills up faster, if you will. But what you said goes along with what researchers suspect. That unless something prompts them to look, most people are asymptomatic and unaware that they've got something like this going on with their anatomy.
