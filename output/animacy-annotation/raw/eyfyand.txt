Well if you read my post you’d see I was mostly talking about people being actually helpful, not people being repetitive and ignorant. That I understand being downvoted but not others being kind to others. Sadly there’s some toxicity in this sub but there’s a good amount of good people in here too. I just wish people would be a little less rude for no reason
