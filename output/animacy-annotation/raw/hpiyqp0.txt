&gt;How do you manage to say that black crime and white crime aren’t real in one sentence, and in the next one say that crime is separated for white and black and other races. 

These are literally the identifiable races we have you F00L!🤦🏾‍♂️ That doesn't automatically make it a "black or white crime", because the numbers of certian offenses can fluctuate based in many demographics like age and location. THIS is how Stupid you are!🤣 You have absolutely no idea how to interpret the data and information.

&gt;Now, with 67% of sex offenders are white. You refuse to do the thing I told you to. You see, it just happens, that there’s more white people in US, than there are black people in US. So you need to use PER-CENT-AGE. In US 14% of population is black, 76% is white.

Comparing CRIMINALS to the entire population of an entire race is incredibly ignorant and incorrect, because that means you're also including women, children, and several other demographics that have nothing to do with the criminal frame smh

How old are you, seriously? You sound like you're mentally challenged, considering you're having so much difficulties understanding how any of this works. You still haven't addressed everything I have said.
