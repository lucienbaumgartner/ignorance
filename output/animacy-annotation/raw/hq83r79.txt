This has to be a troll post right? 

I mean, blatant homophobia and religious beliefs aside, “we said that he couldn’t be in wedding party because we don’t approve of his sexuality and now he’s not talking to us anymore. What did we do wrong?” is massively obtuse and ignorant of the feelings of others.
