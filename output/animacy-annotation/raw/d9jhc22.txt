I'm sure they were unaware and suspect they were misled into paying for "licenses".  I've dealt with enough shady people to have a pretty good divining rod on that.  These folks seem to be victims.  Either way I'm going to get straight on the licenses.  Do I need to format or can this be fixed in place?
