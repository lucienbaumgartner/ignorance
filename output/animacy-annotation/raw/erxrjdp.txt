Go on unpopular oppinion and the "racism" is matched the posts there are so absurd and ignorant that it reads like satire..Twitter and rantss on the internet are not real life nor do they reflect most, everyday people, I have yet to meet these extremists in person their bold views never make it off Reddit or twitter because they can't cower behind annonimity. Go outside and take a joke it'll do you some good.
