There is something to be said about your comment. Don't you think that to some extent autistic self\-loathing would fuel resentment against parents, after all, without them *they wouldn't be what they are*. 

I find this humorous in an existential way. :\-) Your comment has a deep philosophical current. Alan Watts talked about this at times. As children blame their parents for being alive: 'You did this to me!', a child that recognizes to be different has more reason to blame.

To what extend can parents be blamed? I get unto debates about this and usually get downvoted for it. Someone gets four kids and knows he has ADHD and I ask if two wasn't enough to gamble the child's happiness on.

My parents did not have dx's. It was a bad day when they met...for me. Because I never been happy in my life unless you count the child's unaware and undeveloped to recognize mind as happy. My father was autistic and died when I was 18. My mother still lives but she was narcissistic, ADHD and preferred my older brother over me. 

I will never get an apology that is sincere. Parents have a duty to be well so they can care for kids optimally.
