I agree. I don't think I could have. They considered me tainted by going to university, and maintained the idea I'd be Republican "once I got older." 

I'm glad to have our happy memories. And I most definitely see those memories through the view of rose-colored glasses because I was  young and unaware of their political affiliations. 

I don't think they would have said the awful words they said to me in the years before they died when I was a little girl. Or I hope not. They're not around anymore for me to ask.
