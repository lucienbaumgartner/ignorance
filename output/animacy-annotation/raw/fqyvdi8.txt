Officer from across the pond: I do feel sort of sad when I hear these taunts, but not for myself - I sleep easy at night knowing I spend every day trying to keep people safe and I'm proud of it.

No, what makes me sad is that this person is so hateful and ignorant that they surely can't ever find peace and happiness in their lives. If they despise the very concept of the rule of law, or are so determined in a belief that law enforcement are all corrupt/evil/bullies, then I can't see they have the capacity to trust, grow and cooperate with others. And when they are at the point of cheering for the death and injury of cops, then they truly are deranged.

I used to try and argue in good faith, but without exception I'd find the moment I point out a flaw in their argument the tirade of abuse would ramp up ten times worse. Now I just politely disagree and get on with the job - after all, I know I'm doing good in the world and I don't need the approval of a stranger to feel good about it.

As a side note...I am also aware that these are a tiny minority of people. Some people love cops, and some people hate us. The vast majority will never come into contact with us and just view us as a necessary part of society like cleaners or train drivers. And that's fine. I honestly don't want praise, I just want to do my job well and one day retire with a few good years left to enjoy myself.
