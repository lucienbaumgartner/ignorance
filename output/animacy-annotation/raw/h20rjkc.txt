&gt; But lots of Waymo fanboys will tell you it's part of the business plan

There is no fanboyism, it's how Alphabet companies are designed to work. They are expected to raise money on their own. There are examples across various Alphabet subsidiaries:

[Calico's total funding is 2.5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/alphabet-backed-calico-and-abbvie-chip-in-1-billion-to-cure-aging.html)

[Verily raises $700M in funding](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/here-s-how-verily-plans-to-invest-700m-fresh-capital)

[Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (spin off of Sidewalk Labs) raises $400M](https://fortune.com/2020/05/07/alphabet-vets-infrastructure-funding-400-million/)

Claiming Alphabet can't fund it because they aren't confident is downright lazy and ignorant of how the conglomerate is structured. Or more likely, Tesla fanboys trying to take a shot at the industry leader.
