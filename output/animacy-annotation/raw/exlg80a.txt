First, thank you for commenting. You seem to have understood what I was talking about, and I worried I was too confusing. Reassuring to read.

So, on the topic of doublethink, Im a bit confused by your vocabulary: I think the average person is able to believe something and not believe its implications, dragon-in-the-garage style, and to believe contradictory things and use either depending on circumstance. I dont think its even difficult, people naturally learn the way a belief is used with the belief and to do more requires an active step of abstraction. Is that what you mean by "fully believing"? Because I would call that normal doublethink, and in the rationalist sense, we would call it full beliefing only if it controls anticipation. And by "true doublethink" you seem to mean knowing the truth but consciously lying? I agree that that is unstable. But I would say true doublethink is to be both aware and unaware that youre doublethinking. Its pretty rare in the wild though, because there are rarely ever situations where you need to be aware of your doublethinking. The few other people Ive seen who I think do it all seem to be creating rethoric, though that may be selection bias.
