Seriously. Can you believe no one even talks about this horrible thing Trump's team said during the campaign? They knew they were taking advantage of uninformed voters:
&gt; “And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”

Actually I apologize, I just misinformed you. That quote was said by Hillary's team during the campaign.
