&gt;It’s pretty ignorant and nonsensical to say shocking doesn’t save lives **when it’s literally the most important treatment.**

**Its not though. Not at all.** You can shock somebody and it might work, might not. But if you haven't been maintaining perfusion, it's worthless. People wait to start compressions. People stop when the AED gets there. You're nervous, you've never seen this model before, setting it up takes a while. All that time, people are just waiting. No compressions. Granted, defib does a fantastic job of doing its job. But it's not a "gold standard" of anything.

**Compressions is the most important treatment, hands down.** If the body isn't properly perfusing, tissue starts dying. You understand that you can work somebody for 45 minutes and they can make a full recovery, and never once shock them? That's because perfusion was maintained the entire time and interruptions were extremely limited. Rhythms were checked, but they were in asystole (flatline) **and we don't shock asystole.** (Well, sometimes we do, but that's just because we're stubborn.) Got them to the hospital, they get to work on them, eventually stabilize the patient. It's rare, but it happens. And it's all because perfusion was maintained.

So no, it's not pretty ignorant. You're pretty ignorant.
