(TLDR version: Ah to be ignorant enough and to have enough money to believe the opposing viewpoints of Mexico is a crime free paradise and Illegal Immigrants are somehow fleeing from there to escape life threatening conditions of Cartel wars and poverty. One day I wish to have so much money and safety as to fund my heads joyrney that far up my own lower intestines as you obviously did.) Ah to be young, innocent, and ignorant of how shitty the real world is. Most if not all police outside of the tourist areas in Mexico are either on the take or intimidated. The ones inside the tourist areas are both usually from both the cartels and their own government.

Crime syndicates and cartels are not even remotely a Mexico only issue. They are everywhere. From Chinese triad affiliates, African warlords, well mannered and currently primarily into gambling and money laundering Italian mobsters, The Losing Hand of the Japanese Yakuza families, and the list literally goes on for nearly every country in existence or history. 

The issue rises when as we see with Mexico, the government is an absolute joke, the Cartels literally run the country, and a thin coating of order is used in select areas to keep foreigners with more money than brains ignorant of the situation outside those areas. Ask a few immigrants what life is actually like outside the tourist areas. Legal or illegal, after all people don't flee paradise by the 100,000s for our oh so pleasant climate in the midwest to hide from authorities in order to avoid deportation while working heavy labor jobs at below minimum wage.
