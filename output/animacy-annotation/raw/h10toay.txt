I mean its not that we dont want him because of comunism

Its that we dont want him because he is so conservative and ignorant that Im genuinly scared of what is he gonna do


I just found out on this sub and Im....speechless to say the least, I respect your opinion but researching a bit more doesnt harm anyone, hell, even left wing Veronika mendoza followers are scared of this guy

On the other hand keiko wasnt good either, this last elections have been dogshit and many people have concidered emigrating to better places.
