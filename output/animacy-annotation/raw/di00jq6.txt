Homie are you fucking trying to sound dumb? Let me explain this as simple as possible. It is a very very simple thing to understand, but I'll try to simplify it further because you aren't the only one not understanding


Heat is 1 heat (worth say $10 in usd) 
Para is .6 heat. ($6 usd) 

Heat drops in value. Value of para goes unchanged 

Heat is now worth $8, para is still worth $6. Para is not still worth .6 heat as that would mean it should be worth 4.8 dollars. 

Because para has not dropped, it is simply now a different value of heat, worth more than 0.6. Same goes for all items, those .2h painted wheels are now worth more than 0.2 heat as heat changed and they did not 

Heatwave has now changed in value. Yes, 1h still equals 1h but the value changes. We see this in economies all over the world man, how is this new to you? 

This is very very easy to comprehend    

Don't bother trying to refute this unless you can also explain to me how I'm wrong about real world economics and we don't actually have things like fluctuations in the value of a dollar/euro/pound/etc  because $1 is still always $1. I am sure some countries would be fucking thrilled to know they were just confused and unaware that the value of their currency couldn't change due to it being standard where they live. Someone should really get around to telling these countries this  as it can ruin economies and lives in the real world and apparently can be avoided
