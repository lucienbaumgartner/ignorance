The Democratic Party is all about making privileged suburban white leftists feel good about incredibly racist, divisive, and anti-American politics in order to drive wages and community standards down to benefit the multinational interests that donate to them.

For everyone outside the privileged white leftist bubble of useful idiots, Democrats divide people based on race and try to replace concepts like sound policy and upward mobility with angry racial rhetoric and an empty brand image. They want people to be uninformed, angry, and divided.

&gt;*conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry*    
&gt;*compliance is obviously fading*     
&gt;*this problem demands some serious, serious thinking*    

This is how the Democrats feel about their voting blocs. They want to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry and it's only when compliance falls that they consider it to be a problem. You can wake a lot of people up with this one Wikileaks link because they'll know it in their hearts that its what Democrats have been doing to them for years, and they'll also realize the media has been lying to them to keep them compliant and unaware as well.
