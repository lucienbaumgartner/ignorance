Have a friend (female) who would always say "Well, women experience [insert men's issue we were discussing here] a lot more..." anytime a group of my college peers (she being the only woman amongst us) would bring up male issues...She's still my good friend of mine, but she's just ignorant and unaware that men can also face issues, no matter how "small" or often they occur.
