As an individual I get the "heat of the moment" point. However, as a lawyer, I do find it beyond unreasonable that a governmental agency, such as the Secret Service, was so thoroughly unaware and ready to breach the law, with respect to the autopsy. Obviously, the individual agents present there were reacting emotionally but the higher ups needed to be more diligent. The agency should definitely have been taken to task for it. Accountability of governmental action is a must - it is an important principle upon which the whole system functions. Just my two cents.
