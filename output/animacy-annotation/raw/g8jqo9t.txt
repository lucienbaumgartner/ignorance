1. conservative girl hot. liberal girl ugly. The reason both parties are represented as women, is so that the conservative-ish guys that this meme is targeted at don't feel attacked by the people they kinda agree with being portrayed as dumb, yet at the same time its pretty telling which of the two is more identifiable, or at least which provokes less disgust. it plays off of the presumed inherent sexism of the viewer, as well as the political stereotypes they adhere to.
2. outsider good. being blocked by both parties. see, both parties the same! Takes a legitimate problem, and presents a just-so solution (just vote better!) rather than the difficult, boring, wonkish, bottom up, distributed solution that is required if we actually want to fix the problem.
By presenting the solution as "just vote for an outsider" despite that being a completely ineffectual and practically impossible solution, It's equivalent to saying "hey guys global warming is a problem, but if we all just stop consuming fossil fuels, the problem will go away!" no. the problem is systemic, and the system needs fixing. Panders to the kind of person who likes yang because he superficially makes sense and is outside of the establishment, and has the side effect of making the viewer feel smart for Just Getting This One Incredibly Simple Thing.

this meme is just whataboutism distilled and marketed to the kind of libertarian-ish politically unaware roganite brodude who's basically a conservative who likes weed and thinks they're the smartest guy in the room, and dislikes republicans because they say things that are sorta like the things he has to say, but more boomerish. 

I don't think any of this is overtly intentional, it's just a low effort whataboutist meme made by a vaguely socially conservative, arrogant, politically unaware and sexist guy who likes yang
