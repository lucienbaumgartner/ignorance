What I'd do, don't know if it's the call for you, is kinda going all the way, you can be ignorant and happy, sentient and depressed, and then I kept thinking and became sentient and happy again, it's not about ignoring unsolvable problems, it's about accepting them, knowledge isn't power, agency is, if you have no agency over it, it's not something you can change, there's no need to care about it

It's an abstract step to take, not much instructions or predictions, but it would be like attacking the source of this uncertainty, question your questioning, when noticing the pain confront it, drive yourself through it and see the other side, why are you asking yourself that? Why do you care? Do you have any agency, anything to do, with that awnser?
