**Skip down to the tl;dr if you don't want to review.**

MCU, among other adaptations of the Marvel "Extended" Universe have always played fast and loose with the omniversal nomenclature. 

One thing we know is that the TVA/Miss Minutes party line is a lie. Their understanding of the nature of the "Sacred Timeline" is at best incomplete, and at worst, a complete fabrication with only coincidentally coinciding information.

At the end of time in Loki, we do see what *appears* to be the Sacred Timeline and the Castle at the End of Time with He Who Remains at least aware of various incidences in multiple timelines, possibly multiple universes. We also see what appears to be the Sacred Timeline diverging once "the threshold" is reached.  This coincides with the readouts at the TVA in **an alternate *universe*.** (one where Mobius doesn't recognize Loki-199999-B).

However, no one's version of how the omniverse works is credible. The TVA are brainwashed, the Loki's are not trust worthy and ignorant of how these powers beyond them work, and He Who Remains is manipulative and quixotic.

A single timeline spawning branches continuing into alternate universes, complete with Lokis being born different genders and species, as well as a TVA in which Mobius, an interchronographic Loki expert, doesn't recognize Loki-199999-B, only makes sense if branches start at the beginning of time.

We know *a* quantum realm exists in a way that within it, a person can travel both back and forward in time. We know that messing with quantum time travel can accidently pass time through a person, rather than a person traveling through time. And we *know* that going back in time and making changes does not affect your native timeline, but that, at least with removing an infinity stone, one timeline can diverge from itself. (if you believe what the Ancient One tells Bruce)

The Ancient One also tells us there are multiple **dimensions**, and Dr. Strange traveling through them and Dormammu existing in one is good evidence that she was correct.

We have evidence that someone from one timeline can live a lifetime in an alternate timeline and then return to a point in his native timeline. (Captain America couldn't have stayed in his native timeline to return the stones and hammer and then live his alternate life with Peggy, because you can't change your own past)

Finally, we have some conjecture and rumors about MoM and NWH, most notably that people from Earth-10005 or Earth-TRN688 are going to show up in Earth-199999 in NWH. (and Earth TRN688 already showed multiversal crossover in Into the Spider-Verse)

*There's other info on this subject that's no longer canon to Earth-199999 like Agents of Shield in an unnamed "Earth-ABC", and Earth-616 has not had any crossover to Earth-199999, so we can't use the comics as guidelines.*

Given what we know and what we think will happen, I'd say it's reasonable to assume that "alternate timeline" seems to be synonymous with "alternate universe" only once the timeline branch passes "the redline". Before that, they are only "alternate timeline branches" and can be pruned. (the people directly pruned, go to "the Void" and the the rest of the timeline branch, spacetime fabric and all, get remerged into "The Sacred Timeline" via the use of "time bombs". Once a branch passes "the red line" it becomes an unpuneable alternate universe that can interact with Earth-199999 and cause a multiversal war. 

The One Who Remains maintains this timeline through the TVA pruning branches to prevent alternate The One's Who Remain from existing in a multiverse and waging interuniversal and chronographic warfare, but we know that other universes exist in the Marvel Multiverse, including those already mentioned, and that these universes can interact with each other.

Importantly, branches can occur at any and all points in time once the timeline is no longer being maintained by The One Who Remains. So infinite branches starting from the beginning of the universe have formed. The TVA exists outside of time in its home universe, but not outside of its universe, and an alternate universe that must have branched and red-lined before Loki was born (965 AD) and Loki-199999-B was accidentally sent there instead of his native universe.

The quantum realm is either a bridge between the main timeline and alternate time branches (if the events of End Game were not big enough to redline either the past or present that can be remerged with the prime universe) or a bridge between universes that have not existed in the metaverse until **"now"**, but "now" that they exist, they have *always* existed.

**tl;dr**

**The Omniverse** includes Earth-1218 as well as all fictional universes and alternate histories, including all, canon and non-canon, Marvel universes.

**The Metaverse** includes all Marvel and Marvel-connected universes; including canon and non-canon adaptations and media, the Fox Marvel Universe, the ABC Marvel Universe, The Sony Marvel Universe; all universes included in adaptations including Earth-1610, Earth-90214, etc.; and including Marvel properties like Malibu Comics universe, etc.; and including an Earth-1218 analogue. There are multiple Metaverses such as the DC Multiverse and the George Lucas Multiverse (Indiana Jones, Starwars, etc.)

**The Multiverse** includes all Earth-199999 universes; including Phase I-âˆž canon properties, and the alternate universes (unpruned timeline branches that became alternate universes after passing the redline in 2023, 2012, 2013, 2014A, 2014B, 1970A, and 1970B) The Avengers diverted off the main timeline in End Game. Multiple Multiverses exist within the Metaverse including the Earth-10005(Fox's X-Men) multiverse and the Earth-TRN688(Sony's Spider-man) multiverse. These multiverses may interact with each other as well as the universes within them.

**Universes** are contiguous, coherent, and canon properties. Fox's X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand, along with the Wolverine trilogy are in one universe, but Fox's X-Men: First Class, X-Men Days of Future Past*, and X-Men: Apocalypse are in another universe. Universes exist within a multiverse, but, like in the case of Days of Future Past and Deadpool 2, can interact with one another. We may see multiple multiverses as well as individual universes interacting in NWH (Maguire, Garfield, Holland), and very likely in MoM.

**Timelines** are divergences from a main timeline in a universe,  but that are pruned before reaching the red line in variance. Loki-199999-B and Loki/Sylvie come from the same universe, but separate timelines/branches. The TVA also exists within its universe but not within a timeline. The main timeline of Earth-199999 is essentially all the MCU mainline movies as well as WV, F&amp;WS, and most of Loki.

**Dimensions** are part of a timeline. Multiple "dimensions" exist both in the main timeline and in a branch, though it's possible that dimensions are also on the same level as a timeline and are both not affected by timeline branches, and can be bridges to alternate timelines or universes, like the quantum realm does.
