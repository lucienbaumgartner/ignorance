"50 states with different cultures"

you really should have put in being arrogant and ignorant of other cultures if you think that's something that's unique to the us op.

i'm legitimatly shocked by how arrogant americans can be, like really? you think winning independence from britain makes you unique? you think people living in different locations having different cultures is something quirky?

i swear, americans are the #notlikeothergirls of the world.
