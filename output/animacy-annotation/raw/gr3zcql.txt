He still works here.

He's completely computer illiterate
He's a "mechanical" technician with out any formal of experience in mechanical work
He's has no experience in anything but minor work.
He has no fault finding skill set
Oh and he so arrogant and ignorant that he thinks he knows more than anyone else.

This all results in me dreading when he comes off a call out. Cos that fucker will isolate an entire site because of something like a o ring or look knock off power supplies because of a fault instead of calling out a electrician.

He's already cost the company Â£100ks in down time in the last 5 years.

I made idiot guides on how to reset and bring system back online. He ignores and does his own thing...
