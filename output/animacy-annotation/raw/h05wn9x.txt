I'm not saying it was disrespectful to Osaka specifically, but to people who have mental issues in general

Just as you are disrespectful and ignorant of the plight of those with mental health issues for saying she 'played the mental health card to get special treatment.'

That is the stigma people with mental health issues face all the time: That we're lazy, that we're acting, that we're drama queens.

People like you and the French Open officials are obstructions to wellness.
