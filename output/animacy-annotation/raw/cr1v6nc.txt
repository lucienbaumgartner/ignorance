Same situation with me. I'm not too worried about it though because i'm transferring this fall. Honestly, making legit friends at a CC is very difficult if you don't already know people there. I also tried joining clubs at my CC too. Fucking hated it. After that, i just told myself to worry about my grades and just wait to make friends when i transfer. 

As for what i'm doing this summer? Taking summer classes, video games, gym, catch up on GoT, read books. Anything to keep myself busy and unaware that i have no friends lol.
