Holy shit. You do realize "I have a black friend" is the default for people to say when they've been called out for saying racist things? That's not a fucking excuse and it is disgusting and ignorant that you are saying all these things. You think racism is always obvious, but it isn't.

Seems like you would do better at r/BachelorNation. If you actually want to be educated, I suggest listening to Amber Ruffin of late night.
