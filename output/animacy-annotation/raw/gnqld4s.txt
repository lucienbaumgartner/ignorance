It's still a little sad when reading the tweets of people saying I'm losing my house and I could use the money back, please send it back. Yes, it does fall under the survival of the fittest, but you have to start looking at some of these supporters as too dumb to make proper decisions. If you look at some of the non-malicious ones that trusted him to make some of their jobs come back from overseas and ignorant of his malicious doings as mentally deficient, I begin to feel sympathy for a small percentage of them.
