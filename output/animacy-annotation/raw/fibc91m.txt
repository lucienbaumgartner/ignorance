I honestly couldn't tell you. There was a askreddit some time ago that asked women what they wished dudes would stop doing in bed, and so much of it seems amazingly obvious from the other side. Don't try surprise anal with a unaware and unprepared partner. Don't pretend your fingers are in a race with Sonic the Hedgehog, or that a clitoris is a Bop It. Maybe don't choke or slap as a form of foreplay without discussion. These are all things that moreorless appear in porn, which seems obvious to everyone else but straight guys to be fantasy in the same way dicks aren't actually delivered in pizza boxes. Worse, no doubt (some to most) women will communicate something is wrong in some way or the other (e.g. verbally with explicit or soft denials, physically via shying away or kicking at a hand, or show lack of interest or hesitation in future trials) and dudes still keep it up. And I don't mean a few more times. I mean for years do the same stuff that hurts everytime with little warning. TL;DR A lot of men don't listen to their partners. They listen to their porn playlist and leave it at that. And there's no easy answer to teach men to listen to women, in bed and in general.
