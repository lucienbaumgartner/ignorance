Those subsidies would not be needed would Scotland not be crippled by the "Public Sector Debt Interest" throughout decades, effectively paying for debt interest, debt that was not invested in Scotland at all. There is also the huge cost of the UK armed forces expenditure, which it certainly would not require going forward.

It is shady accounting going back to the 1920's, effectively stealing from thus nation under cover in order to keep it subjugated and unaware of it s true worth.
