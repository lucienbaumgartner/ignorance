Repairing a wall along the southern border of the USA to the one in Berlin is ridiculous, ignorant, and complete nonsense.

If you can’t understand the difference between a wall to keep people in and a wall to keep the unwelcome out, you should not be participating in this conversation.

As for the rest of your ridiculous nonsense, we have a system in place by which people may legally enter the USA. I’m not interested in anyone’s defense of illegal immigration.
