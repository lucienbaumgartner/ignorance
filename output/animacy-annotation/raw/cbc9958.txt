i totally get your point but it's the people who aren't tech savvy and unaware that these filters are on by default who are being censored, cameron is trying to get people to lazily accept censorship with the front that it's all to protect the children! if anything, doing this will just make it harder for the government to find out who is accessing illegal content like child porn because they'll be forced deeper into the web with further encryptions, so it'll solve nothing, people will still be accessing illegal content, it'll be harder to find out who is and to top it all off the majority of the population is being censored from information that never caused any problems in the first place...and to note, i said nothing about no adult content? i couldnt give a fuck about porn being filtered, it's the censorship with no absolute, transparent reasoning that i have a problem with...remember when they tried to block pirate bay? well that worked really fucking well didn't it? just a pointless venture by the government to censor the less educated majority and those who aren't tech savvy
