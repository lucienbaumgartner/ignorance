I wasn't necessarily "in" it, it was just that I shared a lot of views with them. In regards to how I got out so to speak, I kinda became sick of all of the doom and gloom people on the alt-right perpetrate and became apathetic to it all, it was sort of a taking my head out of the clouds type of thing, the world in which the alt-right says exists only exists on the internet basically, irl things are completely different. There's this whole notion they spread that 'they' (they means different things depending on the person, minorities, trans people, liberals, etc.) want to destroy your way of life, country, children, etc. and yeah to a mid-teen who had no real world experience and only experience with that stuff where these videos I ate them up. Anyway over time my views changed, I left all of that behind, I'm glad that I never took my old views out on anyone and never hurt anyone, mostly because I was an isolated kid who lived on the web. But yeah I guess that's the best way to explain it? My advice to people who know others who believe in the alt-right, get them off the computer, into the real world, problem is they prey on the young, ignorant and scared
