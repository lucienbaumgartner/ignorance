Well I wasnâ€™t under anesthesia per say and it was something I did coming out of what is called Conscious Sedation (dose you up with a good amount of Ketamine or Midazolam and your awake but totally unaware and donâ€™t remember anything)

Anyway this medication causes your body obviously to not function as it should once you start to wake up. It takes it a bit to cycle out of your system. 
They told me multiple times before they dosed me (wisdom teeth removal) that I would try to feel super human and get up once I was awake.

Didnâ€™t listen
I tried to get up
Lower half of my body would not respond with the upper half of my body and I ate the floor face first. Smashed into the cabinets.
Iâ€™m 5â€™10 and 340lbs I hit the ground like a sack of bricks 
My mother all the nursing staff and the doctors were loosing their minds. 

So yeah I was the first patient in her 25 years to do that ðŸ˜‚
