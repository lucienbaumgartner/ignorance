Oh, I agree. 

America loves to put everyone and everything in pigeon holes. I am not sure where that started or came from. I think it was the class and slavery way back. 

Personally I find it silly and ignorant that everyone has to have a "title". Why? 

Everyone bitches that they want to be free but they throw themselves in a box with a label on it. You have to laugh at it.
