I used to fly from Hong Kong for my annual ski trip to Hokkaido.

Prices have gone up a lot over the past 3-4 years since the Chinese have continued to flood the place but here's a bit of what to expect.

Round trip flight US$4-600
Lift passes US$40-60/per day
Can't remember what rental prices were since we had our own gear
Hotel US$50+/per person/per day (Japan charges by the person, not the room), hostels can be as cheap as 25~ish
Food US$30-60/day unless you go straight convenience store food which you definitely shouldn't
Drink US$5+/per beer
Transportation US$75-100/per person round trip depending on where you guys are headed from Sapporo

I'd avoid Niseko personally, it's Bali on ice. Lots of Aussies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the trails were wicked crowded. Good nightlife though should covid be over by next winter.

Best of Luck!

DEFINITELY avoid going around Chinese new year, everything will be way more expensive and full of first time Chinese tourists, who are just oblivious and ignorant of everything.
