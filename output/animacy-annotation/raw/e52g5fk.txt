should have reworded that.  The super took me aside. I was super naive and unaware that my girl lovestruckness to my crush was VERY VERY obvious to everyone at work, and I did acted flirty &amp; stupid when I should have shown more professionalim. Ppl knew I was being played so thats why my super took me aside and gave me a lowdown on what was going on.
