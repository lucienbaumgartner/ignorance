Just remember that most of America, and most of the world for that matter, are uneducated and unaware of the principles of science, and unfamiliar and unwilling to engage in research and critical thinking. 

Right now, it’s my belief that the easiest and most effective way to get most people on the same page about this is to give them an underhanded, easily digestible, three word phrase that they all understand: TRUST THE SCIENCE. 

Science is built to be self critical. It’s built to navigate towards the most plausible explanation. I doubt there will ever be an instance in the future of mankind where a higher proportion of scientists get a scientific question wrong than the proportion of the general public who gets that same question wrong. Could it happen? Of course. Just highly unlikely. Trust the experts and trust the science unless your willing to do the science yourself and the show the other scientists (since you’re a scientist now) why your conclusion makes more sense.

Edit: To be clear, I do agree that in principle you are absolutely correct. I just think it’s too much to ask of the general population.
