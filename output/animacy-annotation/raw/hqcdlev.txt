I’ve been in so many social groups.

Conservatives and liberals.

They’re both wrong.

The blind hate of the liberals is toxic. Idiots. 

The conservative/republican sorts are more competent than liberals, cultured in a certain way, and whatever else, but they got a better start in life. Got better luck in one form or another. And they are oblivious, ignorant, and pathologically arrogant.

I can’t structure a better reply.

I’ll leave on this note.

Most people disgust me. Everyone could do better, together.
