That's not attacking. 

Yeah they are pretty shallow and ignorant of Christian theology. 

&gt;When in reality atheists are the ones bringing critical reasoning to religious debate. The religious follow their teachings, the atheists question them.

The atheists don't know the religious theology. They have shallow understanding. All they do is building strawman and refute it and they think they debunk the actual theology. 

They love to claim to be critical except their own understanding.
