I know, my bad. I just see so many northeasterners getting excited about "oh maybe we're next!" but who are unaware Chris Christie is still governor of NJ, unaware that the PA legislature is deeply conservative, and unaware that they statistically probably don't live in a state with referendums. And I don't want them to get their hopes up for nothing.

But hey! Come to Mass next year! We have great beaches, skiing, museums, music, and after Jan. 1 2018, weed!
