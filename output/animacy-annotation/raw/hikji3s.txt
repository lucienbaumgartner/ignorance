I think we agree mostly on the nature of economic migrants coming to Europe from Africa and Western Asia. You were just being stupid and ignorant of the very real cases of refugees who also came from these areas. Sudan was fighting South Sudan for example, with thousands caught in the middle.

Yeah, pre 2015, most migrants crossed from Libya to Italy, but in 2015 and 2016, at the height of the crisis when hundreds of thousands made it to Europe, the vast majority crossed the agean Sea from Turkey to Greece, and walked into Europe.
