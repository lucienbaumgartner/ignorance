So the very first time I came across Nosleep was during a very boring internship where I had very little work to do and unrestricted internet access, circa 2010. It started by just googling dark history to learn about, and fictional stories that went along with it, but I somehow came across a link to Reddit (which I didn't know existed at the time, first time having personal computer access was in college and smart phones didn't exist yet) and stories on NoSleep - which I immediately began binge reading. Having very little understanding of Reddit in general and unaware of the RP rules in the comments - I actually thought the stories were real!! I truly thought people were sharing scary, supernatural things that happened to them and looking for advice. And back then alot of authors would include links to pictures to go along with the stories, making it feel even more real. I even remember telling my friends all about it, because growing up in the rural Midwest we used to go "ghost hunting" all the time. Meaning we would drive to places that were supposedly haunted/ had old legends in the middle of the night and basically trespass until someone was scared enough to leave - think abandoned schools, cemeteries, etc. So it was all very exciting at the time. Clearly I caught on to the fact that it is a platform for fictional writing and turned from a long time lurker to someone with an actual account for posting, and while I still very much enjoy NoSleep as a whole I find myself much less interested in the comments now. The RP does feel a bit tired in 2021 where the mystic is gone and we all know it's not real. Whereas I do read the comments on shortscarystories to hear more from the author, especially when they talk about their inspirations which I find very interesting. So after a long rant, I agree with your proposal for a trial run to change the RP rule and see how it plays out.
