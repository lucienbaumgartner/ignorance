There is so much here, but people seem to have it covered.  My comment - you say your family aren't demanding and won't be difficult?  They just complained that you and your EIGHT MONTH PREGNANT wife didn't travel to see them for Christmas and DEMANDED you make it up to them!  Yes, they are demanding and difficult, and I guarantee having them stay for a week won't be pleasant for your wife.  You are so ignorant and non-understanding!
