You obviously have no idea what goes into the top 0.1% pro players training to be that good at video games. Esport gaming is not the same  as olympic disciplines in the sense of what physical and mental capabilities you use. Esports qre typically focused on hand-eye coordination (trained by volume of matches played and specialised training sessions), mental multi-tasking (micro and macro examples in League of Legends, DOTA2, StarCraft, CSGO, mindfully tracking resources available and used to you and the opponent, game-states, positions...) and strategic and tactical acumen based on available limited knowledge, meta and mentally tracked information.

Your opinion is extremely uninformed and unaware of state of things you're opinionating on.
