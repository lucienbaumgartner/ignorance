Many of my fellow Americans worry that they'll have to wait in lines or not be able to choose their doctor.  In Japan, I had surgeries with no wait time and was able to choose doctors as I needed it.  The whole concept of selecting a primary care physician and not being able to see a specialist until your generalist says "I give up" is beyond logic.  


Many others are just arrogant and think that there is nothing to learn from other countries and systems because we're already "the best"...


I love my country, but we are so selfish, arrogant, and ignorant that we'll kill ourselves before acknowledging that anyone else might have answers better than ours.
