In a way, life is kind of precious but at the same time, the world is full of evil people. Not everyone is a good person and not everyone cares about others but actually wants to see the world burn. People are so naive and ignorant that it's crazy. This world is cruel alot of the times and we were birthed onto this planet and it wasn't our choice and we can't decide when we can leave it which makes it more unfair.
