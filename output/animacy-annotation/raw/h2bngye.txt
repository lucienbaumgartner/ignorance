&gt;That sacrifing 1 child's life for the potential life of millions is wrong?

Yes, it is. Take these 4 examples:

1) A man who kills prostitutes because he wants to "clean the streets".

2) A man who kills infidels because "the world belongs to the people who believe in God".

3) A man who sacrifices people in rituals because he wants to "avoid God's rage upon mankind".

4) A man who kills innocent people because he wants to find a cure for a disease and "save the world".

All of them are sociopaths. To a greater or lesser extent, they all have God-complex (they believe in being saviors), arrogance (they believe they are right and justified), lack of empathy (they don't care about those people), hypocrisy (would they kill/sacrifice the ones they care about?) and, most importantly, their thought process is exactly the same: Their victims are necessary losses on the path to make the world a better/safer place.

Obviously, all examples I'm saying involve the victims being either innocent and unaware of their deaths.
