You don’t have the freedom to spread a deadly virus during a pandemic. That isn’t a Constitutional right. You need a license to run a restaurant for a reason. You use tax payer money for protections to help your business. If you aren’t interested in adhering to safety, then you don’t have a right to own a business. It’s that simple. I’m tired of you people being selfish and unaware of what rights you actually have.
