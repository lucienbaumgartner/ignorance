Is it ignorant and misleading to have faith in the fact that 90% of our adult population is vaccinated? So maybe it's reasonable to assume that ICUs will hold. 

How about that all the information coming out of South Africa (where their vaccination rate is much lower) also shows stable hospitalizations? How about in New York where they have 30,000 cases a day and hospitalizations are also stable? 

I don't know if ICUs will pop off in the next few days, but there is plenty of reason to be hopeful. It seems like everyone on here just wants to believe the worst though.
