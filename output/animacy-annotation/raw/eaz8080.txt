Part 2


&gt; College educations are required for the lions share of careers nowadays, that means we can no longer pretend its optional.

They are required for many careers that don't require manual labor.  In some, you can simply demonstrate competence, and put in the effort to succeed.

On the other hand, there are plenty of careers where some manual labor is required that are quite lucrative.

&gt; I think thats a very poor way to view this. The world needs every kind of person and position, not just engineers.

The world doesn't need people with masters degrees in gender studies.  Truly, it does not.

&gt; Im sorry but you're just wrong. Colleges do not exist to push indoctrination.

You sound an awful lot like someone who has been convinced that is the truth.

I'll leave you with a bit of wisdom from a Bill Clinton appointee on the value of education:

&gt; [And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) - Bill Ivey, Clinton appointee to the chairmanship of the National Endowment of the Arts, from the Wikileaks release of John Podesta's emails.
