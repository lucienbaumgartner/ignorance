My involvement is I am just a fan of bitcoins and poker, I have no financial  involvement or interest in btcontilt.com. My direct communication is I used to help another site owner host games on btc so I had direct communication via skype with one of the admins, this is no longer the case. I have been emailing support@btcontilt.com just like any one else can. I have just been taking the time to so I can address any issues this community has with the software. 

I am unsure and unaware that dropbox host the setup program, that is something I will ask about. 

The way chips work is $100 is equal to 1 bitcoin or on the client $1 is equal to 1/100th of a bitcoin.
