That's not entirely fair, though. In this analogy, you were 100 percent unwilling and unaware that you would be kidnapped, and it was done against your consent.

In 99 percent of pregnancies, you are aware of the risks. You were willing to have sex unprotected, or, if using protection, aware of the chance of failure. Knowing all of this, you still made a conscious decision to have sex- pregnancy is the consequence.

I'm undecided on abortion in general- I hope to see a day when birth control is widespread and effective enough that all pregnancies are intentional and wanted- but definitely against it in the late 2nd/3rd trimester, for context.
