I’m assuming your MIL is in Sydney? I’m also an essential worker in Sydney who lives alone, and this makes my blood boil. All my family live in QLD and I haven’t seen them since last Christmas due to the border closures. I go to work, and I come home. That’s it. If I need groceries, I buy them on the way home from work or order online. I wear a mask on the street, on the bus, in my office and when I’m doing laundry in my apartment block’s communal laundry room. I check in &amp; out everywhere I go. I’m exhausted and at breaking point. I was only able to get my first dose of AstraZeneca this week due to the age restrictions. If it helps … my father is the same way as your MIL. He thinks the rules don’t apply to him, and what is worse he is vocally anti-vax, despite being in his 60’s. He is just so selfish and ignorant that I don’t bother to call him any more. I know nothing I say will change his behaviour… even my mother has casually mentioned wanting to divorce him. I just don’t get the mindset of people like this … the rest of us are trying so hard to stop the spread, why do they think the rules don’t apply to them?!
