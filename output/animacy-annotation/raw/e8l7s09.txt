This is so fucking creepy. Pretty sure he doesn't want you to be awake and doesn't wanna tell you that because "you'll be mad" and rightfully so because what is enjoyable about the other person being passed out? Idk I'm pretty open minded but something about him needing you to actually be asleep and unaware that its happening gives me a bad feeling. Also no shame after being caught, no apology or awareness just continuing to point out he wouldn't care if you did it to him and then he tries to shift the blame onto you. 

These seem like the signs of a narcissist which would maybe explain why he wants you to be asleep, so that he can feel in control. Its pretty messy op, I hope you take the right steps from here on. Let us know what you decided to do if you feel comfortable sharing that. Good luck and be careful.
