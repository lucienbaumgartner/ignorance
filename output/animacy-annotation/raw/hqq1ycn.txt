Politics...
I have a degree in politics...

I loved it. 
But the more I learn &amp; hear about other peoples political thoughts and whatnots, the more I realise the world is fuuuuuucked. 

And now I wish I could take back 4 years of university and unknow all the things I know and go back to being ignorant and unknowing and just think things are good.
