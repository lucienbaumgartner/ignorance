IIRC the Dutch foundation that owned the Catalina had a mishap with it which required extensive repairs. Subsequently they were off the air show/tour circuit for a number of years and despite significant donations weren’t able to keep it going. 
They’ve applied to the government for money too if I’m not mistaken and the government -totally unaware and unsympathetic to how special this aircraft is- denied the request for money and/or waiving of tax dues or something and it forced the foundation to sell up. 
What a fucking waste and a big loss for the Dutch historical aircraft community. 

At least she went to a good home. But fuck.
