Modern birth where everyone survived! (With vasa previa probably only i, or none of us would have). I am going to try to find this new York times article about c section recently that discussed how women feel pressured to be like, i had a c section but i had to, or i had a c section but i still suffered in x way. I think it's an early start to pitting women against each other/ mommy wars. The article discusses how some people who get c sections don't feel right saying their baby was born! I think that is sad. I also think it's messed up that classes about birth typically don't discuss anything about c sections or recovery which is just stupid and ignorant of the realities, and makes them more of this hush hush thing that you don't know about and aren't "supposed" to have.
