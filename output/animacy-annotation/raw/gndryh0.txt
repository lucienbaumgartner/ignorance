Kurt seems both aware and unaware of how he looked in the ring.

Like he said that he was slow because of ring rust, and that he never really shook it, and was compounded by arthritis setting in because of his lack of movement and exercise. Looking at matches he had just before he re-signed with WWE, that seems to be true.

But he also says things like "I pitched me, Jordan, and Gable doing Team Angle 2.0 with me as world champ" and now this which makes him seem like he was completely unaware.

Did Angle deserve better? Absolutely. Angle is a legend.

Could Angle have delivered a legendary match? By 2019, probably not.
