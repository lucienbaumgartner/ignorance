Hm yeah, a friend had hypothesized that as well, in case the sun station wasn't told to shut off properly, or if for any reason at all the message that the eye had been found didn't "reach" the Nomai at the sun station, they'd be stuck in the loop forever.

I suppose that makes sense, and now I do remember that passage about potentially being unaware and unable to stop it, so I suppose that supports it.
