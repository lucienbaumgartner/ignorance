Seriously? You were alive through the  Trump 24/7 media circus of 2016 and your argument is that 61% of Mormon voters were so stupid and ignorant they thought Trump was a respectable person?

Can I ask, what is it that makes you think Mormons are so much less politically aware than, say ... you know I'll be fair and pick a demographic group that Trump did not directly attack by name, like Asian-Americans. 18% of Asian-American voters voted for Trump in 2016.

Is it really likely that 61% of Mormons were so dumb and ignorant that they *accidentally* voted for a bigot like Trump even though he was loud and proud about his bigotry, ignorance and hatred?

Or is it much more likely that most of them knew full well what he was like and just decided to ... look past the dishonesty and hatred and vote for him anyway?

Go ahead and downvote, but "People just didn't know what Trump was like in 2016" is an embarrassingly bad take and you should feel bad.
