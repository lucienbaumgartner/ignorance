Edgerton is living in a fantasy world. He doesn’t really try to prove much with solid historical evidence. He just says ridiculous things along the lines of the Confederacy fighting for Christian, loving principles. What exactly that means, we never learn lol. He completely ignores the actual evidence, as I presented one example of to you. These people said it time and time again. They were fighting for slavery and the supremacy of the white race.



&gt;Only a battle flag, doesn't represent slavery or racism. 




They had to be battling for something though, yes? Henry Benning, whose quote I shared with you, and who *fought under that battle flag* throughout the war, made it abundantly clear what he was “battling” for. And again, it doesn’t begin or end with him, as this rhetoric was shared throughout the Confederate military and civilians. 




&gt;I ain't a racist, I'm against it.



You know, I don’t necessarily believe you are racist. I think you are terribly delusional and ignorant of history though. And at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter what *you* feel, or what HK Edgerton feels. You and him did not live through the civil war, and you live in a very different reality. We live in a time where racism is generally looked down upon. They lived in a world where racism was the norm.
