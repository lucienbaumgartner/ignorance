Low but nonzero discomfort of wearing a mask? Thats a bit of a stretch considering to some people masking and lockdowns have been extremely uncomfortable and lead many to depression and even suicide. 
If you are vulnerable or have preexisting conditions then sorry but it’s 100% YOUR responsibility to take care of yourself. Everyone else should not have to forfeit their rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness just to mitigate your “low but nonzero” chance of being hospitalized. 
If I all of a sudden became allergic to pizza I wouldn’t expect everyone else to never eat it again. Just like germaphobes shouldn’t be able to dictate that we all cover our faces and sanitize every surface for them. 
If anything covid has just made people far more germaphobic and ignorant of how their body’s immune system works
