She is uncultured and ignorant of cuisine and cultures it is a wonder she didn't say "bone apple tea"


It is very clear she has not one smithereen of knowledge of how Spanish people truly eat.  How did she get away with this nonsense for 10 years, how? 

I even abhor the way she labours on certain words she almost sings them. It is just so incredibly irritating.

Alec Baldwin must not have had sex in years if this one impressed him. Going through a drought myself but I'm still fussy as hell.
