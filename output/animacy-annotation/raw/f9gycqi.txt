I didn't say it wasn't an analogy. I said it wasn't a *good* analogy. Please read what I write before responding.

The MEs described are only jarring to people who are unable to conceive of the fact that memory is faulty. I can understand why it would be jarring if you are so narcissistic and ignorant that you think your memory is faultless and that the world is changing around you. I totally get that... but unfortunately, that's a personal failing of TruBelievers, and thus the comparison to a fallen tree is a piss poor analogy.

You can put it as simply as you want, but the likelihood is that you are just plain wrong. The fact that you can't entertain the idea that your memory is faulty as the most likely explanation is proof that you are not equipped mentally to make any sort of rational statement as to what an ME is.
