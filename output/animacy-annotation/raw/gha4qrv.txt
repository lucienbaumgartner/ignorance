I wholeheartedly agree, but I also think many perhaps most) “smart” people, are neither arrogant, nor consider themselves to be smart, but rather are somewhat bookish, and unaware. A bit of the Dunning Kruger effect - they think everybody else is equally bookish and nerdy and so talk to them as if they shared a vocabulary. Think about the Big-bang theory, the characters are at once, highly intelligent and unaware of themselves. 

There is also a high degree of anti-intellectualism in western society that loves to hate on ”smart“ people.
