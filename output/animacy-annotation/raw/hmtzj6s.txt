Well IMO the vitriol from the vaccinated is not needed and the constant pressure from all aspects of life to do so would make you culpable if you are doing the pressuring directly or indirectly.  I would say their blood would be on your hands if SHTF and the vaccines ended up doing harm that we can't even know until years down the road including reproductive issues. 

There's something so shady about what's going on right now around the world and I'm not going to be a part of pushing new drugs that modify your DNA just because I want to feel good on the internet.  

Being forced to injected with a drug and working a hard job are not the same thing.  There's plenty of folks out there doing hard ass jobs that you never think about that directly impact the quality of your life.  

The alternative is you leave us alone and that's that.  The way vaccinated talk about the unvaccinated is exactly how the nazis treated the jews, if you cannot see the parallels then you are blind and ignorant of history and YOU will be the one to repeat those horrors.  I don't understand why it's so hard to just get on with life and I don't understand why everyone these days feels they have the right to personal decisions of other people or to deny them medicine or treatment that they request. 

TBH I think it's highly likely many of you are going through a mass hysteria moment in history that you will all end up regretting ESPECIALLY in the medical community.  I think a lot of them are going into criminal if not HIGHLY UNETHICAL areas now.
