Oh, believe me, I didn't handle my Parting Ways ending well either lol. The final scene with the tree carving really gutted me, I was practically cursing the entire franchise, saying these games always brings me pain lol. (I was still naive and unaware of how dark the other two endings were lol)

PW is still my fave though, mostly because it was my first and original ending.

Thank you too! Looking forward to seeing the results.
