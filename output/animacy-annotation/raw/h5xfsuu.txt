NTA. Lots of people have allergies that can be passed on by close contact. If I'm out with my peanut-allergy boyfriend, and I eat something with peanuts, I cant touch him. I can't touch anything he touches. I have a coworker who can't be in the same ROOM as someone eating peanut products. 

When my bf informs the waitstaff that he has an allergy, and ends up needing his EpiPen because the kitchen decides to make some food safe and some food not? We report it to all the relevant agencies and leave scathing reviews about our terrible experience with their food safety. It's life and death for us, and we need to be able to trust our food is going to be safe and edible. One restaurant was so beligerant and ignorant of food safety they closed down.
