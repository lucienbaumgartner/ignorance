Thanks, it means a lot. We’ve been to multiple therapy sessions in the past and she blames it all on me, every single time. I’ve told the therapist I’m scared of her and I hate being with her and my mom just brushes it off like it’s nothing. I don’t understand how you can be so uncaring and ignorant of your child’s emotions.
