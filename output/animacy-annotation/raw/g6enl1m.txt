I can see death knights though seeing hate towards them as acceptable as long as they can continue to protect them. They probably would prefer if any still living relatives sees them as dead and unaware of their existence (Like with Bolvar) as long as they can serve for a greater cause. They might have accepted that they no longer have a home to come back to, but will guard it nonetheless.
