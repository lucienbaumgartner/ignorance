Except you're not going to a restaurant if you're getting delivery you're just getting it delivered, and simply saying they're poor because their stupid is extremely reductionist and ignorant of the circumstances a lot of poor people are living in.

But sure go off defend the the opinion of poor people are just stupid because "lol how are you poor if you have things?" 

God forbid they treat themselves.
