Their Aftermarket kit actually makes accidents more likely in our limited experience. 

Why this is happening is unknown but I suspect that it has to do with the owner being unaware and untrained of what to autonomy to expect. this isn't a surprise really a lot of these early "autonomous" systems that use/need human input have showed to drive claims up. 

Not my area but I suspect that having someone expecting to be fully alert while driving plays a critical role in deterring accidents. Eroding that capacity may play a role in  future claims.
