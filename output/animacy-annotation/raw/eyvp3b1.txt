assumptions? Yikes...

It's one thing to have an INFORMED opinion, it's another to be ignorant. No one is entitled to be ignorant. P.S. we don't need to be friends for me to call you out on your bullshit. Especially when every single reply from you is "WhAt iS YoUr k/D aNd DmG? YoU mUsT bE GoOd WhIcH iS wHy YoU dOn'T wAnT tHiS". With plenty of people explaining to you why it can't work because the population doesn't allow for it and your replies being "you are just saying that because you enjoy killing noobs".

One of the many: we don't have the population

You: I get your point, what are you stats?

Mate............ xD This is not normal. After a certain point you are bound to see how delusional and ignorant that is. You said multiple times that people broadened your view but it never shows, you keep going back to full ignorance. I am beyond shocked at your determination to stay ignorant. The fact that you "think" the post is about assumptions, misunderstandings and misreads is just appalling.
