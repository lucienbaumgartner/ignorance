You do know that it was Sansa who went to Bran for more information on LF's crimes, not the other way around right? She had already known LF wasnt to be trusted especially after he sold her to the Boltons. She laid out the trap for him while being intentionally vague towards his advances, catching him unaware and unprepared. Her opening words on his listed crimes were the crimes commited in the Vale to lessen any chance of escape. Shes actually pretty cunning.
