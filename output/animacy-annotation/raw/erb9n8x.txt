&gt; That’s how. Enjoy your continued downvotes.

Why would I care about magical internet points?

The discussion we’re having is about legal implications and the law — and these are part of the real world.

Is it possible that you’re putting too much weight in imaginary internet points because these are the only things you have? Can you actually present any complaint or case in court that would take note of magical downvotes?

The reality is that the Kickstarter project was started many years ago. Steam was never advertised in those years. What was noted was that backers’ funds will be used to develop Shenmue 3. A Steam version was eventually noted years later, well after the funding project had closed.

Ergo, it’s an open and shut case:

- Were backer funds used to develop the game? Yes.
- Will the game release on PC? Yes.
- Will the game release on Steam also? Yes.

You can be upset every possible way, and you can be angry 24/7 if that’s what gives your internet life any meaning. But, the point still stands that you’re arguing within the bounds of the law and reality.

In fact, my suggestion for you right now is to ask around in r/legaladvice or any subreddit, forum, or website dedicated to consumer law. Let’s see how far your outrage takes you before a reality check hits.

———-

You’re actually trivializing the plight of actual backers since you’re completely unaware and ignorant of legal issues, making a mockery of their own concerns due to your need to push an agenda based on outrage culture.

It’s Father’s Day — a day for dads and for grown-up men.

Join a conversation like an adult, especially when it concerns the law or anything in the real world.

Don’t be like an immature teen who still dwells on magical, imaginary internet points, all while talking about the reality such as legal matters. It makes you look like an out of place troll.

Be a real man and start joining discussions like an adult. Learn from this and be better, fellow gamer. 👍🏻
