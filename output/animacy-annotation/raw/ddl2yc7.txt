The problem with your theory is that a lot of the fans that buy from StubHub or third party sites are actually uninformed and unaware that there are still tickets available directly from the venue or from the wholesalers (TicketMaster). A lot of time a person would buy a general admission ticket from us for 10 bucks above what they would pay if they just went to ticketmaster.com because now people are groomed to automatically search StubHub or Vivid Seats. And whereas there may be a thousand people unwilling to pay $200 to see U2, there are 10,000 people more than willing to.
