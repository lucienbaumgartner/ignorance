I understand. I tried, i did. I was a practicing buddhist for nearly 10 years when trump was elected. I thought "this is bad, but this is an opportunity practice". Then the pandemic hit, and certain people showed just how ignorant and plain immoral they could be. And showing the compassion of the buddha got harder, and harder. Eventually, as it drug on, i slowly stopped believing in anything. These people showed their true colors, and it was inhumane. I got discouraged because trying to lead people to the truth just made them fight back harder. Then the apathy for these people replaced compassion. I didnt hace it in me to try and help these people anymore. I still know right from wrong, which is why i still fight flee the side of whats right, just from a different viewpoint and using different tactics. I just become the trollish asshole with them. I just didnt have it me to help them anymore, because they're beyond help. Like its been said, you cant reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. I tried.
