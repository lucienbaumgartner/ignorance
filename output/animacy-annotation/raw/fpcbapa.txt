&gt; You’re pathetic dude. Take this as a win if you want but I’ve got better things to do than listen to you bitch and moan while being a hypocrite over and over again. You’re in the wrong and nothing you can say or do will change that at the end of the day. That’s on you not me. High grounds be damned that’s all you care about, acting like you’re above people. Take some advice from Bakugo why don’t ya. “If all you ever do is look down on people, you won’t be able to recognize your own weaknesses.” And with that, I rest my case.


Wow, and who’s the one going through a “meltdown” now? That must’ve sting pretty badly lmfao. I’m “in the wrong”, but I simply don’t care what you think, as that doesn’t matter to me. Right and wrong in this case is subjective lmfao, stop being oblivious. You’re the only one here acting like their above people lmfao, you’re looking down on me excessively so that makes you a massive hypocrite LMAO!!!

&gt; You were and always will be wrong for attacking people who did nothing to you, keep disputing that if you want I could give less of a fuck now. And I’m sure this is gonna set off all sorts of victory bells in your tiny brain, but know that I’ve won this argument. Sayonara ya pimply prick!

Again, I didn’t attack them, but explaining to you is pointless because you’re just so oblivious and ignorant that it won’t matter. And if you could give less of a fuck, why are you going through a meltdown right now? LMFAO! 



Bye! Have fun losing more arguments!
