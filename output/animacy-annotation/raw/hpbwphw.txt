I don't even watch FOX News, or news at all. By the time I have kids, it can be completely different. In California, there's a big problem with teachers indoctrinating children to be trans or gay, which is unacceptable to me. I've experienced being taught horrible things by my own peers first-hand. I was in seventh grade and I was on the bus with some of my friends at the time and they started talking about porn and masturbation and I was curious and I started watching it, but now I've stopped. I was 13 at the time, keep in mind, thirteen! Thirteen-year-old children should NOT know what porn or masturbation is, sorry if you disagree.   


We can agree to disagree on walking fish and dinosaurs.   


I've changed my views on how I should treat my wife, still figuring out how to but I don't want a slave anymore. I don't want my kids afraid and ignorant of sex, I just don't want them to know about it until an age that isn't adolescence.
