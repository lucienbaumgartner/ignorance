&gt;I first met my boyfriend on tinder, it was amazing and we were just starting off as friends with benefits because he had just gotten out of a relationship and I didn’t really want much at the time. A month had passed and we started to get to know each other better and I could feel myself falling for him. Given that I was still active on tinder, but not actively swiping (this is due to the fact that he had informed me that I could talk to whoever I wanted because we weren’t in a relationship, and I told him same for you). His friend had found me on tinder and had informed him of me being active still, and he had confronted me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I told him the honest truth but he was in denial and was acting like a boyfriend catching his girlfriend cheating on him. Later that month, things were better. I had fully fallen in love with him and same to him (or at least I thought). I wasn’t active on tinder, heck I even deleted me account. But fast forward to five months later I started to notice sketchy shit from him. He was an avid drinker, would get blacked out drunk everyday and when Covid hit it only made it worse. He would stay at my place drinking while I was off at work trying to make money to help me and him survive, and that he was always active on social media but never texting me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So one night when he passed out from drinking, after peeing all over my floor in his sleep, his phone was blowing up with text messages from a girl I was a little worried about. See this boy doesn’t keep his notifications hidden (which is already kind of bad on his part because I found he had been talking shit about me to another girl). He told this girl that I was controlling and that he was stuck at my place that I wouldn’t let him leave. I worked 8 hour days and he had his car at my place, he was free to leave whenever he wanted. I even told him many times that if he wanted to go home to hang out with his friends or sleep in his own bed, he was more than welcome to.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But he often shot me down and told me he loved me and loved hanging out with me. He even told this girl that he was taking care of me and helping me survive by working long days and me being lazy. I was upset and slept on the ground in my own bedroom, upset and shaking. I had just cleaned his pee from my floor and all of his beer bottles from my bedroom and he had the decency to talk shit about me to another girl. He apologized the next morning saying that he was a piece of shit and that he loves me and can’t leave me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;All of forgiven but not forgotten. Fast forward, his phone broke so I bought him a new one and even helped him pay his rent while I was paying my own. But was never truly grateful because a week later I caught him sexting girls on tinder and asking them to come over to my house while I was at work. He apologizes for his wrongdoing but like I said all is forgiven but not forgotten. My birthday passes and I think everything’s great and that he has changed, he’s caring and rarely on his phone but then the day after I attend his families thanksgiving and the night I was working 12hrs overnight at a new job, he had cheated on me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The only reason I found out was because of this girl, she hit me up bragging how she slept with my boyfriend and called me a bunch of names. This happened while he was blacked out drunk and passed out. My world shattered because while he was out hooking up with girls I was helping him with anything and everything. I shook him awake because I wasn’t leaving until I got answers, but I honestly should have left. I got called names that I will never repeat, so I grabbed all of my shit from him and left, even blocked him off of everything. But I had forgotten one account and the next morning he had texted me long paragraphs about how sorry he is and how amazing I had been to him.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He told me that he was crying at work because of how sad he was when remembering my hurt face. I kind of forgave but couldn’t fully. A friend had introduced me to a guy, and I thought nothing of it. I viewed him as a friend and nothing more. Me and my ex (or whatever we were) were still talking and helping each other out, to which this new boy knew about. Even my ex knew about the other guy. But one night I had sexual relations with the new guy while drunk and unaware of what I was doing. I tell my ex or whatever he is about it, he’s clearly pissed and starts to tell me that he fucked a girl I was insecure about four times in the past month, even though he told me he was trying to make it work and better himself for me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But I’m young and in love and forgive him, and tell him we’re even. Now I’m always scared what he’s doing on his phone, but I think he realizes how horrible we both have been to each other and how I’m trying to ensure this relationship works out and that now he’s trying. But I’m not getting my hopes up, because like I said before I forgave but I never forgot.
