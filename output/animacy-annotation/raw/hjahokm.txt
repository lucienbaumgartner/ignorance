I was almost unconsciously under the influence of marijuana, half asleep and unaware of what was going on. My wife mounted me after she got me to bed, fucked me and I had no idea. I woke up the next morning and she told me we had sex and I asked her if I lasted long. She said no, 20 seconds like I always do. I don’t think it can be mentally related to anxiety or something when I didn’t even know I was having sex
