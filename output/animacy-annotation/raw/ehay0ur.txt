&gt; To my brain I just don't understand why there's no mutual understanding. 

In order to come to a mutual understanding, both sides must either agree or at least agree to disagree.  Your parents are unwilling to do either.

&gt; I have to tolerate, and to a degree empathise with their beliefs as a coping method but they flat out disregard and invalidate my beliefs and very directly say it makes me a worse person.

The bread winner always has the advantage in a relationship where financial dependencies are concerned.  That is just the way things work.  Unfortunately your parents are close minded and ignorant.  That is why it is best for you to devote your efforts to getting out of that environment rather than wasting your time trying to change your parent's behavior.
