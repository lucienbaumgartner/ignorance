Uneeded mediator from the outside looking in: ian is right in retrospect. Walp, you were being slightly difficult and ignorant of the facts that Ian is presenting to you. Tho Ian, walp has a fair point regarding that they could do something different. The possibilities are growing with swsh being the biggest bank they've ever had while still maintaining that budget they haven't increased since the start of pokemon games. In 2021-2022 I would say Walp may be on to something even if it is ahead of time. If life was a pokemon game then years ago we'd be running in squares talking about this. Now we're running in circles. Simple example but innovation isn't measured in complexity.
