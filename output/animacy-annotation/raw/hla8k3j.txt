&gt;you’re trying to solve a problem that isn’t your problem

Problems in the society I live in aren't my problem?

Nah. I can't fix everything that I object to in society. But that's not a reason to deny a problem exists. 

&gt;you’re capitulating to the most vocal and ignorant of society.

Hypothetically, which would a bigot prefer: Me wearing something that reasonable people could interpret as support for bigotry, or me **not** doing that. Because I'm doubtful they are ambivalent, and I'd prefer to do whatever thing they would like less. Especially when wearing (or not) a particular hat is basically free.
