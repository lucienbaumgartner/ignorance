Well if you never had an outbreak then you never knew where the hsv1 was contracted so most likely you contracted ghsv1 during unprotected oral sex and you were asymptomatic until now, it happens as I wasn't even aware myself until joining this forum that ohsv1 can become ghsv1 and that's thing with herpes alot of folks are asymptomatic and unaware of their own status I get you knew cause testing but makes sense you weren't aware if oral or gential and since you do have ghsv1 it is the non preferred area of infection may also make sense about going on asymptomatic for so many years has your partner been tested? Ohsv1 is very common and if he carries the virus to you wouldn't need to take precautions
