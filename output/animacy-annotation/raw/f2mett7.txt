Giampaolo is an Inter sleeper agent (like semi-serious at this point). What other excuses does he have other than being completely unaware and incompetent.

Before someone says that, "it's on the players"... no, it's on the players if only a couple underperform but when every single player from last season has regressed substantially, this is on the coach. 

What about benching your best player and only attacking hope last game?

What about continuing to start Hakan over Paqueta?

What about continuing to roll out Suso and Piatek even though they are giving you next to nothing?

There is one thing being loyal to your players, it's entirely another thing when you have people on the bench that could fill in for them and surely couldn't do a worse job.
