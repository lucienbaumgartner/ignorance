*You lose credibility citing Craig in any future discussion. I’ve engaged with ppl far senior to him and I can tell you; when you understand the rules of discussion and deconstructing worldviews you’ll advance more in your understanding of humans and reality.*


I'm sorry but I don't believe you, you sound like a very stupid person who doesn't have simple logic, you could not enage Craig. I just look at your discussions with Willy Pete.

Go contact Craig and engage him.

Go here r/Christianity, or r/debate religion start a discussion and link it here. 

Again you just make baseless subjective claims. 

You are so stupid and ignorant that you actually asked to see tape of first "couple". So I think you would be made a fool in any debate.

*It is more scientific see how evolution took place. I want to see it on tape*

What do you want to see on tape? Who is filming it? Do you mean documentaries? Plenty of those.

So you won't believe your father is your father or mother is your mother without a tape showing them conceive you? You can't use DNA evidence? Do you realize how stupid you sound?
