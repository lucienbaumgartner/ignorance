Thank you everyone, this was the sanity check I needed and we are leaving. How my husband thought this was an appropriate thing to do is a whole other thing to unpack and am a bit dumbfounded as he is utterly brilliant with our daughter in every other respect. At best unthoughtful and ignorant and at worst negligent and selfish. Not sure which currently. But one thing at a time... Packing our bags and he will get a grilling in the car on the way home!
