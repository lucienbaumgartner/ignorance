Perhaps you want to change his mind because at some level you know he's misguided and ignorant and you see more in him than the beliefs he's caught up in, or that were imposed upon him.  

With a history like yours you have first hand experience that these beliefs aren't useful and hurt and destroy relationships so you've mostly given them up.

In any case, you bonded with him and it's difficult to let go of that.  When we want to separate ourselves emotionally from another it's useful to have negative thoughts about them, but in this case you don't really blame him for how he feels so you're stuck hoping things will change in his mind, which is hardly ever a useful place to come from.  

I hope you can find a man that can experience you without judgement.
