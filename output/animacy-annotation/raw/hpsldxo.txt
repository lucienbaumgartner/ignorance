You don't understand the 1st amendment, and you're being willfully ignorant. Being a hateful piece of shit is protected under the first amendment as long as it's not infringing upon someone else's rights, i.e- threatening someone or physical acts of violence are not protected. 

However drawing swazis on your chest, however hurtful, ignorant and stupid, is protected. As it should be. Not because I agree with it, these kids suck. But because the government should not infringe upon free speech.
