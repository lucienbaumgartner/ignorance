Why don't you just end it then? Isn't that the solution then? Or do you prefer to enjoy things like, food, sex, entertainment, nature, learning, personal growth etc the list could go on to infinity. 

I'd say of there's something to be learned, something to be discovered, even something just to be enjoyed, life is worth living. 

There are plenty of people happy with way, way less than the average redditor has (a white 20 something year old male living in a western democratic country )

The this ideology reeks of the upper middle class. 

Bourgeois, entitled man babies who have more than 99% of people on the planet have yet still find the time to complain about existing. 

Capitalism creates the vast, vast majority of human suffering. The system is the problem, but giving up is not the solution! Fight back. Don't wallow in hopelessness, that is exactly what the billionaires who sit at the top want. People unaware and unquestioning , or people who are perhaps aware but have just given up.
