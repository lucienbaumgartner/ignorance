&gt;So you're just an asshole that lacks the basic decency to respect another human being because

You called me an asshole, personally while in the same sentence criticizing me for not giving people respect. Just think about that for a minute..

&gt; youre so fundamentally arrogant and ignorant that you would rather hate on an entire group of people than agree to disagree. 

Who have I hated? I've stated I have compassion for these people. They are sick. Why is it anyone who disagrees with you is hateful? 

&gt; And yes, trans suicides are on the rise, but thats not for you to analyze. You're not a psychologist. You're in no place to be deciding what to make of data of that sort. 

But it's ok for you to claim that acceptance by society is what's best for trans people? Do you not see that as a gross double standard. 

&gt; Men can do what they want. Women can do what they want People can do whatever they fucking want 

Thank you for agreeing with me.. as a man my POV is that normalizing trans people is a disgusting and selfish act by a society that would rather drive these people to suicide than get them the treatment they really need

&gt; As long as they're not hurting anyone, you can easily sit back and let these individuals live their lives.  

Is that not true for all opinions and self representation? No one is saying they can't live their lives, but i can live my life too. And my life and my existence doesn't recognize the fantasy that a man can become a women and vice versa. 

&gt; You dont have to be a nuisance to anyone who disagrees with you. 

You posted here. I just asked a question.
