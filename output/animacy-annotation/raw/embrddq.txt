I wish I could downvote you 100 times.  Blaming Ben Shapiro for someone going out and shooting someone is....there are no words for how ugly and ignorant that is.  People don't get talked into a shooting like that.  Any "ideological" basis for his crime is just a facade applied to a core of insanity.  Shut the F up with your ignorant, divisive nonsense.
