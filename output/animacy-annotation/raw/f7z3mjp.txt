Yes indeed. Till 10th grade I went to a private school (diplomatic one so all the perks except for the fee) . I got so narrow minded and ignorant that my parents realized it and put me in public school for high school. I went from being in a class of 5 pupils to 47. But man the friends I made and the life lessons I learnt is what keeps me grounded.
