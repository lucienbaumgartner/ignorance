Ok new comment: I think you and I interpreted the main point of Red Guys first comment. It seems like you interpreted his maint point to be, "I agree, men's day shouldn't be a thing." Please correct me if I'm being presumptive. I, however, read, "if men's day shouldn't be a thing, women's day shouldn't be a thing either because that's not fair." That interpretation is based off of my past experience with him, as he has has a reputation for coming out with "WHAT ABOUT MEN???" every time there's a discussion about women. He just distracts from the problem, and I'm tired of it. 

Sure, he presented his opinion respectfully and eloquently enough, but it doesn't change how selfish and ignorant that opinion inherently is.Ok new comment. Reading over everything again, I think you and I both pulled different conclusions from Red Guys first comment. From what I'm reading,
