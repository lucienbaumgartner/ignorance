I'm not saying it was a good question, but the thing with Draymond is that he is trying to lump him together with the bad media that tries to bait players into saying some things, and then they will take that line out of context and spin it against them and get more followers on Twitter... Definitely not what I think this guy is doing. He's just culturally unaware and awkward, and that's the only thing I am using his Chinese-ness to excuse him for.
