How am I being ignorant and racist? To be fair I did leave out the part of how it’s a specific event but I don’t think that’s necessary as they’re stil generalising that they’re inconsiderate, which is the racist part. There is no issue of events being loud, that’s just humans having fun. It becomes racist when they say act like they’re doing it to piss people off. Not trying to be aggressive I just do not understand what part of my comment was racist and ignorant.
