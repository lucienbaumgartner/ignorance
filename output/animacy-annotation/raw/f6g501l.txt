Please don't change yourself. You are absolutely beautiful. Your skin is perfect, you have lips so many women would kill for. Every feature of your face fits your face perfectly. I'm sure you would still be beautiful with some minor cosmetic surgery but it is definitely not necessary if your concerns are about anything other than your own happiness because I guarantee you that no one is looking at your features in a negative way. Also, never judge your smile by a selfie. The only way I have found to really judge your own smile is to see a picture taken by someone else when you are truly happy and unaware that the picture is being taken. THAT will be the smile that reflects the real you and that is the smile that everyone else gets to see all the time.
