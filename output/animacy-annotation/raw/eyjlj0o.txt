&gt; don’t give a fuck

So you’re just selfish and don’t care about anyone but yourself. 

&gt; hundred years 

Clearly showing how uninformed you are about it, and thus proving my point that you don’t care because you don’t really know. The effects will be hitting us hard in 20-30 years. I’ll still be alive and so will my kids. 

Too bad so many people are so selfish and ignorant that my kids and I will have to suffer and pay far more than we would if ignorant and selfish people stopped using their ignorance and selfishness as justification for refusing to do anything, like you just did.
