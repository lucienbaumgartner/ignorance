1.oP used the word not anyone else. It’s a RACIST word. Not just a “PC” word. 

2. Again, doesn’t matter what the song is about, it sung and written by a white man using a racist word against native Americans. 

3. Again, OP doesn’t have any right to play music. Doesn’t matter if there’s one or a bud fed people. Doesn’t matter who was there first. OP is in public and is disturbing other people. It’s no longer just HIS business anymore. And again. Headphones are a thing for a reason. 

Just because an ignorant and inconsiderate person like yourself can’t grasp these concepts. Doesn’t mean you are right. Even if you think you are.
