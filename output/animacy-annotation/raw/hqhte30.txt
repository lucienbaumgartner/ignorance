No because, I am so sick of her being like “I love Canada so much Erik and I met there and I want to move there”. Then have some respect for the country and learn how to spell things properly. She made her entire Haters Back Off dumpster fire in Van and she can’t even spell it correctly? How ignorant and rude. American creators really annoy me when they do things like this, but especially her. 

Also I really don’t see touring as being in her future anymore, especially as Miranda. She hasn’t posted on that channel in months so I don’t really understand her reasoning for touring as Miranda? Seems blatantly obvious she doesn’t rly care for the character anymore but will use it for tours and other financial ventures.
