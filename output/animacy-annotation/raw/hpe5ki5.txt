Watch your step AT ALL TIMES. Take your shoes off at the door unless you want to inevitably clean shit off your floor at some point. Wearing flip flops in certain areas is the same as inviting a used needle to stab you in the foot.

If a seat is empty on a full bus/train, it's empty for a reason (and that reason is usually related to bodily fluids).

Also, learn to let things slide. This city can be rough around it's edges and people can be pretty self-important and unaware of others &amp; their surroundings (aka the "I am the main character" mindset), but most have a really good spirit. If you can learn to forgive and forget, and how to let go of inconsequential things and just go with the flow, and this city will reward you.
