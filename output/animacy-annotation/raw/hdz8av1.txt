I did all the same precautions as you, I am fully vaccinated and am just recovering from Covid. It sucks. I got it from my toddler who got it from my fully vaccinated father in law (who got it from his unvaccinated employee, who is no longer going to be an employee because he still refuses to be vaccinated). I am blessed that we are all ok and baby is ok, although I will be receiving a few extra ultrasounds per doctors orders to monitor fetal weight gain for the remainder of pregnancy. And I can’t taste or smell, or some things smell or taste funny. It blows big time. I am ultimately grateful it wasn’t worse, but I am so angry at the unvaccinated and those who refuse to take precautions because this pandemic potentially could have been over. We are now going to be even more strict, even though we have some extra infection derived immunity. This is not only for safety from illness, this is for safety from dumb ass selfish idiots. I don’t want my children to be around people who are so selfish and ignorant that they are not willing to take every precaution to protect themselves and my kids. If you can’t trust the science, you do not deserve access to me or my family. And that’s it. That’s my hard line in the sand.
