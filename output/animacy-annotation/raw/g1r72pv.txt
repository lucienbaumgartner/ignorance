He said it was like that as long as he's known me.... And I know I was exponentially gassier in middle school than I am now, I really wonder how the kids sitting behind me felt. I couldn't smell anything, so I assumed nobody else did, oops. I also always chose front row as I really needed glasses.

I was totally unaware and most people are too polite to say anything, so it's driving me insane! I want someone to just be outright rude as fuck and tell me I reek for once instead of sucking it up so that at least I KNOW, god.
