That you don’t get rid of trauma in a second and it’s something that is lifelong. 

Trauma has so much impact on everything the brain, the body, the heart. People are so ignorant and insensitive and it makes me mad that not only many people inflict it so cruelly and recklessly but then there are people who deny you the right to be sad, to grieve, to be depressed, to have bad days and just traumatized as is normal.
