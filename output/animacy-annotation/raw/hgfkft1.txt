It speaks to a person's mindset towards willingness (or lack thereof) to believe information they don't have an education level to understand themselves, and their willingness to put the well-being of others above their own, and their unwillingness to seek out information from a variety of viewpoints when told that their views are harmful to themselves and others.

They're stubborn and unaware of their own idiocy.
