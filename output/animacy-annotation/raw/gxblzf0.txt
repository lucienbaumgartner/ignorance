Have you ever heard of Ibram X Kendi?  He is what many consider to be the godfather of "anti-racism." 

He has said:

1.Capitaslism = racism

[https://www.nfg.org/news/capitalism-and-racism-conjoined-twins](https://www.nfg.org/news/capitalism-and-racism-conjoined-twins)

This is insanity.  Utter, and complete garbage.

2. “The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.” 

Wow. So, the only way to solve things is with further discrimination.  Got it.  Is this why White people should be ashamed?

3. He has sated that it is impossible for a White person to experience racism because of the "fact" that White people have held all of the power in this nation for decades.

This is incredibly dangerous and ignorant of reality.

4. He has stated that a White person adopting a Black child is wrong because he views that as a reflection of when White colonizers would adopt a Black child because the Whites were trying to "...civilize these savage children in the superior ways of Whiteness."  

His words...   Not mine.  Just wow.

Amy Coney Barrett has two adopted Haitian children, and Kendi can't get over the fact that she's just a good person doing good things for these (her) kids.  No.  Of course she is trying to INDOCTRINATE them with evil WHITENESS!!!  

Jesus Christ.

Richard Spencer, a white nationalist Neo-Nazi actually agrees with him.  That should probably put up red flags for well...   pretty much everyone on Earth.

There are undoubtedly 500 more things I could dig up, but I am working, and I don't have literally hours upon hours for this.

Quoting from professor and activist Ibram X. Kendi, who popularized his "anti-racist" theory, the idea is to create “identity-safe” classrooms in a post-George Floyd school environment.

"There is growing acknowledgement of the importance of including, in the teaching and learning of our country's history, both the consequences of slavery, and the significant contributions of Black Americans to our society," the regulation states. "This acknowledgement is reflected, for example, in the New York Times' landmark '1619 Project' and in the resources of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History.

The 1619 project, where idiots actually try to make the preposterous and dangerous case that the primary reason for the American Revolution was to protect slavery, among SO many other falsehoods and misrepresentations of reality

The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History, where they LITERALLY stated that some traits of "Whiteness" are:

delayed gratification

hard work

timeliness

reliance on the scientific method 

politeness

rugged individualism 

and more!

They had to take the thing down from their site because many people, including Donald Trump, called them out for being a bunch of bigots.  It was *very* wrong.

You simply can't make this stuff up.  Can they possibly BE more racist?  **THIS is the insanity of CRT and "anti-racism."**

I should never be made to feel shame or embarrassment because of the fact that my skin is lighter than some other people's.  NO ONE should aver be made to feel emotions like that because of their skin color.  That's ludicrous.  Imagine if the color of people's hair had this much impact on society.  It's insanity.  We need to stop and think about where SO MUCH focus on people's skin color is taking us.

I'll answer that for you.  It's taking us all backwards.

No, the "anti-racism" movement is not at all what you think it is.
