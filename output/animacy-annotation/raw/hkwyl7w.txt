Hot/edgy take. I moved from very rural GA to Boston and now Salem. I have two degrees and make good money. As does my wife. We know we are fucking LUCKY.

I came to say the following: I will never leave this place and go back to a red state. Y’all take care of your own for sure, but I don’t give two shits for the morons who are loud, proud, and ignorant that are *hoping* the nation tears apart. 

Blue won’t support red welfare if that happens.
