As I stated in a comment below I purposefully acted in bad faith in a meta thread to illustrate a point. I am fully aware of the fact that assuming what someone is saying is in bad faith. But I appreciate your comment.  


Now on to the assumption that upvoted comments are the good ones. We have removed plenty of upvoted comments by NTS that I would not consider great:   


"How much do you make as a professional goal post mover?"  


"Why don’t you have morals?"  


"When do you plan to start putting more thought into your opinions then?"  


"Are you actually thinking or are you just spewing dumb stuff on the internet to help your side win?"  


"this comment is so woefully uninformed and ignorant that im not even going to warrant it a proper response. im over trying to explain basic fucking science to people who would rather plug their ears and ignore climate change. you’re killing our planet out of fear of change. bye?"   


"i fucking hate pieces of shit like you who just give up. fuck you and fuck your president. this is not a joke. bye?"  


"Did you make friends by being edgy? Or is edgy a way of justifying a lack of friends? "  


In the same way, we've seen plenty of long and thought-out replies by NNs ended up downvoted. Some of them are oneliners, of course. Some of them are shit. But we also see plenty of replies that are simply in favour of Trump.  


If the above comments were upvoted multiple times and received, at most, one report each is it that farfetched that the mod team would say that both the NTS saying that shit replies get downvoted *and* NNs saying that they pretty much always get downvoted unless they disagree with Trump can be right?
