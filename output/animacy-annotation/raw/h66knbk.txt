&gt;and it cost me $200

This makes absolutely no sense. Fisher is not a desirable brand. You could have bought replacement, fully working Fisher stereo components for less than $200. Why would you pay a repair shop more than the stuff is worth in working condition?

Another example is your typical Funai VCR. There is absolutely no reason to pay $100 to have one repaired when you can buy a working one for under $50. It's rare to find anyone that will fix one. Repair shops know it isn't worth fixing. Repair shops know that Funai designed their VCRs to be thrown in the trash and didn't design them to be easily fixable.

Repair shops know all of this, they know you're sentimental and ignorant of the economics of repair, and they're happy to take your money from you. They won't tell you to throw your stuff in the trash and buy another from eBay for $50, they'll recommend you pay $200 for the repair.

I support right to repair and I support repair shops, but ONLY the repair of very high value items. I'm a fan of VCRs, but 99% of VCRs should not be repaired because it's not economical. Try to open your own VCR repair shop and you will instantly go out of business, because you can't make money fixing most VCRs. If you repair strictly AG-1980's that are worth $1000, you might have a shot. But touch a Funai product and you're fucked.
