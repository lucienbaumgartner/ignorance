Those people who dont like being told that to do should probably go live off the grid than, idc how hard or easy it is. Otherwise you're part of the community and need to adhere to the rules. Mandatory masks are a thing in Canada yet i still have to tell old fuckers to cover their nose with it when they sneeze all over the grocery isle. Fucking disgusting and ignorant that about 30% of people i see out in Canada have a mask on right. The rest just wear it over their mouths because they can't be bothered to put any effort in.
