You base what you say on your experience, none of it is based in any reputable source. And secondly, why are you questioning me about religion? You're the one that seems to believe you know everything about that 25%. You're making the claim to know them. I'm telling you you don't know Jack shit past your own experience, which is incredibly, INCREDIBLY limited, JUST LIKE MY OWN. You're arrogant to believe your opinion of people, a huge portion of which you've never met and will never meet, is in anyway accurate. 


So, either stay arrogant and ignorant or accept that you're ignorant and focus on not judging others. I already know what you'll choose, so good luck with that.
