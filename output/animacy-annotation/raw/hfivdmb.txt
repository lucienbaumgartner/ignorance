&gt; N=60 is a small sample size.

Again, you haven't given a single reason. A power analysis, a comparable study with a larger sample, a results-based argument that the study is underpowered -- nothing. Whereas, as I pointed out, the study is sufficiently powered to detect the reported effect.

&gt; “Executive function” does not represent “readiness to learn.”

That's an interesting argument. Not sure why you're only bringing it up now, but to address it: Executive function is a set of abilities that includes paying attention, behaving with self-control, staying calm and focused, sustaining working memory, etc. These subserve higher-order executive functions like problem-solving. Since most people don't know what executive function is, I think it's entirely fair to to report this finding as "readiness to learn" to a lay audience, though the study itself doesn't even mention learning.

&gt; If you want “proficient” answers, check the peer reviews.

If you had any meaningful experience in peer review, you would know that peer reviews are almost never made available to anyone but the authors and the editors.

&gt; The entire point of my argument is that there is ONE study supporting OPs perspective

If that's the point of your argument, then why did you not even mention it in the original comment? You didn't talk about the number of times similar results have been reported; you made baseless criticisms of the study.

This is a classic case of unskilled and unaware of it. If you've even never gone to grad school, then why would you assume that your review captures mistakes missed by actual scientists?
