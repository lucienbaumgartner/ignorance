This NY Times author is a strong, confident, multi-time ceo. I don't know him but I bet 99% of you internet talkers are more beta than that dude.  He listed his company and just a little digging showed he played football strong safety in school. So an athletic, jacked, confident Asian dude.  Some of you sound flat out psycho that any AF who is simply unaware and white worshipping have zero chance of ever changing.  This dude did change her it sounds like.
