But what about the people that say. “Ole bill gates AINT chipping me” yeah okay bud. 

They don’t understand the mechanisms and how they  get you to accept it. It’s truly scary to see how unaware, and naive most people are. Even when you provide links, evidence, precedents, they still just wont accept it because it challenges their worldview. And if they do accept it, they do just that....accept it......
