People have issues and sometimes make mistakes. That doesn’t mean that the people put in charge of making sure that they live should take advantage of people. Have some empathy. If you had an addict in your family, you might feel different. It’s a disease and it’s clear that you’re ignorant to this. Your entire argument is that since she made a mistake it’s cool to kick her when she’s down. Which 1) isn’t how I was raised and 2) isn’t the police officers place to judge when he literally signed up to protect and serve. It was wrong for her to take drugs in the sense that it does harm to her, but it doesn’t make her a bad or immoral person. And if you disagree with that, you’re vision of the world is warped. Police officers shouldn’t stoop to the level of those they are responding too. They have a badge and with that carries responsibility. In your eyes, it’s fine to attack this woman because she is lower than you, but trust me, you are much lower on the totem pole than a lot of people. What if they treated you badly because they felt you were incompetent and ignorant? That wouldn’t be right either. Edit: police officers literally signed up to protect you. It’s their job to ensure your safety and no part of that includes invading your personal space. If they want to behave like a citizen, they should quit.
