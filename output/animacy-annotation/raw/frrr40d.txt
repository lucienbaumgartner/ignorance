You calling me a derp, while you are so blind, stupid and ignorant that you didn't even notice this is not a stealth game? That's the GR franchise. 

It's funny how you think I'm defending anything, meanwhile people like you literally fuckin' up the game industry. People like you fucked the Ghost Recon franchise with Breakpoint, who wanted it to have looter elements in that game. 

Now you would fuck Division 2 to have stealthy elements, and after that you want it to have elements from Assasins Creed, and after that fuck knows. 

People like you, who wants homogenic and generic shit is the cancer of any industry.
