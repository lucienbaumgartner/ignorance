Look into the science of spanking it’s fascinating. I am not like the people here that think it’s TRAUMATIZING ABUSE, in fact I don’t think spanking is abuse at all, BUT it’s extreeeeeemely ineffective and to be blunt, an ignorant and outdated form of discipline. 

Spanking means you’ve lost control and are reacting in anger. Kids see that and then they’ve won. You should never lose control of your baby. Spanking gives them a reaction, and it teaches them that hitting can solve something. You only say it worked for you because it conditioned you to behave. Did it help you understand why you should behave? Anyway it’s super interesting and you guys need to get on the same page.
