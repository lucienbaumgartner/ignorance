Maybe don't be so fucking stupid. First off, winning a court case doesn't make you right. You realize this guy PURPOSELY gets in crashes, right?

&gt;People like you are why people die so often to traffic accidents.

Yea, apparently paying attention to your surroundings gets people killed. No, purposely getting into fucking crashes that you could have avoided gets people fucking killed.

&gt;Entitled and ignorant of basic safety.

So in other words, purposely getting into crashes you could avoid just because you think they are stupid=good driver and someone who thinks people should pay the fuck attention while they are driving=entitled and ignorant. There's a reason I've never caused a crash and this guy has caused how many now?
