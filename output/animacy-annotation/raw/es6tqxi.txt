Perhaps I wasn't clear: I don't think most international students are unaware and unintelligent enough to not connect "the n-word" to what it's referring to - or to Google it, idk. I unpacked it specifically to illustrate that the challenge with teaching international students about race is not in the nomenclature.

An ESL student or any student whose largely unaware of the word or its history

if they have spent time in America, would still be able to figure out what the n-word is. I think you have somewhat of a case with international students, which is why I point out they're an edge case and the general policy shouldn't be geared towards the edge case.
