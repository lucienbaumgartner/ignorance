Yeah it's ok it seems that other person was offended by your usage of the word " freak of nature" for the boy. I guess you shouldn't call him like that y'know. It implies he's some evil monster or like some crazy serial rapist while it's obvious he is just heavily mentally challenged and unaware of his awful acts.

I don't really understand autistic people when they interact with each other, do you guys call each other  "freak of nature" endearingly, like how black people call each other with the N word? I'm not sure how it works. Would appreciate some education on that culture.
