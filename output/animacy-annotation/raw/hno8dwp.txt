I want to sit down with Zimmer, Can Danztler, and Xavier Woods and just have a film session over that last play. Somebody is fucking lying and not owning up, because there’s no excuse for any combo of player and or coach after the middle school level to call a timeout, strategize about what the most obvious play(s) they’re about to see given the situation, and what to do versus what not to do. I get that Woods was technically supposed to crash down for the underneath route, but then WHY IN THE HELL was he positioned so deep and over? Every NFL team has NFL caliber athletes and that short route isn’t some long developing play. A super quick sprint and any receiver in the league will be right there at the line and all they need to do is simply catch the ball and they win. Woods was positioned as if the endzone started 5-6 yards deep within the actual endzone and was still in some prevent mode keeping things in front of him. Dantzler was 4 yards too deep and still started backpedaling off the snap with his body positioned in such a way that he made it almost impossible to redirect back in towards his man incase the guy ran anything but a fade into the back of the endzone. I played receiver in college and in the three years in which I started, any time a corner and safety were too deep within the redzone, we’d try to expose that almost 100% of the time. If the defense is playing on their heels and giving you the front 3 yards of the endzone, those short routes with a catch in stride get in there a lot. There’s no excuse for their depth of positioning, given what the Lions were presenting. 

I simply cannot believe that a NFL caliber DB and S were so damn clueless, slow, and unaware of one of the most basic situations in the game. They genuinely played as if Zimmer told them to do everything in their power to prevent Detroit from scoring in the back 2-3 yards of the endzone.
