Every now and then I think the Murdoch press likes to remind right-wing politicians who is in charge.  The occasional situation like the Barnaby Joyce reveal is the classic example.  It helped that to the extent it damaged the Coalition, it damaged the Turnbull government and Murdoch had it in for Turnbull personally.  And you'll notice that just like everyone else they sat on the story prior to the federal election.

I'm pretty sure I read that piece you linked at the time because I was a Crikey subscriber then.

Incidentally, Bernard Keane (who is the reason I dropped my Crikey subscription around the time of the last Federal election) really comes across badly in that.  Naive, and ignorant of the legal and ethical issues with powerful male bosses sleeping with female employees with a big power gap in between them, especially when they're covering it up so they can't take steps to manage the conflict of interest and other workplace issues.
