You are incredibly ignorant and arrogant. Autism is normal and healthy and doesn’t necessarily prevent a healthy social life and relationships. 

What your missing is that: 

1. there are plenty of conditions concomitant with autism that are necessarily harmful and should have treatments — *something that doesn’t happen when all attention is directed at a mythical ‘cure’ for autism*. 

2. much of the difficulty autistic people have with social life and relationships lies squarely at the feet of neurotypical people and their arbitrary standards, this is quite evidently demonstrated when many autistic people are able to have perfectly vibrant social lives when in neurodivergent accomodating spaces.
