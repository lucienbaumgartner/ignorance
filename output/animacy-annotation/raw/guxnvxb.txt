Nah I misread. You're not a troll.  You're just unaware and niave. 


Look at fucking platoscloset.com

They're a salvation army that only accepts name brand essentially.

I knew a woman who had a hummer with 3 teenager children, one severely disabled. Not only physically. But mentally.  She was newly divorced from a psycho.

By your standard she has a 'luxury vehicle. She doesn't deserve food for her children, being a sole provider on a very very modest income of 11 an hour with 40 hours a week.

Guess how much she was eligible for? 40 dollars a month for food.

But no no. Hummer.   Don't account for the fact she got it a few years old with a mass of issues even she's still is happy it's running.  That's why it was so cheap.


So no. Luxury items don't mean shit.   If someone's broke but inherited a family heirloom of several generations, worth thousands, they supposed to sell that too?  That's a luxury item.


You sound offended poor people could even fathom having any luxury.  Even if it's a passed down heirloom..
