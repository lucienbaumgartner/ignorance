Thanks for the understanding. It took a lot to get out of the toxic codependent relationship that fostered my bullshit behavior. In the end she grew to be the bigger person than i could and moved on and im extremely happy that she could. I loved her before my actions and I loved her after but with the added thought of "its my responsibility to fix this" because she was still so latched to me with what i assume were similar thoughts. I was also latched to her too but i kept running to a woman because of our problems and my personal as a form of therapy session. As a man you dont have many people to go to to talk to other than a therapist and at the time i was so young and ignorant that never came to mind so when i met the first person that actually indulged me in conversation on those issues i latched on. It would eventually lead to sex because on the other womans side she thinks im single and on my end i wanted to satisfy the lack of affection, lack of conflict, and feeling emotionally/psychologically trapped at home. I just wanted to feel loved and sex + intimate convos can trick your head into feeling those things at least for the moment. All in all it was a gross lack of self control and i do wish i would have never done it. It hurt her greatly and i never wanted to see her hurt like that again. She will always have a place in my heart and so will the person that cheated on me. I harbor no bad feelings for both and i think theyre both amazing people. Being on both ends has taught me to empathize in all aspects and also more importantly foster a strict self awareness of myself so that when people feel wronged and i feel right that i should put my pride aside and analyze both to find the truth
