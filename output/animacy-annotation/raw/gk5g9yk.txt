&gt;Idk why you’re trying to make radical Islam into some sort of pissing contest with Christianity

Not what I'm doing, dumbfucks are saying Islam is an inherently more violent religion. It's not. Thats false. Moreover, just pointing out Christianity has killed more people than any other religion. Thats a fact.

&gt;I haven’t seen one person in the thread agree with you.

That's fine. 75 million people in this country have proven their stupidity by voting for a racist, mysogonistic bigot. The fact that so many people are stupid and ignorant of basic things about their own religion should alarm you.
