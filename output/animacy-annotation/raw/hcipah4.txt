I don't have a problem with attacking Al Qaeda and killing Bin Laden.  My recollection is that they started talking about "nation building" pretty early on.  Making Afghanistan a stable democracy so terrorists couldn't take refuge there.  Sounded like  a fantasy to me and that was how it played out.  I recently read a comment by a "CIA/Military analyst" at the time of the invasion and he said they were "naive". I think that was generous.  I would call them arrogant and ignorant of history.
