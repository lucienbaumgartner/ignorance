The thing is though, SBs who prefer single SDs do so for various reasons so you can't assume anything. I know some SBs who like single guys because they prefer to spend more time with their SDs for example and not have to sneak around. Some prefer not to involve themselves in a situation where the SO is unaware and possibly uncomfortable with their SO going outside of the marriage. 


If I was looking for a single SD, I'd be annoyed I'd waste my time going to a m&amp;g under false pretense, no matter what the explanation is. I see a lot of SDs on here chastising platonic SBs about making their intentions extremely clear in their profile so SDs don't have to waste their time, which I agree with. And I think it's only fair SDs should respect other people's time as well.
