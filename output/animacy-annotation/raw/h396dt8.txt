Your own response to America's COVID response seems remarkably petulant and ignorant of other nations. The US is hardly the only country with people who balked at COVID precautions, who are fearful of vaccines. The US is hardly the only country with a leader who actively subverts the pandemic response. The US is not the only country which stole medical supplies from other nations.

You are simply hyper aware of American issues because you're American, and because American media focuses on America.

Would you extend the same travel restrictions to other nations with similar issues?
