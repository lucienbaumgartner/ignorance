I was pointing out the clearly obvious hypocrisy of a company that is not self-aware.  You know that feeling you get witnessing someone doing something inherently dumb and unaware that it makes you hit your face with your palm.  Kind of like watching a moron spout off about being molested by a Jesus Chicken and claiming people are butthurt because someone mentioned a marginalized group in calling out said observation of lack of awareness.  A group that you clearly have a problem with based on your postings.  

Now tell us, how did the Rainbow Man hurt you?  Did a lover stick a finger in your ass and freak you out cause you liked it?  Is it hard for you to eat a banana cause you get all tingly thinking about trying to swallow the whole thing in one go?  Maybe when you ride around in that Ford you can't help but think of big, burley men doing hard, manual labor and it makes you light headed?

Pretty sure I know which one of us actually has a problem.
