Christians are a minority. 

Jesus emphasizes a teaching 3 times in Matthew 7

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Narrow and Wide Gates  
&gt;  
&gt;*13 “Enter  through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that  leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. 14 For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are* ***few who find it****.*  
&gt;  
&gt;A Tree and Its Fruit  
&gt;  
&gt;*15 “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will \[*[*bx*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23333bx)*\]know them by their fruits. \[*[*by*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23333by)*\]Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? 17 So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, you will \[*[*bz*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23337bz)*\]know them by their fruits.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*21 “Not  everyone who says to Me, ‘****Lord, Lord****,’ will enter the kingdom of  heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. 22* ***Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord,*** *did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many \[*[*ca*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23339ca)*\]miracles?’ 23 And then I will declare to them,* ***‘I never knew you; leave Me, you who practice lawlessness.’***

Luke gives more information where Jesus clarified even further:

&gt; *22 And He was passing through one city and village after another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. 23 And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?” And He said to them, 24 “Strive to enter through the narrow door; for* ***many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able****. 25 Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open up to us!’ and He then will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’ 26 Then you will begin saying, ‘We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!’ 27 And yet He will \[*[*k*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-25539k)*\]say, ‘I do not know where you are from; leave Me, all you \[*[*l*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-25539l)*\]evildoers.’*  

Jesus is teaching that a MINORITY of those who CLAIM TO BE CHRISTIAN go to heaven.

And it is because they are actually workers of iniquity. They are so twisted that they have actually fooled themselves into thinking they're right with God. But God knows the heart and he knows better. These people who are affirming this are false converts, false teachers, false prophets and false churches. They need to be evangelized -- or avoided, depending on context, but we have no fellowship with them because they hate God and they therefore hate us and seek our harm. We should not be foolishly naive and unaware of this.

Let your upset provoke you to prayer, prayer that God would rescue some from that deception and that he would give you opportunities and the words to say that He will use to convict men of sin and lead them to repentance.
