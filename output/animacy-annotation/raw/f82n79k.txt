When the quote is abused and incorrect, yes. 

It's misused in order to keep the poor and ignorant that way by tricking them into thinking that they are meant to be poor so as to be holy and pure, and despise the rich but thinking they are holier, and also tricks them into donating all of their money to the church. That's the perversion of the phrase by the church.

In reality, the quote is saying it's easier to get a camel through that hole if you take the baggage off of it (i.e. remove a rich man's things) aka humility, vs. a rich man buying his way into heaven (i.e. indulgences etc. that later got sold, bribing priests, etc.)
