You are right. Moving or new house will not fix a thing.. he is excited and happy about it, but that doesnâ€™t mean YOUR emotions and wishes have changed. Stick to your needs and very valid emotions. Reaching out to your own therapist is a good move. 

What kind of changes have you seen from relationship therapy? And how long will you continue it? He seems very unaware and uninterested in how his behavior effects you. That is never a good sign.
