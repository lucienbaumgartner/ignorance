Without the final say in the matter, and legally being on the same level as those schmucks, I would say that being aggressive is a really good way to an all out war. 
That couple sounds like they are stupid, obnoxious and unaware of how toxic they are, by showing how annoyed they make you feel, they will feel totally justified by upping the ante in retaliation. Not a great way to de escalate the situation. 

Some people will never understand how horrible they are to live with, and though it would be tempting to destroy everything to do with them, burn their lives and maybe leave them stranded in the woods with no phones or music players or lighters... it's technically you who would be creating more conflict, and people like that will make damn sure that it looks like you who's starting the fight.

The only way is clear, open, non aggressive confrontation, spelling out in no uncertain terms what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and open communication with the agency and other housemates. If everyone else really hates them, and they alone keep breaching the contract, then they can be evicted. it's possible but unfortunately it is just easier to move away from that hot mess.
