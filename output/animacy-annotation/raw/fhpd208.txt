IMO:

Michael was WELL AWARE about his legacy from Thriller onwards. He said they were seriously about the Thriller Short FILM so he paid everything and they used 35mm film. After his success, I can hardly imagine that he used video tape again for any short film, considering we have proof on countless making of videos and photos (PANAVISION!).

Even IF the final music video cut was edited in PAL/NTSC due to effects, if any estate has the power and money to EXACTLY reproduce them (not impossible!), then the Michael Jackson Estate. 

If any estate is unaware and ignorant of the potential or the existence and condition of their artists vault, then it surely is the Michael Jackson Estate! 

Film (especially after leaving celluloid out in the early 20th century as a base material) can live up forever, if stored properly. I am sure Michael took care of his rolls. I am not too sure, the estate does so. So if there is a "right time" to take care of those, it's as early as possible.

Considering color grading: depending on the film stock and lighting, I can imagine that this is how Michael looked during the thriller shoot (with his make up). I like it actually and it's refreshing to see him that clearly, even if we are used to the other colors from the beginning. I think they should not do too much with optimization, but rather leave the colors in their original state and work together with the directors for any further decisions.

If the estate wakes up and realises this opportunity and they are not too lazy, greedy or stupid to really invest this time, money &amp; energy for Michaels legacy in the future, then we can be lucky. But so far I think they are sleeping. Pity.
