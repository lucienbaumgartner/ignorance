It's not valid if it's unlawful.

Do you understand how the law works?

There are several unlawful acts that have been committed and some of them are conventions that parliament cannot legislate it's way out of.

Sure they have made new fancy acts like the covid-19 response act, which doesn't legally define what "covid-19" actually is.

But parliament is supposedly bound by common law and precedent.

They are also supposedly bound by international convention not to force medical treatments or experimentation onto anyone, so they skirt around with fancy loopholes and activist judges who basically defer to parliament as sovereign dictator.

The whole thing has been lax and lazy because they know they have the judges sewn up and the people are largely stupid and ignorant of their rights to begin with.

There has been maleficence here and it will become apparent when enough people are sick of their loved ones dying and themselves being injured and finally snap out of their trance.
