It's not assuming you're a liar. It's assuming you are unaware and insecure, which to be honest is looking to be true considering how you've taken a lot of these comments. There's nothing wrong with that, though. People who are incredibly confident do actually have insecurities too and it's the display of that insecurity that comes across humble and endearing. If you think about it, were you actually arrogant as fuck and wholly self assured, people on the internet mocking you wouldn't be a big deal. In fact it would reinforce that confidence in a me vs the world way. Instead, you've run into a thread to defend yourself which I don't think supports the "he's so confident" vibe you're trying to portray. It obviously hit a nerve and you'd probably benefit from identifying where that need to defend yourself and present such bravado would come from, and embracing it by knowing more about yourself- not just talking yourself up.
