&gt;Did I commit shirk?

**Answer: The act is Shirk,**

&gt;**A person who does an act of disbelief is not a disbeliever if he is ignorant and unaware of the sharâ€˜i ruling concerning his action**, or if he asked a scholar who gave him a fatwa saying that his action was permissible.

&gt;**However he does become a disbeliever if proof is established and presented to him**, and any confusion or misunderstanding on his part was dealt with.
