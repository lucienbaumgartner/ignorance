I won't take boost orders for more than just a few items. I found that too many times early spring that boost orders have baggage attached, and the customer is already displeased and far more likely to punish the current driver for the delay with a low rating. I really think some people believe that the ratings they give are for instacart service in general and unaware that an inopportune 4* rating can take away as much as 1/3 of our earning potential.
