I guess.  But one time I was carrying a friend's 5-year-old, distracted and unaware that she was *still* breast-feeding ... until she had almost completely undone my shirt (one button left).  That was awkward as fuck and makes me think if the kid is old enough to actively seek out boobs, he/she probably shouldn't be drinking from them anymore.
