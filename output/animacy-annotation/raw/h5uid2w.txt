Male genial mutilation (let's call it what it is) was either invented as a means of torture or to control male sexuality- the latter was frequently talked about by Jewish and Muslim scholars in the Middle Ages. It isn't a traditional Christian ceremony, and it's only recently- via the USA, for the most part- that it has become associated with conservative Christianity. It literally dulls one of the most important and sensitive parts of the male body significantly, and removes a healthy, sensitive part of skin that helps lubricate and protect the penis. Ergo, in response to your husband:

1. It's not Christian per se,
2. It goes against Jesus's own teachings
3. It's natural (a religious person might say God created people perfectly, ergo why remove part of perfection)
4. Having a penis is normal and healthy
5. The STI link is in no way a reliable study, since condoms and frequency of sex weren't factored in to the whole thing (I'm sure someone talks about this properly in the thread)
6. It carries risks to physical and mental health
7. If a father is to care for his son, he shall protect him from violence and ignorance, and MGM is both violent and ignorant

Of course, I'd usually talk about the sexual issues, but given the circumstances, I'm not sure whether that would help the argument. At the very least, your son, once he has been fairly informed, should have the right to decide when he is an adult. A culture does not overrule the individual.
