Whatever happens happens. A character died, but it actually was a great coalescing event for the party.  Players split the party to investigate two things at once. Most of the group was across town, and two go to the coffin shop unaware of anything except to question Henrik. Wizard and a blind domain of light cleric go in.

They explore and discover something is not right. I'm dropping huge hints that theres something wrong, they should really tell the others, maybe get some guards. They didnt pick up and wanted to figure it out. They find the spawn and combat begins. Other half of the party completely unaware and unable to help. They fought for a round or two but the wizard decided to leave, the cleric remained and resulted in his death. The tension was pretty exciting to flip back and forth between the other half investigating and the fight. 

This was one of the high points of the campaign - suddenly one of theirs is dead and gone. The RP was fantastic from my players and they learned Strahd is smart and calculating. They had a unified and personal goal to fight Strahd. 

I was not prepared for it in the slightest. But the pieces played out nicely for us to continue the story and make things interesting. 

The cleric was resurrected by a dark gift reskinned as a "light" gift. His god cured his blindness and began/finished his personal character arc of restoring his eyesight and he has become reinvigorated with religious light. He has turned 2 other players to be more religious after this. The wizard feels guilty and makes more great rp/ tension between them. Really great character development all around.

I know I was lucky with this, but 10/10 would kill a player again.
