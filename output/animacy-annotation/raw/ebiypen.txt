This. Just awareness in general. Nothing annoys me more than a person that is standing in the middle of a walkway/road/hallway/aisle and is completely aloof and unaware that anyone or anything is going on around them. Like for fucks sake, take few glances around every now and again and take note of the happenings around you. If more people did this there would be a significant decrease in awkward encounters where people are backed up and politely waiting behind some person that’s casually sauntering down the aisle without a care in the world. It just really gets to me. Have a bit of urgency in your life and realize that although you may not be in a rush or you may not care how long you spend shopping, other people around may not have the luxury.

Sorry for the rant, if you can’t tell I’m a bit passionate about this topic.
