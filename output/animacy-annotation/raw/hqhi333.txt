Idk what to say but my mom married another man when i was 6. Never to this day,43 now,have i been capable of calling him dad and he’s a good dude ,i just cant and idk why. Ive tried. My real dad was an absolute piece of shit i barely knew and still cant figure out why i cant call stepdad dad. Not everything will make sense. Not everything is explainable or understandable to us or anyone else. It just is what it is.Sometimes things just aren’t going to be how they want them and forcing the issue is selfish and ignorant and fully not considering anyones feelings but their own. This isn’t something that anyone should force or pressure to have happen. It will come in time or it wont. They should just respect how she feels and move along or they can keep pushing the issue and ruin the family and make everything uncomfortable for everyone.
