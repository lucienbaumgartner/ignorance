I'm not defending rape at all. But to make rape a justified accusation and ensure it is taken seriously in all cases, there needs to be a clear boundary drawn somewhere along the intoxication spectrum. I can't see an alternative objectively measurable place beyond consciousness - but would love suggestions.

I can't think of any method of 100% eliminating rape as a crime within society. While numbers may fluctuate and hopefully minimise, you will always have a minority of either wildly inappropriate and indecent humans or people with mental health problems who will rape. 

While ideally we would have no rapists, and therefore no risk of being incoherent and unaware - that isn't reality. In the real world, I would argue that multiple individual decisions can make you more or less likely to be raped. I don't feel that's an incorrect statement. If you are drunk, high, topless and walking down a quiet, high-crime neighbourhood at 2am - you have made a number of decisions that will statistically increase your risk. You have full control of your actions, but limited influence over evil rapists.

The problem is that we are treating rapists as normal people who are going to see the error of their ways if we just display anti-rape morality through society. Based on the fact they actively choose to rape people, I would argue many of them are beyond appeals to morality. And having a slew of 'socially inappropriate sexual behaviour' misconstrued as rape leads to less victims being taken seriously
