&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

&gt; "An “emerging progressive majority” is a realistic possibility in terms of demographic and voting patterns.  But it is incomplete in terms of organizing and political work.  Women, communities of color, and highly educated professionals are core parts of the progressive coalition.  Nationally, and in key battleground states, their influence is growing.  Latinos and young voters are quickly solidifying in this coalition as well.  But many of these voters are new to the process.  All of these groups—in addition to working class voters and independents picked up in 2006—will require significant long-term engagement in order to keep them reliably on our side."
