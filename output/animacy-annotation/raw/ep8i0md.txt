I suspect that on some level they don’t believe in science, facts, or even objective reality. I don’t mean that they’ve thought it all through and have some kind of fully fleshed out theory of solipsism or nihilism or anything like that. I just think they’re so stupid and ignorant that their gut tells them that they can just shut their eyes and plug their ears and make anything they don’t like go away. As long as they refuse to believe in climate change, say, then it’s not real.
