Yeah I agree, people need to take responsibility if they're going to have unprotected sex. However I also feel like if someone is so stupid and unaware that they: 
1. Have unprotected sex 
2. Fail to take Plan B
,then I don't want then having kids. They're too dumb to. Basically if you don't want kids then take Plan B, if you fail at that, then you're not responsible enough to raise children, please don't have any.
