When I lived in Colorado, all the cars in the ditch during a snow storm were always TX plates. Alaska is the real deal. You will die if you're unprepared and ignorant of winter environments. 

Alaska isn't just somewhere you impulsively move to. You should think and prepare long/hard and make sure it's something you can handle.
