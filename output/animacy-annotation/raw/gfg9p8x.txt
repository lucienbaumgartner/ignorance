Thank you for that, it really put my thoughts into firm words. Iâ€™m glad I am not the only one that sees this and feels that way. In all honesty, unaware and subconsciously racist people make me more uncomfortable than people that are aware of their bias and racism. At least I can avoid people that are openly and proudly racist.
