You're naive as shit, and too weak to foster a revolution as well. Marxist-Leninists weren't patting each other on the back and posting on Reddit while creating the USSR, they were culling the weak and preparing to fight. You and others more concerned with gender roles and queer identity have hijacked Communist-Anarchist movements worldwide and made it an effeminate, weak, all-inclusive hugbox more concerned with Twitter feeds and Reddit memes than revolution. While Marx was theorizing about the uprising of workers and dictatorship of the proletariat, you're making memes and figuring out which TF2 role you'll LARP as at the BLM(a capitalist organization, not even not for profit) rally. You're weak, useless, and unaware that you serve a capitalist society by endorsing these dogshit corporations you buy from. No surprise the Communist-Anarchist dream is dead when you've polluted our movement
