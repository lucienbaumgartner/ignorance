Oh, absolutely. It's kind of cute when it's inter-provincial, but it does speak to larger xenophobic impulses here. 

To be fair though, there have been some stories of out of province landlords being truly awful (or just incredibly thoughtless and unaware of local conditions). I'm sure there are any number of local slumlords as well, but this last 18 months has seen some really wild rent increases.
