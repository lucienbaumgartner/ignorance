Serious as a heart attack you need to go to your corporate Human Resources rep and ask how someone that’s stupid and ignorant of basic labor law could possibly ever be out in a position to lead other people. If your manager actually made the attempt to fire you over this you could sue the absolute pants off of the company!  That’s absolutely insane.
