Your definition seems biased and ignorant of my worldview. The following text is perhaps a useful working definition in regards to moderate liberals:

"Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law."

"Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), democracy, secularism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and a market economy."

That definition seems to encompass most of my beliefs quite well. Ergo: I am 90+% liberal-ish.
