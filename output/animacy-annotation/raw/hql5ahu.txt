If the problem with half of "you" is that your dont get internet satire, I would love to be one of them. 

At least they arent so pathetic they got around degrading strangers over a misunderstanding. He probably did not realize it was BB article, if you dont click on it, it can be very misleading. 
Not everyone knows you can click on SOME posts and go to an article.

The OP needs to clarify for those who might be old enough to have fought for your right to be such an ignorant and pathetic whelp of a human being.
