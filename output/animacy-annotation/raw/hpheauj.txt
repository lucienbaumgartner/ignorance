No one claimed Companions are identical, they are similar in that they do push decks above 100 cards and in absences of RC fiat violates the same rule 10

&gt;Parts of abilities which bring other traditional card(s) you own from outside the game into the game (such as Living Wish; Spawnsire of Ulamog; Karn, the Great Creator; Wish) do not function in Commander.

Unless you can offer an explanation for *where* the companion is prior to the game, the RC has choose to ignore their own rules.

The reason I pointed this out was so you might reconsider strawmanning with statements like

&gt;All the people who cry Lutri come off so insincere and spineless.

We don't have to agree, but you also could choose less ignorant and inflammatory of words.
