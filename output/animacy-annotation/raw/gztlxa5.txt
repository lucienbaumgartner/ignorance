Yeah 2-3 months in is where the masks of the honeymoon phase slightly start to fall off, if he’s being this demanding now about this and doesn’t recognize it’s not your responsibility to be his chauffeur because he doesn’t put in the work to get his own license and car. Imagine how much more demanding and ignorant of his own entitlement he’ll be as time goes on. Just my opinion though based on the short excerpt you provided, what do I really know about you and this guy. Not much LOL
