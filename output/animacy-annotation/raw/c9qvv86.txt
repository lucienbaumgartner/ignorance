okay here, let me explain it as a guy who knows these things and is also myself heterosexual - it's just less boring than girls without dicks in porn(porn and real life are two VERY VERY DIFFERENT THINGS, LIKE MOVIES AND REAL LIFE) - it's fucking hot to see a girl fucking a girl and, instead of with a tasteless strap on - she has a dick of her own.

I'm just saying, you're making this a lot weirder than it actually is. What is the big issue anyway that girls have with this shit? Suddenly he's not alpha or cool/tough/or *something* enough for you now that you know a "funny little secret" of his? Although this is never the kind of thing you'd want your girlfriend to find out about because it's probably just a little kink of his while watching porn(rather than in real life), when she does, you should just be able to laugh about it with her and then go have sex with one another.


You have no right to be judging and the fact that it's "a big deal in your mind"(I know, I know, that is what "your mind is making it out to be"), is the weird part. So what? People have many sexual ideas and nuanced erotic play and feelings - maybe it's a normal part of girl psychology to be suddenly uninterested in a guy if she sees him as being like herself(wanting to get fucked or have a ... you know, inside you) - so suddenly that's what is in your head(which **probably isn't** why he watches that kind of porn).

**But you need to think of it this way, and GET BACK TO ME ABOUT IT** please, about how you feel about this: what if your boyfriend found out you watched girl on girl porn and found it kind of erotic or sexually tantalizing somehow even if you weren't really into it or into being a lesbian or having sex with girls yourself - then he 'confronted you' about it and made you feel judged - when really it's a non-issue and would just be something you weirdly got off on ..and it isn't that weird at all, but somehow he's going to make it weird because "you're not supposed to be gay"(even though you're NOT gay, in fact you're DATING A GUY and fucking a guy regularly).. then he sat around "worrying about it" and "being concerned" and making posts on reddit about how his girlfriend did this and she tried to explain it that really when she thinks about being with girls it's kind of gross but still she watches the porn sometimes for something different than "girl sucking guy's dick/sex/etc" porn.


I once had a girl get SUPER WEIRD about me / around me / about everything to do with me one night when she and I were playing some sex game and she asked me if I had ever had anything in my butt and I said yes(a girlfriend stuck her toe there once, LOL, as a funny/cute thing, not because I necessarily would like to be ass-fucked).

It was disgusting to me because this showed me she was closed-minded and judgmental, and it really gave me an insight into her (unevolved) personality. Like, are you seriously that closed off and weird that you can't consider that stuff or 'anything goes' with your partner? So like I said, maybe it's just a normal(though weird and closed minded) part of girl sexual psychology, maybe you just don't want to be tricked into dating a "gay guy"(but if he wants to be having sex with you then he's not gay), or maybe these girls are just closed-minded and unaware that there's nothing wrong or weird about it.

THIS turned me off with her completely and I wasn't even really interested in dating her afterward - even though I wouldn't want wanted her to go anywhere near my butthole anyway.
