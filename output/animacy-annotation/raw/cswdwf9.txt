I know what he did was a dick thing, this is without question, but how will you respond? If you think about it objectively he was probably being insensitive and unaware that he was doing something rude. Talking about it might be a good idea but he might get defensive because he may not think what he did was a big deal. If he doesn’t understand what he did was a problem he will become defensive and resentful towards you because he will perceive you as attacking him without reason. You have to consider that having a long talk about your feelings and $5 will not lead to the resolution you want, more likely resentment towards each other because you do not see eye-to-eye. I would suggest interacting with him differently in the future. I would offer to do him favors but also ask him to pay you back for doing them. If you do this he will get the message and you won’t have to have a talk, he’ll get the message.
