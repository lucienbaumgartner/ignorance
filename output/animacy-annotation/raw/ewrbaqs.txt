I'd agree if she was, say, a Physicist and wrote this opinion piece, as expertise in one area doesn't mean that they aren't a moron on others. I'd reserve an opinion on their capabilities as an academic in their field in that case.

But this article is in her area of expertise, she references her time as an cultural studies "academic", and it's so... stupid and ignorant that it's hard not to form a negative conclusion.

I'm also happy to be proven wrong if anyone linked a brilliant academic paper she's published.
