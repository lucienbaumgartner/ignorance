This. Many years ago I was a case manager for children with disabilities. One of my clients was a profoundly developmentally disabled teenage girl. She was nonverbal and required diapers. She could not ambulate. She was in constant pain from muscle constrictions and other ailments. 

Why? Dad had cheated, and given mom syphilis; she was asymptomatic and unaware (and of course so were the doctors), and delivered vaginally. My client contracted the disease during delivery. A C-Section could have spared this child a lifetime of physical and emotional pain. This is just one example of things that can possibly happen to this unborn child, who is innocent in this whole awful scenario.

OP, **please tell this woman**, so that she can make the best and most informed decisions for herself and her child. And I am so sorry this is happening to you.
