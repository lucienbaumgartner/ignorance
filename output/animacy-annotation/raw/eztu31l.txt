This is what always baffles me. I cannot even fathom being so selfish and ignorant that you would cause such an issue trying to correct your own mistake. Just suck it up and find the next turnaround. Maybe this comes from my upbrining and being made to feel like I was always a burden on others, to the point where I feel guilty about even asking people to do their goddamn jobs, but I dunno.

Honestly, I guess I'm just jealous. I wish I had the balls to be so brazenly self-important and give zero fucks about others.
