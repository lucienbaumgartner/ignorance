I definitely get that - BUT The first few times I’ve had it was localised to my RHS so I went in for multiple gallbladder investigations and scans of the area plus lungs  stomach kidneys etc.

Now I’m in the UK so that was genuinely a waste of tax payers money! Therefore there’s incentive to at least be acutely aware of the phenomenon vs completely unaware and ordering expensive tests. 

I think your point re symptoms subsiding is unique to each person - my worst subluxation took around 3 +weeks to normalise including pain and mobility.
