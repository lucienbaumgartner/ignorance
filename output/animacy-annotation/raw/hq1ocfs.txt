Yeah its getting stupid.

Barcelona fans are dumb and deluded about their problems and current situation.

Soccer users jerk off each other especially when its related to an EPL and it gets rubbed on the users here participating there which leads to massive overrating of the EPL clubs. For example this comment just bellow on the OT:

&gt; City are looking crazy scary, scarier than any other team I've ever seen.

Which is both ignorant and stupid.

The "why" they post BS people here quote are the two reasons I put above, not sure why we need to keep doing it. Barca and soccer users are dumb fucks, no need to pay attention to them.

We are where we are is because we focus on ourselves and try to improve when we can, not by watching City fucking a team with a defense that got destroyed by covid and panicking saying stupid moronic things like:

&gt; Who's gonna stop city in the ucl?

And

&gt; Yep ,our main hope in beating them is pep overthinking

I wish I had the power of sending my hand through the screen and slap the users that said that.
