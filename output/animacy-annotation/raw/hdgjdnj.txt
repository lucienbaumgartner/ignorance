You must be quite entitled and ignorant of industry reality to make these kinds of comments... 

do you have even the slightest idea how brutal it is to work in the games industry?

customers are unforgiving, competition is increasingly massive, costs are high and rising, chance of failure is huge, technology is only getting more complicated and innovative fields are harder to navigate on an almost daily basis


given all that, playing video games is surprisingly cheap
