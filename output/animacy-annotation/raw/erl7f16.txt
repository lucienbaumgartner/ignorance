Actually it would be also harmful to have such a legal limitation. Not everything in our life taught that are facts. 

A lot of what we know are not facts but models that the best describe observable effects. Yet, such models are not facts. It is very possible there will be better models discovered that will surpass current models. This is how science works, we teach the best model, as not everything is fact.

What you proposing is stupid and ignorant that will harm science.
