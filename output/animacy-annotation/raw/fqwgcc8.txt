Why do you think I'm not aware of those things? I'm perfectly aware, and think they're horrible too. However, just like what's happening in China, there's nothing I can do about it. Plus this thread is about China not about Australian or American immigration policy.

Peaceful protest has been tried and it's clear that unfortunately, the majority of australians are so racist and ignorant that they can be tricked into voting for the Peter Duttons of the world every election cycle because of the scary brown boat people. I hate it too but I don't see what can change it.

I'm not 'uncritically' repeating shit either. I speak chinese, have lived in and travelled the country extensively, and have a degree on the topic. Excuse me for giving a shit about human rights abuses when they're perpetrated by someone other than the West. Your whataboutism is a very one dimensional way of looking at the situation and doesn't achieve anything other than excusing horrible behaviour.
