I think youâ€™re exactly right. Or at least, he was very invested in you not SHOWING emotions.

I had panic attacks, too, at that age. I went to one therapy session. It was not good for numerous reasons. My mother was having her own breakdown, and my father was always useless and unaware of me as an individual. My mother left us and went to live 2000 miles away with her sister, and I was left to figure it out on my own. I learned to mask my panic attacks very, very well, all for the convenience of those around me, and to my own detriment. All of the adults in these scenarios failed is catastrophically.
