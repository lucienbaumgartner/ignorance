I'm just saying it's a totally meaningless standard by which to judge a song being good or not. Like... Judging a painting by how much yellow it has. Or a movie by how long it is.  

You claimed HotRH is a better song than anything by green day or Radiohead (and you're kinda implying any band from their era) and that's incredibly silly, and reveals you as being really ignorant and biased about music.  So now you're just harping about this... Slide guitar song thing, because you feel like it's the only thing left justifying your inane comments.
