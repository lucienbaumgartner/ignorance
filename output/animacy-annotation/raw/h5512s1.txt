I'm a Belgian electrician and have seen this done before by someone very pragmatic and ignorant of regulations. The finish was flawless and it looked oddly satisfying.

The client wanted to keep it and we negotiated during the electric inspection (third party inspector) to consider it as part of the wall and left it disconnected when we left. 

After the inspection I suspect the client pulled the wire out of the wall put and added a plug (which he connected to a socket nearby). It is therefore not part of the house wiring and ignored by the inspection... does not make it right though
