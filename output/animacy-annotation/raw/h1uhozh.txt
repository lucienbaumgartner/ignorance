A shadow pregnant Melisandre plus some melee fodder to keep the three from getting to her while she goes into labor. Let's say Wun Wun, Mag the Mighty, and Ser Robert Strong (UnGregor).

If unbloodlusted and unaware of what she does they might be too reluctant to even murder the weird woman going into labor in the back of the fight until it's too late. Once the shadow is out I doubt anything they have can kill it. GRRM put her on his "7 of my characters vs Rand al-Thor" team and Rand had to balefire it out of reality to stop it. The only real question is whether the shadow kills them all or will just stop at one.

Even without the shadow Mel's crazy dangerous if prepped. She set a warg's eagle on fire from the inside at a distance of 100+ meters, and has various alchemical powders up her sleeves, at least one of which releases a deadly poisonous fog.
