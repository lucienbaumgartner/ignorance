As a person who got obsessed with the show and later found out I had DID— no. No it was really bad honestly. When I wasn’t aware of my issues I thought it was great and loved the character

Basically: Mike will *physically* change his appearance to all his alters and they’re all just massive stereotypes. 
BUT HERES THE WORST PART... in one of the later seasons, Mike’s evil alter is trying to fuck shit up and they go into his head space. To stop it all Mike presses and big ol button in his head that magically integrates them all and boom- no more alters. 
Even when I was young and unaware, that ending got me kinda confused and I was not happy w it and it made me realize Mike was in fact not a good representation when I at first liked him a lot.
