You are a dense one, huh? Yes, I was speaking in hyperbole, it is a literary device. I am not sure why you seem to miss the point and try to make a big deal out of it why you are unable to appreciate my observation.

And come on, "boys will be boys" have never, ever, been used to justify sex assualts or rapes. Ever. EVER. "Boys will be boys" is said when a boy is a little rowdy or breaks something or gets in a fight. It is not used to minimize rape. That is ridiculous, and saying something as unaware and oblivious as that discredits you on the grounds of having no idea what you are talking about. All I did was use hyperbole, you are guilty or ignorance. 

I have no bias. Bias is what I called out. Bias is saying "they were just a child" when we talk about a little girl being a sexual predator. Nobody says that about boys. Ever. If you want proof, then look up cases where teenage boys are raped by their female teachers. They get pretty close to blaming the teenage boys in those cases. There is a huge difference in the language used than if it was a male teacher raping a teenage girl. I dare you, look up articles about boys being raped by women teachers if you want to see real bias. They will act like the teacher was having an affair and not raping children.
