plot hole: an inconsistency in the narrative or character development of a book, film, television show, etc..

The characters completely ignoring events and happenings are plot holes.  Why do I have to explain to this to a "writer"?  Oh, because you are not a writer.  Ohhhh, yeah.  Makes sense.

The actions of the characters are not plausible.  Characters learn of plot to kill king.  Characters investigate it for a few minutes before completely ignoring that it exists.  Characters see lightning from girl.  Characters ignore it.  Characters see purple woman try to kill people and chase her large distance across their world.  What happens when they find her?  They simply ignore that she did anything.  Everyone else ignores that she ever existed.  It is never mentioned again.  Fucking implausible.  The writing requires the characters to be oblivious and ignorant of the world around them.  That is not good character development or storytelling.  The viewer cannot suspend disbelief as the story is held together by characters acting in unnatural and unbelievable ways.

Again, sport, which one of them do you pretend to fuck?
