I admitted I wasn’t a doctor. I just mentioned l that I have a job that is analytical more than emotional. I like facts and data. (I don’t want to know how bad someone THINKS a thunder storm is, I need to know how bad it ACTUALLY is. That kind of thing.) That’s why I sent the research to scientists who read that kind of research for a living. 

In my post, I didn’t claim I was right. I just said that I did research the best that I could and found precious little. My comment was only in response to the person’s claim that non-maskers were ignorant, unaware and non-caring. That is not always the case, and in fact, less than one would think. It’s just hard to realize it when one joins the mantra of criticism without taking time to understand the other side.
