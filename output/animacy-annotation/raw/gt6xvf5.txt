The good thing is, you have a good understanding and ability to describe yourself. I see that as the first step to improvement.

As you identify your issues, maybe start working on them, one by one, little by little? For example, learning to tolerate disgust... I think we both agree that your level of disgust is clearly more than reasonable. You have issues interacting with people? I get that most people are boring and ignorant of many things... so, maybe you should learn how to communicate with them at their level.

The world will be as it is... irrespective of what you do, as an individual, you don't have much power to change it. So, in my opinion, it's better to develop skills to keep up with it. Only after that, you may even start to push it towards what you think is right.

As for the final questions... dude, I see that you're EXTREMELY judgemental... and also, probably a perfectionist. Maybe re-evaluate your parameters of judgement? Because it's clearly beyond reason.
