As these cases have shown over and over again there is no truth to the claim of widespread or outcome altering fraud in this election. The Trump team hasn't even been trying to make that claim in most of these cases even as they give the impression to the uninformed and ignorant that there is some credible legal battle against electoral fraud taking place.

Any claim someone makes that there was any significant voting fraud in the last election is plain misinformation, as the judge said in this case "with no basis in law or fact." I think any claim like this should be flagged and removed as such.
