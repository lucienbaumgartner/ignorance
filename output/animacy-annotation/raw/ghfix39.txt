I cried too. My mother has Alzheimer's and lives in a group home. Part of me hopes she's still there, locked away in her mind, and another part of me fears that's true and excruciating for her. With covid I haven't been able to see her for months. And I too never had children, and know I will die alone. Just as my mother will die alone and unaware of her surroundings. God I'm crying again. This episode is a great addition to your stories, Kate.
