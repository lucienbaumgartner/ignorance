You should read this book by a psychologist named Bob Altemeyer, *The Authoritarians*.  Trump supporters are what he calls "right-wing authoritarians".  These are the kind of people who are really devoted to their leaders, who tend to be ignorant and irrational and gullible.  Altemeyer says that right-wing authoritarians are drawn to what he calls "Social Dominators", which are people who crave power over others and will take it by hook or by crook.  Social Dominators are not irrational and stupid like their RWA followers are.  They see through he bullshit but don't care.

So what you get in authoritarians movements is flocks of gullible sheeple led by cynical lying assholes.  In the Trump movement, the gullible sheep are all these idiots wearing red hats and pro-Trump banners on their pickup trucks, and the cynical liars are people like Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz, who know Trump is a scumbag but lie about in public because it gives them money and power.
