Lol you just keep going. So let me get this straight- you are somehow the authority over what people are allowed to feel, even sympathetically, without meeting the definition of a terrorist? Do you even hear how narrow-minded and ignorant that is? And now youâ€™ve shifted from ideology to partyism, but every party across the spectrum has propoganda, waste, and alterior motives, including whatever party you call yourself a part of. I could start talking about the BLM CEO stuff or trashing Biden/Dem leadership but what good would come of that? Same result as you going around thinking you can label people a terrorist bc they disagree with you and it will magically change their minds. Quit gaslighting and creating unneeded polarization please!
