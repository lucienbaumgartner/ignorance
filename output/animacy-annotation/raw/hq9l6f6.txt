I'm not talking about rich assholes that bought their degrees, that's not stupidity that's privileged. I would agree with you, when socioeconomic factors wouldn't play a role in education. What you say is ignorant and unscientific, at least. There is an prominent example from one of my native languages that shows that everyone is restricted in their intellect in specific contexts. Every English translation of Kant is invalid, because the lack of vocabulary changes the whole meaning of his work. Language is a tool, not a measurement for intelligence.
