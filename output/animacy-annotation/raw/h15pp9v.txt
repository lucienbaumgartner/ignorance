What is your point? If you can afford a $30 meal, and that is all you can afford - buy a $25 one and tip your driver $5. 

Or go to the grocery store. Use some of that 'critical thinking' to plan your food needs ahead. You can wait an hour to get food delivered, you can go pick up a can of soup at the convenience store.

IDGAF what reason you are having food delivered. Tip your fucking driver. 

I do hope though that your insults of me brought you some solace. You seem very unhappy and unaware of how to interact with other humans with any level of kindness. 

Doesn't surprise me, with your views on tipping.
