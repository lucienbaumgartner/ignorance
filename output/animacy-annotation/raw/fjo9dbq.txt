So I'll start this out by saying I am a CIS gender gay man. I'm also not a part of the "younger" generation, meaning I grew up when the whole pronouns thing weren't a thing, and it was a bit of a shock getting used to it. With that said...

&gt; No one is denying they are human. Some people deny that they are the sex they claim to be.

This just makes me want to walk away from this conversation immediately. This is such backwards thinking here. Why does it matter to you what gender a person wants to be? I never understood this argument. Not only that, but if someone clearly puts on twitter (as they often do) "[he/him]", why the hell would you go out of your way to refer to them as a woman? Why are you so spiteful and ignorant that this is the way you decide to talk to someone?

Pronouns don't only apply to transgender people, by the way. Lots of people (even straight dudes, I know... right!?) use pronouns these days, as do people that identify as non-binary.

&gt; Someone hurting your feelings is not denying your humanity.

This isn't about hurting your feelings. You need to wrestle with that one for a bit and try to understand the underlying problem with *intentionally* misgendering someone. Just because you can't wrap your mind around this doesn't somehow make it less demeaning or harmful.

&gt; The people making this claim are not as frail as they love to pretend. In fact, they are aggressive bullies who claim irrevocable damage when someone uses the wrong pronoun or name.

This is a whole lot of generalization on your part...

&gt; They are vermin.

Ah, so you're just a bitter and hateful human being? Be who you want to be I guess, a shame you decided on something so ugly.
