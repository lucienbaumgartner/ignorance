Well thatâ€™s just not the case at all, and it sounds like you are very uninformed and ignorant of the issue. For example, my office has been working to strike tens of thousands of drug convictions over the past several years as a result of a recent court decision. I work with victims of domestic violence who are assisted by police in shielding themselves and their loved ones from abusive parties, juvenile offenders who get assistance from corrections personnel to get their lives back on track, and judges who are elected by the people to make sure the victims get their day in court. All these people are generally assisted by police officers.
