There's my CoD tracker so you can see my stats. If you think someone with those stats, is "cheating", then again, it's basically confirmed you're nothing but a VERY dull child around the age of 10.

Can't wait for the day that this mistake is lifted and I can show you that I'm playing on my account again. Imagine how dumb you're going to feel/look.
