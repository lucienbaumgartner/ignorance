I honestly think these SJW writers are doing this on purpose to address the "Mary Sue" examples that have been brought up countless times.  You know, as a way of showing how their characters aren't Mary Sues, and have flaws they have to work through.  Which is a good thing to aspire to when writing characters....

  ...except these retards can only seemingly do that by making all of those flaws and struggles relate to blatant stereotypes, because instead of writing actual characters, they write caricatures that then have to retroactively be given flaws after being given all of their buffs, and they use stereotypes to do that because they never learned how to write genuinely good characters in the first place.

  And the worst (yet most hilarious) part of all that?  They're completely unaware and oblivious to consciously or subconsciously recognize this when they do it.  Combine that with the indoctrinated belief that their characters are inherently "quality" simply because of what side of the political isle the writer sits on and their boisterous proclamations of doing things for "social justice", and you have trainwrecks like The Last Jedi.
