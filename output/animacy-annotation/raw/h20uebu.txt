Except it’s not realized. You have to pay that money back + interest + you’re still at risk of stock price dropping and owing MORE to the firm you borrowed money from. 

It’s like buying a $5,000 car that’s worth 15,000. You wouldn’t automatically owe the state 10,000 in “income” because you were smart and got a good deal. Same concept with a stock. That would be insane. You would have to sell your asset to be able to pay the tax. What you’re saying is brain dead and ignorant of how the world works. 

If you pawned that car at a value of 15,000, same way someone uses stock as collateral, you wouldn’t pay income tax on that loan. Loans are not income. If the value of the used car market dropped and your car was magically worth 5,000 again you would be absolutely fucked if you were required to pay tax on that loan.
