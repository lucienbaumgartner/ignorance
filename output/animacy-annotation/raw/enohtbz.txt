As a person on the spectrum, I can honestly say that while I deeply value friendship they can be darned difficult to establish and maintain. If you actually knew a person on the spectrum you would see how naive and ignorant that comment is.....
It’s really a combination of problems but I don’t think that should have an influence on dating. 
If he’s on a dating site, he is obviously reaching out.
