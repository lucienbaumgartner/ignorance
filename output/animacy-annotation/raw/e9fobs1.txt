There are lots of better reasons that I want her to run, but I think the GOPs kneejerk reaction to black women is so despicable and ignorant that she would end up working it to her advantage. She has a badass 'Jackie Brown' kinda poise that would shine an unforgiving light on the ugliness of racism. 

I even got a great slogan for her... "Harris 2020 - Who else would you see hold the GOP accountable?"
