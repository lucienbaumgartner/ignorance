&gt; we wouldn't want to copy everything from China

Fine, USA controls study of USA and controls the journals, does opinion change about facts? The point isn't to copy everything China does, that would be a stupid interpretation however understandable considering many Indians do want to copy China or West, but to copy what works beneficially within Indic framework and context. 

&gt; "I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other people's houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave." -Gandhi

It's okay to have different viewpoints, but not okay to be naive and ignorant of pragmatic realities, otherwise end up as slaves again. Who funds the overseas universities, and what makes their funding any different than EIC? The same game is being played but with different players.
