I'm not wrong at all. 

How many of those 700 million users are Chinese? Cause they're unnappliacle and irrelevant to what we're talking about so you can discount them.

How many are kids? Again, discount those users cause that's 100% just negligence on thier parent's part if they don't know what's on their kid's phones. 

I'd wager alot more than 5% of the remaining saw something about it, and if they didn't, well it's sorta on them again for being so ignorant and unaware of the modern world.

None of this is a secret. It's been in the news worldwide (I'm in aus and it's been on over here too) and all over social media.

Your entire last paragraph is just an excuse that carries no weight, becuase ignorance isn't an excuse.
