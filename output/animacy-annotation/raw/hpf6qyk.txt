Andrew Yang represents two things. He is what we need, and he is what we don’t want. Yang thinks about governance in the most pragmatic way that any recent president (other than Obama during first term). But the problem is that his policy positions require understanding of very complex issues. For that you need to run a campaign that either educates people or treats people as already knowledgeable enough. The problem is that most voters are ignorant and somewhat moronic, and that voters don’t want to spend the mental energy learning about important things. People are “simple”, and they like to be “wow’d” more than they’d like to be informed. That’s why modem politics is all a theater. Cause that’s what people want. And that is Yang’s biggest weakness and why he’ll never win. Well, along with the fact that half of his policies go completely against the self-interests of other politicians in Washington, which means  that none of his policies would ever pass anyways since they would be blocked by Congress right away.
