It's just so pissing. I've tried to be fair with you. I've tried to give you reading materials. I've tried to joke with you. And what do you do? You continue to act like a fucking child that had their toy taken away. It's fucking pissing. It's the excat same "debate" style that liberals love to use. You've never even considered your own positions. All of your values are based on the opposite of reality. Like you really need to get punched in the face repeatedly, I think. And I don't say that lightly. But at this point, I think that's the only thing that will make you see just how fucking stupid and unaware of yourself you are.
