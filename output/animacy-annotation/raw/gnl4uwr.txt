You've shifted the goalposts! At first you said it's not more complicated than Christians bad. Now you say *majority*. This will be my last post on the subject because you're not arguing in good faith. You've come to a conclusion and formed your facts around that conclusion. Instead of looking for evidence to support your worldview before making a decision.

But here's more evidence to prove you're incorrect.


[Here's a Christian winning the Nobel peace prize.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize#:~:text=The%202009%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize%20was%20awarded%20to%20United%20States,diplomacy%20and%20cooperation%20between%20people%22.&amp;text=Obama%20accepted%20the%20prize%20in%20Oslo%20on%20December%2010%2C%202009.)

The aforementioned US civil war is another where Christians fought and died to end slavery. Where yes a majority of Christians were literally giving up their lives so that slavery would end. The entire economic and technological power of the north was used to end slavery. Lincoln was a Christian and used every tactic he could to end slavery.

Here's a religious song specifically written to advocate for the noble cause of giving up your life to end slavery. And the most popular song of the civil war.

And to shake it up here's some non Christian nations or nations with state atheism commiting crimes against humanity.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge (see the crimes against humanity section)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide


I'll say it again. People use religion as a tool. Nothing more. It's not the religion that's at fault for any act of good or bad. Atheists are just as capable of crimes against humanity. It's people. It's always been people that are responsible for their own actions. 

To claim that Christianity is the root of all evil is so incredibly irresponsible and ignorant of Millenia of history. 

In the future argue with good faith and an open mind.
