"Spend some time critical thinking"  ...lol, grow up. Spend less time thinking of insults and more time choosing your words. You show very little understanding of the due process you are talking about.

First, idk why you think I'm arguing with you to begin with, we literally agree with each other (I do think your previous comment is slightly ignorant and very dickish though tbh). I explicitly agree that she's a POS and that the system failed to maintain justice. Her guilt has not been determined yet, so hopefully it ends a bit more fairly but we cant know that yet. 

I think the only thing I disagree with you is whether or not a person can be jailed prior to an investigation is completed. And whether you like it or not, the fact is that you can absolutely be thrown in jail for a period of time with absolutely no evidence. This is why bail is a thing. There are limits to how long this holding period can be, which differ from place to place.

As for the reviewing of evidence you are right that is absolutely part of the process, but of course it takes time, anywhere from days to even years sometimes. So during that time a person can be held (with limits) or released on bail. The man's alleged crime was violent in nature so his bail was denied. And during that time evidence was collected, reviewed, and acted on. Those actions would have included his release as well as filing counter charges against the woman for whatever they decided to slap her with based on the discovered evidence.

As far as her due punishment, its still coming (at the time of the video at least). This story was reported right after her bail hearing. Bail is not used in a punitive capacity, otherwise we'd have even more cases of what happened to the man. Do not worry, she'll have/had her day in court and all of this evidence will be used against her.
