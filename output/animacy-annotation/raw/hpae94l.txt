Except that medical science has come to the conclusion that the only effective treatment for gender dysphoria is transition

That is a link to a page that contains links to many different studies, there are some null (no result/invalid research) and neutral results but the overwhelming majority agree on this.

Changing the way someone thinks on a fundamental level (cognitive behavioral therapy doesnt affect this) is impossible with current therapies, at best you can teach someone ways of coping with the discomfort and pain that comes with being denied transition, but that will often make someone aquire/worsen their depression, anxiety and any other of a number of mental illness.

So yes "mutulating" someones genitals and/or secondary sexual characteristics (its very much not mutulation but using your words) and giving them hormones and hormone blockers is far easier and more effective than anything else medicine has come up with.

The hardest part of transition isnt the medical procedures, but the hate ignorant and intolerant people throw at you for existing.
