Personally, I've always found the "they have magic so they never needed to innovate" trope both lazy and ignorant of how people work. First, if magic exists in the world, it's just another natural phenomenon like chemistry, electricity, electromagnetic radiation, etc., and will be explored and utilized to the best of people's abilities. Second, even if magic provides a powerful solution to some problem (eg, weaponry), nothing is ever 'good enough' that people will stop trying to innovate.

Given that firearms themselves are a medieval invention, I can't imagine any world that had mechanical engineering, early factories, metalworking, etc. comparable to 18th-19th century Europe (I assume that's what you're talking about) without anyone having realized that building up pressure in a confined area and using that to launch a projectile makes for a great weapon.
