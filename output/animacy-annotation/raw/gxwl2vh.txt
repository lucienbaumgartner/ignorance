I was playing soccer in the culdesac with the neighborhood kids the other day.  My friend and neighbor is the father of a boy who is pretty hyper.  I sympathize with his boy because I was like him when I was as kid.  Smart, aloof, wild and unaware of social norms.  So anyway we were kicking the ball around and his son kept kicking it to me instead of him.  I saw his shoulders slump and could tell it was hurting my friend that his boy was preferred to play with me instead of his dad.  I tried to be graceful about getting him to kick the ball to his dad instead of me.  I want my neighbor to like me and Iâ€™m sensitive to quelling any beef.  The quarantine has brought us closer and I want it to stay that way.
