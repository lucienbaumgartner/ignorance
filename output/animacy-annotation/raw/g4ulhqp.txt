My therapist's child pops in every once in a while and loves to tell his mom what he did on his Wii and how cool it is. She will ask me to hold on for a moment when she sees him to not violate my privacy. She walks him out, and we resume our session. I just see kids as unpredictable and unaware of what they are doing. I don't mind and it's never really bothered me as it does not happen all the time. She has her own office with a door that she does sessions in when she is at home that is away from where her son is playing. She cannot help she is currently working from home, and her child comes in to tell his mom about the Star Wars video on his Wii because he is excited. It's almost nice to see a child enjoying life and not feeling like he has to suppress himself for the sake of being polite, and his parent not screaming at him or angry he interrupted.  

As far as the other therapist, I'd be hella upset about that. It's one thing if it was an accidental interruption but not when it is a therapist just there...uhhh, what about privacy, dude?
