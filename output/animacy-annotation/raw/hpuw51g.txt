No doctor at the moment waiting to be seen by an endocrinologist for treatment. Both my regular doctor and my first endocrinologist said I definitely have pmdd but the one Endo I saw didn't say much it was weird so seeing another now but have a few more months until that appointment.

That's great thanks so much! Sure I definitely would. Sorry for the delay, holiday stuff got in the way.

I can't believe some people think we have control over our emotions lol, one comment was ignorant and rude telling me to stop control my emotions. Sweetheart I normally can but pmdd is pmdd for a reason, I can't control myself from getting upset on pmdd if I could I wouldn't have any issues lol.
