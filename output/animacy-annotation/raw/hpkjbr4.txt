you definitely a middle aged privilaged white man that isn't happy with his life. and you disregarding rap as rhymes about made up black suppression proves your Idiocracy much more. your opinion is dogshit because its based on "what i dont understand or dont like == trash" instead of being a bit self aware and just saying to yourself "this isn't my taste and i have never listened to it so my opinion isn't based on actual experience". im saying you are white because rap is a big part of black culture so its hard that a person of color would disregard  their own part of culture. trying to argue with strangers is definitely not for you cuz you can't even make a normal argument without making yourself look blatantly ignorant and moronic.
