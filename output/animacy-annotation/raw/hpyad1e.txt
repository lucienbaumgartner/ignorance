I personally feel it hit the nail on the head as a social observation. It pissed me off to see that humanity is actually this ignorant and selfish and I think that was the point? 

Fun acting. Leo's outburst towards the end was fantastic and hit home tremendously. 

I didn't particulary like any character as they all had flaws, some more than others. 

It wasn't a fantastic film and I doubt I'd ever watch it again but it was ok I guess.
