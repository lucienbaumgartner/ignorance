the problem is that one's decision not to take the vaccine affect others and the government in this case should have the power to protect the majority of people's life in my opinion. I agree that it doesn't feel right for the government to have such a power but the majority of people's life matter, also most people are so fucking dumb and ignorant that u can't just expect them to make a good decision when it comes to something that can kill so fucking many people. Well these are my 2 cents.
