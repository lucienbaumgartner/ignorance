Most of my pet peeves are driving-related. Here are some examples:

* People who merge on to a busy highway going 30 km/h(18 mph) under the limit. Holding up 10 cars now also trying to merge at 30 km/h under the limit.

* Just generally unaware and lackadaisical drivers.

* People who leave their cart in the middle of the aisle at the grocery store; make no effort to move before you awkwardly have to shove your cart into theirs to get their attention.
