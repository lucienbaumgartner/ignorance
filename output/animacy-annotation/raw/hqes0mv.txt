Like you I commented in more than one place on a post I am interested in.  If you're worried about me, take a look at yourself you are doing much the same. 

I guess you could start by saying that you were wrong about Ireland being a colonist nation, then take time to examine your own imperialistic values. For you it might be an intellectual debate, but the effects of colonisation are well known and I am familiar with them as I grew up living the experience. You literally said Ireland benefits from being colonised and disregarded the fact people have lost their language, their family history, the countries population has still not recovered to prefamine levels, and 20% of the country is still under foreign rule. But please tell me more how Ireland benefited from their British benefactors.

Your comments are ignorant and hypocritical.
