Reddit is supposed to need ad revenue to keep the lights on. But the admins let a small cabal of disturbed individuals routinely hold their site hostage. Who's going to advertise on a site where the ad views can be hijacked by some rogue volunteers larping as freedom fighters?

 Either they're getting income from somewhere else, or they really don't have the foresight to see what a problem this cabal is. 

The cabal has started using the same tactics on any subreddit they have a personal beef with. eg a few are targeting the banpitbulls subreddit with nearly identical language: accusations of brigading, spreading hate, and doxxing.

The admins are either monstrously unaware and stupid, or are funded in some other manner and don't care that the site is run by a small group of mentally ill shut-ins. 

It's really weird.
