Well the stereotype is there for a reason... I mean, I don't know how it's possible to be British and unaware of this trope. Its written through us like a stick of rock, and loads of our humour relies on it. It's not the same as being an incel, which someone mentioned (fucking stupid comment) - it's about typical British introversion and slight wariness in social situations. If you're not like that, Billy for you but don't run around proclaiming it to not be a thing.
