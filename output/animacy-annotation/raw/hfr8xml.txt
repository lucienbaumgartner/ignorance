I can't help but smile at this: Just imagine everyone (neighbors, passersby, the construction workers) remembering this moment of the stupid pigeon. Everytime you walk there, you will be reminded by the traces this unknowingly, unaware and almost blissful being had made in so many lives. I wouldn't want it any different ðŸ¥²
