You've compared my disagreement of categorising and measuring sexuality to transphobia, which traditionally has focuses on categorising and pinning people down to be immovable.

I asked my bi friend what she felt about the scale, she said "Yeah idk I understand why people wanna be more specific but sexuality is such an individual experience and sometimes you can’t find a definition that fits. I don’t think I’d be able to rate myself with that scale but I get their thinking behind it."

I provide you with my proof of study, and... Nothing. It's what the humanities has continuously tried to combat, the defining of people to a point of unchanging variation.

If you think I've been passive aggressive from the get go, you're reading something that isn't there. My last message was because of your writing an entire sentence in caps like I'm thick and unaware of what you're saying.

If someone doesn't see themselves or can't point themselves on that scale, which many can't, that is equally as invalidating of their sexuality.
