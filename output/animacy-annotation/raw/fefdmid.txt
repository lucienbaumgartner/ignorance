I generally try not to wade into the Israeli Palestinian debate, because I do not trust myself to be informed enough to make a statement that I will soon find is incorrect and ignorant.

That said, I think there is distance between being critical of the Israeli government and being anti-Semitic. 

Trump has white nationalists in his cabinet and chief strategists. He let those people into his government. 

You are peddling false dichotomy and defending it with a false equivalence. You should just stop talking.
