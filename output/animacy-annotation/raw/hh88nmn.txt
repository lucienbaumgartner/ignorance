 My s.o is on vortioxetine for a second time these 2 years, after two severe depression episodes  and he js on higher dose this time , and everytime on the 5 6th month of taking it he becomes totally different person

Usually he is the most loving, thoughtful and caring person and loves me so much and wanted to spend the rest of his life with me but  when hypomanic(he is not diagnosed bipolar yet because he is not visiting his doctor after he starts feeling well) he becomes totally different and ignorant of everything else in his life ,always fighting with his parents,  who he deeply  respect and love ,now I'm experiencing for the first time all the negative aspects on me , he suddenly became very emotionally numb,  he is not interested in showing any emotion and he doesn't know why,  he has changed soo very much and now he broke up with me because he wanted to "live his life " and he doesn't want a serious relationship to be on his way of living it

And this change in him is almost  two months now and I'm devastated he is not the same person anymore,  but I think it's all on the meds.. considering he might be bipolar and antidepressants just trigger his hypomanic side but I'm not sure if that's all..
