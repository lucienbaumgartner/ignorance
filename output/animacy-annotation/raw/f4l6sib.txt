&gt;This literally changes nothing. Nobody ask how he got there IF he was in a car crash. Don't need a registrerad vehicle to ask that.

Hospital doesn't ask how ANYONE got to ER if they were in car crash. Hospital ER will ask if anyone else was injured in the car crash however. Police on the other hand, when questioning Ray, hospital staffs weren't sure except Ray's head injury from a car crash. Ray disputed by saying it was from a fall and told police he was in a car crash 8 years ago and told he drove to hospital with his wife and kid. Because there was no earlier vehicle accident reported and hospital staffs seemingly unaware and confused, shrink was called in while APB was most likely placed on Ray's registered vehicle which wasn't found at the hospital parking lot. Hence they went to the gas station.


&gt;And if Ray was delusional and believed those Two to be His family, then he would logically show His car to show that he wasnt in a car crash.

I don't follow your rationale. Ray is convinced hospital is harvesting his daughter's organ. He has to prove hospital is killing his child, not prove he wasn't in a car crash. Mental illness is not a choice you just reason yourself out of.
