Saying "happy holidays" isn't woke my dude. It's acknowledging fucking facts.

Between November 1st and January 15th, many of the world's major religions observe approximatelyÂ 50 holidays, several of which overlap with each other and even fall on the same days.

We get forced days off for the christian ones because those are the ones that the guys in positions to federally mandate shit recognize. I doubt there is a christmas buzz in Rwanda or Iran. Usually whatever country is trying to federally mandate the wholesale execution of christians you won't find this same set of cultural days off.

Your government is run by Christians, that's all, and it's telling how ignorant and biased they are that the only date WalMart will give off is Christmas day itself because the only thing that monstrous company fears is the feds. Public school is another place to look if you want to see what the government thinks is a real holiday and what isn't. 

As a non-Christian myself, I am well aware of your pain because this year Christmas is shutting things down around me while I am homeless and the realtor won't call me back because *it's Christmas*.

But it doesn't make the phrase "happy holidays" a bad one.
