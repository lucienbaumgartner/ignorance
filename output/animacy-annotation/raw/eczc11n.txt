Is your argument here "its been that way forever and that makes it morally acceptable?"

Wow.




Do you even realize how shortsighted, closed minded, and ignorant that response was?



Traditional does not equal correct.



Thousands of years of institutionalized slavery throughout the entire course of human history just told me so.



Do you have an argument for how non consensual confiscation of goods under threat of violence somehow isnt theft?
