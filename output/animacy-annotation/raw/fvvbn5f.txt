F-22 is EXTREMELY limited in A2G capabilities... Basically GPS guided 100lb JDAMs and GPS guided SDBs, and that's it. Not exactly a true multirole needed to replace a multirole airframe like the F-16.

I'm sorry you don't like facts and reality, but the cool thing about them is they don't change no matter how ignorant someone is to them! Cool thing about them, right? But thanks for downvoting me just because you can't handle facts.

Also, if you think an F-35 is slow, I'm gonna say it's safe to assume you've never seen a combat loaded F-16 flying, because you'd realize how idiotic and ignorant that statement is...
