That's just shockingly cruel, evil and ignorant that your family would try to teach you that you're nothing but an incubator.  You're more than that, and you're no less a woman if you can't have children or simply choose not to have them.  It's more of a sin to tell someone they're worthless if they can't pop out offspring.

 I could go on and on about how vile a sentiment that is, but know that you are allowed to live, be respected, and be happy no matter what.
