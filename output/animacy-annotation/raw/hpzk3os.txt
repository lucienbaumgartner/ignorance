&gt;Are y'all just making up new titles to go with your pronouns now? I don't have the energy or time to sit here and go through every little thing you've said that was wrong

&gt;Don't believe? Fine, nobody cares. But I also won't sit here and let you slander something you know nothing about

I will slander away as I please because I have more knowledge about it that you do. If you actually read your Bible, you would realize ho fucked up the god portrayed within it truly is. You are actually better than he is and you're a complete asshat.
