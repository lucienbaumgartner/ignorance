I’d love to be able to forget the childhood abuse, but I wouldn’t be able to understand and relate to people as well if I only had good memories. My view of the world would become blissfully deluded and ignorant of certain realities. It’s because of that abuse that I can recognize traits, see little things that people and know when I do and don’t need to hold my tongue. Most of all, those bad memories taught me the kind of person I cannot and will not be.
