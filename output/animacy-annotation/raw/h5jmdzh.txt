And u are just blind and ignorant of ur own statements. It's is what's being discussed , if it is fair or not these people receive relief from the state they are in due to historical events?
1.saying that it shouldn't because slavery is human nature and always existed is hipocrisy.
2.saying that they giving them money won't solve anything while sitting in ur home is hipocrisy.
Just go to Haiti and look at the state it is in,  creating a discussion that will change people's minds about Haiti getting any sort of money is cynical at least.
