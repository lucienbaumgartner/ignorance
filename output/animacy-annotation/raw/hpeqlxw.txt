Thats the thing. I haven't done LSD but I've done mushrooms a few times and I definitely feel like there are revelations that come which were right under my nose thr whole time. I think what happens with people who are frequent trippers is that they adopt this mindset that everyone is asleep and unaware of the complexities of life, and therefore they are more "superior" because they know the truth.
