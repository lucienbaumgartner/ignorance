This country was founded upon the indigenous people, they were the first ones to live here, therefore being the only qualified official language.

The french were immigrants, the british were immigrants, punjabi's were immigrants, the chinese are immigrants, saying otherwise is foolish and ignorant of our history.

Our country was never founded by the British and French, it was taken. I'm not saying this was utterly wrong/right, but it is extremely hypocritical for french/english to be considered "original".

The "constitution" is a piece of paper. We can use our best judgement of when the constitution should change, as all things do.
