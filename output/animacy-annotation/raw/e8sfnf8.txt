In another comment you talk about Liberal celebrities only having x or y views for 'goodguy PR points'.

But now, here you are, talking about Hopkins, who's  entire job is to be a provocateur "isn't going along with what's cool to say".

She's saying what is "cool" to her base of grumpy old right wingers in the same way that celebrities try to please their demographic of young diverse people with their views. 

She says what is necessary to get her repeat business appearing on daytime TV and writing Newspaper columns and selling books.

The cognitive dissonance with you is just unbelievable. And that is not a phrase I use often. You are profoundly unaware and stupid. You should really go back to school and get some classes in GCSE English for source analysis and maybe some A level critical thinking classes. You clearly failed the 1st go around.
