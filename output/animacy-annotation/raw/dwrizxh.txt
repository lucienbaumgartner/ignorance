It's okay. We need people like Hitler as reminders so the world knows what not to do.  

Just look what happened when the first baby that grew up to rule the entire world through fear and genocide was strangled to death in her crib by time travellers.  We ended up naive and unaware, and nurtured Hitler in her place.
