I know I can't do nothing and I do try my best to do something even if I'm not obligated to. Problem is that my word means shit because my dad is the type of person who is so full of himself he doesn't value anyone's but his word. Because I'm 14 and not some 40 year old my word means nothing and I'm automatically wrong. Honestly I mostly call this out on my mum who's not the worse but just ignorant and refuses to take action. 

So I'm stuck because my dad will automatically pin any screaming from my brother on me and scream and punish me for it even if I'm not at fault but I can't fix anything if I don't go near him.
