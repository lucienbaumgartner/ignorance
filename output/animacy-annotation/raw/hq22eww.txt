Protection from medical “misinformation?” What a pathetic excuse. First, exactly what is “medical misinformation?” Since when does disagreement with the dogma and pablum pushed by the government qualifies as “misinformation?” Second, what sort of pathetic, ignorant and uneducated losers need “protection?” One of the hallmarks of being an adult in a supposedly democratic country is the ability to make your own mind about what is true or not true. If you need protection you do not deserve to live in a free country.

Wake up American people, the woke, progressive crowd is stealing our country.

God Bless America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
