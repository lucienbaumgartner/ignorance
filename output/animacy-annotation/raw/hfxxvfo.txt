I mean, I could see this exact same story from the reverse. “This total Karen just jumped the line” (even OP said she probably didn’t know, how often do these stories have people who might be new and ignorant of rules) “so I tracked them down and gave them an earful! I told them I was in a rush to get back to my son in the hospital (even though that’s not true, but they don’t know that) and that they were so selfish. They started crying, it felt nice to teach them a lesson”
