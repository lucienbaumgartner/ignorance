You're just wrong. Empirically false and easily disproved. Get a clue- there's no USA without immigrants. It's just too bad some people are too ignorant and racist to admit it.
Real ones recognize the importance of immigrants to the fabric of the entire continent. 
I'm sorry you are so clueless about your own fucking country.
