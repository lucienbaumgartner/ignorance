Stalker?  Nothing that attentive, more of an intermittent study, looking though the microscope, studying a strange specimen.  Your behavior is simply so repulsive and ignorant that it confused me, I couldn't fathom that level of depravity, and it bothered me, "triggered" if you prefer to use reductive buzzwords.  It didn't make sense.  I mean, I know there are bad people in the world, but I still want to understand where their behavior comes from.  I'm an empathetic person :)

I won't be bothering with you anymore, so don't worry about me annoying you.  I'm glad to have figured you out, and though I'm disgusted by what I've found, the closure is very nice.  Carry on with your insular life and enjoy.
