Do you really believe that the “working poor” are so untalented, unskilled, unambitious, and ignorant that they will never rise above a minimum wage job? Do you really think that just raising the minimum wage will help them when their labor is already worth so little to employers, rather than suppressing demand for their labor that could have otherwise provided on-the-job training? On an economics sub? Sheesh...
