Where we fucked up is having 50 Republican senators actively preventing us from accomplishing anything, who are supported by millions of reactionary right-wing americans who are proudly ignorant and happy to flaunt their selfishness while the world burns. 

I'm not really sure what option we have besides re-education camps :/
