Hey hey! Unpopular opinion here, but that was me, in my first serious relationship. I realised i have codependency issues and EXTREME anxiety, all from childhood trauma and ridiculous unhealthy family dynamics. I needed constant reassurance by means of texts, calls, words of affirmations and generally like non stop contact /communication.
I would literally haven't panic attacks. I was so uneducated and unaware and actually believes i lobed him THAT MUCH. Aside from these issues, you guys seem okay? I understand youre feeling smothered but maybe, if you like, talk to her about this. Research codependency and speak to her about her family stuff and get hwr to see a counsellor. I HAD NO IDEA what thwse terms were or that they'd existed but when i read posts about thwse with details describing them, my mind was blown and felt likely someone was reading my life. The posts in question were from an instagram page, the holistic psychologist. O don't think your gf is putting her feelings before u, because she selfish and doesn't care about u, i believe, like me it's seriously an uncontrollable impulse to ease the unbearable anxiety. Like i said, one o learned the terms and recognised my behaviour, that was half the battle
