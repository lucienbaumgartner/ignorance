And you have all the time in the world, its no problem and no rush at all.
Know that even if we understood everything, even if we had all the answers, we'd still be here just the same as we always have been.

Continue whatever methods are most helpful for you to integrate this stuff, see your therapist, take care of yourself, but most importantly just take it easy. 

Nothing is going anywhere, nobody is going anywhere

Although you have experienced or are experiencing ego dissolution, your ego isn't going anywhere either, only your association with it is what has changed.

It is disassociation, it is depersonalization, but that doesn't mean its a problem. 
Its just something that is happening.

As time continues, you will find certain things tend to fuel the ego, certain things tend to tame it, and sometimes you're completely selfless and unaware of the ego.. yet still playing your part perfectly.

As we become more familiar with these subtle influences, we get a little more consistent or stable.

So in the beginning these disassociative experiences were unmanageable, in the end they're relatively easy to work with.. because we understand that we can put it on and take it off. 
We do our thing, work at our job, take care of our families, whatever it may be, and when the ego isn't needed we just slip out of it and relax.

The ego or the mind, is just a tool that we can use to function in the world, its not really who we are.
