Your writing style is highly evocative of someone’s right wing uncle on Facebook. Maybe the reason you’re seeing “parroted” responses isn’t because everyone but you, the enlightened one, is brainwashed, but rather maybe it’s because you come across as a very specific variety of angry and ignorant that elicits a certain kind of uniform response.

Maybe the problem isn’t that *everyone else*, but maybe you’re just coming across as kind of a stupid asshole? Worth thinking about, at any rate.
