I'm not as knowledgeable on Perry's gf situation as most, so correct me if I'm wrong here...but with a baby on the way and at least some influence over Perry's decisions, wouldn't it be smart for his gf to say, "Hey, it's been fun and all, but it's going to be better for your career and our family if you train with a real camp and have an actual corner from now on?"

Is she naive/dumb and unaware of how precarious the situation is re: his fighting career? Would he just not listen to her even if she begged him to take fighting more seriously?
