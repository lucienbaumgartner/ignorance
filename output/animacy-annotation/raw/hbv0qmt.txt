Ok that’s not how public perception works.
He doesn’t get a pass just because he doesn’t want to engage. That’s irresponsible and ignorant of the way things work. 
It doesn’t matter if he wants to appear like some absentmindedly brooding teen, if he didn’t want to have to address questionable tweets then he should just have kept his mouth shut about the issue. But he literally is attempting to play both sides by not saying anything and that’s not ok.

Like it or not he’s a brand now, that’s how celebrity status works, if I see a brand giving anything to republicans, It’s license to dislike that brand. so his stupid tweets are my license to dislike him because they legitimized bullshit like Shapiro and Fox News and the cancel culture “debate”.
