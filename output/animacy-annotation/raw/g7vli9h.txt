Wow. You are so smart that cant understand my words. No if it is normal some one to have sex in that age in this time, it is normal to get married in that age in that time. And you are speaking like it is anormal to marry in their time. It was normal in europe, arabia, persia etc.

Yes he was uneducated but he was smarter than you atleast.

He was illitrrate but he was honest. He never told a lie.

Lust for woman? He married older woman so nobody could told him that he has lust. And he married some widows for protect them. And yes he married *child* for protect her too.

The last part is did not even true. You are so stupid and ignorant that you are talking lies now.

Pathetic.
