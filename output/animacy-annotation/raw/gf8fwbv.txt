This makes me physically sick. These people are absolutely heartless. That poor, poor child. She was not only violated and traumatized once, but twice! How can these people not see this child’s suffering? All they care about is controlling other people, they’re so fucking brain dead and unaware of others suffering they call a violation of a child’s body and mind a blessing. But even worse are the people that denied this poor child the MEDICAL TREATMENT (yes abortions are medical treatments) she needed. She could’ve had the abortion and hopefully worked on healing herself, but no, now she has to be violated AGAIN and put her body through more trauma, preventing her from healing properly. I fucking hate humans, we’re so disgusting and lacking empathy for other people. These people don’t care about children, they only care about making sure their disgusting cycle of suffering continues, this is absolutely fucking revolting.
