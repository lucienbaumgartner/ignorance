Lmao the fucking ignorance of that post. People are getting downvoted for saying 80% of people get it. Which is true. There are over 100 strains of this. And it’s so easily spread that even with a condom on you’d almost definitely get it. You’d have to stop having sex completely to not get it. 
It’s funny because a lot of those men probably had it and their body cleared it or they don’t have sex lmao. 

The first commenter was right, you should always disclose it unfortunately it’s really shitty that we should because it’s so common that they most likely have it anyway but out of good conscious I say yes. 
And to be honest if they’re not ignorant and closed minded then they either know what hpv is or you’ll be able to explain it’s low risk and that it should go on it’s own. And tell them they should get the vaccine regardless if you two stay together or not because it will help them avoid getting the more dangerous ones from future partners. 
I’ve had a boyfriend for four years and recently had a biopsy to make sure my lsil isn’t something more serious because it did not go away on its own. I thought my bf would think I was disgusting but he was so supportive and reminded me that I’m not disgusting because so many fucking people have it that it’s literally almost more normal to have it than to not. I believe almost every sexually active woman will have had it before the age of 30…40? I don’t remember the number. He also got the vaccine at 16. I got it at 21 after I dropped off my old sexual friends for him. 
I think that should show you who he is as well.
