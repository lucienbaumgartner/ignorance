&gt; I’ve also been told that bitcoin is a stupid and shitty investment since it was 180$

I never said it was a shitty investment, I said it was a shitty currency

&gt; Do you know how stupid I feel these years later looking at my portfolio?

I imagine not very, considering that bitcoin has shot up in value.

&gt; I’m also invested in many other things which act as better “currencies”

You mean currencies with actual regulation and stability?

&gt; What I’d urge you to do is to look at the replies here. A lot of people who have been conned into believing many lies. People who watch main stream media news. People who went to public government indoctrination camps. People who’s minds are basically a bowl of angry sloppy mush. These people are so brainwashed by their masters - so utterly unaware and stupid - that they are easily manipulated by endless governmental propaganda put out by agencies such as NASA which paints pantheistic fantasies for Godless (and sadly “Christian”) masses to fall prey to. 

Blah blah blah fear mongering gibberish

&gt; Remember I was born into the same world you were

Yea but you're way crazier than me

&gt; Luckily I have found some very valuable truths

No you haven't. You jumped on a band wagon and got lucky

&gt; You believe and do as you’re told. You’re a good little minion I’m sure!

You might as wel bitch about sheeple, you'd sound less crazy
