UDF is Unity Defense Force, designed for and created for the overall support of NMS in general by u/GeneralJagers at my personal request. It is sanctioned by the UN42 governmental faction, and housed by the NMS Cafe of which he's also a leader. The purpose of this creation is to aid, supply, escort and protect players in Cafe based civ spaces, anywhere else deemed legitimately in need, and is quite happy to assist the GHDF. 

To anyone that may play this off as a troll group etc., you are dearly misinformed and unaware of its actual honest existence past memes and coy snark thrown randomly at it and others that seek peaceful playtime in game. To others who seek help or to join, please do ask whatever you like. I personally stand behind the UDF, the GHDF and any other faction that is driven to assist and support the community overall. I hope this view is more shared than forgotten. ðŸ’œ
