First off I read your comment. What a silly accusation.  You said my comment was shortsighted, divisive and ignorant.  That is name calling. Typically name calling occurs after someone has had their feelings hurt. Secondly, I'm not I'm not "doubling down" because I don't have "black-and-white thinking;" I have *literal years of first hand experience dealing with these people.*  I am sorry that you can't fathom that I know more about the people of my country than you you know about them, but in this case I absolutely do. 

Any person who still supports the farcical circus of "stop the steal" (nothing was stolen) and "kraken lawsuits" and "hE's gETtiNG rEiNsTaTeD iN aUgUsT," and "January 6th was ANTIFA cosplaying as MAGA, not really MAGA" etc, etc, etc; is a cult-indoctrinated dolt. I genuinely don't know why you'd be pushing back so hard about something so overwhelmingly obvious.
