Woooooooow, what an incredibly ignorant and dismissive thing to say. Do you not know any Deaf people? Have you really missed this entire cultural shift? It’s pretty basic knowledge at this point that many people do not consider it a disability and that people in the community celebrate many of the things that not being able to hear and/or speaking sign language has led to, like ASL poetry and dance.

Please, read up and catch up with the rest of society. Your comment was incredibly hurtful, judgmental, and uninformed. (And not just for Deaf people, also for those of us with ADHD who recognize and even celebrate some of the things about the ways our brains work, and would not want to scrub every aspect of ADHD from our brains even if we could).

“We’re not broken.”
“What people may not know is, behind the meaning of the word “deaf,” is a beautiful and rich culture, complete with its own traditions, language and people. “Deaf” may be seen as a negative occurrence because hearing loss, or hearing impairment, is often seen as disabled.

“As a community, we believe the complete opposite. People who are deaf do not see themselves as broken or as a disability. We believe we do not need to be fixed because we are immersed in an amazing culture that has shaped our identities and given us a way to express ourselves. We do need to be respected.

“Being deaf is part of our identity.”
