And, doesnâ€™t Twitter give warnings. The 12 hour suspension with what you violated... etc. I see people Tweeting about how they were mistakenly suspended and how they had to appeal the decision. It always sounded like a lot of hoops and it took a long time to get sorted out but there was clearly an appeals process even with Twitter. Obviously they judge if something breaks their rules. Places police their customers all the time. These arguments are so shortsighted and ignorant of the actual processes.
