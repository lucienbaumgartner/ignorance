Do you need to justify a position if you're 'not' a thing?   

Anyway I eat meat. Lot's of meat. I love it.   

The morality of killing another creature is very subjective and all comes down to where you personally draw the line. I've often thought how hypocritical it is of vegans to drive around in their Prius's telling the world how they don't harm animals but they ignore all the bugs splattered on the grill. Ignore the number of parts that use petro carbons (plastics, lubricants, fabrics, rubber) and nasty acids (the battery) to produce and ignore the harmful effect that has on the environment both directly through pollutants and indirectly through the process of obtaining these base materials.    

The point of what I'm saying is that you too (making the assumption here that you are the vegan we're discussing) have a subjective line in the sand where you say "this is good, that is bad". I'm simply OK with killing a few more creatures than you and I'm OK with it because I put them to good use. I don't accept their loss simply as a byproduct of my lifestyle.   

I'll also point out that I hunt. This doesn't only mean I shoot things. It means that I manage the land, keep invasive plant and animal species in check, remove and report sick game animals, maintain the waterways, pick up litter. Then I shoot something. I clean it, skin it, process the meat, and eventually cook and eat it. I know where my food comes from. I was there when it died and I've felt the anguish of it not being done cleanly. I respect my food.    

As for torture that's a whole different thing. Did you know that a stressed animal has a different flavor? It's not usually good which means you want the animal relaxed and happy when it dies. That's why goats are used to lead other animals through the slaughterhouse and why you stalk and take game when it's unaware and relaxed. So if I were to kill and eat a dog it would be a happy dog and it would be dead before it knew what was going on.
