That is true. There are a lot of things that the us did and what the other countries did. However, for Japan, it's a different story. Japan is a country that started the war that killed millions of people. They were on the same side with a country that killed millions of Jewish people just because of who they were. However, the current Germany government and the people regret what they have done and tries to fix it by doing a lot of humanitarian work all over the world. However, Japan does not feel a but of remorse or guilt of what they have done. They are proud of what they have done and does not stop with their bullshit story and excuses. It is outrageous to see a G20 country act so childish and ignorant. That is why I am so upset of current japanese government and feel sorry for the people who believe that crap that the government is feeding them.
