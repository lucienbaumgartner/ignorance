Are you telling me that adult men still living with their mother for years can't be expected to know something is off?

Also, are you telling me that the mother is committing this unhealthy behavior, damaging not only her son but also herself, knowingly almost all of the time? That she knows she is a devouring mother and she knows why and how to fix it?

Not all mothers are devouring. So how does a devouring mother get created? You would say they are usually knowingly created by themselves or something. You still put the entire blame on her. A Devouring Mother is a victim of her circumstance just as a Puer is a victim to his. You expect the mother to be thinking "Yes, I'm this little boy's mother and I'm going to attack him with my demons knowing exactly the damage it will cause to me and to my child" with full awareness while the Puer is suppose to be completely unaware and innocent in all of this. Double Standards

Like, the mother may be aware that she is castrating her son in the same way that the Puer may be aware that his life isn't going as it should. Yet they can both be Unconscious of the myth they are living out.
