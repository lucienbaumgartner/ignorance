What did people of other faiths do wrong? Or women do wrong? It’s not that these groups have done things wrong, it’s just that the people in power, generally white, cis males, want to make it easier to retain power so people who share similar traits are more likely to gain access to those positions than other groups. This creates an inherent bias in all of societies systems that discriminate against those who are different than those in power. 

Online, it’s a different story. It’s not that the communities themselves are hateful, they attract people who are hateful. For instance, if I’m going to bully someone, will I bully the kid who is 50lbs heavier and 6”4’ or the kid who weighs 50lbs less and is 5”3’? It had to do with vulnerability, as well as the reactions they get. Gender identity, like this, is so incredible personal. Attacking it is a) an easy target that b) gets a massive reaction, exactly what the people who hate online want. They just want to make someone else’s day shitty, and they’re weak, pathetic, and unaware of their own vulnerabilities that they have to go after some of the most vulnerable people to feel strong. It’s also easier to be hateful online. You have, for the most part, complete anonymity, and it’s easy to forget you’re interacting with another human. A perfect storm for being as shitty as possible.

I’m sorry you’re scared, I really am. I get it. I’ve been out with makeup on once and I had enough stares and negative reactions that when I do go out now, I wear sunglasses to hide my face and identity. It takes time, and it will be slow, but by doing this more, this being us being who we are, we slowly break down those walls, we change what is acceptable. We pave the way for future generations to have it ever so slightly easier. And know that what you are is beautiful. Every act of us being ourselves is, in a small way, a protest against society, a changing of the mould, and that… that’s how things change.
