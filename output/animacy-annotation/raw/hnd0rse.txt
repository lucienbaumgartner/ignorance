You think cooks of all religions do this? On what basis? Why are all the ones being caught Muslims? 

Sanitation? Do illiterate people go around spitting in others food? Where have you heard this?

Do you think people in India are stupid and unaware that spitting at someone or something is a disrespectful act meant as an insult and defilement?

This person was paid money to serve food at an event. He was hired without discrimination or religious bigotry. But he spat in the food of those paying for clean food. Would you determine that he gave them what they paid for? Is tampering with someone's food and deliberately soiling someone's food legal? Why should he not be arrested?

This is not just something like a chaat guy using tap-water to make panj-puri water. That might just be a guy cutting corners and saving money... maybe someone unaware of why tap water might be unsafe for drinking. This is DELIBERATE, and completely unnecessary. This is not a mistake. 

They are already doing it covertly. Theh already know very well why it's wrong.

Now, let's have some honesty fron you... why are you so desperate to make excuses for this chap and the others like him? Why does it pain you so much that this guy is getting punished for his very deliberate and malicious actions?
