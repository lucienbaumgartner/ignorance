My takeaway

Centrist: Most wholesome, but usually ignorant and lacks desire to revolt when needed. Ideal wife, but a very unsafe husband, as he will do nothing when duty calls.
Libcenter: Practical jokers, really just post-leftism. Awesome people in general.
LibLeft: Based and bold. Real chads. Violence is often needed when the machine treads on us. Ideal husband, will keep his family safe from the greater evils.
All others: Evil. Proof that Ideologues who sell their souls to the state/corporations are the driving force behind all evil in this world. It isn’t the fault of anarchists for wanting these people dead, it’s the fault of the perverted leaders who give them reason to rebel.
