Amazing that I only had to read the title to know this would be a Facebook quality climate denying shitpost from someone who thinks science is an instantaneous thing. It takes zero effort to go find figures that state that it's a centuries long process. Asking if someone has seen their community end up underwater, when predictions are a 23 inch water level rise over 100 years, is so mindblowingly fucking stupid and ignorant that I'm disappointed I went out of my way to write a post to someone who is never going to change their mind.

The world going to hell isn't about the lifetime YOU'RE living, it's about the future people have given to their kids. Regardless of whether you want to plug your ears over OBVIOUS problems the world has, it's incredibly selfish and shortsighted to think humanity can keep living, consuming, and destroying the way that we do.
