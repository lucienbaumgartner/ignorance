Loco literally takes vods of Travis' show about roster moves and uses it's footage as a content for his own content, bragging how he will make 5 or 6 videos out of Travis' single episode and make a lot of money from it. Loco is so obnoxious and ignorant that Travis, when they were live, even joked that Loco will do exactly this. And then Loco proceeds to try and joke about how "salty Travis is".
