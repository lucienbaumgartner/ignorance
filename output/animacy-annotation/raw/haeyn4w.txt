Sorry for my late response, but I've just woke up.

Let's say for example, I make a general statement like: I don't think you should fight or resist cops when they arrest or stop you, and you say "you are insensitive and unaware of history between Black people and cops". My comment wasn't directed at black people in particular, but you strawman it that way just like Defranco's tweet wasn't directed at minorities. See how this comment was used to discredit my argument and how black people struggle was used indirectly to defend some crazies out there.

I don't think Defranco's tweet was virtue signaling. You may argue it is not helpful, but it's funny to me how we are quick to attack those who say "get the vaccine" when many lives have been lost to this virus and many maniacs just decide to not trust it when it got recently approved and studies shows it effectiveness. To me these people just decide to not trust it.
