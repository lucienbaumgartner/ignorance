Oh they deleted it... it was some really long comment about how farms are very dirty and smelly because animals deficate, and with that, farmers are very dirty and unaware of how bad farms smell because they live around it every day, and that their homes smell bad too because they work in this defacation-filled area, which means they MUST track it back into their homes every day after work... I have no idea about ANY of that. I just think cows are cute, but as someone who has driven between Southern and Northern California many times, I am quite aware that many cows in a large area is quite smelly. Doesn't mean I can't think they're cute though!
