I know what you mean, here in the states we still have quite a bit of fundamentalism going on. I'm more sick of it than I am disappointed seeing as it's pretty hypocritical. Most of the people like that are so myopic, ignorantly unaware, and unappreciative of other cultures that they don't realize they themselves have been partaking of the same co-opting and adaption of other cultures and beliefs into all kinds of art forms as entertainment in their own culture and they think nothing of it. Like literally, no thinking.
