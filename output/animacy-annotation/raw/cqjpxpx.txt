Yeah, I think part of it is the sheer volume of sexual attention that women get. As a man, you'd probably be flattered by a woman brazenly hitting on you, even if you didn't really find her attractive. But imagine if that happened *all the time*. It would lose its appeal. Now, I was kind of an ugly duckling in school, so whenever people genuinely compliment my appearance today, it always surprises me and makes me happy, even if it's coming from someone I find unattractive. But if I was a Victoria's Secret model and got complimented all day, every day, I would probably get annoyed by people stopping me to hit on me when I'm just trying to run errands.

I think some of the guys who send those messages are genuinely socially awkward and unaware that what they're doing isn't helpful, but I think a lot of them also get off on acting like creeps, for whatever reason. The woman will respond negatively and tell them to stop, and they'll just continue escalating it. I think that's also why some guys yell obscene comments to women on the street. They don't actually expect to get laid because of it. I think unsolicited dick pics are the modern version of flashers in the park.

I was actually surprised at how many guys would be uncomfortable to get random sexual messages or pictures, though. I guess it does go both ways!
