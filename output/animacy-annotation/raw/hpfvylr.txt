Defund the police/ice are pathetically bad messaging. I mean stupid, unproductive and unhelpful to the cause AF. Yes I understand the impetus which is good, the messaging is toxic and deadly to progressives. Argue the point all you want woke people, you are painfully wrong and ignorant of human nature and you have become the problem. 

Ayanna Presley, an impressive new voice for Democrats squandered 100% of her credibility  when politely challenged by NPR on the messaging problem of “defund the police”, her answer was “Semantics aren’t important/it’s not about semantics”

Sit the fuck down Presley you just lost America and any support from me. It’s ALL about semantics you fool.
