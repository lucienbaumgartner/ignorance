“Fine people, on both sides.” 

Lmfao. You could probably make the same argument about an anti-vaxxer here but the reality is that if they’re not bad people, they’re so severely misinformed and ignorant that they support systems or regimes that lead to the death of others. It’s a difference without a distinction because you don’t want to be associated with either group.
