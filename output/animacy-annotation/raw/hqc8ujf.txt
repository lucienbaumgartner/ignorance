So then what’s stopping someone from claiming you as a rapist to your friends and family, and what reason would they have to deny it? 

And I’m not the type to pass doubt but I was literally in a thread just yesterday where a girl admitted she falsely accused someone of rape for fear of consequences from her parents for having sex with the guy. My point is, it’s ignorant and unfair to just take peoples word for it because do lie. Not everyone all the time, but some people do sometimes. Which is why we have a thing called due process.
