Attempting to legislate morality has never worked and always has other "unintended" consequences (I put unintended in parentheses because the mass incarceration rates for the urban poor and minorities for drug crimes was very much a desired outcome of the so called "war on drugs"). The negative outcomes of the criminalization of most narcotics such as the separation of families, the violent nature of black markets created by the demand for illegal drugs, the invasion of privacy and disregard for constitutional rights inherit in policing drug use, the generational mistrust and fear of police and the federal government and the complete disregard for any studies or evidence that is contradictory to the accepted view of drug use to name a few far outweigh any perceived benefits of the current laws. 

I would also like to address the OP's mistaken statement that "hard" drugs such as cocaine and heroin have no "legitimate" or medical use which is simply incorrect...cocaine is a schedule II drug meaning it has recognized medicinal value and is still used in certain circumstances by medical professionals to this day and while heroin itself is not used to treat pain many of the most effective and proscribed painkillers and anesthetics are opioids derived from the same plant as synthetic heroin. I point this out to show how the general public is very misinformed and unaware of the very complicated reality and history of the human consumption of narcotic substances.

Regardless as a topic of discussion within the classical liberal view the only thing that really matters is how the "war on drugs" and the criminalization of drug use effects the liberty and dignity of the individual and on this point the answer seems to me to be very clear...it is paternalistic and a violation of the basic human right to self ownership to dictate what substances a person may choose to put in their own bodies. This is a fundamental right that must be respected within any understanding of classical liberalism...anything less is antithetical to the sovereignty of the individual.
