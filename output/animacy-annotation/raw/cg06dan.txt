Dude, I respect your opinion and even agree with your sentiments, but that was pretty harsh. 

First of all, it's not like they are catatonic and unaware that they're alive.

Secondly, acting like a mentally disabled person isn't even human? Using the term "it" to refer to a human being, sarcastically putting the word special in quotes? 

I find that extremely ironic since you claim to be pro-life. Obviously not, lol.
