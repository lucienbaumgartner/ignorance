The only sure way to survive a mass would be, like some have said, don't be there in the first place. Most of us can't really live like that in reality, lets be honest. Second, I would agree with finding cover and concealment and just keep out of a shooter's attention. 

Other than all of this, YOU are ultimately responsible for your safety and the safety of your family (if this applies). You cant rely on police, who respond after the fact, or other bystanders/victims to do it for you. I would go as far to say, buy a firearm, learn to use it, get a carry permit and regularly practice. So if the day ever came, god forbid, that you were in a situation like that and there was no effective means to cover or get away, you can still actively defend yourself and your family. 

And note that the mass shootings are almost always targetting people who are unable to defend themselves. Unarmed, unaware and unprepared, in other words. Not that anyone could ever REALLY be prepared to be shot at while buying groceries, but you get my point.
