But I'm pretty sure Arthas was binding them to his will and effectively mind controlling all of them. Later when something happened that weakened him, can't remember what, his grip weakened and Sylvanas and some others broke free from his control. 

Sylvanas didn't want to be like Arthas so she didn't use any mind controlling things. She also thought undeath was a curse.

So that's why I dislike it. This of course isn't the first time undead that Sylvanas has risen has acted like this. I can't remember the details but in some battle Sylvanas raised a bunch of human soldiers that had just died and they immediately started attacking those they had fought beside. Now apparently this still wasn't mind control and they where just confused by suddenly being thrust into undeath without any warning and therefore struck out at anyone around them. Now this is a pretty iffy explanation but I can accept it, though not very happy about it. 

The problem is when the people that are undead start to show any form of reasoning, by monologuing, it kinda kills the whole "unaware and confused" argument. 

So that's the problem for me. Arthas was stated to mind control so actions make sense. Sylvanas is stated to not mind control and people just decide to join her and do a 180 in character just like that.

Sure, there are some characters which don't change their alignment when being undeaded, but there's no difference to how they where raised so it only points toward blizzard not really caring and doing whatever they feel like while ignoring characters and earlier established lore.
