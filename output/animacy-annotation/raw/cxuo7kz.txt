you sound ignorant, I am a new found member of the lower class, i went to college, interned, and got a job in my field and I'm hardly making it, sure I dont collect welfare or use EBT, but I dont think im what my parents would have considered middle class. I'd consider myself in the upper part of the lower tier and dont even get me started on my student debt.  An uneducated populace votes with their emotions, far easier to control than an informed, educated populace. Here on reddit we bombarded the front page with anti-TTP articles but since the MSM didnt share our opinion, they made no mention to the tv watching populace. The TTP passed without a blip on fox, cnn, or nbc. There were no protests because the intellectuals didnt have the backing of the blue collar types, who were uninformed and unaware that this bill exists and affects them. Its in the governments better interest to keep us poor and uninformed. Not rock bottom poor, that's the type of poor that causes us to revolt, but the barely scraping by poor that we are all becoming accustomed to and we just ho-hum hoping for things to get better.
