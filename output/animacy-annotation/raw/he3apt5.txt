Her pregnancy announcement and the way she did it was also extremely problematic. She told about ‘tips’ that got her pregnant like using oils which is extremely demeaning and ignorant of people struggling to conceive. And then went ahead and told that she got pregnant in the FIRST month she tried then how’s she qualified to give any tips when she hasn’t known even 1% of the struggle to conceive. Her post and ranting about all the amazing things she did to conceive was extremely triggering and insulting.
