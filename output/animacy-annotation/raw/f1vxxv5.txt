The Brothers requires years of reading until one gets even remotely close to fully understanding all the ideas, so I'd highly recommend reading it over and over again, especially Pro And Contra and The Russian Monk. 

That being said, I understand your actual question better now. The problem with finding so-called modern 'prophets' is that genius can only truly be recognised given enough time. The critics of Dosto's time ripped The Brothers apart, unaware and unable to comprehend its brilliance. There's a good chance the great thinkers of tomorrow are already among us, but they are too obscure and unknown, discoverable only by chance, if you ask me.

You could always try putting your own ideas and interpretations down, maybe you've got it in you to join their ranks one day. Writing ideas and thoughts down is also a great way to understand your own line of thought better and familiarise yourself with your personal world view.
