I say this not to be insensitive to those who actually struggle with financial and medical problems because I truly am sympathetic to them, but to compare the economic struggles of people to slavery is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of history. 

If you hate a specific minimum wage job, you can get a different one. Your manager can’t rape or whip you because you fucked up. Your manager can’t prevent you from learning to read, pray, or develop meaningful human connection beyond the field you’re beholden to. Your manager can’t sell your SO or your child to another slaveholder as punishment.

What you are describing are basic economic problems that have existed for the entirety of human existence. The discussion about whether or not something like that is ok in the context of a modern rich nation like the US is totally valid and a good one to have, but it is *absolutely not the same* as slavery and I think you lack a historical perspective of the horrors of slavery if you really think they’re equal.
