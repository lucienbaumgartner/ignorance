i can try. ngl i’ve been thinking about going inpatient again. i wouldn’t hurt to try ig. i was just talking to my mom about me wanting and having a plan to end it all. and she yelled at me :/ she knows how ignorant and inattentive i can get when i’m in this mindset. i continued to tell her how i feel and that i just don’t care anymore, and she started crying. and now i feel really guilty.
