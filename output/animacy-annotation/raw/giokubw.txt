No, but hailing technological/civilicatory progress as emancipatory is just as non-sensical and ignorant of history as outright rejecting civilization. There are plenty of critiques of technology, civilization and technological progress that don't make the fallacy of mindlessly turning to an industrialized hellscape. Bookchins social ecology (NOT his libertarian communalism!!), post-civ anarchist critiques or the social geography of Èlisée Reclus all can provide valid critiques of capitalist technology (which we absolutely have to abolish if we ever want to be truly free) and ecological devastation due to industrial production, without claiming that people have to revert to hunter-gatherer societies.

In my opinion what anarchism has to strive for is to resolve the rupture civilization has created between us and nature.
