After reading the Bill Ivey email to Podesta these stories that put different demographics against each other are far too obvious - at least in my opinion. 

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."

What you say is not hard to verify either. Take this story from National Propaganda Radio (NPR) - this is the same article on NPR:

July 7, 2016: A Minnesota police officer fatally shot a man in a car with a woman and a child, an official said, and authorities are looking into whether the aftermath was live-streamed in a widely shared Facebook video, which shows a woman in a vehicle with a man whose shirt appears to be soaked in blood telling the camera that "police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason."

...

The incident comes as police use of force, particularly against minorities, is back in the national spotlight after the video-recorded fatal shooting earlier this week of 37-year-old Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police. The U.S. Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation Wednesday into the shooting, which took place after Sterling, who was black, scuffled with two white police officers on the pavement outside a convenience store.

It's not so much about making white crime worse, it's about control. 

Edit: You can read many articles about these two shootings on almost any media website and see how they don't describe the Castile shooter (who was hispanic) but always identify the Sterling shooters as white.
