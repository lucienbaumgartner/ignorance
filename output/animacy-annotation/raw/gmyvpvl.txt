I think this is too simplistic.  The Soviet ideology was to achieve Communism through Socialism and dialectical materialism.  It would be achieved through education and planned transformation of the people and economy until they finally reached a high productivity and mostly scarcity free society of educated people pursuing science, culture, and arts.

Ask a former Soviet if they were Communist and they would laugh at you as , in that time, to claim Communism would have been arrogant and ignorant of the socialist work yet to be done to achieve it.  Communism was always the distant goal - Прекрасное Далёко.

It was a nice dream, just does not account for human nature.   And that is how many Soviets felt about it in the end.  Read or watch Bulgakov's *Heart of a Dog*. The 1988 Soviet film adaptation is very good.  Bulgakov annihilates the whole Soviet premise in this work.
