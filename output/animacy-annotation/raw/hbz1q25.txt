&gt;Like most 9/11 truthers, he has a quantity of sources, but that doesn't mean he's well-sourced. 

It sounds like you didn't even look at the links so how in the fuck would you know? What a chickenshit response.

&gt;"One bomb can't blow off the face of the building!" is the kind of armchair, smoothbrain "gotchas" that belies most conspiracy theories: people who are smart enough to spot anomalies, but too stupid/prideful/unhinged to admit that their initial feeling was incorrect or beyond their ability to understand.

That's a misquote for one thing and also leaves out the the other reports from many others that there were additional bombs in the building.  I found a [video montage](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=2130) of this so you can see for yourself, it's only a minute and a half.  [Here are witnesses that describes the blast sequence](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=3974).  Here is evidence from [seismographs showing 2 blasts](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4067).  We can also look at the damage done to [Sterling Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hall_bombing#/media/File:Sterling_Hall_bombing_after_explosion_1.jpg) with a 2,000 pound ammonium nitrate bomb which blew out the windows of the building but that's about it.  The OKC bomb was allegedly a 4,800 pound ammonium nitrate bomb and it [blew off the entire face of the building](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/oklahoma-city-bombing-20-years-later-key-questions-remain-unanswered).  When you compare the photographs, does that make sense to you?  In the [Sterling Hall case, many were hospitalized due to the poison gas](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4301), this did not happen in OKC.  A f[ormer director of Airforce armaments laboratory](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4373) who spent his career in bomb damage analysis, investigated the OKC bombing and found it couldn't have been done solely by a truck bomb.  Then there's allegations by a former FBI employee, Dr. Whitehurst, that [the FBI fabricated the evidence involved in the bombing](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4553).  And then the [armament laboratory at Eglin Airforce base conducted tests](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4646) to compare their data to what happened at OKC.  They tried to recreate the truck bomb.  Their weaker test structure suffered less damage from a more powerful bomb.

It's real simple, they could just release the confiscated video footage, but they won't.  Is it not suspicious to you that video footage in high profile cases is never released or goes missing?  Like the footage at the Pentagon, one of the most secure buildings in the entire World, we're told only those 2 crappy videos are all that's available despite there being about a hundred cameras on the Pentagon grounds according to Michael Moore?  Or the Epstein Suicide, oops, cameras weren't working.  Or take [this man's 10 minute story](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4984), whose brother was connected to the OKC bombing in a strange way.  He "committed suicide" in jail, but after badgering authorities to see the body, found that his brother had skull fractures, bruises on his arms and feet, his throat was slit and had markings of strangulation.  Again, video cameras malfunctioned, and the prison logs went missing.  Or how about the JFK assassination, in which the film famously known as the Zapruder film was bought and stored in a safe by Henry Luce of Life magazine and not shown to the public.  We were told for years that JFK's head jerked forward from the impact of the shot.  The film was released due to subpoena in Jim Garrison's case in New Orleans.  That is the only reason we were ever allowed to see it.  And it's only at that point that we realized JFK's head in fact went back and to the left.

If you tell me this is all just coincidence and there is nothing they are hiding, I would call you gullible, naive and ignorant.  Of course I don't have high expectations for you, as you and everybody like you looks at the headlines of whatever mainstream new source you use and decide what they should think for the day.  You put in minimal effort for serious issues so you can feign empathy as if you actually give a shit.

&gt;Debunking each and every source takes time that most people don't have, and failure to address even one draws claims of "Aha! You dodged Exhibit #47!"

Great excuse.  Why don't you just curl up in the fetal position and call for your mommy next time.
