If amazes me how many lawmakers are utterly incompetent and ignorant of basic elements of law (and other things that everyone should know). This doesn't take place only on one side of the aisle- Democrats love talking about things they don't understand (gun laws being the biggest) but it does seem like the right has decided to be proud of ignorance in a way I would not have expected in the days before Sarah Palin. We've come a long way from Nixon's brand of republicanism.
