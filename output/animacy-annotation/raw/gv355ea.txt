Absolutely. Finasteride should always be tried first. I hope I had tried (at least the topical version) even before my transplant because I was a diffused thinner. I was so scared and ignorant of this drug.  


As for side effects, I lost my orgasm quality to maybe 10-15% of initial and did not feel any pleasure from them. Maybe my body was adjusting to everything but I'm very conscious about my health and it did scare me. I am going to try the topical finasteride now because it sounds less intrusive (at least in my head)
