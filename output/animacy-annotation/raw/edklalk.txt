&gt; If I don't partake in the system I either get arrested for dissenting against it or I simply die.

No one will arrest you for not taking part in capitalism. You have it confused it for something else. 

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract The social contract is obviously not a physical document, you agree to it in order to live under this government in this country and indeed any modern somewhat developed society.

I agreed to nothing. I don't get a choice. How you cannot see the irony in calling this a contract while stating capitalism is a mandatory system is bewildering. 

&gt;You pay taxes and rightfully contribute to the society and greater good or you get the fuck out.

"The greater good" LOL like bombing little kids in the Middle East? Get over yourself. There is no where for me to go, and it is incredibly arrogant and ignorant that you would say "get out". A broken system being mandatory doesn't mean I can't work towards fixing it. 

&gt;Lastly, your link is bullshit and falls back to the absolutely insane NAP which basically changes nothing

You're an idiot. Somalia had a government. It was horrible. They are better off now but they were broken by your holy statism. 

&gt;Somalia IS (right)libertarian whether you like it or not

It's not, no matter how many times you tell this lie. 

&gt;there are no laws and you can do whatever the fuck you want

Ignorant view of Libertarianism is not surprising, but it does not mean "no laws".

&gt;Even with the context of colonialism and regional powers, the fact remains that THAT is what your ideal society would be like.

Imagine being dumb enough to think America would look like Somalia if we got rid of the government. Their government sucked because it was made up of their shitty people. Their non-government society sucks because it's the same people.
