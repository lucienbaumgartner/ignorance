We’re all adults, and we get to decide what to do with our money. We don’t *need* you looking out for us. Just look out for you and keep your opinions to yourself, that way you don’t cause unnecessary pain to somebody who is already grieving and struggling. 

Those of us offering to help would rather lose $20 to a scammer than potentially ignore a 13 year old girl, grieving for her father, and dreaming of fresh fruit for her birthday instead of a GD pony, like she should be. 

Don’t worry about us, worry about yourself. Perhaps some introspection will help you understand what happened to you in your life to make you so jaded and cynical that you think it’s ok to make snap judgements on strangers, to belittle, demean and insult others who’ve shown no cause to be doubted. Not to mention, you are insulting everyone who offered to help by implying we are all so stupid and ignorant that we are easily scammed. We don’t need you to tell us what to do with our money or who to give it to. It has nothing to do with you. Move along, please.
