I am sure that black people you know have anecdotes of individual instances of racism. No one is saying that racism does not occur, and no one is saying that black people face more racism than white people. That would be idiotic and ignorant of statistics. But to say that systemic racism exists is idiotic and ignorant of statistics and law. The United States is the free-est county in the world and bars discrimination. If you can point to a single law that is discriminatory, we can have a conversation. However, you canâ€™t, because that law would be illegal.

It is what we are talking about here. The laws in the United States dictate how the systems are built and regulated. They are one in the same.
