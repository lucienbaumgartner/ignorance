I don’t know if you would consider it manic episodes but when I get like this it almost always leads me into feeling this weird life high where I’m impulsive and unaware of consequences and I do shit like cut my own hair and dye it or I give myself piercings that usually get infected but idk I think that’s just me using my body as an outlets for my feelings and modifying what I look like. And I start feeling this way normally when I’m alone and it used to be daily my emotions would switch around but I haven’t felt like this in 7 months and it’s starting again and I don’t know if I can handle it being a constant thing. I wish I could go to therapy but I can’t afford it and I can’t afford medicine. I’m just tired of living like this.
