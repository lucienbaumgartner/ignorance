&gt;Imagine thinking critical race theory is valid academically. 

Imagine being so stupid and ignorant that you leave a comment that's so easily open to refutation. 

**Hiring Discrimination:**

* [Modern Racism and Modern Discrimination: The Effects of Race, Racial Attitudes, and Context on Simulated Hiring Decisions.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167283094004) [John B. McConahay](https://journals.sagepub.com/action/doSearch?target=default&amp;ContribAuthorStored=McConahay%2C+John+B) 1983.

[Summary](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs): Implicit bias leads to white people being hired over black people even when their resumes are identical. Just having a black sounding name reduces your callback chances by 50%.

Dumbing it down: Being white makes it easier to get a job, regardless of qualifications.

**Sentencing Discrimination:**

* [Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Sentences.](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2413&amp;context=articles) Sonja B. Starr, M. Marit Rehavi, 2014.
* [Demographic Differences in Sentencing: An Update to the 2012 Booker Report.](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf) United States Sentencing Commission, 2017
* [Judicial Politics and Sentencing Decisions.](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cyang/files/cohen_yang_march2018.pdf?m=1525793200) Alma Cohen, Crystal S. Yang, 2018

[Summary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.06f30983faa6): Black people are sentenced longer for the same crimes as white people, accounting for nearly identical criminal backgrounds. GOP appointed judges are the worst for this, but all judges do it on average.

Dumbing it down: Born white? Do less time for the same crimes.

**Redlining and Housing Discrimination:**

* [Cartographic Editorial—Mapping the Racial/Ethnic Topography of Subprime Inequality in Urban America](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2747/0272-3638.31.4.425?journalCode=rurb20). Joe T. Darden, Elvin Wyly, 2013
* [HUD settlement for discrimination against Black and Latino families from 2000-2018.](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/EXECASSBANKCONAGRMNT.PDF)

[Summary](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america): Federally mandated discriminatory lending practices are directly responsible for the creation of poor urban black communities, the historic lack of black home ownership (with generational wealth being the most important form of transferable wealth), and easier home purchasing for white people. Some of these practices still continue to this day, despite being outlawed.

Dumbing it down: White parents owned a house? Federally mandated racism got them that loan, and you are absolutely benefiting from it.

**Law Enforcement Discrimination and Use of Force:**

* [Police are more likely to kill unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)
* [Police over-stop black Americans when compared to white Americans and subject them to searches, handcuffs, and arrests even when factors were controlled for.](https://stanford.app.box.com/v/Data-for-Change)

[Summary](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/12/cover-policing): " There's evidence of racial disparities at many levels of law enforcement, from traffic stops to drug-related arrests to use of force. But the roots of those disparities aren't always clear. Experts point to systemic problems as well as the implicit (largely unconscious) biases mentioned in the debate. To be sure, those biases aren't unique to police. But in matters of criminal justice, implicit bias can have life-altering implications. "

Dumbing it down: Police and law enforcement racially discriminate against black people which contributes to single parent households and other socioeconomic disadvantages.

And here is a study about CRT in academia specifically:

[" Today, CRT is utilized within different fields and draws from several disciplines, including civil rights, ethnic studies, and critical legal studies, to examine and transform the relationship among race, racism, and power.6 Some of the basic themes of CRT include the re-examination of history through the eyes and voices of People of Color and interest convergence, or the belief that racial reform only served to promote whites’ self-interest.7  It is characterized by several subdisciplines, including Latina/o Critical Race Theory (LatCrit), which employs CRT to examine the particular ways multiple forms of oppression intersect to shape the experiences of Latinas/os in the U.S."](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&amp;context=sjsj)

&gt; You're so desperate to present yourself as smart it's cringe inducing. Brainwashed beyond help. 

You don't seem to be concerned with presenting yourself as "smart" at all. As a matter of fact, you're desperate to cling to your ignorance that you intentionally ignore academic research and peer reviewed studies in a gross display of willful stupidity.  

So you're the one clearly projecting when you talk about being "brainwahsed" and "beyond help." I'm responsive to data and facts, while you're clearly not.
