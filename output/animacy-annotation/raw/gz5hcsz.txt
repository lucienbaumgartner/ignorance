I sincerely thank you for your civil and thoughtful response!

I think however, that there’s clearly a cognitive dissonance here:

&gt; using an anglo-american loan word (n-word)

&gt; claiming that “our language” shouldn’t follow any “american trends” in choosing whatever words we use

Picking and choosing, huh? 

Once again, I am almost completely oblivious and ignorant of the estonian language and its specific nuances. It is simply important to note that our european cultures are predominantly not black and brown, and therefore we are not some “neutral party” to the global discourse on racism, irregardless of our subjective (non-)colonial histories.

“Colour blindness” doesn’t take us very far in understanding the contemporary european/finnish/estonian/russian ethnic tensions. For me it is clear that our world seems to *think* we are racially divided, although there’s no biological/rational basis for racism. That for me is enough reason to consider our “global culture” as racist, or at least racially divisive. Just look at the current world, and tell me if it is a “race neutral” one in your opinion. 

I am simply trying to state the obvious from what I see in my homeland; I have not studied the racial discourses in the US, for example (any more than the next person).
