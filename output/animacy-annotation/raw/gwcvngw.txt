Honestly I'm compelled to join the future witch hunts, I personally have plenty of decent reasons why I would feed into that when shit hits south.

However securing myself along with family and friends is first priority, then all I need to let myself loose is one good reason and that will likely be given during the chaos, or who knows, maybe my hormones will take control and toss reason away like society tossed itself.

I honestly don't know how I would act if society collapses, prob revert to primal instincts for a while and experience what it's like being an animal for a real frame of reference, if it doesn't kill me then quite quickly I'll learn how to act in the new world and I can revert back to having manners once I know what's up.

The ability to adapt is the key to learning and power over oneself.

There's probably better ways to go about it, but I'm young and ignorant of those better methods for adaption. Learn along the way is what I say!
