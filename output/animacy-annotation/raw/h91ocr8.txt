Pretty bold of you to assume I'm ignorant and unaware of the functions of power in my country. Not wanting to be up to date on everything happening in the world is perfectly healthy. There's too much negative shit to worry about. I make a comment saying my friend's husband was deployed and that I think he was being sent to help could've just been met with, "Actually, they're being sent to evacuate".   

Instead I'm told I'm ignorant and blissfully unaware of the state of the world.  

I'm well aware of the state of the world but choose not to dwell on it every day as I'd rather live a life with as much peace and happiness I can create than one of anger, fear and nihilism.

EDIT: I see you used words like populace and rabble so I don't think it was a comment on me particularly but I'll leave this up regardless
