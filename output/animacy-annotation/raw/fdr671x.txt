You’re coming off as condescending here OP....honestly, no mention of actual work done on your marriage but you’re already patting yourself on the back for your plans to leave with as little guilt as possible? Maybe your sons will “want” to live with you, if not you’re ok you just want to see them?? Any idea how juvenile and ignorant that sounds? You’re going to ask your **3** and **6** year olds if they want to live without or daddy? 

Oh, and you’ll what, just make major financial decisions for your wife? Jesus OP come on. 

See a lawyer if you won’t see a counselor and keep it fair. 

Something tells me you do not want us to know what started this falling out.
