Dual-hodler here (xxxx movies, x games, working towards xx before MOASS)

I believe another theory. I think that there's a very targeted effort to try and divide the apes and make them chaotic and emotional, thinking other stocks are a threat in some way.

With this, some bs "news" org put out a non-sourced article and some bs "influencer" spread it like wildfire.  He either did it cuz he got too excited and didn't research it (ignorant and unprofessional), or he's a paid shill.  Neither is a good look, but he's always been problematic and I've never been a fan.

I've researched both stocks, and I'm confident both will squeeze.  I'm currently of the opinion GME will squeeze more and have more staying power post-squeeze.  However, movies are how I first got into this.  And selling any stock only helps the SHFs cover and keep them alive.  I'm holding to make sure everyone gets paid.  My personal strategy is to only buy GME going forward, but I'm not gonna diss anyone else for their conclusions.

The fake news was bs, but it looked like an obvious ploy to create more chaos amongst apes.  Ignore the noise, you know what you hold.  No matter what, MOASS will happen, even if other people are buying and holding other stocks.  Multiple stocks will squeeze.  It's inevitable at this point, the mountains of DD just prove it.
