It is not good to uphold enemies of the Union and the defenders of slavery on literal pedestals.

This is why Germany tore down all Nazi iconography. For some reason, people still remember Hitler and that dark time in history despite not having statues in their face every day.

If you want reminders of dark times in history, books are things that exist, and so are museums. 

We don't need to put white supremacists on pedestals in 2017 to remember that they exist.

You're deliberately ignoring why these statues were erected and what purpose they intended to serve - to uphold white supremacy during the Jim Crow era. Context matters. For someone who claims to love history, you are surprisingly unaware and dismissive of historical context and historical meaning.
