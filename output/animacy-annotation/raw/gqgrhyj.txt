Lol okay lucky shamrocks. You literally speak exactly how you claim I am speaking. You say the irony is I don't see my own behavior but this is literally exactly what you're doing. Lol. 

And my generalizations are absolutely correct. You, like everyone else for the last five years, are INCAPABLE of explaining legitimate reasons for your irrational and pathological hatred of the man. All you guys cry about is words words words but can't ever seem to understand the world doesn't run on words but instead on laws and policies from economic to foreign to trade to military. The world is not run on words. You and people like you are offended by th guys words. 

You don't owe me anything, this is accurate. However, when for five years I've had to live in America and listen to all the cry babies of the country complain about trump, only one time in 5 years and after asking literally hundreds of people, did anyone EVER explain real things they hate about trump. Only one person ever could profess their hatred with valid facts to back it up. They actually explained the policy they disagreed with and it wasn't the bullshit mainstream nonsense. They were valid points.

One person in hundreds. Do You  know why it's so rare? It's cuz your hatred is pathological and not based on reality or facts, therefore you LITERALLY cannot price your own point because you literally don't know what you're talking about. 

I don't get butthurt at trump hate. I despise the hypocrisy. Trump is a bad dude and I can list REAL reasons why. I have no problem doing so either as I didn't vote for him either of the times he ran. But you still won't be able to tell me any policy. It's evident in your blatant cop out of "I don't owe you anything". Talk about reasonable discussion but then still can't be reasonable and discuss. You're like all of them, once again I'll say it, STUPID and IGNORANT of the truth.
