&gt;I'd call the texts insensitive (blaming the parents) but I didn't read them as racist.

Why did he blame the parents? He said the lens he looked through was as a parent reacting from that place. The more likely answer is that his mind went there because they're black.

Regardless of whether this is unconscious, it's still racist and it's the type of racism that is gonna take the longest to go away.

It's part of the micro-aggression stuff, a lot of the time being unaware and ignorant, bit harmful none the less.
