When her friend's husband was arrested for trying to have sex with a 14 year old people took screenshots of his IG and posted here. He had a lot of anti-immigrant, all lives matter, pro-trump posts. And guess who had liked a lot of his posts? Chelsea's bestie, Chelsey Grace. Fuck these people, honestly. When the entire nation was talking about George Floyd, Chelsea was posting about a gold blazer like the tone deaf nitwit she is. I can't get behind someone so obtuse and unaware of the world around her. 

There are a couple users all up and down this thread talking about the handful of over-the-top people who compared Cole to a serial killer. In my opinion they're doing that to deflect from some or the real issues with Chelsea and her fam. Idgaf about those people's comments about Cole. Ignore them and move on. I DO care that that the Deboers seem very comfortable hanging around people with fucked up racist beliefs. That says a lot about them. 

There was also a user here who said it was confirmed on TitTok that the Deboers voted for Biden. I'm pretty sure they aren't even registered to vote. It's laughable to me that someone would make that up because they want to defend Chelsea and her views so bad.
