Yeah, I don’t know why but I swear in Canada a lot of docs have some weird idea that ADHD is only a childhood affliction that a lot of people just “grow out of.” My hypothesis is that that false (and frustratingly  ignorant) belief, plus the potential for abuse/demand on the black market (and the fact that there’s no shortage of stories about  patients who turn around and sell the pills from their scripts to students on high school and university campuses) makes a lot of doctors hesitant to prescribe for an adult whose history they don’t know. Especially those doctors at walk-in clinics in urban centres, perhaps due to the higher frequency of addicts they treat on a weekly basis, who knows..

Regardless  the system is obviously not working as it should if  a legitimate and verifiable need isn’t being met. And then if even a fraction of those undiagnosed and unmedicated patients turn to  sketchy street deajlers, as I have had to do before, those same docs are creating more market opportunities for organized crime, as well as exposing their patients to a completely unnecessary  amount of risk and trouble. I think it’s effin’ irresponsible, ignorant and selfish that they unwittingly promote risky and criminal behaviour among a demographic that is just seeking to treat a legitimate diagnosis, and in the context of an opioid overdose epidemic to boot?!

 I’ve only ever been able to see docs at effin’ walk-in clinics for the last 10 years of my life in BC because if you don’t already have A family GP  in greater Victoria, Saanich or the lower mainland, well… toughluck for you, you’ll have to figure out your own solutions… *sigh*
