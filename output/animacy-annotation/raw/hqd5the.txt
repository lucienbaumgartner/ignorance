Lol! To me, being accurate means more than feeling supported. It’s worse to be ignorant and happy than right and miserable.

But here comes my confusion: do I simply *value* accuracy as a key component in my *value* system? Or do I really believe it’s more important analyzing and understanding, then re-wire my logical framework? As I type this I strongly see the latter in me.

Plus after doing some introspection lately, I notice although I suck at both Te and Fe, my biggest freakouts has to do whether people like me, am I loved, etc - all that Fe mess I can’t properly grasp, rather than Te execution. As for Te, I can pull my ass together and get things done, then procrastinate, then execute again - a bit sporadic.
