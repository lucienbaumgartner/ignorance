It's well documented about the healthcare provider burn out and nurses leaving healthcare, but I will say that most of us have gotten to a point where a significant portion no longer care about other people. People dying ends up meaning nothing to us and some I've talked to are even glad about people dying who don't do the simple things that most of us who give a shit about other people will do in this societal contract.

People are so selfish and ignorant that... Well..... Fuck 'em.
