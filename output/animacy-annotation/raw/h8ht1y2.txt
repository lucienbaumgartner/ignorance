To be fair, there were good ideas. I'm pretty sure most of these ideas were there to pave the way to what Xbox is about now: Gamepass.

The thing it was too bold, radical, arrogant and ignorant of what people wanted. Also it was so badly advertised that they didn't talked about the "good part". There obviously was some kind of family share and everything.


Still an abysmal concept, good ideas at the core I think but way too many compromises.

Between this, Wii U and Vita, early 2010's really were the dark era of video games I feel.
