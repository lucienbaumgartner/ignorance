Just to be clear, the DoDI is the Bible in these matters and is the regulation that everyone from the surgeon general down uses to determine tour qualification status.

&gt; Threatening me violence

If you told me you intended on walking into a frat house on Saturday night and dropping the nastiest shit-talk ever, and I told you that you're gonna get you you face beat in...  is that me threatening violence, or trying to open your eyes to reality because I've been around the block and seen a thing or two?  That's what's happening here whether you choose to believe it or not.

&gt; I asked a specific question and it was immiditaly ignored. 

Bullshit.  You got asked for bog standard clarification of your details, something absolutely needed to properly answer you, and you turned smart-ass like you have any idea how this works.  This is evidenced when you say people don't get prescriptions without diagnosis.  The truth is it happens all the time, you're just to young and ignorant of the world to know it.  Same with being told the correct things by authoritative sources and multiple times you stated you don't believe them.  You're asking people who've been doing this since you wore Spiderman undies and when you don't like the answers you simply decide you know better.  You're not 12 anymore...

&gt; they already decided who the villan was. 

Sorry but, just no.  **You** decided that when you turned smart-ass when asked for clarification, and then proceeded to repeatedly tell experts in the field that you simply won't believe them.

&gt; now you are here telling me how Im going to get my teeth punched in.

That's because with what you've shown here this is a distinct possibility as you enter the adult world.  Either figuratively *or* literally, depending on how much you act this way in person.  I've watched kids*(if you can still join the AF, you're a kid comparatively)* learn hard lessons about social interaction a couple times, but if you don't believe me that's ok - you'll learn.  

More than that, this is the internet - you don't make the rules and if you can't handle people on the internet not jumping when you snap your fingers, you **really** don't belong in the military cause you'll have a baaad time.


&gt; sensative ... slightest bruise

You really think that the 74th dumbass kid to say stupid uninformed things here *just this week* actually bruises anyone's ego?  You're not the main character and you aren't that important to anyone here.

You got asked good and necessary questions and you good and accurate responses.  You may be ignorant of this, but your little situation/questions is one of the most basic common types of things posted here.  You've assumed that what you think you know about how things work is equivalent to the reality, that's simply not the case.  I'd recommend learning that you don't know better than most people who do things for a living quickly, AF or not, life is gonna be difficult otherwise.

Go take care of yourself medically, grow up a little, and figure out what else you want to do with your life.
