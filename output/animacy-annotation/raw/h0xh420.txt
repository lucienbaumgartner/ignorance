Sorry, I know what you mean and my initial comment was just poorly worded, I just think this is a difference in the wording we use and not a difference in belief. 

Sexual maturity isn't something found in a single moment, children don't fully understand what sex means even when they're first made aware of it so while they can explore it naturally at their own pace, and as they get older might want it, they might also not be ready and still be learning. Delibrate attempts to be provocative are normal during this process but are more attempts at self exploration in a hopefully safe enviroment rather than genuinely asking for a full sexual relationship. Nothing wrong with peers at this age exploring together, but there is something wrong with an adult with full sexual maturity seeing this and taking advantage of this exploration. 

Still, I don't think even intentional sexual mimicry implies a full understanding of what that entails, it's a learning process y'know? A young teenager may know that they're wearing clothes that people may find attractive, and that finding somebody attractive may mean they want to have sex with them, and even the physical process involved with that, and they may intentionally wear it because of that but that doesn't give them a full understanding of what all of that means, to them or in general, which is only discovered as they grow more mature at their own pace.

I'm not trying to suggest all children are completely ignorant and unaware of sexuality and have no understanding of it, I think that myth is harmful, I just think children need to develop in a safe environment where they have room to explore free of adults treating that as an.. invitation, or declaration of consent.
