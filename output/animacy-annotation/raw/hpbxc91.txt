Then you've not looked enough or are just ignorant and islamophobic, which is par for the course really. There are literally channels on YouTube which all they do is make fun of Islam and they're threatened by nincompoops, so atleast that's consistent. 






There are televangelists, or whatever you call them, who do that on the regular too and then there are our politicians who are even more vocal about the practices followed by Islam but obviously you're blind to all this because it doesn't fit your agenda. Check out some of Russell Peters sketches on Arabs or Middle-East or Islam. Needlessly being ignorant like you're getting paid for it.
