You seem to have trouble reading since I said neither of those things. I was asking what those echo chambers would look like exactly, not saying that they don't exist at all. Also the fact that educated people tend to be Democrats rather than Republicans doesn't in any way say "echo chambers are good", it says Republicans are usually ignorant and uneducated. I have the feeling your last comment would fit nicely on r/SelfAwarewolves now that I think about it.
