yeah it's crazy, i was so absent and unaware of life. i was just concerned with getting spun all the time. when i see photos i think back to how i felt back then and i try to re create my thought processes, what did i do all day etc. i go through snapchat memories of when my family was falling apart and i was just getting high and thinking life is a joke not caring about my family at all.
