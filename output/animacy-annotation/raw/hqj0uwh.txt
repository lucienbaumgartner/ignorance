&gt;Like you, I also had a crisis of faith/atheist phase. 

Yeah you're a total ass. Get your head out of it, seriously. You have no idea what I've experienced. 

&gt;Uncomfortable questions? Like what? Why God allows suffering? Itâ€™s because mankind is fallen from the Garden. God has left us to our own devices since we chose sin. 

God CREATED sin in the first place then CREATED the devil to tempt man to fall in the first place. I know virtually all of the old testimate is God scape goating his failures onto his creations, then brutally mass murdering them to save one old drunk who curses his own children when they catch him passed out drunk naked. It's INSANE. You can't honestly justify it, I tried to for so long and I can't. I couldn't lie to myself anymore.

&gt;However, out of love, He gave us Jesus as a way back to Him. 

Out of love he sacrificed himself to himself to get through a loop hole in a broken system that HE created and won't fix and if you don't sacrifice everything about yourself right down to your every individual thought he will send you to a hell where your flesh will burn for all of eternity and you will continually experience the maximum possible anguish he can inflict on you. What a loving guy...

&gt;There are no earthly solutions for spiritual problems

In other words, "dont go to therapy! Throw away your medication and never go to hospitals! All you need is Jesus!". You know there are so many cases of religious parents refusing to get their children help for religious reasons, only for the child to die? That attitude is extremely dangerous, and you can play up this "I don't hate you, I feel nothing but pity for your poor tortured soul", it won't stop me from telling you that your attitude is ignorant and dangerous to others. 

Now go tell your church how persecuted you are.
