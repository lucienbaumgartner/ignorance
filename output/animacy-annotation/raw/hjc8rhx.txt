Here's my two cents:

If it was Jacob there's two options. Either he did it consciously or he did it unconsciously, in the way that he could've been under the influence of a prescription medication like Ambien (like one Reddit user commented below the post). Ambien apparently has a lot of side-effects, sometimes causing the user to do activities while sleeping. This post is a very interesting read discussing "Ambien Zombies" that airlines have to deal with: [https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/planes-sleeping-pills/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/planes-sleeping-pills/index.html)  


If it wasn't Jacob, the OP must've been lying and fabricated the story for whatever reason. I think that's possible but unlikely. OP has been an active redditor for a long time and still actively participates in a multitude of pages. There's no record of OP being a known troll. OP also posted a screen recording of a supposed conversation she had with a friend in 2018 right after the plane landed, in which she identified Jacob. Reportedly they also saw Jacob's name on his boarding pass.

I've also messaged OP about the situation. According to them, Jacob was laid stretched out across 3 chairs trying to sleep for the most of the flight. This makes sense if you look at the dates, since he had flown around quite a bit of the world, and was now on another plane on his way to LA. The idea of him taking something like Ambien, being uninhibited and unaware and doing something like this is very possible.

To end off, I don't think Jacob is the type of person to actively/consciously do this. Of course we don't know him through and through, but from what most of us have seen he's usually a very kind, supportive and upbeat soul. 

TL;DR: If Jacob, he might've been under the influence of a drug. If not Jacob OP could be lying but it's unlikely.
