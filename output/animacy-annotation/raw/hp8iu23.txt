I'm afraid to tell you this but unfortunately this is a bad argument. To say an opinion is a mental illness is just so ignorant and inaccurate, and thus probably stigmatizing, and thus ableist. Associating disabled people with certain negative opinions? Yeah fuck that. Disabled people does NOT equal feminists or liberals or sjws or nazis or any of that nonsense. Anyone can be an insufferable asshole. What next? Are we going to associate people of color with left-wing opinions?
