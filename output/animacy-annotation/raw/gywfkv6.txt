I'd imagine it as a process leading to you turning into a husk of your former self, still alive, but without purpose, free-will, or even a sense of self. The soul is what makes you *you*, so what are you without it? An undead-like being left in a catatonic state, only able to complete the most basic of tasks. Most end up mindlessly wandering the lands, mute and unaware of the world around them, shambling in search of something only they know of and yet cannot find no matter how hard they look.
