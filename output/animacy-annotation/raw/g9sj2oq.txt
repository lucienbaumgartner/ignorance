As usual, 3 steps forward and 43 steps back.

Honestly I was expecting bullshit like this to happen since they said Infinite would be a game as service, F2P and that it would last for the next 10 years.

343i is just so irreparably incompetent and unaware of what Halo is supposed to be and they really don't care about what the fants want, it seems they actively want to sabotage this franchise or something.

I wouldn't even call these "bad" decisions, this is some pre-planned shit, they really hate Halo and its fans don't they.

Way too many people have kept defending this joke of a company for years, I only hope they're waking the fuck up now.
