i donâ€™t think tolerant is the word to describe Thais. more like ignorant and mild amusement. katoeys are always being poked fun at and use as some clownish character in Thai drama. 

also thais are defined gender at birth so even if u do a full on sexual realignment you still need to do national service if born male while tomboys are exempted.
