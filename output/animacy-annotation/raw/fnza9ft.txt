People will not be sitting in a restaurant for a very long time.  Some will, but once this virus starts spreading again, attitudes will change.

I am stunned at the number of people standing in line at the grocery store without a mask.  Every day more is learned about COVID-19 and still, people are so selfish and ignorant that they do not wear a mask, talk in line, and talk to the cashier.
