Honestly the japanese version makes sense, people remember she is not a human, she is a friggin dragon a dragon who is not good a transforming into human. If you watched the series you will also know that those giant pieces of fat are her flame sacs and the reason why they are gigantic, once again lies in the reason she cannot transform very well. Sure the chinese version looks great but Ilulu's character revolves around the narrative that she is ignorant and clumsy with humans.
