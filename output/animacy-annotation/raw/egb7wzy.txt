“Patient experience team”? 

This is the sort of thing that patients need to hear about, that they’re being encouraged to act so fucking petty and ignorant that teams have been assembled to make them feel more like children being taken on a vacation, until they fucking die because their shitty attitude is literally putting their health and life at risk. And that the health care providers that they’re trusting their lives to are being forced to play along because some moronic CEOs would rather line their pockets by complying with ass backwards laws than allow their staff to fight those laws for the good of everybody.
