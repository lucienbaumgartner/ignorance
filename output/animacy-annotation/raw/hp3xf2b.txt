You mean the country that was utterly crushed and dealing with devastating economic issues was trying to give itself power again? No shit.

Other countries bordering them were either actively fighting them or already conquered. Your argument is vastly incompetent and ignorant of that situation. 

People did fight and were sympathetic, but couldn't just be all willy open and fucking singing about it without being iced by some SS troops.
