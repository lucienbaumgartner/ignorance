No we don’t. If you’re talking to Kim Jong Un and he says “North Korea is not totalitarian and anyone who says otherwise is attempting to trick the Korean people” you laugh him off because there is no way of changing his mind from that ridiculous worldview. It makes people seem childish and ignorant of how normal life is. America for the vast majority of people is not a dystopian corporatist hell. It’s a fairly average western democracy with some extra laissez faire economic policy thrown into the mix.
