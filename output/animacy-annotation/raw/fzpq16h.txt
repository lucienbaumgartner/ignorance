OP is so naive and ignorant that calling him names is the only way to convey my frustration with his post. Also I refuse to tippy toe around anybody, if I see an idiot I call him what he is, all this convoluted language doesn't benefit anybody. At the end the idiot won't know he is an idiot or that he is wrong/did something wrong and the one to point out mistakes won't even bother with it since he has so compress so much.
