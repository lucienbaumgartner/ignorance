It's not as "waifu dating" as some people say, sure, but it's VERY tone-dead to what has happened in Inazuma so far. We just finished probably the darkest archon quest so far, along with several fucked up world quests, and after Baal repealed the Vision Hunt Decree, everything is suddenly sunshine and rainbows again. There is a few stuff related to the aftermath of the Decree, but it's very light-hearted and hand-waved. Dictatorship and a civil war is a very serious business. The recovery period can take years or decades, and the ramifications of these things shouldn't be treated lightly. But that's exactly what Baal's story quest does, treating these things very lightly. It's just very jarring after witnessing so much suffering that the people of Inazuma went through.

Second, would it hurt them if Baal at least saw how her people have suffered and actually felt regret and empathy? No, in fact, it would actually give her a proper redemption instead of the "look how cute and clueless I am! I'm not evil!" crap that the story quest brought. Baal was built up to be a great character and villain, but instead she was dumbed down into a clueless girl that's ready to abandon her *500 years ideal* because Yae and some traveler defeated her in a shounen-protag showdown and gave her an Inazuma tour. Making her change her mind is good, but it just feels so easy, non-serious, and ignorant of things that had happened.

Ayaka's story quest is good, it establishes the character well, except for the very obvious romantic subtext. Like, it's either you like it or not, but you can't deny it exists.
