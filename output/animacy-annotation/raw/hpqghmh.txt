I didn’t say your ignorant and sorry if it came across like that but some of the smartest people lack basic common sense! You see something one way, and I don’t know what hospital your working at isn’t any of my business either, but others see things a different way, you think your right because of numbers, data and science, etc, I think I’m right because I’ve not seen anyone kill over walking down street from Covid, or I’m not seeing ambulances everywhere picking up sick people dying from Covid so I’m my eyes this is not a pandemic and shouldn’t call for a mandate to force people to do anything, they put word out let people decide for them selves, but now if you work for a certain company ( as of now) if you don’t be vaccinated your getting fired because government wants to fine your company! My post was about people promoting hate against others who do not believe the same way, I’m not promoting hate against the vaccinated! But this lady and the show she’s on does it all the time, fueling the flames I hatred and causing a divide in this Country ! Let people do what they feel is best! We are not China or Soviet Union we are supposed to be Free to choose! Period science has been wrong before my friend so have scientists and Doctors!
