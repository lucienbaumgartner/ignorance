Same here. There was a Zen teacher, I forget who, who said something like; 

"You have to bring your practice into your ignorance. But to do that you have to almost allow yourself to be a little ignorant and be mindful of it". 

Because what we normally end up doing is we have periods where we are a perfect practitioner, fully invested in the practice. But then we slip out of that and into our habits, as will happen. But we have set up such a barrier between being "good and mindful" and being "bad and unaware" that when we go into our neuroses, we go completely and bring no awareness.    

The intermediate step here would be to begin to bring just a little bit of subtle mindfulness into our nuerotic states. Maybe you wont go meditate. But just bring in the slightest amount of awareness, and just allow yourself to be there in that nuerotic state. Often you'll almost resent this awareness. You are being nuerotic right now, and theres no place for mindfulness here! But work to disregard that, and just bring in the smallest hint of accepting awareness, and not squelch it out right away. 

This helped me out somewhat. Of course I don't always do it when I am acting out of whatever nuerotic state it may be. But sometimes I do, and it helps.
