In the case of pedophilia, I feel it's really because of the way modern society raises and represents their children. In modern culture it's taught that children and teens are so innocent and unaware that they can't even work or do anything really, without special conditions. But this is only true for half of them/us. I believe that if the children of the next generation were raised to be strong and and have the common sense of an adult like in previous generations before modern society, they would have the ability to consent. Then pedophilia wouldn't be a problem, because pedophilia would be a cultural norm as it was in the past. I mean, MAPs (A part of the LGBT+ community) exist for this very reason.
