is that really all you see is "taking pictures of guys in restrooms"? I hope you just lack awareness and you actually think this instead of deliberately posting something that, when taken out of context, would make people think OP was some kind of perv. While being unaware and somewhat dumb would suck imo, it's not nearly as bad as trying to portray one thing as another just to fit a narrative.
Whether you believe this or not, the OP is not simply taking a picture of a guy in a bathroom. The point of the photo is to emphasize how incredibly weird it is for someone to apparently shit while eating more than one donut. Is eating pastries while shitting weirder than randomly snapping photos of people in the bathroom? Probably not, and this seems to be what you want people think is happening. Is eating pastries while shitting weirder than taking one photo of one person eating pastries while shitting ONE time? To me, it is much much weirder.
