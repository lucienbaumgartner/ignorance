&gt; That group was the one that was attacked during the genocide. So reducing it to "black on black" is both reductive and ignorant of the historical context.

You're right. I am sorry. Black on Black is somewhat reductive. What I meant by that is that the actual actions on ground were not borne out of "that person is not my color/race" (even this is not technically correct but i hope you understand what i mean) but divisions far more deeper and with much more context and background.

I don't mean to excuse the racist ideology that gave rise to the conditions that resulted in the genocide.
