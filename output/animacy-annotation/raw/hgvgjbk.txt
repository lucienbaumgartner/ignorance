I think he spelled out what he saw as a hopeless scenario and just wanted to know if he was being selfish for wanting to leave. I never got the feeling he was seeking your advice, in any other regard. He has listed many things he tried doing, to save the marriage.

Maybe he just needs advice on how to go about a divorce. I could help him, there, as I've been in a marriage that was dead for years, while I tried to work on it (she was having an affair, the whole time). I went through rounds of therapy, tried to have "real talks", tried trips, little shows of affection, etc. In the end, I felt empty and knew I had to move on, but I had no idea how. Whelp, I figured it out and would to love to help this fellow get his life back on track, too.

Anyway, you are definitely trying to come off a certain way, but from my perspective, you seem obtuse, somewhat ignorant and unaware of a fellow human, who is suffering. I'm not indicting you, as a person, as I don't know you or your experience. I do find your comments to be off base, however.
