American's are both the biggest bullies on the world stage and the biggest victims within their own society.

This is what happens when you build movements entirely based around being the victim. By her sheer ignorance of the greater world around her this woman has decided to be offended by the name of a country.

This is why I keep saying to people that Donald Trump didn't greatly diminish the reputation of the United States on the world stage. That reputation has been absolute dogshit for my entire 40 years on this planet. American's are seen as sheltered, entitled and ignorant of literally everything outside of their borders and large portions of America itself.

When I was in high school our social studies courses definitely focused on our own countries history the most but every now and then our teachers would make an effort to teach us about the major events that happened all across the world or even just basic geography. My mother on the other hand who was raised on the East Coast of the US said that at no point does she remember ever even being taught anything that wasn't American-centric.

This young woman is a product of her environment and you can rip on her all you want but this isn't a "her" problem, it's uniquely "American" problem.
