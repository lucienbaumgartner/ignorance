Oh my god! I can’t believe she put her hands on you! I mean the entire story is just unbelievably unacceptable, ignorant and rude but I especially can’t believe she had the audacity to touch you!!!! I’m so terribly sorry you had that experience. 

Sadly, unless you caught it on camera, I don’t think the police could do anything. Every time I’m assaulted in public I always wish I’d remember to take out my phone and start recording. It can make a Karen’s mouth shut faster than a poked clam.
