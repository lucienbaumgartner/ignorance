Yes, these are kind of continuous with each other, they used to be part of the same construct, and psychoanalysts, e.g. Salman Akhtar, still see these two constructs in this way.

If you're interested in learning more about schizoid PD (and avoidant PD) I would suggest looking at the r/schizoid subreddit. The sub's wiki google doc has a couple of full text pieces in there that are quite good. They both go into detail explaining what I just said about the relationship between SzPD and AvPD, and a lot more than that.

One of these two pieces, which is a PhD thesis on analytic treatment of schizoid personality by Zachary Wheeler, you can find for free here, there's no paywall: https://search.proquest.com/openview/10cb591b9eb8147e5881ffc5bb279e66/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y

And, a shorter chapter that isn't on that google doc, but I feel is really good at explaining what it is like to be schizoid, for most people who are schizoid: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Psychoanalytic_Diagnosis_-_Nancy_McWilli.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjlvaOm87qAhUUbs0KHfWkA3MQFjANegQICBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vrBsRB7R6pwJpqie16g4-

I say most people who are schizoid because it's quite rare for people with a schizoid personality to be as withdrawn and reclusive, and unaware of their relational needs as the DSM diagnostic criteria make them seem to be.

It's chapter 9 in that pdf, for the stuff about schizoid personality. The intro sections of the book are also great as an introduction to the modern, ego psychology/object relations, integrative approach that has been gaining some traction in psychoanalytic circles in recent years.

This is the approach taken by one of the leading experts on personality disorder, Otto Kernberg, and is what informs the manualized PD treatment, Transference Focused Psychotherapy, that he and his colleagues at Cornell have conceived of based on about 4 decades of research. The Wheeler thesis is attempting to describe how to apply this approach to schizoid PD, so this is still being worked on (it was published in 2013).. as is the case elsewhere in psychotherapy research, schizoid and avoidant pathology is kind of neglected while BPD and NPD have gotten most of the research attention so far (probably because people who have these disorders come in for treatment more, and because their behaviour is more outwardly destructive. And in the case of borderline PD'd people they're more willing to admit they have problems and take steps to actually seek treatment).

Also, about the other piece in the sub's wiki google doc, the book the Ralph Klein chapters in that doc are from, you can find on libgen. The title is Disorders of the Self, edited by James Masterson and Ralph Klein. It's a collection of papers but the first 150 or so pages are all on SzPD and all written by Ralph Klein.

I hope this is helpful and not too overwhelming an answer in terms of the detail.
