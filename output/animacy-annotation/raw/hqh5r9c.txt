Governments get very authoritarian during wartime, that's just part of how war is conducted on the homefront. The Union government under Lincoln was surprisingly dictatorial, yet it often gets overlooked. I do not mean for this to be construed as support for these actions nor the Confederacy, but to say that the US is alone in the restriction of rights is an exceedingly ignorant and narrow-minded view of history.
