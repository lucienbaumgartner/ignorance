NYC is for everyone. You are thinking small. Somehow you think only one or two types of people live here. Everyone lives here. If people are to your distate, guess what, just turn one degree to your left and there's hundreds of other different folks lined up you can talk to. Your community, whether it's ethnic or hobby, is definitely here and if you need to be near a good community of people, it's a great reason to come live here. You can easily afford it so do it. The so called unwelcome vibe is scene folks being scene folks and not even trying to meet other people than the small cliques they are running in. Frankly that's just people being small minded and unaware of how crazy big this city truly is and all the *other* people, 99% of everyone else, lives here.      

Unfortunately it's colder here but it's nowhere near chicago cold so frankly I think you can easily bear it. Especially during the hot summers and reasonable springs and autumns.
