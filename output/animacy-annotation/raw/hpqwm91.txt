Yeah I am a long time cyclist and have adopted this rule out of self preservation. Drivers tend to be a mix of unaware and just plain assholes and either way doesn’t bode well. It sucks, because it SHOULD be their responsibility but apparently being responsible isn’t a prerequisite to getting a license.

I’ll never understand people on bikes who just blow through stop signs and red lights. It’s just asking for trouble.
