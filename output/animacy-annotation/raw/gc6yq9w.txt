You are in the AP/FA anxious avoidant trap and now you have learnt about attachment you feel you can learn things to change or save your girlfriend. It happens all the time on here. 

You say she is not self aware and unaware of attachment theory. If you bring it up she may feel you are saying there is something wrong with her and no one wants to hear that. 

You can love someone as much as you can but love is not enough it can not solve everything. This woman will make you understand your own attachment issues, your needs, triggers etc so you can hopefully learn and grow. As if you were secure you wouldn’t have lasted two years in this situation. It sounds harsh but if you read all the stories on here they never end up working out. Perhaps far down the line in the future when you have both changed if you are single but not now. It takes a long time to unlearn and process changes to become secure. She will need to want to work on herself when something finally clicks and the fear is less than the love for someone which will make something click. You don’t become secure over night or by watching a few videos on you tube. 

I of course am not trying to be harsh I have an FA ex. I was never AP before until we met and ended up in the anxious/avoidance trap at the end when trying to maintain a friendship afterwards but still really wanting her to open up and change when she was unable to be vulnerable and even went into denial in the end. It was a total mess and I never want to be like that again but I have learnt things about myself. 

You should not be your loved ones therapist. You can only change yourself. Good luck to you. I know it’s not what you want to hear!
