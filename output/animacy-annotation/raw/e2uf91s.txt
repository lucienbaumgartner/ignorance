I said that I respect the fact that you haven't had sex. You can assume anything you'd like, except many people get into relationships without sex being a part of it. Finally, the fact that you haven't been in a relationship simply makes you unaware and inexperienced in certain matters - it's like me asking to be hired as a Physician when I haven't even been to medical school. Not going to happen.
