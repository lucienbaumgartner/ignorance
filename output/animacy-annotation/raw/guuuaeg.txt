When I was 20 and living at home with my parents I thought I could live/travel in Southeast Asia for several months. I booked myself a ticket and thought I'd be fine because I was cocky and thought I was better than everyone because of strong "look at me!" energy. Everyone else was going to college and I was like Taylor, going on my \*\~own\~\* journey (altho I've never been in an MLM so there's that...).  
It was so fucking hard. I emailed my mom every single day. I was sooo insecure with myself  and felt so minimized by other travelers around me because of how much happier they were (probably because they were traveling for fun, not to fill a void or prove something, like I was doing.) It's very difficult to transplant yourself to another country when you're doing it for the wrong reasons &amp; when you're so miserable with yourself. I genuinely thought if I physically placed myself on the other side of the world, I would magically be happier. But my insecurities came with and were magnetized the moment I stepped out of the airplane. 

Taylor has so much inner work to do and I genuinely hope that she becomes even slightly aware of how unhappy she is. If she decides to move to MX, she will be in for the shock of her life but I hope she powers through it. I wanted to come back early from Asia but I also had so much pride that I stayed and I think those last few weeks are when I started to come around and really begin to see myself for who I really was. I do not have high hopes for her, because she seems so dense and unaware of her surroundings, but... you never know.
