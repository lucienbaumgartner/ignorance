Good luck with this, you will be trolled hell out of for this. People don't like to think for themselves. Much easier to be spoon fed everything  from the people profiting from it all. 
Despite the Wuhan lab being funded from everywhere to experiment with Respiratory virus. They had 100 of the exact bat we are told the virus came from, all infected with respiratory virus. Have a record of things leaking out the lab. 
Bats that are not native to the area. 
It's not a wild stretch to think it may have been leaked accidently or on purpose from this lab. Infact it's pretty stupid to not consider it considering the evidence. 
That's not even getting into the fact China was under a lot of pressure and under huge sanctions before covid. Covid has been excellent for China. Given they are an evil dictotorship of criminals in one of the least free countries on earth it's hardly the stretch these people make it out to be. In fact it's a stretch to think it's not likely or stupid like been suggested.  You have to be pretty stupid and unaware of the world to think it was not a possibility given what's surrounded it all.
