&gt;Also I am curious if Obann himself is even aware that it’s Tharizidun he is worshipping. I think he is probably unaware and honesty believes in the Angel of Irons. Possibly it’s the same with Vence.

Unless Matt's version of Tharizdun is wildly different from traditional lore, Tharizdun's release is *the absolute worse thing that could ever happen*.

He's an extraordinarily powerful god, completely insane, and if he were ever to have a moment of lucidity long enough to realize he's imprisoned, he would break his chains and destroy *everything*. Not just Exandria, everything- as in the entire multiverse. He would tear the gods back through the Divine Gate, rip them to shreds, and raze their planes. It took a massive coalition of gods, both Prime and Betrayer, to imprison Tharizdun in the first place (they couldn't manage to kill him). Since then they've grown weaker behind the Divine Gate, while Tharizdun has grown steadily madder while reshaping his own realm.
