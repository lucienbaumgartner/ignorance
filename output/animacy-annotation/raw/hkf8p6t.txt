it's not dramatic to be pissed that his mother left him at a gas station in the middle of the night it's not like she had so many people in the car that she just didn't notice you weren't there. there were only three people in the car both under age children it is her job to keep track of whether you and your brother are in the car with her especially when you are out of state and have a disability that makes it hard to communicate. you aren't being dramatic she is being unaware and dismissive about what she did wrong. she needs to apologize to you for leaving you.
