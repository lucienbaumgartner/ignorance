I'd agree that the overall conversation is idiotic.  

What people are describing as painful for the US is only a short-term readjustment to a new US-focused equilibrium and pales in comparison to the pain experienced over the past 30 years as industry left the country.  

The difference here is that we'll be adjusting to industry returning.

It took 30 years for the frog to wake up and realize the pot was boiling.  Now we get to listen to all the unaware and ignorant profess as to why getting out of the pot is a bad idea.  Could probably mix in the metaphor about crabs leaving a barrel.....
