I am sort of fascinated by the Beatles but as a cultural artefact and by their place in pop culture history. Like, whatever I personally think of them I can't deny their huge influence and the esteem they're held in and their place at the forefront of that particular era of pop culture. It would be very foolish and ignorant of me to discount how big they were.

At the same time, I do think there are other artists who shouldn't necessarily be praised more, but who I don't think get the recognition they deserve (although Neil isn't one, I think he's rated about right). They had a lot of contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic who made records as good and as innovative (and who innovated things the Beatles are now often credited with innovating) or who were equally individualistic and groundbreaking, but who never had the status of the Beatles and so remain in their shadow somewhat.

I think to a large extent (although by no means entirely or even mostly) the success and sustained popularity of the Beatles is due to the hype machine, they're a shining example of the power of marketing and packaging in pop music, and the power of "cool". Which I don't mean as a slight necessarily, but it is what it is.
