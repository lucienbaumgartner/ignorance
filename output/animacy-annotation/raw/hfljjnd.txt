Why don't you want her to babysit? Are there other behaviors from her that makes you distrust her?  


Calling your kid her baby is annoying, and she won't stop unless you tell her to. Just remember it's not a plot to steal your kid, it's probably just being overly excited and unaware of boundaries. I am not saying she's right in doing so and you should allow it (at all!), just that this behavior alone isn't proof she is the devil incarnated, nor should be enough to make you so mad that you don't let her babysit in my opinion.  


And an offer to babysit isn't outrageous nor an offense, it's nice, as long as she respects your answer. "We don't need anyone babysitting yet but if we need you, we will let you know" will work fine as an answer. If she  insists too much, you can either keep denying or be blunt, and tell her that you need to trust whoever stays with your kid to respect your wishes, and she isn't showing she will right now, which makes you wary and less inclined to saying yes.  


If you don't know if you can trust her or not, start small - let her take care of the baby while you make yourself a sandwich or work on something in the house to see how she acts. Having someone you can trust and that loves your baby giving you a few hours to yourself and your husband can be great, after your baby is old enough for it, of course.   


And, if she has showed other behavior that makes you not want to babysit at all, just "no, thank you" as an answer would be enough - you don't need to explain to her why, just repeat "we don't need it" and "no, thank you" over and over.
