No reply from rensole, and I do not nor should anyone simply trust his judgement on this or really any matter. He strikes me as persistently naive, underinformed, and unaware of his own blind spots. 

I saw in the OP's history that they submitted a screenshot of their old profile as proof of identity. I could figure out how to spoof this in about one day despite having never done it before. For a professional, which presumably an infiltrator would be, it'd probably take considerably less than an hour.
