**Of COURSE YTA.** Is there literally ANYTHING you've said here that WOULDN'T make you a complete AH?

Let's recap:

Your daughter is feeling lousy because she has her period. **Her stepmother does a couple of nice things for her because she's not feeling well, and** **you're trying to make her feel bad about it.** Then to make matters worse you try to negate her experiences completely because "every woman has a period". Guess what? Not all periods are equal. Some women have very light flow and no cramps at all, other women get incredibly ill and are in agony because of their periods. "Every woman has a period" is a meaningless statement designed entirely to negate your daughter's pain. 

**And then, as if you weren't awful enough, you try to COMPETE WITH HER OVER WHO HAS IT WORSE**. WTF? More than one person can hurt. It's not the Bad Period Olympics. Just because you have cramps doesn't mean that she doesn't, and you have NO reason to assume that yours are worse just because they're happening to you. And who gets so competitive with their own child anyway? Do you understand that you're supposed to be her parent and support system, not her enemy? 

**You come across as petty, childish, bitter, and ignorant. And more than a little hateful towards your own child. It's no wonder she's so appreciative of her stepmother. Anyone would be, with a mother like you. YTA.**
