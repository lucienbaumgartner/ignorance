My wife is 5 months pregnant and there are a few things that caught me way off guard...#1. Extreme sickness- For the first 12 weeks, she was very sick and nauseous. Throwing up 5/10 times daily was normal for her. I had no Idea that some women (her) go through that.
#2. CONSTANT PEEING- I knew pregnancy made women pee more, but MAN. She is heading to the restroom every 15 to 30min (a bit less at night) to pee which seems like an outrageous amount 
#3. Feminine smells- These odors have become pungent and noticeable since about 3 months in. I guess it's to be expected, but I had NO IDEA. 
#4. Increase in libido- This one is pretty serious. She now has the sex drive of about three 16 year old boys . Not complaining, just unexpected and unaware that things would ramp up in that department. 
Sorry so long, lol
