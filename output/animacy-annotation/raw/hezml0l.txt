Usually I get this argument from people who have never been in a union.  But that's irrelevant.

Can you answer why union junior pilots make effectively less than minimum wage and work 80 hours a week while senior ones make 400k doing 20 hours a week for what is substantively the same job?

I'd like you to answer another question:. I understand you've been propagandized to believe workers are dumb, but if they're so dumb why can union operatives convince them to vote for their interests?  Are the union organizers themselves too dumb to persuade anyone?  Really this entire line of logic is so patronizing and ignorant that it practically screams you've never been in a union or even worked a blue collar job.
