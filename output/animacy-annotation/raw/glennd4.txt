Let's be honest here: an extraordinarily large number of men would be THRILLED to have a girlfriend with a high sex drive.

It's disrespectful, rude, and ignorant of your boyfriend to call you weird and a sex addict because you want to have sex with him roughly three times a week. I can't even wrap my head around saying that to somebody who desires a very reasonable amount of healthy intimacy with another person.

You can find somebody who doesn't just appreciate, but is EXCITED about your sexual urges.
