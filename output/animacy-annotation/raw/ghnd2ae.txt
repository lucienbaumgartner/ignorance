I had this supposed "half black" guy go on self crusade frenzy on how Asians do not experience "real" racism on one of the comments I made the other day. 

The main point of his claim was that Asians do not face actual violence in America at all and there is no real threat towards Asians from other people groups.

These are the same kind of snowflakes who cry at the hint of discomfort and always pull out the race card to justify their own prejudice and racist behaviors towards other minorities. They are so dense and ignorant that they believe only their group of people face real hardship and racism.
