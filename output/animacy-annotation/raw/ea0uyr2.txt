My dad took my Roomate and myself out to eat one time while visiting. We were in our very early twenties he was a few years older though. He knows my dad will pay so he orders like 30 wings. I was a little bit pissed but maybe he’s just starving. He eats 5 of them and when I ask him why he ordered so many in a very direct way he tells me that he wanted to take some home....Wtf. Shit was not cheap. But the kid really wasn’t malicious he was consistently this dumb and unaware that he was being rude.
