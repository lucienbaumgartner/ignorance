For me it would depend on the student.  Sometimes embarrassing them works.  “Oh, Dylan, thank you so much for deciding to grace us with your presence! Please go ahead and find a seat.  We’ll wait.”  And then stare at him for a good 15 or 30 seconds.  This may also cause the other students to stare at him.  Peer pressure can work wonders.  Do this every time he comes in late.  

If it’s more that he’s oblivious and unaware that he’s being rude, you could send an email asking him to come to your office.  Then have a conversation about why this behavior is unacceptable, what is causing his tardiness, and what he plans to do differently to be on time in the future.

You can lock the door at the start of class.  I had a prof do this in undergrad.  It’s effective.

Finally, make a note to your future self to include attendance and timeliness as part of the grade and/or include a disclaimer that pop quizzes are possible.  It’s always good to have options.
