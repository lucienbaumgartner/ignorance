I would love to see this get more coverage and awareness.  I fully believe that the reality we manifest is a co-creative process and the more people who consciously agree to disclosure, the closer it will come to fruition.  Right now there are still just too many people asleep and unaware that are keeping us on the course we're on (secrecy and control).  You really can't impose this on anyone though.  People's free will right to decide what they want to believe must be honored.  So how do you raise awareness without imposing or sounding crazy?  Tough nut to crack...  I think he comes across as believable as someone can talking about this stuff...
