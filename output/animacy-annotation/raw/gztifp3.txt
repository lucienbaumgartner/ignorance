You realize that you're commenting how much anti-choice advocates "care about born humans" under a headline about them being totally okay with putting women to death for choosing not to be pregnant, right? In the same state which allows fertilized IVF embryos to be discarded without any concern about their "life"? 

And yes, it is treating people very differently to consider a fetus inside of a person's womb to have more rights than the person whose body it is inside. It's also extremely illogical and ignorant of bodily autonomy. In no other medical situation is a person forced to put their own health and life at risk for the benefit of another against their will. That would be the same as legalizing the collection of organ or blood from someone without their consent.
