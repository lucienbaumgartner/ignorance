Wow, There's just so much wrong with that excerpt...on so many different levels. The paragraph above the excerpt shown, is almost as bad maybe even worse!

I honestly haven't read such a contempt, inappropriate, gross and just 100% willfully ignorant response than..."*The logic has been used to defend the us all vaccines to date,but i has been proven to be nothing more than 'mental masturbation' for 'nerdy scientists'. It sounds good and feels better, but it's not 'the real thing'*.

This next part is worse, if that is even possible! "*Many people have been stained by the resulting 'intellectual ejaculate'. In most cases it's not too late to "wash it off". Cleanliness and immunity go hand in hand*."

Just reading that made me actually made me stupider and made me throw up in my mouth. I really can't remember when I last read something so extremely cringe-worthy. It so smug and ignorant that it almost reads like a parody and is actually kind of funny, until you suddenly realize that this horrible person is completely serious and might actually influence some naive people how bought that book because they wanted to learn about natural cures into believing such ignorant and potentially harmful rhetoric.

I believe in the freedom of speech and freedom of the press, just as much as the next person, but there comes a point where spreading such harmful and hateful rhetoric with outright lies and disinformation actually because dangerous to society and has no place in it, at least not without some kind of disclaimer or warning on how much is wrong with it or has scientifically been proven false.

I genuinely feel sick, depressed, and have lost a bit more faith in the world after reading just that one page and knowing that book even exists.
