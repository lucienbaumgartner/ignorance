Trump's refusal to reveal his tax returns, something that every presidential candidate for the past few decades has done, was a strong indication that he has something big to hide. 

Donald Trump Jr. is on record as stating the following: ""In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. Say, in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo, and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."

Likewise, the fact that Trump has had secret meetings with Putin and has refused to tell Congress what happened in those meetings is a matter of fact. 

As for Trump's connections to Russia, there is indeed a LOT of evidence. That you've been told that "any agency that says anything negative about Trump is lying" doesn't make that true. 

The fact that several members of Trump's campaign have pleaded guilty to illegal connections to Russia can't be ignored. This means that either Trump was completely incompetent and unaware that members of his campaign were making deals with a foreign power, or that he was complicit and aware of this.

Trump's lawyer has confessed to having committed federal crimes at Trump's command.

This is not "political hit job assumptions." This is fact.
