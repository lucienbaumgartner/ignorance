The thing is. "Feminism" today is only enforced wrongfully in first world countries. Men and women arent globally equal in society no matter where you go. Theres only terrible things like women in isis camps being forced to birth. Or incels and other hated groups being constantly misunderstood and unhelped.
You should not try to level with these people they are insane. 
Feminism (the only original one way back) was to make us equal. Theres nothing wrong with that. But the thing is. People are so high up their own ass, selfish and ignorant. That equality is simply not possible. 
Just try to stay on the surface and call out hypocrites. Pick who you support carefully.
