Thanks for the honesty, it's appreciated.

Warning, personal story inc (I know the meat eaters will hate it):
 I became a vegitarian a long time ago but didn't choose to restrict my diet before I moved out because I wasn't even cooking my own food and so I'd have to cut off my diet or force my ethics and morals to impact my family and I wasn't sure I'd like to blame myself for being born in a carnivorous society so I waited until I had started to cook my own shit.

Also, for a long time I was like you, I knew it was unethical but I chose to do what I believed was wrong because in my honest opinion choosing to do wrong isn't as unethical as being unaware and oblivious to the fact that you're commiting immoral acts.

What I mean is, I love to hear people who choose to eat meat but admit it's kind of fucked up to slay another animal for it. At least know what the fuck is up. Because to be honest, if your culture is full of shit you shouldn't blame yourself for being made a part of it.
