Awesome! This trend of waking up from trained submissiveness is terrifying to the establishment. 

Remember this from the Podesta emails, it doesn't get any more brutally fucking honest about their agenda:

"And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking"
