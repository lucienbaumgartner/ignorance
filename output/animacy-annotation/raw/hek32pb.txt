Just pay your taxes and don't be a freeloader. When you break the law, you suffer the consequences of the law. This has been the case throughout human history, and you aren't immune just because you think you're better than the law, and more moral than the rest of society. 

You're not. You're just naive and ignorant of what actually works in the world, the equivalent of the toddler throwing a fit because his parents sent him to bed early because he didn't pick up his toys. Being a part of society has massive benefits, and that comes with a cost whether you like it or not. And if you don't, feel free to leave. Nobody will miss you.
