Unfortunately, it’s the way to live. I appreciate the optimism it takes to live otherwise but to me it belies a poor understanding of human nature.

There are people that are ignorant and selfish and turning the other cheek is not a magical first step that will put them on the path to good behavior in the future.

Ultimately, emotions like guilt and shame are more universal to every person and are better motivations for changing one’s behavior than vindicating their behavior by giving them an unearned level of respect.
