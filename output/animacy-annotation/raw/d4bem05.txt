your mix and tone are good

don't know if i would call this metal though?

Aesthetically (in other words my opinion) its a little too "soaring" for my tastes, reminds me of like a Top Gun track or something, just too heroic.  So it feels a little cliche to my ears for that reason.  I don't mind the occasional "soaring" song especially if its like Kenny G and it has a cheesy R&amp;B grove, but only because it emphasizes the goofyness of sacharrine love jams.  in the context of archappegios and marching war drums its just all too awesome with no awkwardness.  So it comes off as lacking in either reflection or having a sense of humor.  Maybe it could be balanced with the right lyrics, but I don't think the irony required to balance that track is humanly possible.  I mean maybe, but I image you'd need a person so unaware and full of themselves that they themselves wouldn't understand the profundity of the joke, which means hanging out with them for the time required to write a song would probably either really suck, or you'd have to chew your tongue off to keep from laughing at them in their face all the time.
