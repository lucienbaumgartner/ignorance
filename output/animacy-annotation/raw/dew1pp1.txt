In the 1989 Bay Area earthquake, a trapped child had to be removed from a vehicle in a collapsed freeway the same way. The problem was, there was a body in the car blocking the way. Before amputating his leg, a surgeon had to first divide and remove the torso of the other body with a chainsaw. The six year old was fortunately unconscious and unaware that he had to be pulled through his mother's friend.

The rescue workers were unbelievably brave, considering that the entire structure was on the verge of collapse. 

EDIT: procedure on the child was not done with a chainsaw.
