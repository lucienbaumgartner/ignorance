The guy was caught in the act of assaulting a woman who was bleeding on the ground from damage caused by that "small, blunt metal object".

[Blunt objects are the cause of 400-500 murders per year. Bare hand and feet cause 600-700.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls)

Yes guns are more dangerous, but your tone that this was just a "small, blunt metal object" is just ignorant and dismissive.
