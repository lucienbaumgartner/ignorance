My FIL used to say that women were made for housework. Something in their genes. 
There is no way I would put up with it. Us just cut him off. He knew that he should either shut up or us be leaving. 

I did have a friend (until last January when I cut her off). She was right wing, ignorant and racist. I’d suffer it cos I felt sorry for her (bad divorce) but I always drew a line at the racism. She knew when to shut up. Anyway, during the lockdowns I just couldn’t tolerate her any longer. My skin was too thin.
