&gt;  Isn't that because Kickstarter has become a glorified pre-order system?

Yes? If publisher wants to offer exclusives on Kickstarter the value proposition is higher to back the Kickstarter despite lower retail pricing. If the publisher wants to offer exclusives on their website the value proposition is higher to order on their website despite lower retail pricing. No value proposition? No reason to buy for ~20% more. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say an informed consumer will recognize their options and an informed business will understand that.

OP decries this practice, but any time I put myself in a hypothetical publisher's shoes I don't see why I wouldn't use it - it's certainly not forbidden by Kickstarter (they make bank) and people seem to cling to this notion that it's just for the 'little guys' and anyone who uses it otherwise is abusing it.

If my choices are 1) try to project unit production amounts from a finnicky market and then secure loans or lines of credit upwards of a million bucks plus (that my business is on the hook for if I'm wrong) only to turn around to sell to distribution for a fraction of MSRP, OR 2) get an exact gauge on my production run, receive those funds immediately (no need for that loan!), AND make ~90% of MSRP per sale? The only reason I would not do this is if Target or Walmart has perpetual agreements for me to fill their shelves.

Is this consumer friendly? Fuck no, I'm not particularly interested in someone earning interest on my money either. But that's the thing; the Kickstarter is 'for the common folk' schtick is just that, a narrative people have bought into for some reason while the platform is absolutely designed to extract value from high performing projects. Kickstarter is just fine and dandy with this, so this 'it's just a pre-order system!!!!' is seemingly na√Øve and ignorant of what kind of business Kickstarter itself runs.
