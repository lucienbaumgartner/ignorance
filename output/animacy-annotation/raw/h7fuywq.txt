No, not really

Even if it is illegal, things like onlyfans can still exist. Get a VPN for the user and the company can move their base in *insert country that doesnt care (from Panama to Malta, idk)

How big do you think CP is? Because i doubt you understand how big it is

How wide are the abuse in the porn industry? Because i doubt you understand why we are against porn

Im tired of people thinking like this. Bannin drugs is bad, banning this is bad, it will just make it illegal!!!!!!!!


I dont even want to spend the time explaining why you are both wrong and ignorant of the issue. You just want to feel smarter than everyone because no one has possibly thought of that.
