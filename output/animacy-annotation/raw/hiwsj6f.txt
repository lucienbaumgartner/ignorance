Personal shields deflect anything moving too fast.  That makes guns useless, severely blunts explosions, and requires people to practice moving their knives slow enough to penetrate the shields.  Incidentally, you *really* don't want to hit a shield with a laser weapon.  That causes an explosion very similar to an atomic bomb, and using atomics is one of the few things that will bring down the combined wrath of most of the Landsraad on you.

The one place you see guns being used is on the planet Arrakis, because shields also attract the sandworms, and drive them crazy.  If your opponent has a working shield on Arrakis, you don't need to kill him, Shai-Hulud will take care of that for you.  So fremen do use guns, and assassins count on their targets being unaware and unshielded.  Everybody else uses other methods, like blades (with or without poison.)
