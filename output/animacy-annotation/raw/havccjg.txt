FYI, what you're talking about isn't DCA. It's just buying what you perceive to be dips.

DCA is a specific strategy that involves programmed blind buying on certain pre-determined dates.  By definition it's not supposed to be responsive to things like "when the red days are raining down".  

I'm not a fan of DCA, as it's largely a industry-invented and industry-serving sales concept.  And it only works in one specific and not-that-common curve pattern.

But the idea of DCA is that it is a pattern of buying that is deliberately unaware and defiant of any market conditions, such as "red days", so it's not compatible with your states intent.
