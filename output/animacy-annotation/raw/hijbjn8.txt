So this is just an anti Trump/Right rant obviously.  Cuomo may have had daily press conferences about the virus, great, but everything he was saying was a huge lie.  When he came out and said New York city, the most population dense city in the country was handling everything perfectly and that infected numbers were low because of his governerning, I spit my coffee out and laughed.  There were daily videos of block parties in the thousands.  New Yorkers were flocking to my Beach town and staying in their second homes while bringing the virus with them.  We know now that everything he said was horseshit but I knew when he said it because that's illogical.   He wrote a book that was full of lies too.  I love how you just casually say, "sure he fucked up the nursing homes."  That's cruel and ignorant of you.  I vote Libertarian so don't even try to come at me with your Fox news bullshit.  Don't have cable.  Both sides lie.
