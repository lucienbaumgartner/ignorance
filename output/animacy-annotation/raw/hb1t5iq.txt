Why'd you feel bad? I feel like if she were dumb and unaware of what she had been doing, she'd just apologize and be like "shit I didn't realize. So sorry." I'm also not sure that she's a mastermind, but she knew what she was doing. That's why I don't feel sorry for her. She had her opportunity to apologize and didn't.
