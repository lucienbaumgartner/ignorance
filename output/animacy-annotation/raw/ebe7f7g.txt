It’s a matter of public record that Clinton traveled with Epstein on Epstein’s plane 26 times. Virginia Roberts, one of Epstein’s victims, claims to have met Clinton on two occasions at Epstein’s island.

These wealthy, power, prolific rapists and abusors don’t exist in a vacuum; they survive because other powerful people are ready and willing to look the other way and cover for them.
