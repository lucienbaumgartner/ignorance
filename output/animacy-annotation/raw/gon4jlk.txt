here: 

&gt; "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
 
And you labeled them because you are racist and ignorant of your family past where they received the same treatment when they arrive in the United States.
