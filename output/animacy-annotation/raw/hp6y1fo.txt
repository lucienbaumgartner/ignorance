You're one of those people who don't understand the essence of dynamic characters who are consistently changing. 

&gt;he pretended to care about Lily's son

Snape did not 'pretend' to care about her son. He straight-up resented him whilst actively protecting him. The entire purpose of this was to portray his own internal conflict as a result of his inability to distinguish Harry as his *own* person. He couldn't help but see James's son nor Lily's son. Not only was this a direct result of his personal trauma with James at Hogwarts, but it was also the built-up guilt from getting Lily killed. This was Snape's outlook for Harry in the *majority* of the series, but we are exposed to a change in his character. 

During the events of HBP, Dumbledore let's Snape in on the secret that Harry needs to die. Snape is shocked at the idea that Dumbledore, the one who forged Snape's path for atonement..."help me protect Lily Potter's son"..., was the one who abolished this motive for Snape. What we also know is that Dumbledore asks Snape, "how many men and women have you seen die"...to which Snape replied...."lately, only those whom I could not save". This is a clear indicator that Snape had grown an affinity for doing good for the greater good, not just because of Lily. If you narrow his actions to be solely directed at Lily, you'll realize that you'll struggle to link the many acts/actions he did to this motive. This is obviously because the books portray a general progression in Snape's own personal motives for acting the way he does. 

&gt;So all in all, he's doing it so he doesn't feel guilty. Trying to make up for his horrendous mistake.

Essentially. This is incorrect, you're argument is heavily whitewashed and ignorant of various context regarding the dynamic nature of his character. The notion that Snape's actions were selfish are directly contradicted by the text itself.
