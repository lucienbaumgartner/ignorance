I'm not an atheist, I'm Christian.

To add to the discussion however, refusing a COVID vaccine on religious grounds.

One person I know in particular believes the vaccine is not necessary as God's children have bodies designed to fight off disease. People are dying. Vaccines stop people from dying. Whole thing makes me so mad.

I also know a Christian who went on a religious rant on social media after a pro athlete came out as gay. Said he should have embraced Jesus. His comments were shallow and ignorant of what homosexuality is and the suffering many gay people endure before, and after, coming out.

Love one another. It's not a hard concept.
