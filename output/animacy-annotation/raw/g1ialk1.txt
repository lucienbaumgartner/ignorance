Oh stop being a child. This has nothing to do with monogamy or open relationships. Op cheated. Being bi has zero to do with it and frankly it’s insulted and ignorant that you’re trying to make it about being bi. Open relationships aren’t cheating. Monogamy isn’t the problem here. A person entered a relationship under terms they are knowingly disrespecting and have zero regards for their partner. They are also looking to hide that and lie about it. People with crappy morals and zero regards for those they date make crappy partners in almost *all types of relationships*. Go be edgy elsewhere.
