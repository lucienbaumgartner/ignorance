Except no mither means the killer isn’t going to give you even a tiny window to do so 99.99% of the time unless they are new and unaware of what the perk does. Even then, the newer and less experienced killers usually just automatically grab the downed survivor even if there’s a great chance to down someone else or someone standing in plain view ready to beam them in the face with a flashlight. I messed around with no mither builds for a while back in the day and while it’s a ton of fun, just using unbreakable is going to be way better.
