In some ways, it is still too soon to tell.

Overall, was it bad intentioned? No. Was it handled poorly, maybe. But these kinds of things are hard to do perfectly. It could have been a mistake to even try, and thus almost doomed from the start.

Look, the US honestly did this because it thought it would make a better world. Was it arrogant and unaware of its limitations? Maybe. Was getting international approval absolutely necessary? Maybe. 

Will, in 50 years, Iraq be better off because of the War than if it hadn't happened? Quite possibly. Was this worth the cost to the US citizen at a time when the real threat they should have been paying attention to was China, likely not.

Even now, evaluating Vietnam is very difficult. I don't think there is any consensus among serious historians. Iraq might turn out to be a bit simpler to evaluate than Vietnam was, but it will still defy easy categorization.
