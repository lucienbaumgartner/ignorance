You can be confrontational without riots.  Because thats exactly what Waters said, On to Trump and team, Giuliani said, “Let’s have trial by combat,”, among a pile of outright lies and misinformation,  Trump said "We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,", He did say peacefully, but his rhetoric and lies leading up to the Jan. 6th insurrection attempt were just playing on the weak and ignorant that truly believed the election was stolen, it wasn't.  Still no proof, nothing, zip, nota.
