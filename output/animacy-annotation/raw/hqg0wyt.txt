Skunks don't give a crap about anyone or anything. They are proud and ignorant of danger. 

I live in the wilderness in northern Ontario much of the time and I've come across several skunks. They'll walk up to you, sniff your leg, go into your shed, try to go into your house, walk around like they own the place and if they don't like you or your place, they'll move along and find somewhere else to go. Heaven help you if they decide to move in and call anything within a mile of you home. 

If you disturb them, make them angry, offend them, scare them or upset them in any way, they will unleash chemical warfare on you and they know it. Otherwise, they'll quietly live alongside you. 

And if they do stick around, they will mildly stink all the time because when they go away, they'll inevitably run into danger or get scared, spray and get some of the stuff on themselves. 

I had one live under my cottage for a couple of years and it took a lot of work to get him or her to move.
