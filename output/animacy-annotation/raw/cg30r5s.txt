I am a doctor. Have seen first hand the famous God's complex. Treating nurses and patients like shit. I try hard not to be like that. Even the patient doing the dumbest thing possible, I tell myself they are intelligent human beings who are just scared and unaware. That said, I am better than that bitch ex of my boyfriend. I tell him that everyday so that he doesn't forget it!
