I thought “R’s” were the “red team” and that you like to suck on “red pills”.  I think you’re closer to China?  I mean Russia does sit right there next to it...

Must suck to be so weak, insecure, and ignorant that you think shouting “China” is an efficacious argument.

What leadership? I’m American so I’m allowed free thought.  I suppose you’re a little confused though and think “liberty” means follow what your “leader” asks of you.  

Take care, I hear Putin can be punitive.  Enjoy your commie beers!
