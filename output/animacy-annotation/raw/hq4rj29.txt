I was very lucky that my wife’s Nan had jewellery coming out the wazoo (her grandad was relatively wealthy) and one day, upon us visiting her Nan, she took me off to the side and produced a ring with diamonds and an emerald in it the size of my thumb nail. She told me a story about how my wife and her sisters, when obviously very young and ignorant of the true worth of the jewellery, would play dress up with it and this green emerald ring was my wife’s favourite (she loves the colour green). So she gave it too me to use as an engagement ring. I tried to to politely decline (due to the expense and never in my wildest dreams being able to afford something like this) but she was the type of Nan that wouldn’t take no for an answer and I found it in my cars ashtray while driving home from work a few nights later. She’d hid it there at some point during our visit. Anyway, long story short, I used it propose and now my wife only wears it for special occasions. When her nan passed, she left her the matching earrings. 
I always chuckle to myself when I see that ring. I have no idea how she took my car keys without looking and hid it in my ashtray but she was always pulling shit like this. She’d often try to pay me for bring her granddaughters to visit, as if I thought of it as a chore. She’d always find a way to give me money. I’d find £2.0 notes in my shoe when I got home and took them off. What a wonderful lady.
