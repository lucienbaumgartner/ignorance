NO, it is NOT broken. It IS good and BALANCED!

Countering the Onslaught is easy, just go near ur teammates and let him rush to his quick demise. If you're alone in the Jungle when Butcher Onslaughts you, pray he's a noob and doesn't manage to kill you, if he has Lambs to the Slaughter.. Well, you're shit out of luck tbh :D

Jungle is Butcher's home, where he hunts the unaware and helpless players for Fresh meat.

Btw, back in the day, Butcher could just run trough Leoric's Entomb. Making holes like the Entomb is cardboard box.
