Sadly no. There used to be a time and I’m sure it’s still largely true for the masses that a confession is a sure conviction. The layman would say he confessed! That means he did it.  Not for me, I need to hear the extraneous circumstances case by case. If the confession is done on the suspects own cognizant then maybe...but even then there are instances where prisoners serving life sentences will confess to murders that they didn’t commit for various reasons such as monetary or attention. Yes, it can be helpful and is a good indicator. By now most of us are knowledgeable enough to know that coercions exists.

There’s been instances where witnesses are coerced especially those with low IQ unaware and less informed thinking they’re contributing to an investigation or just plain want to go home because of them being interrogated for hours on end.  You know of these instances I’m sure with the Central Park Five and Brenden Dassey from the Making a Murderer documentary. You largely know those kids and Brenden had no capacity or knowledge of the crimes they’re being questioned on but the cops are leading a confession.

Inadmissible evidence largely stems from lack of ethicality. Evidence has to be taken the right way, it’s gotta be done as ethically possible because once justice is perverted for one then it’s perverted for all. Even if you have strong circumstantial evidence that the accused did it  then build the case with as many facts otherwise reasonable doubt persists.
