The satanic temple and other similar groups don't worship Satan, they are atheistic. They use Satan the fictional literary character as a symbol.

If you read the Bible as a work of fiction without the assumption that God is the good guy, its easy to root for Satan. God made humans ignorant and subservient and Satan helped them attain knowledge. God destroyed cities, murdered children, genocides humanity, and demanded his followers sacrifice children to him; Satan suggested that many all those things were bad ideas. 

Regardless of your take on religion itself, the literary character Satan is an excelent example of a rebel who challenges authority.
