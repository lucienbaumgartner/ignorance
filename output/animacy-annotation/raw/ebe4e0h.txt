Maybe you didn't, but others did.

I honestly don't know. Knowing what Winchester did to Denise Williams, it's also entirely plausible to me that he concocted the plot and threatened or intimidated her into participating. Maybe they were having an affair and Winchester made this play to get her. I honestly don't think she's unaware and innocent, but there is some serious reasonable doubt, at least as I see it.

This is a horrendous deal, and she didn't actually murder anyone. I can't abide her getting charged with murder when the actual killer gets off completely. This is not a murder-for-hire case, Winchester unquestionably benefited from the murder of Mike Williams, and he shouldn't get away with it.
