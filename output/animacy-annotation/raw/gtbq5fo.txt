Old Man Steve Rogers in Endgame.

We talked about this one on [Tumblr](https://draconic-duelist.tumblr.com/post/189926910710/heres-the-thing-there-100-has-to-be-some-kind) a while back, so I'm just going to copy-paste the discussion from there and link it. My evidence is at the bottom in my contribution to the post. (Have to break it into multiple comments, due to breaking the character limit)

**TL;DR**\- Due to how many changes would be caused by the movement of the Stones and interactions caused in the attempts thereof, when Steve goes to return the Stones and doesn't come back via Pym-Particles, there's *no way* he could have come back "the long way". Therefore, whoever "Old Man Steve" or "Roger Stevenson" is, it is ***not*** the Captain America we and the Avengers know and love:

if marvel revealed that steve rogers was actually stuck in the quantum realm it would legitimately be one of the most unsettling plot twists they could manage like not only would it mean that old steve is not steve at all, rather someone or *something* else, but it would also imply that steve didn’t finish his mission and return all the stones &amp; that the very fabric of reality is in danger

**imposterogers**

the thing about this is that the reveal would be absolutely bonkers and hit SO hard no matter how they did it bc not only would the audience would have the immediate and sinking understanding that they were wrong and unaware of the severity of the situation But they’d also have to watch as the rest of the characters continued day to day life w/o any suspicious while an imposter lived among them, reality begins to falter, and the real steve is stuck somewhere

while I’m at it .... possible ways they could reveal it

1. a scene with old steve interacting w sam and bucky immediately followed by a shot of Vormir that gradually zooms in on a man (steve) dancing alone on the cliff w a blank expression

2. old steve makes a huge mistake and answers a question or does something that we the audience know is 1000% ooc to the extreme but no one else notices

3. someone DOES realize old steve is an imposter but old steve realizes they figured it out .... and then we find out just how dangerous “old steve” is

how it could fit into the mcu :

\-falcon &amp; the winter soldier proceeds as normal. there’s no hints that’s something wrong. the Very last scene of the series is the dramatic reveal (to the audience only) that old steve is *not* steve rogers

\-this is not immediately touched upon again. there is no easy fix or instant solution. rather, in the shows &amp; movies, there seems to be something off. events and characters exist that shouldn’t &amp; others disappear. reality is beginning to decay.

\-wanda &amp; vision is a result of this: they are forced into an alternative reality (the 50s)

\-loki (who travels interdimensionally) begins to notice the signs and the danger the ENTIRE multiverse is in, and alternates between causing mischief and trying to bandage the holes in reality back together

\-enter dr strange. maybe it’s bucky who alerts him, fearful of what has been posing as “steve” &amp; what happened to the real one. or loki, who “wouldn’t be here unless it was important”. or wanda or or or. but then his film is a direct response to this growing problem within the mcu. the unraveling of reality. the invasion of whatever is trying to cause it. it’s a battle against time, as his memories and abilities begin to fade away. it’s him finding the real steve, wherever he may be, and whoever did this to him.
