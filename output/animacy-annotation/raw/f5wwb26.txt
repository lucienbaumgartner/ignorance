Translation: "waaaahhhh!! Old people tend to vote conservatively! And im a screaming liberal with a hyper-inflated identity and ego who thinks hes always irrefutably right! Because no human ever admits to being dumb and wrong and misinformed and ignorant! That just doesnt feel good and is non-conducive to feeding our good feelings! So we just scream louder to pretend we're sagacious and knowledgeable! So to hell with everyone who disagrees with me! They're dumb and obsolete!"
