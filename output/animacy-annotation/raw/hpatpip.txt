Fostering isn't inexpensive. And when the No. 1 goal of fostering is reuniting the child with the birth parents, adoption isn't even an option 75 percent of the time. 

I have worked in foster care. Unless you have, suggesting it is a equitable replacement to having children is incredibly ignorant and naive.
