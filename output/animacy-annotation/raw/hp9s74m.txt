Then I don’t know what to tell you. You’re ignorant. Roads are better as public entities than private ones. Firemen, policemen…all better now that they are public. USPS is better and cheaper than FedEx and UPS. Healthcare in other countries is better and cheaper than ours…and theirs is government run. Schools are better, reach more people, are less exclusionary and less racist and less sexist and less classist as public institutions. Most research is done by public universities. Literally most things are better as public institutions. Good lord man. 

You’ve bought into the propaganda and you are misinformed. 

Your wife…shame on her. Again, your ignorant and selfish. If you don’t understand why vaccines are good and why masks are good…I don’t know what to tell you. You’ve chosen to ignore the best science we have and buy into the propaganda. 

Go look at how vaccines work. Go look at how viruses travel and water droplets and how mask reduce viral loads which makes it harder to spread disease. Again, Jesus fucking Christ man. 

The reason why they all have to act they way they do at the schools is because of people like your wife and her selfishness. Fuck. 

I’m at least glad you are pro choice. Not a total hypocrite. And I agree. You don’t have to get vaccinated. BUT you don’t need to be in public spaces or private businesses either. Don’t want to be vaccinated? Great, your choice. Here are some consequences for your choices: you can’t teach. You can’t be a vector for a deadly virus. Your kids can’t go to PUBLIC schools. 

Your restricting paragraph is laughable. My wife can’t walk down the road topless. She will get arrested. No shirt, no shoes, no service…ever heard of that? Dress codes? Fuck, look at BYU and the HC. 

And finally, you ignore the science. Your response shows that. Like mormonism, your response is nothing but an uneducated mess of contradictions. Good luck man.
