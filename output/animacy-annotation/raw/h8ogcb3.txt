Everyone will tell you to break up with him, don't.

Consider the pros and the cons of the relationship first. He's insecure? Sure. But does he take care of you, does he support your dreams? If this is the only issue, he may be insecure and unaware of how his behaviour is making you feel. Assure him you love him dearly, but you're often very tired and not in the mood for sex. Communicate. Don't throw away a relationship just because some people on Reddit told you to, when they only know this brief post and not your entire relationship or him. Leave him only if it feels right.
