That’s by design? Lol

They consciously decided to stagger the release of normal 2 weeks after the release (savage 2 weeks after normal) so people don’t feel like they have to rush.  Gives people time to do msq, ex trials, and level up other jobs.

I’m guessing you’re new and unaware that it’s been this way for years.
