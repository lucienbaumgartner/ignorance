1) Technically men already have a finite number of sperm they can release-ditto for woman and eggs-before they die, even if they wank it every day, as death would ultimately put an end to any and all sperm production.  (Unless you’re immortal.) Also, I’m pretty sure you don’t just run out of sperm even in a hypothetical like this. Over time the health of an egg or Sperm can depreciate or get damaged. I’m assuming the same still happens in this hypothetical, just on a faster timeline for sperm producers versus egg producers. So then it becomes the issue of viable sperm that no longer gets produced, As in sperm that is healthy enough to create the end result of a healthy fetus that gets carried to term successfully. Maybe after a hard set age or amount of “use” the sperm gets too damage so it never results in a pregnancy, our sped up sperm longevity time line, so Basically after a certain age or use amount you’d be guaranteed to “shoot blanks”. 

2) *Dude* following that line of thought, the market for a talented gentleman in his 20’s, 30’s, 40’s or 50’s +, who *couldn’t* get you pregnant in any way? All the fun with built in birth control. Everyone gets off and goes home happy. No unwanted pregnancy to worry about save for a possible STI/STD. Like wise people going buck wild during their midlife crisis and divorcing to screw who ever because there would be no resulting children? And orgies with age restrictions might be more common as well, because why not? 

3) I’m not even sure what that would do to people on a religious front because there’s a lot of extremism out there, but I’m assuming those who could create healthy viable sperm would be coveted and there’d possibly be a rise in arranged marriages. Male masturbation would be like a bogey man nightmare you’d tell little boys about-among a plethora of other unsavory tactics you could imagine-to ensure they even had a choice of a family further down the line. Or crack pots saving sperm samples for their kid’s future and the accompanying economy that would develop around that. Also purity balls and promise rings for boys-rather than just girls-with an added unhealthy emphasis put on staying pure and ignorant of body functions until marriage.

4) like wise, assuming the availability of healthy viable sperm is what we are focusing on, A willing healthy male donor could probably make it rain after a few donations-can you imagine the kind of bombardment high school &amp; college students would get? “Pay off your student loans” “buy the car of your dreams with three easy appointments we know you’ll enjoy” or the true crime stories “I was conned out of my future family”. More on the negative, There would be an increase in male child abduction in addition to sperm farming facilities filled with unwilling donors because scummy, soulless humans exist and exploitation is nothing new. 

TLDR pretty much the same/similar problems we have in the world now just a bit different. 🤷‍♀️
