What a weird phenomenon. I live in Mexico, and it's pretty much the opposite here. Rich people ran to US when the pandemic started to get the shot as fast as they could. Poor people don't hesitate against getting shot, even though these people are normally the most ignorant and uneducated of all. Of course there is still a big antivaxx community here in Mexico, but people don't distrust the government in that way like Americans do (Mexicans distrust the government in other ways, but not in ways concerning health.).
