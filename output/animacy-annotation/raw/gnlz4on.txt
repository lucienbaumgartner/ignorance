I have ADHD and this sounds familiar when I was unaware and untreated. There are special cleaning companies (like more geared toward hazardous waste) that can come in and clean really well, and it sounds like he needs some intensive sessions with a reputable ADHD coach who will come into the home and set up systems for him and he needs to hire out as much as he can afford and then slowly add things onto his plate when/if he is able to avoid that “failure spiral”. That’s all if he gets the diagnosis. Treatment has changed my life, but I still struggle immensely without my supports.
