I have an 8th house stellium (sun mer ven jup). Moon is conjunct pluto, the latter in the first house. Both of those trine mars. That should probably explain a lot, lol.

The state of this country and the entire world is at stake here. Climate change is an existential threat on us all and for all those who have yet to be born. Leaders and talking heads like Limbaugh operate from the stand point of hatred misinformation and are nothing short of this centuries incarnations of Nazi's. Nothing has proven to do anything to stop them appropriately, so many remain to varying extents willingly unaware, and many others stand in the way in the name of "both sides" or mislead compromise. I was so immensely relieved when Scalia died due to his damage and the continued danger he posed to society. If death is what it takes for the world to be saved, then that is what it takes. Unless we start turning in the right direction and their power/authority curtailed, I hope that many like them just drop dead.
