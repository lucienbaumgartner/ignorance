We call that incel, not gay. Gay is being a man attracted to men, fashionable clothing is optional, snootiness towards women usually isn't a part of it either.

At first I thought he might just be confused and unaware of asexuality, but no he's probably just a "nice guy" turning full incel. Just the voluntary kind. Volcel? Abstincel? Is there a term for these guys?
