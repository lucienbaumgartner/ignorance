I currently live here, as a single dude in an apartment. So I can list some pros/cons 

Pros: 

1) everything you could ever need is right here. I live close to 242 and it’s crazy. 

2) everything looks pretty and there are a bunch of trails to walk. Everything is (usually) very clean. 

3) it’s safe with a lot of nice higher end things to do. 

4) if you have a family, it’s a great place to raise them. 

Cons: 

1) everything feels fake here. Everything is planned and it feels off. 

2) there is very little diversity. It’s all bland rich people who walk around and gawk at stuff. 

3) everything you could ever need is here. It really feels insulated and unaware of the world. 


All in all, I don’t mind living here. It has the things that I want, but without the heart or culture of it. I’ve found some great friends to hang out with and it makes it tolerable and a good job not that far from where I live. 

Like any place, it’s what you do with it and how you make connections. Get involved and find friends. The Woodlands is designed to have everything you want and for it to be a nice place to hang out.
