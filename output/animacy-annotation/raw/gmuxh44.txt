What good comes from delusion? I’d rather know what reality is as best I can, and thus be able to make an informed decision. Religion takes that away from people, as near as I can tell. How could that be a benefit? It’s like saying that walking through a minefield blindfolded and ignorant that it’s a minefield could be a benefit. Sure, you won’t feel anxious or scared and will die with peace, and you may even accidentally make it out alive and intact. But you’d be far more likely to get out alive if you took the damn blindfold off. And the only way you’d ever step ok a mine is ignorance that it’s there, which is all that the blindfold can give
