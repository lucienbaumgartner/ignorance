I’m very sympathetic to the broad concept of cultural appropriation, especially when it’s done for cynical profit motives. 

But exactly what the fuck is the rationale here. To your point, how is she to know that a hairstyle she’s only seen once, on a man she’s never met before, and assume it’s an exclusively black hairstyle? 

It’s one thing to go to japan and buy a kimono. But are people supposed to look everything up ahead of time to verify if their race invented it? 

It’s hardly worth engaging with this, because the antagonist is so blindingly stupid and unaware that she could never be a real person
