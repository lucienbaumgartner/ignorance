I am so sorry this happened. You should be proud of your clear head and your ability to be with your friend during that experience. 

You are traumatized and these are all normal responses to such an experience. 

If you have the chance down the line, EMDR therapy is an evidence-based therapy that is proven to have incredible results for PTSD.  I dont know how accessible it is in the UK but its the gold standard for healing these kinds of experiences and stopping the feeling of being haunted by them.

Try to be really kind to yourself, do the coziest things you can think of, take a bath, make popcorn and watch a funny movie, eat some comforting meals, hang out with your pet if you have one, wear comfy clothes. Those simple things can help. 

But really be very proud of the help you gave your friend, both practically and emotionally. You totally changed his experience, and definitely saved him from much worse trauma than if he was alone and ignorant of what to do. Many wouldve frozen or shut down and left him to deal with it all alone.

I hope you feel better soon. And please consider speaking to a professional if you dont start to feel better. These one time traumatic events can really be eased thru talking to someone.   


Wishing you luck, you did a lot of good that day.
