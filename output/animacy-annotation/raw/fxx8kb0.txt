Don't be so fucking naive and ignorant that you think anything short or straight up Marxism is compromise, or that you are the only one with problems. Back to normal means listening to scientists and not fucking risking death for a pandemic to satiate the narcissism of fascist wannabe dictator. Back to normal means getting rid of the concentration camps on our border. Back to normal means getting rid of the tax cuts that entrench the powers which make half that shit possible. Back to normal means continuing the march to progress that was going before Trump was elected.

Normal was having a functioning republic and using democracy to change the shit you described, which have gotten significantly worse over the last 4 years.

Yeah, I consider that a massive leap forward. Every gain is hard fought and easily lost. You're never gonna get your fantasy country where all those problems are fixed by "revolution", even if Bernie Sanders were to be elected. He wouldn't outlaw stock ownership either, like that would help any one of those problems. 

At this point, stopping the backslide to dictatorship is revolutionary. The problems you describe were problems that can not be dealt with under current circumstances. Not until we free ourselves from the grip of this demented nutball.
