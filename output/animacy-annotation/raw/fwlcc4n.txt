So in the case that her gender has nothing to do with her problems and it is actually just regular people being regular people who think they know better, then what? We should still just maintain that she shouldn't change her perspective?

When I used to pug, most people were bad and unaware that they are bad, which is a shitty combo. So I rarely pug these days because of the same issues that OP describes, but I a man.

I am not saying that women don't have a harder time in video games, because they most certainly do. Many men are bastards and can't help themselves from saying sexist shit, but the problems faced by OP here doesn't necessarily seem related to gender
