Dark Fate is even worse. They pick up from the end of T2, where they actually stop Judgement Day, but some random Terminator from the future that they stopped shoots John Conner in the fucking face and he dies.

You think the whole movie is about the fact that we now live in the doomed timeline where John doesn't exist (GET IT DARK FATE) but no... He actually DID stop the Judgement Day, except the new timeline also creates killer robots completely separate and unaware of skynet who start time travelling back to kill the resistance.

So they obviously recruit the Terminator who killed John Conner to help them because he has learned sentience and now has a wife and step son. There's also a line where he explains that he's never fucked his wife so she doesn't know he's a Terminator and they have to be sneaky about it.
