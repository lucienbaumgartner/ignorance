I have been watching housewives for like 6years now, I didn’t originally like OC but something about the last year made it CLICK with me - in fact I watched the whole series 3 times in the last year. It is essential HW viewing. The first two seasons are MUCH different but essential viewing. Just go into it expecting to gawk at how obscene and trashy they are (OC ANGELS, hummers, milf culture, JO AND SLADE just to name a few). I mean ssn2 ep1 is the famous “family van” scene. Season 3 when Tamara comes on is when the classic HW format starts - she brought interpersonal conflict that really changed the game. Season 4 Gretchen comes on - which is totally hilarious as she is OBVIOUSLY a gold digger with a fiancé on life support. Season 5 Alexis joins and the 3 Alexis seasons are just peak OC for me. She is so hilariously unaware and obscene it’s amazing. Then there’s the CANCER SCAM. 

The past few seasons are kinda meh but excited for the return of heather dubrow.
