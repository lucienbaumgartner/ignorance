Good point. I would offer this:

&gt;this refers to sacred tradition and apostolic authority

2 Timothy 3:16 NLT
All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.

2 Peter 3:15-16 NLT
And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him- [16] speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.

So, if Peter is using his Apostolic authority to say that Paul's letters are scripture, isn't it safe to say that the rest of the New Testement written by Apostles would be inspired by the Spirit as well?
