&gt;primary school biology

Intersex exists - it's not just Male or Female.

Your primary school biology probably didn't tell you that, though, did they?

There is SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), to help people match to their true gender.

I am a trans woman, and I want SRS someday. My gender is female, and my sex will reflect that in the future.

&gt;Gender is irrelevant

Tell that to gender experts, and you will find that you are wrong.

&gt;Why do you think it is intellectually competent to throw basic and constant fact into question?

If your "basic and constant fact" is false, then yes, I will throw it into question.

Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and people like them, are not gender experts. They are assholes who have an education, but they don't (and haven't) attempted to learn or understand what it means to be transgender.

&gt;But it's clear that neither of us will get anywhere.

Agreed. I think you would rather listen to hate than to read up on this.

I know it might seem hard to try and learn, and because of how it is hardly taught in "primary school biology" (have you got past that point yet?), it doesn't make sense to you.

Just read up. Being ignorant helps no-one.

&gt;armed with basic fact and reason

...

Your understanding of the transgender community is what I'd call basic, so I will agree with that.

&gt;you continue your agenda based pseudoscience

Oh... do you think gender experts (who actually understand and agree with transgender individuals existing) are lying, and just have an agenda?

Do you think experts are lying to people about gender, because you are so right-wing, biased, and ignorant that you don't know better?

&gt;we never speak of this again

I'd be fine with this, but frankly, I'm concerned about someone so ignorant and hateful visiting trans subreddits to harass.

Please. Get help.
