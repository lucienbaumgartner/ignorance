***At the risk of being inaccurately accused of shadowing you again... you replied to me here... so I wanted to reply to your comment...*** 

&gt;Just a few thoughts--not really intended as a debate, but to help folks see how a believer might read your post.

You started off so well, and then proceeded to call me ignorant, uniformed and lazy. This tracks with the vast majority of your comments and posts... aggressive and deflective. If this is how you think believers may read my post, t***hat gives me more of insight into your character and how you view exmormons***. Personally, I have found many TBM's online and in my personal life to be very loving and accepting. I don't get the sense that you extend the same amount of grace to us exmormons.

&gt;This statement is highly inaccurate and ignorant of the facts. The church has produced the best and most complete resources on its founding history available in all the world. Ironically, these resources likely provide the factual basis for many of the author's own criticisms of the church as producing a white-washed history.

I can't tell if you are being serious or not. ***Just to give you one example of many*** of the church whitewashing history... I'm wondering where I could go to learn about official church statements and positions from before the priesthood was opened to those of African descent... not the church, that's for sure.

&gt;This sentence is false. At its best, the sentence is highly conjectural. The concept of an ongoing restoration has been a central part of our belief from the outset of the faith. "We believe that God will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God" was written by Joseph Smith.

I'll counter this point with another quote from Boyd K. Packer in 1971 about the gospel, which is reflective of church position:

&gt;*How disappointing when the fullness of the gospel, the whole keyboard, is here upon the earth, that many churches tap on a single key. The note they stress may be essential to a complete harmony of religious experience, but it is, nonetheless, not all there is. It isnâ€™t the fullness.*

While Joseph Smith and other prophets claimed the idea of continued revelation, IMO a great deal of emphasis was about how the church contained the ***fullness of the gospel***. IMO, the idea of continuing revelation was to add to the gospel, not change, delete or hide it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the author betrays his own uninformed assumptions and bias, and a tendency to make lazy generalizations.  
&gt;  
&gt;the author has revealed his own proclivity to make unfounded assumptions, reach conclusions based on ignorance and conjecture, and now is offering a complicated explanation for the church's success.

***Coming from you...*** ***of all people******... this is rich and dripping in irony***. I'm reminded at how many times you've inaccurately categorized me into a pigeon hole of preconceived assumptions of exmormons. Just two weeks ago you admitted your own biases and then posted a highly biased view of exmormons and their view of their believing spouses online. There were quite a few examples given to you of recent posts from exmormons praising their believing spouses. You sir are exactly what you are accusing me of being.
