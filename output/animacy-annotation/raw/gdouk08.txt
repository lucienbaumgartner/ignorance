Interesting to see Sanae and Kanako's titles this time.

An overview of the character titles so far:

Reimu (Guardian of the Sacred Sake) is enshrined

Marisa (The Forest of Magic's Moonshine) is an outcast

Suika (Shuten-Douji of the Gourd Pillow) is a king of the alcohol game

Sakuya (The SDM's Kitchen Drinker) enjoys her work as a servant

Miyoi (The Poster Girl of Geidontei, the Fantasy Pub) has her identity attatched to her home

Youmu (Life is Death, Half &amp; Half) suppresses a side of her emotions that comes out when shes drunk

Mamizou (The Bakedanuki's Deceitful Bottle) is a schemer

Aya (The Cocktail Party Where the Walls Have Ears) is a relentless newshound

Komachi (Death in the Afternoon) is a slacker. Or maybe it's about how she just shows up wherever her job tells her to go?

So now we have:

Kanako (Mountain and Lake and Naturally Fermented Sake)

Sanae (No Additive Sake of the Wind and Miracles)

Sanae's probably innocent and unaware of all the plot going on, but what's Kanako up to?
