Clarification: Every weapon is playable, and no weapon is inherently bad. And this list isnt for gold/plat/diamonds.

No one hates on Blasters, and the only people that they it sucks TYPICALLY are blasters players
I love Blasters and they’re the most fun weapons to play alongside orb, but they also suck
In one of the comments I put down the criteria used to rank each tier.
Blasters require significantly more movement reads/dodge reads/neutral knowledge to be high on the list, especially when the DPS you get from perfect play is lower than semi perfect play from gauntlets/hammer/scythe.

Every argument I’ve seen about this list seems really stupid and ignorant of the whole point of the post.
It’s for pro play, not playing vs plats/low diamonds. And undeniably the weakest 2 weapons in pro play is lance and guns, at least with lance you get STUPIDLY high DPS for successful initiations.
