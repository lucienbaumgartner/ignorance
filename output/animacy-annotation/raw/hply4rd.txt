You can drs any shares yes but dtc got a rule approved that prevents a company from encourage their shareholders to drs. 

And the brokers are incrntivised to not encourage it either as the brokers rather keep the shares on their books rather than drs

So thats why no one seems to know about drs - everyone with money/power is incentivized to not talk about it. 


The rich and powerful have been very successful at keeping the general public ignorant and poor. IMO.
