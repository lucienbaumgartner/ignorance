Um… remember when you said that thing about how the cartoon tried to make Jewish people “seem good” even though the “actual Jewish people are committing genocide in Palestine.” .. let’s start there.

Yeah… “actual Jewish people” live all over the world. Many of us actively disapprove of what’s going on over there. And here’s the crazy part: there are also Jews IN ISRAEL that disapprove of the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Am I blowing your mind yet??

It’s unclear how much world history you’re privy to but historically the actions of a country’s government/ military aren’t always aligned with the beliefs of their citizens. And ya know.. judging an entire religion off of the actions of a subset is prejudicial, not to mention incredibly lazy. So because Jews are the people in question, this prejudice would qualify you as an Anti-Semite. So, no.. “calling out atrocities against a group of people” is not what makes you anti-Semitic. Your ignorant and simplistic assertion that all Jewish people are responsible for genocide is kinda what influenced that.

But hey ya know, nuance be damned, right? it’s much easier to just lump us all together when you hate us all the same anyway. 

Lemme know if any of this is ~ hard to swallow ~
