600000 people died in the US last year due to a single mismanaged event alone. 

That happened because the general population in the capitalist US is so utterly stupid and ignorant that they voted for a fascist and now voted for a liberal, both of which are two sides of the same (self-)destructive coin.

The only "fortune" the US ever experienced was built on the back of people it exploited through force. Be it native genocide, slavery, oil wars, anti-communist mass murder, etc. All American wealth and success is stolen. You know how there is a stereotype of the "dumb barbarians raping and pillaging peaceful, progressive countries" throughout all of history? The US is the 21st century version of that. Just like the Nazis and Japanese were before them. And here's the thing: In the long term, they lose. Every single time. You know which country always won throughout all of history and has a perpetual history and culture for thousands of years now? China. A pillaging, inhuman shithole like the US is nothing compared to China. Absolutely. Nothing.

The US is a total failure of a nation. It never was good and never will be good as long as its people stay this completely fucking stupid and ignorant. It will continue to crumble while democratic nations with an actually educated society and pro-intellectual culture like China will dominate. All Americans are good for is causing wars and murdering people then stealing from their victims. That's all the US ever did and ever will do until it collapses and socialist revolution has converted it into a free and democratic country. And that point is approaching rapidly as China will not lose in any war the US is planning right now, the best the US can hope for in terms of "winning" is also hurting China in a global nuclear holocaust... but even then China will win. Capitalism always fails.
