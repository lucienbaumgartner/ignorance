If insult comedy makes you feel bad then don't listen to Jim Cornette.  It's what he does, he trash talks people who are putting on poor performances in the type of entertainment that he loves and dedicated his life to.

And he targets individual wrestlers and their on screen performances and their appearance, not entire communities of people. I don't know where people get the idea that he's against all of these entire groups of people because I haven't seen evidence of that. The exception being that he has an issue with Asian women and insists on believing they're all Riho despite being told how wrong and ignorant that is, and I fully agree with you that he's being a racist dumbass there.
