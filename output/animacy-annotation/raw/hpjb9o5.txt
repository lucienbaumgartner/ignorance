This is disingenuous and ignorant of the situation, I was in the guard when this happened.  What people don't realize is the NG and ANG are not like police, they are not primed and ready to jump at short notice.

When 6 Jan went down (and previous year's BLM protests for that matter), there was a mass recall of the guard.  Members had 6-12 hours to arrive for briefing.  After sitrep briefings, they were transferred to the armory in DC to get gear and assignments (which takes more hours), then transportation to their assignment.  

Ignorance of how our National and Air National Guard works has further propagated the lie of "they don't care because it's not BLM".  No one remembers **the exact same thing happened during the BLM riots**, it took over 24 hours to fully moblize.  The events of 6 Jan simply didn't last long enough for the Guard to get significantly involved.  I know because I was there.
