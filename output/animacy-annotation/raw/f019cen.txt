No. Have you never guided a man in with your hands while he's holding himself up or something? Obviously not having foreplay is bad but I think we both know it happens all the time.

Look what's more likely? That a man decided to make a joke about L and R tampons or that he is so stupid and ignorant that he thinks women have two vaginas?

Yes dumb people are common but not nearly as common as jokes that don't land.
