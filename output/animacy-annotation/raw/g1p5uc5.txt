Yes hormones work internally but can be injected externally. Genes don't work the same way. You thinking that shows YOUR limited knowledge on the topic. Whether I can immediately tell has no bearing on this conversation. Say you are a female and you feel you are a man. That's fine. But no matter how you change your appearance, you will always have a double X chromosome pair. That is always a part of you. Your genes control which hormones are released into your body and how much, hormones control the body's growth and functionality. Again you can artificially change which hormones are present and how much of them is present, but your body will always try counteract this artificial change, hence why it's called hormone "therapy". You can get your body used to that change and it may stop trying to counteract it as much but your genetic code will not change as a result. This is important and on any medical paperwork you should still mark female because the original comment was right, you are biologically female. If you try and say different in a medical situation you could potentially get yourself killed. I don't care what gender you want to be, do what makes you happy, but don't be so stubborn and ignorant that you hurt yourself later on down the line.
