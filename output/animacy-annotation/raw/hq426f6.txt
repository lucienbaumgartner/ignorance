Actually almost every neoliberal country has these things already!  Do you live in America by any chance?  America is one of the few neoliberal countries that falls behind in these areas.  I find that Americans tend to be very self-important and ignorant of the policies of the rest of the world. But don't worry, universal health care, taxes on the wealthy, policies aimed at rehabilitation rather than punishment of drug abuse, LGBT+ rights are definitely a mainstay of neoliberal countries - by the numbers, much more so than countries with different economic/political systems.
