Ahh, so you meant disgust not discuss and chose to use equally disgusting words as those you’re disgusted by. You don’t have to use derogatory words to get your point across...perhaps “Reddit soy boys truly disgust me, they’re just brainwashed and ignorant of the facts.” Of course this is your opinion but it might be taken more seriously. Instead of discussing you and what you meant, we could be discussing who said soy boys are, in what aspects they are brainwashed, or your actual stance on our current political atmosphere.

Not trying to lecture you, just pointing out that being less ignorant may be more conducive to a real conversation. Unless of course you’re just going for the “idc what anyone else says, blah blah blah, mic drop!” In that case, go one with your bad self.
