My bad, I wrote it 5 days ago and forgot some of the details, I did indeed mention it. 

I wasn't able to find anything supporting your claims "Critical Race PRAXIS and it's being indoctrinated into the kids with shit like classroom racial segregation and partioning of privileges in the classroom based on race." or to back up your assertion "it's teaching them to FEEL oppressed even though as of now they do not... it's teaching kids to be ashamed of who they are because of who their ancestors were 150+ years ago"

What I do know is parents of black kids have to give their kids "[The Talk](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/28/882383372/a-black-mother-reflects-on-giving-her-3-sons-the-talk-again-and-again)"; so the idea that POC want their kids to be idealistic and unaware that racism is a thing doesn't ring true to me.

You claim "There is a reason why even a lot of POC parents are outraged by this"; but scrolling CERT Protest images I'm hard pressed to find POC in the images, and a quick cjeck of the map of anti-CRT laws overlays nicely with the "Confederate flag" crowd, to bring things back...
