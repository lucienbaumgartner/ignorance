Honestly they're just way too complicated and detailed, but these are the recurring patterns:

1- They make fun of me and/or say stuff that offend me - i respond - they respond - conflict begins. Problem is they hurt me then really go on about their lives, not even slightly affected about what they did to me and how i feel. Im either too sensitive or they're just too cruel, probably both tbh.

2- They are extremely unapologetic and unaware of the mistakes they make, they believe apologizing makes you weak, or sort of "lose" the argument which is extremely dumb. They're also a bit narcissistic. Especially my siblings.

3- They always focus on the bad, they never praise me when i do something good. Its always the bad. Like if you're gonna keep focusing on the bad why don't you give me credit for the good at least.

I know these reasons seem entirely subjective but its the best way i could put it.
