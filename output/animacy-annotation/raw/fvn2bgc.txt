Because it’s subjective. You do more than watch a game. You interact with it. I’ve heard only people say how bad the story is BEFORE the game release or specifically talk about Joel. I’ve heard plenty of people praise the game as well. The point is that you can’t measure something that is SUBJECTIVE as the decisive factor to deduce the quality of media as complex as video games. 

“Boohoo my favorite character is gone and now my one vicarious tie to the story has severed all relatability I had. The game is bad waaaahhh.”

That’s the world of judging games on story merit alone. There’s plenty in TLoU2 to merit calling it a masterpiece or at minimum excellent. Hating a part of the story and judging the whole game as bad is small minded and ignorant. That is all.
