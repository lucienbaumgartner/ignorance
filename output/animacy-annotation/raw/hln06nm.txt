My MILs 8yo golden retriever, who is normally a hyper mess(still very loving, but just doesn’t sit still for very long) had little to no interest my entire pregnancy thus far. However, I went over one weekend (29wks at the time) and he was stuck to me like glue. When I sat on the couch, he climbed up and put his head in my lap/resting on my belly. MIL was a little worried because he can be very clumsy and unaware of his size, but he was oddly gentle, cuddly and calm. It’s really crazy how animals change when they notice hormone differences.
