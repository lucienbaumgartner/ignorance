At the pharmacy that I work at, I of course see many elderly patients. It's scary how often that they have their Social Security card with them. And if not that, then they have their Medicare card with them even if they don't need it. That thing has the Social Security number on it! I try to mention to them the risk of doing that and most are unaware and grateful that I told them. Then, I have a select few who have the attitude of, "Well, I've been carrying it around with me for umpteen years and I haven't had any problems." Well, sorry for caring about your well-being. Those people make me want to yell at them, but I care more about my job than fixing their ignorance. Lol.
