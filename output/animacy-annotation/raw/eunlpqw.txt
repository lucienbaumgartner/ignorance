That's disgusting and ignorant that people would say that. I'm sorry. I lost a lot of weight when I was in college and I remember how nasty it felt--people would whisper about me being anorexic behind my back (they never actually asked though). I'm losing weight again now and while I'm not underweight yet, I can see it happening. I wish people knew that weight gain or loss is related to so many different factors and stop being so goddamn judgemental about it.
