Tu Mujhe Suna from Chandni. Not the song itself but like the scene it takes place in, with the Europeans in the background not understanding what the words they are singing means and probably are assuming Rishi and Vinod are singing about their love for each other and not Chandni lol. 

Or pretty much any song with unaware and confused foreigners in the background looking and getting in on the film-itâ€™s amusing to see their reactions. I love Bollywood lol.
