Oh I completely agree with what you said. I'm just using an old example of how people get treated in retail. This was almost 8-10 years ago the situation I spoke of. The problem though is in retail the management gets into your head as your typically younger and unaware of those rules that are set out. High school kids and university students are unaware of those rules generally speaking and are usually too afraid to speak their minds. Theres alot more fear of loosing your job when your stuck working minimums wage and you don't see a way out to even think of going to a workers rights tribunal
