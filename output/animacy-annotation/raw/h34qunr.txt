&gt;Well I wouldn’t say you’ll miss it, but I would simply say that one day it will permanently stop and you’ll never get it back.

I was at the park the other day watching the sunset when I noticed a man stopped a few feet away from me.  He was leering at me, and vigorously masturbating. 

If I could make the attention go away **today** I would.  However, so long as I am physically fit, it never will.  It will be reduced by a large degree, sure, but to tell me it will go away completely merely displays that you yourself are ageist and ignorant of the existence of GILF fetishes.
