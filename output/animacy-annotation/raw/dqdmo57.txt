Analyzing an opponents power is a pre-requisite to final victory. "Hoes ain't shit" will give you an attractive mindset and is healthy for us all to tell ourselves sometimes, just as a general will scorn the enemy to his troops before a battle. But if that is your core mindset, you will inevitably leave yourself completely defenseless to infiltration you won't even be aware of.

Trust me, a woman's favorite target is an Alpha who is unaware and high off his own shit. That's why most of the "natural" alpha's from your high school are now fat and in shitty marriages.
