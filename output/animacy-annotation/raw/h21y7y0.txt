Aaahhh. Well, I know it has nothing to do with Algorand, and everything to do with Amazon, but markets can still be impacted by bad information or perceptions.

However, to further your point, most people who would actually sell Algos (as opposed to diamond hodling) won't be using the wallet, they'll just leave theirs on Binance or Coinbase- therefore being unaffected and unaware of the issue. People who use the wallet won't sell anyway, and therefore won't tank the price.
