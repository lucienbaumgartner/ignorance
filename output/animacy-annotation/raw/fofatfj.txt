Doctors recomend disinfectants to sterilize non-human objects, and medicine to treat humans. Phototherapy is a real thing but likely useless and irrelevant here. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine showed some promise in one, small study... but are dangerous drugs that treat an entirely different type of infection (plasmodium vs viral), and have killed people. 

Trump tries to repeat what doctors tell him but he’s so wildly uneducated and ignorant that he says the dumbest shit. Then his supporters try to justify it by pointing out the smallest kernel of truth in his mountain of idiocy. You Can dig through cow shit to find kernels of corn but it’s still a pile of shit
