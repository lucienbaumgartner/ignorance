Lol I do. And I fuck with them all the time about it. I call them socialists and hypocrites all the time. The worst part is they genuinely don't realize the job we have would be considered socialism and when I explain it to them they get all flustered and usually try to change the subject. Honestly they and most of America is so uneducated and ignorant that even if you break it down for them they still won't understand. They are so used to being told what to think I believe they forgot how to think for themselves. If it wasn't so destructive to the world I would feel sorry for them.
