&gt; the GOP is going to go extinct

The most dangerous myth in all of politics.

Repeated ad nauseum in the 90s before Bush. Repeated over a decade ago before the GOP took control of Congress. Repeated five years ago before Trump…

It’s just so ill-informed and ignorant of both history and reality.

The GOP dominates state houses across the nation. As a result, they’ve set the terms of engagement via heavy-handed redistricting and voter regulations.

And the bit about the GOP “aging out” is probably the dumbest argument of all. It’s the same dumb argument Baby Boomers made about their conservative elders 50 years ago. 50 years from now GenZ will be mostly conservative and their grandkids will be celebrating the inevitable collapse of conservatism when GenZ dies. And the day will never come.

Rinse. Repeat.
