I don't know anything about cinema techniques, but I can feel an opressive aura through the entire film. Those dark colors, the merciless sun, the arid environment do play well with a tragic story where mexica people try to put an end to their gods wrath, just to realise how indifferent and ignorant of their suffering they are.
