The reason is because animals are innocent in the sense that they aren't human. They are ignorant and innocent and only worry about their material needs like sleeping eating and resting and playing. They aren't as complex as humans, like true human greed, or violence, sure maybe some are violent but they're just animals, cats, dogs, they didn't do anything to deserve any pain or suffering. That's why we feel worse when animals get hurt, it's because they aren't human.
