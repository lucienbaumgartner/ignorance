I think the issue people are having is that a POLICE OFFICER was too stupid to remember taking a bite of a sandwich and having the lack of emotional stability to rationally investigate the situation like you know...a cop would. Yeah people are pissed because someone who is expected to carry a gun did something so fucking stupid and ignorant that were they in any other field would be let go for wasting resources. This is a disgrace to a badge.
