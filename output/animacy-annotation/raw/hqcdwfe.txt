Yep.

You know who I have even less pity for?

People who lie about their vaccination status, and buy fake vaccination cards.

That just means that not only are they willing to put other people’s health at risk, they’re willing to lie to them so that they’re comfortable and ignorant of the fact they’re having their health put at risk.

So all that crying about “HeAlTh DeCiSiOn’S sHoUlD bE PeRsOnAl” was bullshit, because they happily forced *other* people to make decisions about *their* health with information they knew was false.

So yeah. I won’t feel bad if they die of COVID. Sorry. Just hope they don’t end up one of those truly god awful, worst-of-the-worst cases of Long Haul COVID, where they probably won’t be able to walk up stairs on their own without multiple breaks for air, all while strapped to an oxygen tank.

Not even they deserve that.
