Hello! I just wanted to ask for some help with this spread. It's a bit large so thank you to anyone who helps &lt;3 I'm just new and my friend and I could not figure out how to make it make sense for us :) 

Currently, I've been getting a lot of 2 wands/swords/pentacles in my readings about myself and it's made me scratch my head as I don't think I have any choices in front of me- or at least I thought I didn't. So I asked my deck using [this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/835623208437678160/841515835927167017/Screenshots_2021-05-10-23-23-00.png) wonderful spread someone linked in Discord. 

I shuffled and pulled the cards + a subconscious from the deck. 

**What crosses me:**  4 of swords reversed + 2 of swords 

**Option A:** The star reversed 

**Positives of A:** Death 

**Negatives of A:** Queen of Cups

**What do I need to do/change to get to A:** Page of Pentacles Reversed

**Option B**: 2 of Cups

**Positives of B:** 8 of Swords Reversed 

**Negatives of B:** Ace of Pentacles Reversed

**What do I need to do/change to get to B:** Page of Cups

**Advice:** Judgement

**Subconscious:** The Devil Reversed 

My short and lovely interpretation is: 

What crossing me right now is the recovery coming out of rest, or maybe I'm not resting that much and self-love - I might be pursuing someone who doesn't want me- and I'm very blinded and unaware of what I need to do and I know I need to make a choice. 

For option A- I think this is about great disappointment and leaving something I didn't want to and feeling like the world is on my bad side. But, it's good as it's close to a chapter and gives room for rebirth! If I leave though, I might think with my heart too much and might feel clingy and disappointed about my choice. I need to start letting go and taking time away, remembering what I wanted earlier to get to this option. 

For option B- someone or something will offer me a partnership (Friendship? Love? Business..? I am in separation from someone but I don't think this might be pointing to it). If I go with it, I'll be freed and I'll get a new perspective on a relationship with whoever is coming and offering me that cup. But, I might miss a lot of chances I could have had without them and it could be a very rushed and irrational decision without thinking. To accept B, I need to start accepting my emotions being okay with them, and understanding them more. 

Advice: Learn from the past, there are consequences for every action so any choice will have that. 

  
Subconscious: Freedom and reclaiming control! 

Does anyone have anything to add/ remove from my interpretation or could give me guidance to more about what these cards might mean. I think I have a grasp but I'm so confuzzled.
