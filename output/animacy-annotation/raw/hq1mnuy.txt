They spend less on their military than the U.S. does by a yuge margin.  The don't have the graft and corruption that the U.S. does, so they produce better weapons systems for less money overall.  Russia has working hypersonics, while the U.S. can't even get one to drop off the plane.  Why are people in America and the West so ignorant and stupidly jingoistic?  I am constantly mystified by the stupidity of the average American.
