To be fair, the skullcrawlers may just be the type of Titan that can be extremely deadly if they manage to get the jump on you. It might not be that the skullcrawlers defeated the older Kongs in combat but rather that they snuck up and assassinated them.

I'm not sure if that means that a completely unnoticed skullcrawler could assassinate Godzilla but ultimately it doesn't matter because there's a big difference between what a Titan can handle in a fight and what a Titan can be killed by if they're unprepared and unaware of surrounding danger.
