Going to pull a full Colin Cowherd “popular kids become QBs” take here and say that Mikey was the STAR of the area. He was the boy every mom wanted their daughter to marry and the boy ever girl crushed on while every boy was secretly jealous of. He was a multi sport All-Star at every level, he was a high-honors AP student, he was handsome as hell since he was a kid, he was humble and unaware of how talented he was, and he treated every kids parents with the upmost respect..... and now he’s pitching for the Yankees, The most storied franchise in baseball history.... no one deserves it more.
