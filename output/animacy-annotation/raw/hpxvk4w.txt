I'm not at all grateful for my period, it's caused me nothing but problems for years and is completely useless as I don't want children. I think it's perfectly acceptable to not be grateful for my period and not expect to have someone come on to a period sub and tell us to be grateful for having periods. Not to mention plenty folk would love to be pregnant and your comments are so ignorant and small minded.
