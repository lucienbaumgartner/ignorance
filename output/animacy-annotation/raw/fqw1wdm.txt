No kidding, I always get this Tom fuck on my videos asking to be friends.

I don't like sub 4 sub, because atheists end of the day it's the content that holds people.

You  can click bait all you want, you keep that method up and you'll just be another generic buzzfeed  type channel.

I love original content, especially when it's done underground and from the heart.

Sub 4 sub doesn't do shit, it's like a bunch of stupid people trying to lead stupid people. 

But they're also dumb and ignorant that they truly believe what they are doing helps them. No matter how much you argue or debate with them.

Didn't mean to rant but goddamn, all people wanna do is become some bitch ass corporate youtube channel. 

Nobody gives a shot about your clock bait. You get views but they don't stay on your videos. You just end up looking like some faceless corporate America buzzfeed /IGN type of person.

Underground is where it's at! ðŸ’Ž
