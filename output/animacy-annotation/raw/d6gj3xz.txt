Interesting additional info on the film. The director was a survivor of the Hiroshima bombings who lost most of his friends in the tragedy. He made Hausu as an allegory to the horrors of the bomb, with the young girls representing the youth who were unaware and naive about its lasting emotional effects on the country.
ALSO, the studio behind this film was trying to capitalize on the popularity of Jaws and tasked the director with creating a story that fit that vein. The director, however, felt that big scary animals were already saturating the market (especially funny because the studio was the very same that produced the Godzilla films), so he turned to the idea of a monstrous house instead.
