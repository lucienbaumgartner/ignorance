-forced to live in a house you don't own, working a small plot of land you don't own with primitive farming methods

-required to give up most of your surplus beyond subsistence, fight in their wars, and perform additional services throughout the year

-had to ask permission to marry, your kids most likely remaining serfs with almost no chance of social mobility

-generally illiterate and unaware of the world at large, considering it a "big black hole that French people occasionally storm out of"

-rather high risk of death during famine

Like are socialists who consider serfdom to be anything similar to being a worker in a modern day first world country being intentionally hyperbolic, or do they really think it's the same thing?
