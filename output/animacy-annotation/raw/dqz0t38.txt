Uh... nope.

I mean yes, men can be victims of violent crimes, and women can commit violence.  But it's *not proportional*.

 “Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death.” ― Gavin de Becker, The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence 

[If you ask a woman what she is afraid of and what she does to protect herself, she'll give you a list of specifics. Ask a man the same question, and he might not understand what you mean.](http://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/articles/nightmare.html)

If you look at crimes committed directly in response to romantic rejection, the majority of it will be against women or sexual minorities. Not all, but very much disproportionate to the population.  We live in a culture where women wearing the wrong thing is viewed as "asking for it", and if a guy rapes her because he felt entitled to sex from her, the chorus of "what did she expect, dressing like that".  Where girls wearing spaghetti strap shirts to school get sent home to change because bare shoulders might distract the boys. Etc.

It's not that men can't be victims. They absolutely can. And the culture we live in can be toxic to men as well as women.

But the person I was replying to seemed to think that the OP finding the situation creepy was just her being young and naive and unaware, that she was just overwhelmed by the attention.  Which shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it's like being a woman in this society.
