&gt;The majority of the Germany Army, like the people, didn't like Hitler's hate for the Jews

You're so fucking delusional and ignorant that it's scary, antisemitism was the core of Hitler's ideology and Hitler's portrayal of the jews as 'The ultimate enemy' was something all German civilians and soldiers supported to some extent. 

There were tons of German politicians trying to get the country back to shape, Hitler was just the one with the best words and someone to blame for all their misery. 

This is what all of these 'high IQ' wehraboo anime fans believe in and it will eventually lead to them to join alt-right groups. 

Girls und Panzer doesn't tell people to hate jews and love nazis, but it influences the viewers worldview and portraying the nazis and the German army in a positive light will eventually lead to this.
