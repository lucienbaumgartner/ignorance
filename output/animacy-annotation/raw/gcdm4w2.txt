That's literally, bi with extra steps.

As mentioned before, I don't care what genitals are attached to the person.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly what characteristics I exactly find attractive in a person, but genitals sure aren't the deciding factor.

Maybe I'm old and confused and unaware of my exact sexuality, but it was never a problem before.  

Now it just annoys me, that people assume that bi is limited to male and female only.  Bi has always been inclusive of trans.
