How dumb do you have to be to travel overseas and not even know about the tensions between two borders? To not even have a quick check to make sure you’re not touring anywhere that isn’t a potentially dangerous spot? If they really wanted to be educated on this, they would have researched it before they even left their own country. Everyone knows the North Korean Dictator. Even if they were truly curious about the tour guide maybe being related to a Dictator, that’s just a rude and unnecessary question. He has caused a lot of hurt in NK, SK and the world. Sometimes a question is just plain stupid, and people need to know it. They were ignorant, and I would bet money they were sheltered Americans who thought they were making a ‘funny’ joke, or are that unaware and insensitive about the rest of the world they thought that asking if someone was honestly related to a Dictator is an okay thing to do.
