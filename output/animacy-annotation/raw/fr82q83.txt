Omg great plot. Will definitely make a one shot or of this. My idea is, that the police equivalent is understaffed and unaware and approaches the group to help a on a dissappearance. These started after the current lord came to rule out something. Players could also be taken captive or be suspected.

Back to your question: they can  hire anything. My lords had strong barbarian body guards or elite soldiers, personal priests / wizards / guard lions / summoned demons . In the combat, make sure, that the weak bbegs are not there, e.g. they go to a hidden chamber, teleport away, something like that. After the fight they are at mercy of your players and you can see what they do.
