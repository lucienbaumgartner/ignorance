Being influential is not the same as popularity. Don't you realise that if a lot of artists nowadays admit they were influenced by kanye, that means he's influencial? Being as influential as he is in the genre must mean at least some artists find his music "good".
Listen, i'm not a diehard Kanye fan, but labelling his music as non-experimental or bland just seems ignorant and childish.
