Bruh, shut the fuck up with your "woe unto me" internet badass bullshit. I've looked at your post and comment history and it's just full of garbage, contradictory bullshit and I PROMISE that there's not a damn thing you could dare begin to tell me about combat so save that shit for someone that you might could convince to feel some sort of "hero" pity for you. For you to be some hardcore combat vet like you love to present yourself as, it sure does seem silly to me how you've said in posts amd comments before how you, and I quote, "freaked the fuck out" when some friendlies started firing mortars at hostiles and when one of the guys with you simply stepped outside of the truck for a couple of seconds at another time after "months of a boring" reservist deployment. Then only a few days or weeks after you made a post about how you're going "on an adventure backpacking" through some other country for an extended period of time, you post in r/randomactsofpizza or some shit trying to milk how you're a "disabled vet" and wanting someone to feel sorry for you and buy you a pizza. And now with this

&gt;Just from being in combat your cortisol levels increase permanently.

This is not how the "fight or flight" hormone works. Otherwise all I would have to do is sneak up behind someone and clap my hands once and fuck them up **for life.** Cortisol levels rise and fall with stress, they have never, and will never rise and then stay there forever, much less fucking **guaranteed** to happen to every single person that has been in combat, which I fucking strongly doubt you've actually ever stood your ground somewhere exchanged rounds downrange with a hostile considering all of the other bullshit you claim for your own self-gain. 

I get it, my post rubbed you the wrong way because the military didn't set you up for life, but whose fault is it that your lazy ass didn't apply yourself while you were in? YOURS. It's not the Army's fault. It's not your MOS's fault. It's not your "boring deployment" to Afghanistan's fault. And it damn sure isn't "your" PTSD's fault. If anything is causing you anxiety or mental issues these days, it's your fucking drug use. Btw, you may want to remove all of your paraphernalia out of the background before you take pics of your dog and post them online. 

So, I'm sorry that you were too lazy to work out after getting your heart rate up in Afghanistan and that you still, years later, feel stressed out and crippled over it. I'm sorry you're angry because apparently by your comments, you got picked on by other guys while in the military (jeez, I wonder if it could've been because they witnessed your bullshit firsthand), but most importantly I'm sorry that you feel the need and the definitely the right, to talk shit about other service members and claim that anyone that has had an unpleasant experience or sight related to combat is automatically fucked up beyond the ability to function in society when they return stateside and that your bitch ass is so arrogant and ignorant that you don't even see how foolish and offensive that type of bullshit lie could be to some people. Take your fake fucking ass somewhere else. Preferably for a long walk on a short pier.
