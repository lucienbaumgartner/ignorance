&gt;vaccine mandates have been standard since vaccines

You really need to stop reading garbage sites like Vox. In their shit article claiming mandatory vaccines were always a thing in America going all the way back to President Washington, they give one historical example of him mandating that all men serving in the military be vaccinated...one example, the entire article and it was not a mandate on everyone and thus not a mandate.

This virus was immediately compared to the Spanish Flu when it hit and was CONSTANTLY being used as an example of what NOT to do during a pandemic, which is NOT quarantining and NOT vaccinating. Not. Doing. It.

Do not spew out misinformation to me, I am not an anti-vaxxer. If you are going to try to argue against me, come up with something that is not a blatant lie that is going to go over the heads of idiot anti-vaxxers. Lastly, its the selfish and ignorant that wish to use force upon people and take away their choice and its insane to think you have the right to forcefully make a person to take a shot of something or do anything against their will. Its borderline psychopathic.
