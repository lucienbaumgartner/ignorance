To anyone suggesting that there isn't an overpopulation problem, sorry you're all so uninformed and unaware of the world around you.

To the main question. It's totally selfish to have kids. If families could stick to 1-2 kids maximum for a few decades, our species might just be able to survive into the next century. 

If that sounds dramatic to some of you then, when well again, sorry you know so little about the world that's rapidly dying all around you.
