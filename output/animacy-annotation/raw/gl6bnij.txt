That’s understandable. I will mention that I don’t believe demo Buzz to be devoid of all emotion. He clearly feels pride, love, happiness as seen from imposter Buzz and Zurgs relationship. To me, the switch flip is symbolic as a rude awakening/deeper connection with everything around him. Almost like a young kid hitting puberty and realizing they can’t escape being a grown up, Buzz’s switch keeps him innocent and ignorant of the idea that he’s a toy and will someday be stored away, trashed, or broken etc.
