I'm failing to see a situation where someone who puts on a fuck ton of weight and still posts pics of them skinnier has an accurate and healthy body image. Very, very few people will intentionally mislead a person, and it's most often a self-image issue if there's such an extreme variation between pics and reality.

So for the majority of these cases where the difference in weight or attractiveness is slight, then yeah it is your fault for both being unaware and shallow. They posted a picture of themselves they thought looks good, not because it is meant to deceive potential dates.

Quite frankly, this view sounds like you're taking offense to someone liking you. Not every date goes exactly like you want and sometimes there's just no convenient out of a situation. We have a pretty established social standard that says you stay on the date, and then message/call her after saying there wasn't a connection or something like that. Ditching is worse than ghosting in my opinion.
