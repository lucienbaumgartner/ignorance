I’m sorry your schools failed you lol. 

I never said and I certainly don’t believe that Republicans are perfect or that there aren’t people who call themselves Republicans that are racists. I acknowledge there are stupid people all over the political spectrum. I’m not ignoring anything. The idea that Republicans and Democrats suddenly “switched” is patently false.

The Democratic Party is primarily responsible for the establishing the KKK, killing 20 plus million black babies, Jim Crow, and segregation. I don’t know how anyone is trying to dispute that and I’m not sure how any of that is hypocritical. Those are truths. So to call it the “republikkkan” party is silly and ignorant. That is my point you NPCs!
