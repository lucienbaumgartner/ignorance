I think the root of the issue is that it's not just "different"... they've literally ret-conned major personality traits and elements that were canon for these characters, and inserted some wild stuff with no continuity or explanation at all.

E.g.: Miranda was a hugely successful, experienced lawyer, and (according to this show), has done a lot of pro-bono work with immigrants and minority groups... and yet she has no idea how to talk to black people without sounding racist and ignorant? And SATC went out of its way to establish that Miranda was in fact straight, and had rekindled the spark of her marriage and they were very happy... and now in this episode she has suddenly "felt trapped" since "forever".

I mean... wtf?

None of this would matter if it was a brand new property, with new characters. But trying to convince us that this is the same group of women we got to know so intimately in the 90s...? Nuh-uh. This isn't character **growth**. It's character **erosion**.
