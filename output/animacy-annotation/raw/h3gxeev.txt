&gt; Are you Christian?

I grew up Episcopal, but I left the church over disinterest in the question of religion during my confirmation.

We didn't believe demons were real because we didn't take any of the Bible fully literally. Mainline Protestants tend to recognize that the Bible was written by humans and that humans can fail God. The lack of the literal description of any demonic possession in the Bible + the other two legs of the stool of Anglican faith make it pretty clear that demons aren't a thing.

&gt; “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the authorities and the teachers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms”

This is so _not_ a conclusive declaration of the existence of demons. The first sentence is nothing more than a neoplatonic rejection of material conflict in favor of liberation from the material. The second is merely describing the fallen world of man, particularly the _Roman_ world as spiritually corrupt. Reading it as a description of demons is way, way, way too ambitious and ignorant of Paul's context.
