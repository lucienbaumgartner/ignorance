My character happens to be perfect for the setting so I had to share, she's a purple tiefling beast barbarian called the emerald siren long hair but pulled back think like Esmeralda from hunch back hairstyle, curved ram like horns and crocodile scales down the around the left side of her chest, her entire back and over her left eye having one crocodile eye (beast barbarians lore is so cool). She usually wears just an open long ass pirate coat with just one button done at the center and a big goofy green and purple tricorn hat. She's also like absolutely massive for a tiefling height wise. Personality wise she's extremely friendly but in an agressive and kind of intimidating way like a happy drunk who's a bit too touchy and unaware of personal space constantly wanting to start fights but more for a love of fighting then anything negative it's all in good fun. She's a captain normally with a whole crew I designed but she could easily be downgraded to crew member, her ship got blown the fuck up and she's adventuring to make enough money to fix it anyways.
