Fair enough. If you're willing to admit that you're that careless and ignorant of everyone else's thoughts then I understand, it's just your personality. Probably anti-vax with a few dui's under you're belt too if I had to guess. It kinda fits the whole ignorant, not caring about others thing you've got going on. If you're gonna hardcore dance, then do it at a hardcore show. It's expected there.

News Flash: deathcore and metalcore aren't hardcore. Neither is mathcore. Would you hardcore dance at a mathcore show just because it has "hardcore influences"?
