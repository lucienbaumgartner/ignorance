For being so wise I would think you could easily figure out im talking about Trump. I never once debated him winning the 2016 election so not sure why you are bringing that up. I'm clearly only talking about his incompetence and his urge to constantly spew false information while pretending hes protecting your freedoms.

Why the hell are you rambling about history? I don't care if its a republican or a democrat although its very easy to see how insane a larger majority of Republicans are currently so yes ill vote democratic until more competent Republicans can prove they can at least minimum use common sense. I dont need a history lesson about freedom. 

Its not honorable to defy public health policies set in place by people who actually know what they are talking about. Clearly COVID has proven many people to be ignorant and selfish. People in the US have PLENTY of fucking freedoms. Complaining you dont think you should be forced to taking an overall safe vaccine to help prevent more disease and death is insane. Its a minor "freedom" to give up.
