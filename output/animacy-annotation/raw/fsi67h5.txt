Why does he need wireless modules?  


In reality human life is so powerful it can be used to power entire civilisations.  Only within the matrix are the humans kept so subdued and ignorant that they believe that they are merely slightly evolved apes.  Within the matrix humans are powerless.  Within the matrix, humans believe the  universe is limited because simulations are limited.  Within the matrix the universe is so limited that there is even a speed limit on everything - nothing can travel faster than the speed of light!  There is a voxel size limit of simulation of a whole planck length!  Within the simulation, the idea of humans being used as 'batteries' is meaningless because those who only know life within the matrix have no idea how powerful life truly is.

Those science textbooks you believe are true?  They are the science of the limits of the simulation of life within the matrix.     


The world outside the matrix is a much wider vista.  **Life has power.**  You will never understand that using the limited shadow of science of inside the matrix.
