I can’t be bothered to produce any bc it’s not my job to educate you. 

You’re speaking out of your ass. Racism has been documented dating back as far as the rise of Sumerian culture some 5,000 years ago and all the way to present day, period. That’s an undeniable fact. 

Again, your being lazy and asking someone to research for you why your wrong. Perhaps read a little and educate yourself before you post things that make you look ignorant and stupid.

Again, it’s not silly, it’s factual to say that there is an absolute consensus in academia that racism dates back to the earliest recorded instances of inter-race contact and conflict. 

You’re doing a good job of pretending to be knowledgeable but your not fooling anyone who has a basic understanding of history.
