I know a little bit about the industry, but not as much as you and enjoy hearing your insights.  I personally know of only one well that has not been plugged-- in Louisiana, decommissioned around the 1960s.  The oil company had money troubles, and the landowners didn't care about getting it plugged (they were lazy and ignorant of environmental pollution).  As time passed, it was mostly forgotten.  The next generation who inherited the land might correct it now that another oil company wants to drill-- if that company didn't require getting it plugged, it might never happen.  Huge fight right now about who is responsible for the well.  Lawyers on both sides.

So yes, abandoned wells are a problem.  This is a reminder that it's hard to find clean water nowadays (contaminated well water or city water).
