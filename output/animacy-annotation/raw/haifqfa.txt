A simple answer to the question you posed: yes.  Clearly a huge number of people BELIEVE that we have achieved that goal, that the civil rights movement somehow “succeeded”, and that racism no longer exists in America (see: liberals are the real racists rhetoric).  It’s an extremely ironic viewpoint in that it is racist and ignorant of the real struggle that people of color face still face today in America.
