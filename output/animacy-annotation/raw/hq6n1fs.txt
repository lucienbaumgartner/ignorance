I understand all I need to about the camera industry and I literally don’t care. It’s the same as any other modern industry. This is why I didn’t want to get into this with my original reply. Talking about gear with someone that only cares about upgrades and tech is literally pointless because it has no other meaning. I bought something that’s worth the money for me. Maybe it isn’t for you or others because it’s not what you look for in a camera. That’s fine. It’s been absolutely worth the money for me and many others so can you just accept that not everyone that owns a Leica does so for the purpose of vanity? If you can’t I’ve nothing more to say to you other than that you have extremely ignorant and short sighted views of people.
