I really dislike the idea that people in Western countries just think that people who have different opinions from them only have them because "they got brainwashed" and "aren't smart enough to know the truth" as if these 20 year old students at MIT are so stupid and ignorant that they need to be shown the correct way to think. It's really condescending but anyway, I'll just leave it at that.
