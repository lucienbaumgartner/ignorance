I wouldn't want any strange adult talking to my 6yo child.

That being said,any of the people on the registry are there for things like being piss-drunk and urinating in public (public exposure), being 17 and sleeping with their 15 year-old boyfriend/girlfriend (statutory rape), or other minor things that were either accidents or just being young and ignorant that got blown out of proportion. The judicial system isn't perfect. So, there is something to be said about not withholding judgement until you know for sure what someone's story is. 

In a situation like this, though, there's no reason for this man, who is a registered sex offender, to be talking to someone's sic year-old daughter.
