Here is what he said:  

"I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."  

They are content to demean government, which is the opposite of respecting government.  

They are content to drop civics, which means the rules no longer apply.   

They are content to conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.  

"The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly" is an interesting statement.  It is like he is saying that people are less compliant for reasons they do not know.  Like people know that something is wrong, but they do not know what is wrong.  

"This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."  I take this to mean that they use fraudulent polls to influence what people believe.  It is like the prediction that Hillary had an 85% chance of winning.  If that is true, then why bother to show up and vote for Trump?  You may as well just stay home.  

It is some very interesting insight from someone in the know.  I wonder how many children this person has sacrificed to Moloch?
