1.) She’s ignorant. That’s a character flaw.

2.) Her emotions are clouding her judgment and affecting her actions. Yes what she did is reckless but I believe that she believed that no one other than roxxon troops would get hurt.

3.) Once again she’s acting out of emotion not rationally. She feels like miles is betraying her and he’s trying to stop her from seeking her revenge of course she’s treating him like shit. Also the “Miles didn’t become a terrorist when his dad died” is a honestly a horrible argument. If I had no money and I was hungry, sure I might not steal any money or food to get to my goal of eating but that doesn’t stop other people from doing it. People react differently from other people even if the situation is the same.

4.) Once again she is so stubborn and ignorant of course she’s not gonna listen to the person she feels is betraying her. Her intelligence has nothing to do with it. Also the last time she checked the reactor it WAS only gonna affect the plaza  but she doesn’t want to double check because she just wants to get her revenge as fast as possible. She’s not gonna listen to miles because he lied to her and he’s just another obstacle in her way.

5.) To me her redemption and sacrifice worked because it took her actually seeing what she’s done for her to finally realize how blinded she was. That “I’m sorry” really conveyed to me how horrified she was with herself and what she had done. And her death worked for me because if she could at least go out saving the thousands she almost killed maybe the one last person she loved, who was trying to help her the whole time but spat in his face every time, maybe then he’ll know how truly sorry she was and that person he was trying to reach was still there. But that’s just my opinion.

6.) The one thing I will agree with you on. If phin had more time to breath, they could have fleshed her out way more. I thought phin was good but she definitely could’ve been better.
