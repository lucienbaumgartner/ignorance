my man, I've read S&amp;R 3 times so far, I know it left to right, you are quotemining and skimming the book just to try to own me lmao. This conversation "forced" you to open the book? Read to try to understand Marxism man, not to make an argument.

&gt;How did you read about Kautsky and miss the sentence "The state is the  organ of class rule"?

The state as an organ of class rule is indeed one if not the major characteristics of the state, but it isn't the unique feature to define the state. Lenin literally introduces the book with an Engels quote where he explains that the state is an apparatus that even though arises from society it stands/separates itself from it. This separation occurs in the positions of authority of the bureaucracy, the police and the standing army. 

This is the reason why the DOTP, even though remains an organ of class rule, it ceases to be a state in the full sense of the word. Because it abolishes those institutions. Lenin explains this thesis rather vaguely in S&amp;R, fortunately he wrote more thoroughly about it later:

&gt;Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises  *the need for a state* for the purpose of the transition to socialism; but (**and here is where we differ from Kautsky and Co**.)  ***not a state of the type*** **of   the usual parliamentary bourgeois-democratic republic, but a state  like  the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies of  1905  and 1917.**  
My third argument:  *living reality,*  the revolution, has  *already actually* established in our colmtry, **albeit in a weak and embryonic form**, precisely this new type of **“state”, which is not a state in the proper sense of the word.**  
This is  *already* a matter of the practical action of the people, and not merely a theory of the leaders.  
**The state in the proper sense of the term is domination over the people by contingents of armed men divorced from the people.**  
Our *emergent,*  new state is also a state, for we too need contingents of armed men, we too need the *strictest* order, and must  *ruthlessly* crush by force all attempts at either a tsarist or a Guchkov-bourgeois counter-revolution.  
But our  *emergent,*  new state is  *no longer* a state in the proper sense of the term, for in some parts of Russia **these contingents of armed men are** ***the masses themselves,*** **the   entire people, and not certain privileged persons placed over the   people, and divorced from the people, and for all practical purposes   undisplaceable.**  
We must look forward, and not backward to the usual bourgeois type of democracy, which **consolidated the rule of the bourgeoisie with the aid of tho old,** ***monarchist*** **organs of administration, the police, the army and the bureaucracy.**

&gt;And how did you managed to misinterpret "but also  without the destruction of the apparatus of state power which was  CREATED BY THE RULING CLASS" into "let's have no state at all"? Lenin  was CLEARLY referencing the destruction of the Tzarist Russian state and  the provisional government state under Kerensky.. and is NOT against  the working class forming a state... which is the DoTP. 

It's not that hard to understand the point dog, I don't know what makes you miss the entire point. I guess all Kautskyists are this oblivious and unaware of their opportunism.

The proletarian destroys the state machine, establishes a state-commune consisting of the armed workers and this state-commune is what withers way. How is that hard to understand? 

If you read the passage I quoted above you would see that Lenin thought that this new state of the armed workers already existed in an embryonic form. And it would have kept growing with the economic transformation of Russia. This process was of course interrupted, due to mistakes and the circumstances of the time. Also the last sentence! What else do you need?!

&gt; None of this means anything and I have already debunked most of it. 

Yeah, by quotemining and control f-ing. What do you think of these passages? Help me understand them:

&gt; If the workers voluntarily unite their armed forces, this will be centralism, but it will be based on **the “complete destruction” of the centralized state apparatus—the standing army, the police, and the bureaucracy.** Kautsky acts like an outright swindler by evading the perfectly well­known arguments ofMarx and Engels on the Commune and plucking out a quotation which has nothing to do with the point atissue.   
&gt;  
&gt; Hence the need for all bourgeois parties, even for the most democraticand "revolutionary­democratic" among them, to intensify repressive measures against the revolutionaryproletariat, to strengthen the apparatus of coercion, i.e., the state machine. **This course of events compelsthe revolution "to concentrate all its forces of destruction" against the state power, and to set itself the aim,not of improving the state machine, but of smashing and destroying it.** 

Lenin also pointed out the cries of anarchism by the Kautskyists. Some things never change!

&gt; Marx agreed with Proudhon in that they both stood for the “smashing” of the modern state machine. **Neither the opportunists nor the Kautskyites wish to see the similarity of views on this point between Marxism and anarchism** (both Proudhon and Bakunin) because this is where they have departed fromMarxism.   
&gt;  
&gt;Addicts of hair­-splitting criticism, or bourgeois "exterminators of Marxism", will perhaps see acontradiction between this recognition of the "abolition of the state" and repudiation of this formula as ananarchist one in the above passage from Anti­Dühring. **It would not be surprising if the opportunists classed Engels, too, as an “anarchist”, for it is becoming increasingly common with the social­chauvinists to accuse the internationalists of anarchism.** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Neither of those texts say that the workers shouldn't defend themselves  against foreign aggression. Are you to imply that Lenin went against his  own theories? Like dude... 

Bruh. [Read](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/9t7g46/read_nigga_read_template/) the f-ing book!

&gt; It seems you're either a left com or an anarchist... aka for revolution unless it is successful. 

What successful revolution? The revolutions were crushed, and the Stalinists aid in their destruction.

&gt; They were certainly vanquished, but they belong to the fertile series of  all crushed revolutions whose revenge will come, a revenge that can  only be global.
