After my divorce in 2015 I stumbled onto one of those subreddits, not knowing anything about it and it brought me out of my depression because I felt like I wasn't alone anymore and it temporarily helped my brain to move to the next phase of recovery by buying into the false belief that there was something wrong with women instead of me. Some of the memes made me laugh and it got me thinking about things other than my own despair over losing the love of my life. I met other guys who were also recently broken up with and we bonded. Those guys were genuine and we helped each other just by listening. 

I didn't realize at the time the fact that there was a sinister undertone to everything and that there was genuine hatred in some of those people. I didn't realize that they were trying to brainwash me. I felt that it was a support group because I was so naive and unaware of the context surrounding those people. 

Eventually, I recovered and stopped visiting those groups completely. I forgot about it and started dating again, got remarried and have erased that part of my history. It served a purpose at the time, but it never consumed me.

I think this groups attract damaged people and they can draw them in and warp them even more if they aren't careful. Loneliness is a dangerous way to feel.
