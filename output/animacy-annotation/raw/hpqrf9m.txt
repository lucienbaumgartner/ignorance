To me the **worst** thing was the way they changed Goku's personality, he was made to be very stupid and unaware of things/ extremely naive like.

I mean goku was never ever stupid, in the beginning stages of the franchise, Goku was just a bit naive and lacked knowledge about the world simply because he grew up in the mountains and didn't interact with the outside world aside from his grandpa, his character developed overtime and in Z he became a serious grown up man, then suddenly in super he was made extremely over the top silly and naive. specially in the Zamasu/black arc. there are many moments that were so frustrating I was actually annoyed by his behavior because it's over the top unlike Z Goku. 

I don't know if the writer thought that would be amusing to see but it is definitely not.


My other issues was weak writings in some areas, or things that don't make sense. for example in the frieza return arc they implied that golden frieza was potentially stronger than SSB which should've never been the case, also Frieza should not be able to sense Goku's Ki when he is in blue or regular god. 4 months of training and hes stronger than blue? complete nonsense reasoning, either have a better background story or don't make up weak reasoning for things.

There are other issues like this but I don't think I need to mention them because most people are either aware or if this gets too long no one will read it anyway.

Regardless of many issues I think I liked it very much either way, I just wish some minor things to have been done better. if just needed more logically consistent writing. so things make sense.
