"If you tell a child anything often enough they will believe you"

Your argument contradicts itself...
That IS what's happening right now. Children learn from toy aisles and marketing that girls are SUPPOSED to like pink and play with dolls (etc) and boys are SUPPOSED to like blue and play with trucks (etc). 

Changing the colour scheme of toy aisles and making the marketing of each product gender nuetral or more inclusive allows kids to feel comfortable playing with whatever they want because the implicit message of who is supposed to play with what is gone.


Edit: also your comment seems to be both transphobic and ignorant of the Islamic faith so what's up with that?
