I'm amazed by your confidence in dismissing disablity as a weak excuse. I'm not disabled in any way yet I understand that for some people the simple act of standing still is an effort that brings tremendous pain.

You wouldn't be able to tell if someone had some sort of fibromyalgia at first glance, does it mean that their illness is fake? 
They suffer from chronical muscle pain, every single task that seems mundane to you makes them ache and tense for hours, so yes, in a sense playing videogames is a privilege for them.

It must be nice to make "bold" statements about a subject despite being blissfully unaware and ignorant of its ins and outs (not that I claim to be an expert, mind you).

I get that you don't like games getting easier and dumber, neither do I, but the way you word your opinion sure doesn't make you look good.
