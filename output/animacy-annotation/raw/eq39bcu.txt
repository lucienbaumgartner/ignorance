To add on that, If you wanted to as a DM you could consider them as paralyzed for the purpose of the attack roll (0 dex which is a -5 to AC) since they would be unaware and completely unable to dodge as it would hit them before it happened.

You'd probably want to do a stealth roll first though. And they would still keep their base AC and armour bonus, so there's still a *chance* it misses though unlikely. Maybe you missed, or maybe it glanced off their armour not dealing damage.
