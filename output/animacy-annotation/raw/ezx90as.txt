It's weird that I bought one of these shirts too, when I was about 9. It wasn't exactly the same shirt but there were pictures of planes crashing into the WTC all across it.

It's weird thinking about how dumb and ignorant that was, given that I am a muslim living in India. Must have led on a few to believe that I, being a Muslim given the stereotype supported the actions of the terrorists. 

The reason why I choose that particular shirt out of the few I was shown is just as embarrassing. I was basically a nerd kid who felt that I needed to show to the kids my age that I was up to date on the current happenings in the world.
