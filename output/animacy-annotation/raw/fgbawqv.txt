driving is the one thing that puts our lives at risk every day but most people become apathetic and don't realize the danger just like the drunk lady who hit you;  completely heedless and ignorant that we're all connected; we should act like we're connected instead of like nothing matters and living selfishly as if there are no consequences - notice how she was okay with drinking and driving but didn't accept the consequences and tried to put the blame on you?  what an idiot
