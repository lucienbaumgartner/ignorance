This comment section was amazing. The most beautiful and hopeful pictures and stories from others. Wonderful memories of arriving in America for the first time. The vivid recollections of small details from that day. 

You are what I wish we could change in the world.
You sound over privileged and unaware of your immense good fortune to not live in a place that you must flee for your life. 

Please take yourself out with the trash.
