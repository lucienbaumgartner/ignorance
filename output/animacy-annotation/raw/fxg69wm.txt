damn dude that's insane. I was prescribed guanfacine as an adhd med and imipramine which is a tricyclic antidepressant, both at 9 years old, and like you I quit both cold turkey the day after I turned 18. doing that changed a lot about me. I used to be super socially awkward and unaware and that's not really the case anymore, and also I used to be the biggest stoner out of my friend group before I quit and now weed just makes me paranoid. I also have a hard time remembering parts of my childhood, any memory from before I quit feels kind of like a dream or like someone else did the things I did. Also I went thru a year and a half of withdrawals and not feeling like myself anymore. anger, serious anxiety, obsessive/intrusive thoughts, fun shit. I'm 22 now. crazy to hear someone had a similar experience, although imo adderall is prob more intense esp if u started at 3. hope you're doing well now.
