Boycotts are mob rule? Posting bad reviews is mob rule? People expressing their opinion about how a person was so petty and ignorant that they refused to provide their service to someone because god said so? That guy went out if business because society said that his "values" of excluding people based on things they can't change weren't acceptable. And they decided to exclude him because of something he *could* change. I guess if you think that mob rule is people standing up and refusing to let others be discriminated against, then I love mob rule
