Tammy has SO much help from so many different resources.  It's really insulting for her to act like no one helps for her, like she's on her own.  When there are people out there who are in unfortunate circumstances that they can't necessarily change or control, who would give anything for a fraction of the resources Tammy has been alotted.  They'd love to have family that won't give up on them.   

She's very blind, and unaware of how lucky she is in that regard.
