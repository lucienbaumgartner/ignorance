I'm not saying you're wrong about slavery being worse than working at Amazon, but it's also very reductive and ignorant of the struggles of the kinds of people who work at Amazon to say they can just up and quit if they hate their job. Wage slavery isn't as bad as full on slavery, but it's still pretty fuckin bad.
