&gt; No one fucking said its a direct connection

People of your type can never follow along. Go back to the first comment I replied to literally about being "directly" connected to the Internet. That is the context. That is why I mentioned it. Because I can stay on topic.

&gt;But you are also wrong in saying you aren't on the internet.

Me? I never wrote that. What the fuck do you think is happening right now. You don't know what this is about and are making up fake shit.

&gt;you are essentially saying the internet doesn't exist because its a network of networks

The fuck.

&gt;not understanding that if your machine is assigned a public IP address that it is directly addressable from any other part of the internet

You literally gave an example where that was not true. But that is just a dumb as fuck side thing you introduced because you are so desperately contrarian and ignorant of the topic.

The really fucking stupid thing is that you avoid the simple question I asked, because you must understand it exposes your ignorance to answer it. Instead you continue with this unhinged bullshit to do what? Trick me? Convince yourself you know things you don't. FFS
