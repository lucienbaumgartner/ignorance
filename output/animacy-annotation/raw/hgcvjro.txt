I tried to explain that too and got downvoted to oblivion. This sub has really gone off the rails. Ignorant of history, illiterate and ignorant of context. So many posts are of either books that are just objectively bad overall, not just for descriptions of women; or so clearly from a character pov. 

Or that fucking screenshot of Queens Gambit where she’s lounging in underwear and smoking being like, “This is what men think rock bottom is.” Did that dumb fuck watch the series all the way through?

Sigh…
