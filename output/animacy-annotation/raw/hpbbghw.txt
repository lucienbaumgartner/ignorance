That's not the point though, I welcome new technology, there will be commercial flights in some form to space in the next 50 years. The problem is who controls the technology, who chooses who gets to use it and to what end, and who benefits financially from restricting access to other people. 

I might consider down the line some form of cybernetics even, if it was a total and completely my own decision to do so. (A built in breathing apparatus so I can swim without having to breath or wear big clunky diving suit? All for that kinda thing.)

Same with a smartphone, I have the option to go away and get the latest Samsung 21 or whatever the count is up to now. But I don't want one. So I don't get one.

Different story altogether when some external authority is trying to dictate to me where I can and can't go because I don't have the latest version. 

Look at what happened to Tesla for example - he designed free energy for the world. Edison and all his buddies made a concerted effort to shit all over his work and discredit him so they could take his ideas and develop them into the energy industry we know today. Big bucks for them. Imagine what we could do if we didn't have energy bills? 
And also through that unification Tesla was chasing, service to others rather than service to self, it would make possibilities for humanity truely infinite.

Instead, those Edisons are still around today making sure we all stay dumb and unaware of possibility, maintain their profits and keep giving our hard earned money to them. 

I go commando these days so nothing surprises me lol but it's our planet, our species, Earth deserves better than what it's been given and same for the people. My death won't change that. But I'd still like to have left behind some legacy or positive impact on the world before I leave it. So these things do concern me.
