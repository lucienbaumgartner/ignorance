Most people in western society are wage slaves, hurned out, many have dangerous kobs that either lead to injuries accidents or rsi or wearing out their body and backs, they have to eat bad food quickly and cant even eat and drink what they want because they  cant go to the bathroom freely while working.  
Most people are depressed or have been depressed or are in pure denial so they dont ha r to cope because they are blissfully ignorant and unaware , and most experience serious mental health problems.
