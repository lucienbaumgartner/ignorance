I think this is because of the criticism she's received. She's been raked here for her insensitivity and one dimensional writing of marginalized people. She's pretty well known for writing about historical bigotry through the lens of a modern bigot. I mean, the kindest interpretation possible is to suggest she's just ambivalent, ignorant, and so ensconced in white privilege that she doesn't even see her own biases. Sure, earlier novels were written and published 30 years ago... But she's employed racist tropes and disappointingly limited descriptions of POC through the more recently published books too.

I think Bees is a last ditch effort to do better or redeem her image.
