People love to cherry-pick history. Slavery was happening across the planet long before America was even a thing and still in some part exists today. African tribes would conquer other tribes, keep some and sell the rest to English settlers. 

Yes, white people have done fucked up shit but looking at any race and any culture you can find that too.

Saying that one group can't be proud of their skin color but others can is literally racist and ignorant of history especially when not all white people owned slaves during that time. I am of Irish descent, my family was in no position to have slaves and was also discriminated against when coming to America but because I'm white I can be proud my ancestors faced and overcame tough times to make a new better life for them and their families?

Yeah okay. /rant.
