Sure, but that's not the point. People who want one and either have to wait or feel like they have no choice but to but one at an inflated price. I never said i felt that way - I used Twitter alerts and got one for a buddy and got mine from Sony Direct - I'm just saying there are people that feel like they have no choice because they don't want to wait until what now looks like 2023. There is no way in my book that makes them worse than the actual scalpers. No way. It just makes them susceptible and unaware of how you can actually get one.
