A True Master doesn't "Go With The Flow."

The Absolute is not passive and it doesn't "go with the flow." It both IS the flow *and* directs the flow. Those who are disconnected from this are not truly free, but are given the illusion of freedom. Being unaware of the guiding force that directs the All, just means that you are unconscious of its all-pervading influence. The Intelligence and Wisdom behind the unfolding display of existential dominance is incomparably masterful and exquisite. 

The players and moving parts are countless and unaware of the inevitability of the coming mass Awakening and reconnection with the One Living Truth. Even those who ignorantly oppose it only hasten its arrival, in spite of themselves. None of the players in this Cosmic game are more powerful, intelligent or wise than the machinations of the Cosmic Mind.

This assertive force of Truth provides a stark contrast with the passivity of people who call themselves "spiritual" and yet are disconnected with its magnificence. The more connected you are to the One Truth, the more dominant, assertive and powerful you become. If you are not connected with this Truth strongly, you are more easily blown about and influenced by the inferior influences of others. This force has many names. Whether you call it Atman, Brahman, Cosmic Mind, Bodhi Mind, the Source, primordial Living Truth, or something else, it is One. Your proximity to this determines your degree of liberation, whether you realize it or not.

Instead of going against the flow, go with the flow. Instead of going with the flow, become the flow. Instead of being the flow, go deeper and become one with the Director of the flow. Only when you can do this, can you call yourself a true Master.
