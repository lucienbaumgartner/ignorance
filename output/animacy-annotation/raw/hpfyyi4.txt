Agreed with everything up until the end. It's a supposed first world superpower where the middle class is on its way to extinction, and millions of people are below the poverty line, with starving children and no universal healthcare. Also, with the existing system, not only is it required for you to be set up for success, but there is a hard limit on the percentage of the population that could achieve it, since the system is built upon exploitation/theft of the masses. We're also, as a population, frighteningly ignorant and brainwashed. Most humans aren't very bright, but American culture really makes people the worst they can be in a large number of cases.
