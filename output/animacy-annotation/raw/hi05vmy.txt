To be quite honest most fun solution for me would be that PC can't transform back till warewolf is absorbed, and they must continue their adventure as an Trex or throw up Wolfie. 

Regarding it's warforged and it doesn't need to eat or sleep (in genuine way)... This could be funny thing, and a nice nudge for other players not to do it unless they want to remain in whatever they transformed into. Your PC now can't go into taverns to chat up other NPCs, fit trough small spaces are big and unaware of their sorroundings because of the new body. Get weird looks and funny encounters from village folk .... This could be very funny! From kids running away from Trex warforged, to it babysitting same kids while other go and talk with some NPC. 

Just to be "realistic" i would have it roll for constitution save now and then because Wolfie wants to get out, and take 1/2 damage on each fail. Nothing major, just small nuance... Remainder of Wolfie inside.


I think this is a great opportunity for charachter development. Like how to resume life after amputation or some major change in life.
