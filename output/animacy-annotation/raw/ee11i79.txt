Regarding the optimist's dialogue, I think it would have been better if he had responded more positively - in this sense you've made him out to be a generally average dude - perfectly fine, but doesn't really fit the "Optimist that wants to be friends with everyone".   


For example, I'd have gone something more:  


"Why do you think that having at least one study partner for every class is necessary? â€¦"   


"Because it's fun! With more people around you learn about more interesting things, and you learn more about them at the same time!"  


I can understand the genius being more accusatory and unaware that his words could be too curt or rude, but the optimist being immediately defensive felt a bit off to me
