FUCCK THISS! I have been through this hell.

I spent 5 years with a cluster B accepting shame and blame from her when she was unhappy but when I explained my issues it was always "I don't understand" until I phrased it in such a way that she could exploit it and benefit. Anytime I would try and do anything for myself that would inconvenience her it was a whole day of fighting but when she said jump...well you know the rest.

Did couples counselling, I tried reallly hard, listen and accepted my flaws, tried to improve, supported her through bankruptcy and her degree (I bought a house but it was in both our names 3 years later) and I am now left with nothing but low self esteem and a ton of debt.

I was naive and unaware of life, I figured that someone who was like me couldn't be bad, there was red flags but I was wearing my rose coloured glasses.
