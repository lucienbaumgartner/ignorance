And that's exactly what's dumb, smartypants. Criticizing "the government", rather than specific policies.

You don't give a fuck about the fact that there are good and bad parts about their, or any, government. "It's Chinese so it's bad". You give no notion to context, circumstances, culture, and trajectories. You pretend that you "know what the US did" but you wouldn't hate them blindly ; but because we're talking about China, blind hate is completely acceptable. And hey, look at that, you're getting all the upvotes from other redditors, so you must be right !

The majority of Reddit has this utterly stupid belief that hating China as a country, but not individual Chinese people, isn't racism. As if it's not still discrimination based on nationality and not facts ! That's not surprising given how fundamentally dumb, arrogant, interculturality unaware, and incapable of viewing things from someone else's point of view they are, though. Not surprising, but still disgusting.
