I agree. I couldn't cut ties with her. I feel a deep gratitude and obligation towards them both until the day they die. She is not monstrous at all. Simply, simple minded and unaware of how anything she says or does affects people. She doesn't have friends for longer than 6 months and none of her children enjoy her presence. But we love her.
