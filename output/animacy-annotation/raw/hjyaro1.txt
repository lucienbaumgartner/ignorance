Just thinking about taking over the milky way as a race sounds crazy once you get a feeling for the size. I remember thinking "Man.. at some point we'll have the whole universe covered". Now, knowing that we most likely wont even reach a different galaxy than our own, not to mention a galaxy outside of our cluster, it's insane how naive and ignorant that thought was.  


However I hope that current theories are wrong about the end of the universe. It'd be such a shame if all the living species go towards their inevitable death. Not to mention that we'll never be able to meet most of them due to the galaxies-drifting-apart problem (that almost sounds like a poor name scientists would choose).
