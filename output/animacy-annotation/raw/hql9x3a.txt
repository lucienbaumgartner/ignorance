Name the ignorance hes spouted.

Narcissism refers to extreme self involvement to the degree that it makes said narcissist ignore the needs of those around them. To equate an egotistical cocky man to a narcissist is frankly ignorant and inaccurate, as hes shown time and time again hes done more than enough to tend to the needs of those he cares about.

"But he has access to more money and support to get the help he needs"

First off, money can't solve mental illness, it simply can't, some people just can't be treated. Hes tried to get help all throughout his life, hes been on meds multiple times, has a psychiatrist, therapist etc. To say he isn't trying to get help is bullshit, and just what you want to believe so you can continue to hate on him.

Second off, have you not stopped to think money makes his condition worse? I mean if he wasn't successful, his mother would of never gotten that fatal plastic surgery which he blamed himself for. Would he not be more stressed, as a mentally unstable individual to have such a large amount of money?

"But he isn’t a role model" 

Maybe not to you, but to millions of others he is, hes inspired me to take many steps in my life. And lets just act now like hes a horrible person, can a horrible person not be a role model? Can you not learn from a horrible person?

"He isn’t even a good person at the end of the day."

How so? What has he done that makes him as a person just horrible? Is it not a negative reflection of you to just blindly despise someone and attack their character?

"He’s just refusing all help" 

Hes not, but you never bothered to do any research anyway lol.
