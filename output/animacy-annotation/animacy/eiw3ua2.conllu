105	but	_
106	in	_
107	some	(32
108	battle	32)
109	Sylvanas	(13)
110	raised	_
111	a	(34
112	bunch	_
113	of	_
114	human	_
115	soldiers	_
116	that	_

118	just	_
119	died	34)
120	and	_
121	they	(34)
122	immediately	_
123	started	_
124	attacking	_
125	those	(13
126	they	(34)
127	had	_
128	fought	_
129	beside	13)
130	.	_
131	Now	_
132	apparently	_
133	this	(38)
134	still	_
135	was	_
136	n't	_
137	mind	(40(39)
138	control	40)
139	and	_
140	they	(34)
141	where	_
142	just	_
143	confused	_
144	by	_
145	suddenly	_
146	being	_
147	thrust	_
148	into	_
149	undeath	(22)
150	without	_
151	any	(43
152	warning	43)
153	and	_
154	therefore	_
155	struck	_
156	out	_
157	at	_
158	anyone	(44
159	around	_
160	them	(34)44)
161	.	_
162	Now	_
163	this	(38)
164	is	_
165	a	(38
166	pretty	_
167	iffy	_
168	explanation	38)
169	but	_
170	I	(2)
171	can	_
172	accept	_
173	it	(38)
174	,	_
175	though	_
176	not	_
177	very	_
178	happy	_
179	about	_
180	it	(38)
181	.	_
182	The	(51
