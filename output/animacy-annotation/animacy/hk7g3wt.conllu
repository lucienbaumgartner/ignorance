2	thanks	_
3	!	_
4	I	(2)
5	appreciate	_
6	the	(3
7	examples	3)
8	although	_
9	I	(2)
10	ca	_
11	n't	_
12	really	_
13	relate	_
14	.	_
15	What	_
16	is	_
17	interesting	_
18	here	_
19	is	_
20	that	_
21	you	(5)
22	told	_
23	her	(6)
24	what	_
25	you	(5)
26	wanted	_
27	and	_
28	she	(6)
29	still	_
30	did	_
31	n't	_
32	do	_
33	it	(9)
34	.	_
35	I	(2)
36	like	_
37	to	_
38	think	_
39	I	(2)
40	would	_
41	n't	_
42	do	_
43	that	_
44	if	_
45	someone	(12)
46	explicitly	_
47	told	_
48	me	(2)
49	the	(14
50	problem	14)
51	but	_
52	I	(2)
53	do	_
54	n't	_
55	know	_
56	.	_
57	I	(2)
58	'm	_
59	curious	_
60	to	_
61	hear	_
62	the	(17
63	same	_
64	story	17)
65	from	_
66	her	(19(6)
67	perspective	19)
68	.	_
69	I	(2)
70	think	_
71	my	(14(2)
72	main	_
73	problem	14)
74	,	_
75	and	_
76	probably	(6
77	hers	_
78	as	_
79	well	6)
80	,	_
81	is	_
82	that	_
83	I	(2)
84	'm	_
85	socially	_
86	unaware	_
87	and	_
88	completely	_
89	oblivious	_
90	to	_
91	the	(25
92	world	25)
93	around	_
94	me	(2)
95	.	_
96	I	(2)
97	also	_
98	take	_
99	things	(28)
100	at	_
101	face	(29
102	value	29)
103	instead	_
104	of	_
105	trying	_
106	to	_
107	pay	_
108	more	(30
109	attention	30)
110	to	_
111	what	_
112	's	_
113	really	_
114	going	_
115	on	_
116	.	_
117	I	(2)
118	bet	_
119	her	(19(6)
120	perspective	_
121	on	_
122	these	(34
123	situations	19)34)
124	is	_
125	quite	_
126	different	_
127	,	_
128	not	_
129	that	_
130	it	(19)
131	's	_
132	correct	_
133	.	_
134	For	_
135	example	_
136	,	_
137	I	(2)
138	had	_
139	a	(37
140	friend	_
141	who	_
142	helped	_
143	me	(2)
144	get	_
145	my	(40(2)
146	job	37)40)
147	but	_
148	I	(2)
149	ended	_
150	up	_
151	on	_
152	her	(43(6)
153	team	43)
154	and	_
155	she	(6)
156	bitched	_
157	about	_
158	how	_
159	bad	_
160	her	(46(6)
161	boss	46)
162	was	_
163	and	_
164	apologized	_
165	that	_
166	I	(2)
167	ended	_
168	up	_
169	with	_
170	him	(46)
171	,	_
172	too	_
173	.	_
174	But	_
175	then	_
176	,	_
177	once	_
178	I	(2)
179	started	_
180	my	(40(2)
181	job	40)
182	,	_
183	she	(6)
184	was	_
185	friendly	_
186	and	_
187	kind	_
188	to	_
189	the	(46
190	boss	46)
191	.	_
192	It	(40)
193	blew	_
194	my	(56(2)
195	mind	56)
196	.	_
197	I	(2)
198	never	_
199	would	_
200	've	_
201	guessed	_
202	she	(6)
203	did	_
204	n't	_
205	like	_
206	him	(46)
207	from	_
208	how	_
209	she	(6)
210	was	_
211	acting	_
212	to	_
213	him	(46)
214	.	_
215	I	(2)
216	get	_
217	that	_
218	he	(46)
219	's	_
220	the	(46
221	boss	46)
222	but	_
223	it	(40)
224	still	_
225	took	_
226	me	(2)
227	aback	_
228	.	_
229	I	(2)
230	actually	_
231	distanced	_
232	myself	(2)
233	from	_
234	her	(6)
235	after	_
236	that	_
237	because	_
238	if	_
239	she	(6)
240	was	_
241	talking	_
242	behind	_
243	her	(72(6)
244	bosses	72)
245	back	_
246	,	_
247	she	(6)
248	probably	_
249	was	_
250	talking	_
251	behind	_
252	my	(75(2)
253	back	75)
254	too	_
255	and	_
256	I	(2)
257	did	_
258	n't	_
259	want	_
260	that	(75)
261	.	_
262	Things	(78
263	like	_
264	this	78)
265	are	_
266	typical	_
267	but	_
268	I	(2)
269	have	_
270	a	(80
271	hard	_
272	time	_
273	finding	_
274	the	(81
275	nuances	_
276	between	_
277	fake	(82
278	friendliness	82)
279	and	_
280	real	(84
281	friendliness	80)81)84)
282	until	_
283	it	(84)
284	's	_
285	too	_
286	late	_
287	.	_
288	Like	_
289	I	(2)
290	'll	_
291	only	_
292	notice	_
293	if	_
294	it	(84)
295	's	_
296	blatantly	_
297	obvious	_
298	but	_
299	the	(88
300	relationship	88)
301	is	_
302	usually	(89
303	beyond	_
304	repair	89)
305	once	_
306	it	(84)
307	gets	_
308	to	_
309	that	(91
310	point	91)
311	.	_
312	Another	(92
313	thing	_
314	I	(2)
315	have	_
316	to	_
317	work	92)
318	on	_
319	though	_
320	that	_
321	reading	_
322	your	(95(5)
323	post	95)

325	me	(2)
326	:	_
327	finding	_
328	a	(97
329	balance	97)
330	.	_
331	I	(2)
332	have	_
333	like	_
334	2	(99
335	modes	99)
336	,	_
337	one	(100)
338	is	_
339	confident	_
340	and	_
341	comfortable	_
342	.	_
343	This	(101)
344	is	_
345	when	_
346	I	(2)
347	'm	_
348	being	_
349	myself	(2)
350	but	_
351	end	_

386	it	(101)
