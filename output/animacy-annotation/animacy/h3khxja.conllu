14	!	_
15	As	_
16	you	(2)
17	said	_
18	,	_
19	I	(6)
20	would	_

23	that	_
24	your	(8(2)
25	partner	8)
26	is	_
27	already	_
28	aware	_
29	of	_
30	this	_
31	,	_
32	at	(9
33	least	_
34	to	_
35	a	_
36	point	9)
37	.	_
38	It	(10)
39	seems	_
40	strange	_
41	to	_
42	me	(6)
43	that	_
44	he	(8)
45	never	_
46	brought	_
47	it	(13)
48	up	_
49	formally	_
50	,	_
51	when	_
52	you	(2)

54	so	_
55	receptive	_
56	to	_

61	is	_
62	also	_
63	just	_
64	familiar	_
65	with	_
66	the	(17
67	lifestyle	17)
68	,	_
69	but	_
70	not	_

76	I	(6)
77	was	_
78	in	_
79	a	(22
80	similar	_
81	situation	_
82	,	_
83	where	_
84	I	(6)
85	have	_
86	always	_
87	wanted	_
88	more	_
89	than	_
90	a	(24
91	normal	_
92	relationship	22)24)
93	.	_
