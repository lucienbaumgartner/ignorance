22	over	_
23	to	_
24	“	_
25	say	_
26	hello	_
27	.	_

29	I	(2)

44	going	_
45	to	_
46	be	_
47	a	(13
48	pretty	_
49	normal	_
50	thing	13)
51	.	_
52	I	(2)
53	imagined	_
54	we	(15)
55	would	_
56	catch	_
57	up	_
58	for	_
59	a	(16
60	bit	16)

73	But	_
74	I	(2)
75	got	_
76	there	_
77	and	_
78	she	(5)
79	seemed	_
80	really	_
81	happy	_
82	to	_
83	see	_
84	me	(2)
85	which	_
86	was	_
87	a	_
88	little	_
89	odd	_
90	since	_
91	I	(2)
92	did	_
93	n’t	_
94	really	_
95	know	_
96	her	(5)

102	n’t	_
103	going	_
104	to	_
105	question	_
106	her	(27(5)

109	.	_
110	After	_

112	up	_
113	a	(16
114	bit	16)
115	she	(5)
116	asks	_
117	me	(2)
118	if	_
119	I	(2)
120	had	_
121	eaten	_
122	breakfast	(32)
123	,	_
124	I	(2)
125	had	_
126	n’t	_
127	so	_
128	I	(2)
129	said	_
130	no	_
131	and	_
132	she	(5)
133	asks	_

141	,	_
142	and	_
143	basically	_
144	make	_
145	breakfast	(32)
146	.	_
147	That	(40)
148	probably	_
149	seems	_
150	odd	_

152	anyone	(41
153	who	_

155	me	(2)41)
156	knows	_
157	I	(2)
158	cook	_

165	breakfast	(32)
166	and	_
167	I	(2)
168	’m	_
169	still	_
170	blissful	_

178	some	(48
179	serious	_
180	hints	48)
181	.	_
182	I	(2)
183	thought	_
184	she	(5)
185	was	_
186	laughing	_
187	at	_
188	my	(52(2)
189	stupid	_
190	jokes	52)
191	a	_
192	little	_
193	too	_
194	much	_
195	but	_
196	brushed	_
197	all	(53
198	that	53)
199	aside	_
200	.	_
201	After	_
202	breakfast	(32)
203	she	(5)
204	cleans	_
205	up	_
206	the	(56
207	kitchen	56)
208	and	_

213	to	_
214	go	_
215	to	_
216	her	(59(5)
217	room	59)
218	and	_
219	watch	_
220	a	(60
221	movie	60)
222	.	_
223	Naturally	_
224	I	(2)
225	say	_
226	yes	_
227	,	_
228	at	_
229	this	(62
230	point	62)
231	I	(2)
232	’m	_
233	beginning	_
234	to	_
235	wonder	_
236	if	_
237	there	_
238	is	_
239	something	(64
240	more	64)
241	to	_
242	this	(65
243	visit	65)
244	.	_
245	So	_
246	we	(15)
247	go	_
248	upstairs	_
249	and	_
250	I	(2)
251	’m	_
252	watching	_
253	whatever	_
254	on	_
255	her	(69(5)
256	bed	69)

260	begins	_
261	to	_
262	rub	_
263	against	_
264	mine	(2)
265	and	_
266	I	(2)
267	finally	_
268	understand	_
269	what	_
270	’s	_
271	happening	_
272	.	_
273	It	(74)
