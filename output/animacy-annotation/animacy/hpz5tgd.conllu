1	there	_
2	,	_
3	I	(2)
4	wanted	_
5	to	_
6	reach	_
7	out	_
8	because	_
9	what	_
10	you	(3)
11	're	_
12	experiencing	_
13	is	_
14	very	_
15	similar	_
16	to	_
17	how	_
18	the	(4
19	last	_
20	few	_
21	years	4)
22	have	_
23	looked	_
24	for	_
25	me	(2)
26	.	_
27	I	(2)
28	was	_
29	in	_
30	denial	(7)
31	about	_
32	a	(10
33	lot	_
34	of	_
35	my	(2)
36	abuse	10)
37	,	_
38	and	_
39	even	_
40	when	_
41	my	(12(2)
42	therapist	12)
43	talked	_
44	about	_
45	CPTSD	(13)
46	it	(10)
47	was	_
48	never	(15
49	with	_
50	enough	_
51	focus	_
52	for	_
53	me	(2)
54	to	_
55	really	_
56	realize	_
57	that	_
58	diagnosis	(17)
59	could	_
60	explain	_
61	almost	(18
62	everything	15)18)
63	.	_
64	Though	_
65	I	(2)
66	had	_
67	a	(20
68	lot	_
69	of	_
70	intrusive	_
71	thoughts	_
72	growing	_
73	up	20)
74	,	_
75	and	_
76	much	_
77	of	_
78	the	(21
79	discomfort	21)
80	/	_
81	pain	(23
82	I	(2)
83	do	_
84	now	23)
85	,	_
86	I	(2)
87	did	_
88	n't	_
89	know	_
90	what	_
91	it	(26)
92	was	_
93	caused	_
94	by	_
95	exactly	_
96	,	_
97	I	(2)
98	just	_
99	had	_
100	some	(28
101	vague	_
102	and	_
103	muddled	_
104	notions	28)
105	,	_
106	a	(28
107	very	_
108	foggy	_
109	memory	28)
110	.	_
111	As	_
112	I	(2)
113	got	_
114	older	_
115	/	_
116	smarter	_
117	,	_
118	I	(2)
119	started	_
120	putting	_
121	things	(32)
122	together	_
123	,	_
124	and	_
125	once	_
126	that	(33
127	stuff	33)
128	was	_

140	all	_
141	I	(2)
142	could	_
143	think	_
144	about	_
145	.	_
146	I	(2)
147	had	_
148	constant	(40
149	flashbacks	40)
150	and	_
151	could	_
152	focus	_
153	on	_
154	little	_
155	else	_
156	.	_
157	It	_
158	sounds	_
159	to	_
160	me	(2)
161	like	_
162	you	(3)
163	're	_
164	in	_
165	a	(43
166	similar	_
167	phase	_
168	of	_
169	acceptance	(44)43)
170	.	_
171	I	(2)
172	never	_
173	could	_
174	have	_
175	imagined	_
176	it	(46)
177	changing	_

181	it	(46)
182	seemed	_

184	I	(2)
185	'd	_
186	have	_
187	hundreds	(40

190	in	_
191	just	(51
192	a	_
193	few	_
194	hours	51)
195	,	_
196	it	(46)
197	left	_
198	me	(2)
199	keyed	_
200	up	_
201	and	_
202	full	_
203	of	_
204	panic	(54)
205	.	_
206	I	(2)
207	always	_
208	felt	_
209	like	_
210	everything	(18)
211	was	_
