10	and	_
11	went	_
12	through	_
13	the	(7
14	list	_
15	of	_
16	names	(8)7)
17	to	_
18	find	_
19	the	(9
20	most	_
21	vulnerable	_
22	one	9)
23	.	_
24	I	(3)
25	found	_
26	one	(11)
27	after	_
28	around	(12
29	2	_
30	hours	12)
31	.	_
32	It	(13)
33	was	_
34	a	(14

36	-	_
37	year	_
38	-	_
39	old	_
40	man	_
41	130	(15
42	pounds	14)15)
43	and	_
44	had	_
45	diabetes	(16)
46	.	_
47	I	(3)
48	knew	_
49	that	_
50	he	(14)
51	would	_
52	put	_
53	up	_
54	little	(19
55	resistance	19)
56	since	_
57	he	(14)
58	was	_
59	weak	_
60	and	_
61	legally	_
62	not	_
63	allowed	_
64	to	_
65	own	_
66	a	(21
67	gun	21)
68	.	_
69	That	(2

73	over	_
74	to	_
75	his	(25(14)
76	house	25)
77	and	_
78	scouted	_
79	out	_
80	a	(26
81	couple	_
82	of	_
83	potential	_
84	entry	_
85	points	26)
86	.	_
87	I	(3)
88	finally	_
89	decided	_
90	to	_
91	push	_
92	in	_
93	the	(29
94	hall	(28)
95	fan	29)
96	in	_
97	one	(9
98	of	_

100	1st	_
101	story	(31)
102	windows	9)32)
103	,	_
104	and	_
105	I	(3)
106	waited	_
107	until	_
108	all	(34
109	the	_
110	lights	_
111	in	_
112	the	(35
113	neighborhood	34)35)
114	were	_
115	out	_
116	before	_
117	doing	_
118	so	_
119	.	_
120	Once	_
121	I	(3)
122	got	_
123	inside	_
124	the	(25
125	house	25)
126	I	(3)
127	looked	_
128	around	_
129	for	_
130	any	(39
131	potential	_
132	animals	39)
133	.	_
134	I	(3)
135	had	_
136	completely	_
137	forgotten	_
138	to	_
139	check	_
140	if	_
141	he	(14)
142	had	_
143	any	(42
144	dogs	42)
145	,	_
146	but	_
147	luckily	_
148	I	(3)
149	did	_
150	n't	_
151	see	_
152	any	(14)
153	.	_
154	I	(3)
155	started	_
156	down	_
157	the	(46
158	hallway	46)
159	and	_
160	went	_
161	up	_
162	the	(47
163	stairs	47)
164	.	_
165	I	(3)
166	stepped	_
167	on	_
168	the	(49
169	edge	_
170	of	_
171	each	(50
172	step	49)50)
173	so	_
174	as	_
175	not	_
176	to	_
177	make	_
178	any	(51
179	noise	51)
180	.	_
181	Once	_
182	I	(3)
183	came	_
184	to	_
185	the	(53
186	bedroom	53)
187	,	_
188	I	(3)
189	saw	_
190	that	_
191	his	(56(14)
192	door	56)
193	was	_
194	wide	_
195	open	_
196	and	_
197	that	_
198	I	(3)
199	could	_
200	see	_
201	him	(14)
202	laying	_
203	there	_
204	quiet	_
205	and	_
206	unaware	_
207	of	_
208	the	(59
209	fate	_
210	that	_
211	was	_
212	to	_
213	befall	_
214	him	(14)59)
215	.	_
216	I	(3)
217	pulled	_
218	out	_
219	my	(63(3)
220	knife	63)
221	and	_
222	stepped	_
223	quietly	_
224	into	_
225	the	(64
226	room	64)
227	.	_
228	I	(3)
229	walked	_
230	right	_
231	up	_
232	to	_
233	him	(14)
234	and	_
235	reached	_
236	over	_
237	holding	_
238	the	(63
239	knife	63)
240	to	_
241	his	(69(14)
242	throat	69)
243	.	_
244	By	_
245	this	(70
246	point	70)
247	he	(14)
248	was	_
249	awake	_
250	,	_
251	but	_
252	he	(14)
253	and	_
254	I	(73
255	both	73)
256	knew	_
257	that	_
258	if	_
259	he	(14)
260	screamed	_
261	I	(3)
262	would	_
263	cut	_
264	out	_
265	his	(77(14)
266	vocal	_
267	cords	77)
268	.	_
269	I	(3)
270	sat	_
271	there	_
272	for	_
273	a	_
274	while	_
275	feeling	_
276	him	(14)
277	quiver	_
278	under	_
279	my	(81(3)
280	arm	81)
281	,	_
282	but	_
283	then	_
284	I	(3)
285	knew	_
286	what	_
287	I	(3)
288	had	_
289	to	_
290	do	_
291	.	_
292	I	(3)
293	raised	_
294	up	_
295	the	(63

297	and	_
298	stabbed	_
299	him	(14)
300	as	_
301	much	_
302	as	_
303	I	(3)
304	physically	_

317	dead	_
318	,	_
319	but	_
320	part	_
