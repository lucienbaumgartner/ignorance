6	.	_
7	This	(3)
8	sounds	_
9	similar	_
10	to	_
11	my	(6(2)
12	experience	6)
13	.	_
14	We	(7)
15	were	_

19	investigated	_
20	those	(9

24	,	_
25	but	_
26	it	(10)
27	was	_
28	always	(11
29	in	_
30	the	_
31	context	_
32	of	_
33	talking	11)
34	about	_
35	how	_
36	some	(12
37	evil	_
38	people	12)
39	did	_
40	n't	_
41	want	_
42	to	_
43	listen	_
44	to	_
45	the	(13

51	up	_
52	things	(14)
53	to	_
54	say	_
55	that	_
56	it	(10)
57	was	_

59	written	_

63	Questioning	_

65	the	(13

67	came	_
68	from	_
69	where	_
70	your	(18(17)

73	it	(13)

75	from	_
76	was	_
77	tantamount	_
78	to	_
79	questioning	_
80	God	(20)
81	himself	_
82	.	_
83	I	(2)
84	was	_
85	pretty	_
86	far	_
87	removed	_
88	from	_
89	the	(3

91	by	_
92	the	_
93	time	_
94	I	(2)
95	started	_
96	to	_
97	really	_
98	doubt	_
99	that	_
100	the	(13
101	Bible	13)
102	was	_
103	divinely	_
104	inspired	_
105	though	_
106	.	_
107	A	(25
108	lot	_
109	of	_
110	pastors	_
111	in	_
112	the	(3

114	were	_
115	raised	_
116	in	_
117	it	(13)

125	.	_
126	So	_
127	they	(25)
128	've	_
129	probably	_
130	had	_
131	same	(30

147	scared	_
148	of	_
149	them	(25)
150	like	_
151	how	_
152	I	(2)
153	was	_

155	That	(36)
156	's	_
157	no	(36

173	it	(36)
174	helps	_

179	I	(2)
180	probably	_
181	did	_

186	of	_
