0	Ok	_
1	,	_
2	you	(2)
3	’re	_
4	right	_
5	about	_
6	that	_
7	.	_
8	To	_
9	me	(3)
10	the	(4
11	Proclamation	4)
12	makes	_
13	it	(5)
14	seem	_
15	like	_
16	gender	(6)
17	is	_
18	more	_
19	cut	_
20	and	_
21	dry	_
22	than	_
23	it	(5)
24	is	_
25	in	_
26	actuality	_
27	.	_
28	But	_
29	maybe	_
30	that	(4)
31	’s	_
32	just	(9
33	me	9)
34	.	_
35	I	(3)
36	was	_
37	pretty	_
38	young	_
39	and	_
40	unaware	_
41	of	_
42	a	_
43	lot	_
44	of	_
45	things	_
46	when	_
47	it	(4)
48	first	_
49	came	_
50	out	_
51	so	_
52	I	(3)
53	always	_
54	thought	_
55	“	_
56	yeah	_
57	,	_
58	of	_
59	course	_
60	,	_
61	our	(6(13)
62	gender	6)
63	is	_
64	our	(6(13)
65	gender	6)
66	,	_
67	that	(4)
68	’s	_
69	an	(4
70	easy	_
71	one	4)
72	”	_
73	.	_
74	Then	_
75	I	(3)
76	learned	_
77	more	_
78	about	_
79	how	_
80	often	_
81	it	(20)
82	is	_
83	n’t	_
84	so	_
85	simple	_
86	for	_
87	people	(21)
88	.	_
89	It	(22)
90	’s	_
91	a	(23
92	hard	_
93	thing	23)
94	to	_
95	figure	_
96	out	_
97	how	_
98	to	_
99	believe	_
100	in	_
101	the	(25
102	proclamation	(24)
103	doctrine	_
104	,	_
105	which	_
106	makes	_
107	it	(26)
108	seem	_
109	so	_
110	simple	25)
111	when	_
112	it	(26)
113	is	_
114	actually	_
115	pretty	_
116	complex	_
117	when	_
118	dealing	_
119	with	_
120	issues	(28
121	of	_
122	non-obvious	(6
123	gender	6)
124	or	_
125	non-cis-gendered	(31
126	people	28)31)
127	.	_
128	Again	_
129	,	_
130	this	(22)
131	is	_
132	just	(22
133	my	(3)
134	opinion	22)
135	,	_
136	but	_
137	to	_
138	me	(3)
139	the	(36
140	wording	_
141	of	_
142	the	(4
143	proclamation	36)4)
144	implies	_
145	that	_
146	each	(38
147	person	38)
148	will	_
149	know	_
150	whether	_
151	they	(39)
152	are	_
153	a	(39(39
154	son	39)
155	or	_
156	daughter	(42)39)
157	and	_
158	that	(4)
159	wo	_
160	n’t	_
161	change	_
162	which	_
163	makes	_
164	it	(44)
165	really	_
166	hard	_
167	for	_
168	transgender	(45
169	or	_
170	intersex	_
171	people	45)
172	to	_
173	know	_
174	if	_
175	they	(39)
176	are	_
177	going	_
178	against	_
179	God	(47)
180	or	_
181	not	_
182	as	_
183	they	(39)
184	try	_
185	to	_
186	live	_
187	in	_
188	the	(49
189	Church	49)
190	.	_
191	And	_
192	the	(50
193	numbers	_
194	I	(3)
195	quoted	50)
196	mean	_
197	that	_
198	around	(52
199	160,000	_
200	members	_
201	of	_
202	the	(49

204	have	_
205	physical	(54
