"hqpz63t","Exactly. If you think vaccination will protect you go vaccinate yourself, but don't blame it on those who don't want to do it. Vaccinated people get infected, get sick, and transmit the virus. So vaccines are obviously very low effective, in terms that maybe only provide some sort of protection to the older most sensitive generation who has the most compromised immune systems. 

Flu types of viruses constantly mutate, which is why for a long time now, flu vaccines are not recommended to young healthy adults by the NHS in the UK, because they're almost never effective. RNA viruses, like Corona, standard flu and measles, are more prone to changes and mutations compared to DNA viruses, such as herpes, smallpox, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Covid-19 will almost certainly mutate to Covid-XY which would be totally resilient to the vaccines used right now, if that's not the case already. That's why flu vaccines are only seasonally recommended to older people with health issues - the same generation that is dying to Corona and to seasonal flues. Young healthy people without underlying diseases mostly have immune systems strong enough to fight viruses like these, and it's exactly what is happening with Coronavirus where we have 85% of people almost completely asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. The virus is so contagious that I think most of us have it without even realizing it. So convincingly the best way to turn this pandemic into endemic, is that everyone starts living a normal life and we expose ourselves to the virus so that we build stronger collective immunity. That is exactly the thing that will weaken the virus and make it be even less dangerous. The most vulnerable groups of people are free to vaccinate themselves, wear masks, and be more cautious in general, but this situation where even the young healthy people are obligated to vaccinate themselves in order to live a normal life, is just showing in what terrible state human ""hive mind"" is at the moment.

"hqpbm46","&gt;What Karl Marx called “capitalism” was in fact mercantilism

This is just nonsense as since the beginnings of the industrial revolution simple commodity production would be exchanged into generalized commodity production alongside with wage labor becoming the dominant system over that of serfdom or slavery, this is exactly what Marx wrote about in Capital and is exactly what the Capitalist mode of production is. But regardless nice attempt at some historical revisionism. 

&gt;making the absurd moral statement that business owners are evil, greedy thieves who steal the productivity from their employees.

Not once does Marx ever make a ""moral statement"" that the Bourgeoisie is evil, in fact this is the kind of idealist nonsense that you would hear from Utopian Socialists. Instead Marx argues that just as the Bourgeoisie were historically compelled to rise up against Feudalism and the nobility, so too will the Proletariat against the Bourgeoisie. This is simply historical materialism. 

&gt;The economic calculation problem, which is a complex subject that I will not cover here.

Because you don't understand it yourself and use it as a buzzword. 

&gt;When everyone is paid the same 

Read something for once in your life: 

&gt;Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor. The phrase ""proceeds of labor"", objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.

&gt;What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.

&gt;Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.
Hence, equal right here is still in principle – bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.
In spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard, labor.

&gt;But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only – for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.

&gt;But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.

So I'd love to know where you got this notion that Marx advocated for people being ""paid the same"" when this is exactly what he's criticizing the Social Democratic party in Germany for in regards to the ""undiminished proceeds of labor""(nevermind the fact that Marx specifically wrote that commodity production and the Law of Value wouldn't exist under the Socialist mode of production so how would worker's be ""paid the same"" anyways if wage labor is nonexistent). 

&gt;There are no two ways about it, Communism is an evil doctrine.

Was it evil for the Bourgeoisie to have their own revolutions against the nobility and absolute monarchs in Europe? 

&gt;Finally, we get to the real issue here, which is that communist propagandists and politicians know that communism and socialism are incapable of working. Their end game is not communism or socialism, but feudalism. Communism and socialism are simply excellent propaganda tools for achieving it because people, in general, are very stupid and ignorant and economics is complicated and people just can’t be bothered to learn it. So politicians dangle the promise of “free stuff” in front of the populace and wait for the votes to roll in. However, in order to achieve full feudalism, they need a way to keep people under control when their idiotic policies blatantly fail. How do they do that? Well, all they need is a base of fanatical supporters who are insane sociopaths that are perfectly comfortable inflicting violence on anyone who disagrees with them, and who will never admit the failures of their ideology and its policies no matter how blatantly obvious they are. And that, incidentally, is why all modern western nations are infested with ‘social justice nonsense. By raising children to be obedient sociopaths who riot on command and who go around loudly proclaiming that 2 + 2 = 5, modern leftist politicians now have both a steady supply of votes and an army of thugs to terrorize their political opponents. It’s an age-old strategy that could have been lifted verbatim out of Mussolini’s playbook. So yes, that wasn’t real communism. Or maybe it was real communism and its ‘failures’ were just capitalist propaganda. Or maybe the person you’re talking to is just a brainwashed sociopath trying to gaslight you and all those communist countries really were genuine abominations which is why they collapsed and why people flee them in droves.

"hqp8h33","&gt; that's the whole point of being anti-natalist?

Oh, honey no- The whole point is not wanting people to suffer. Hatred does not come into it. What a sad perspective.

We don't hate natalists; we feel sorry for them because they have been brainwashed, are slaves to animalistic instincts, and don't know any better. Is what they're doing wrong? Obviously. Does that make them bad people? Obviously not. 

&gt;You act like trans men can't get pregnant or have abortions too, you moron. Criticizing a natalist who happens to be a woman doesn't make me a misogynist. Ever heard the term ""birthing people""? For a trans person you sound pretty trans-phobic.

Oh, piss off- I'm a transman; I'm fully aware of that, but given the context of female reproductivity and the subject being a woman, I went with misogynist. Hateful, intolerant, and ignorant of female reproductive rights, especially when combined with social status as a woman, describes you just as well so let's go with that instead. 

Also, the reason that transmen also struggle with getting abortions etc. is because when it comes to healthcare related to our sexes, people will more often than not see us and therefore treat us as women. Just because we're not, doesn't mean that we aren't subject to misogynistic attitudes just the same as women. Everyone has to recognise us as men for us to be exempt from being subject to misogyny and unfortunately, many people don't, especially in the context of female reproductive health. 

&gt;Do you really think the woman is that immature 

People in coercive/ abusive relationships are immature, TIL. I'm not saying it was the case here, but with the information we have it's just as possible as your conclusion. 

&gt;you're just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, most people out there are natalists, the chances of her being forced into late pregnancy are way too slim to even suggest. She most likely intended to have kids.

1) Yes, of course I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Innocent until proven guilty, no? Must be hard to always see the worst in everyone and always be so cynical

2) You are highly ignorant of the way that social pressures affect our actions. If the entire world is expecting you to have a baby including your friends and family, I can't blame you for caving to that sort of pressure, even though it's the wrong thing to do. People are not perfect and many people haven't had the privilege of learning about antinatalism the way that we have. Many people are indoctrinated from a young age to be religious; it's not easy to undo all of that and abstain from having kids, especially not if you don't understand why it's a bad thing to have them. 

&gt;Its a matter of life and death, hence why i used the word killing coz I didn't know what better words to use to describe the situation at that moment, like what the actual fuck is wrong with you? You're dragging things way out of context

&gt;Dude, the internet is clearly not for you, jfc https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/grammar-nazi/

"hqojozf","For me it was backwards. There wasn't a reason NOT to believe, there just wasn't a reason TO believe in the first place. I grew up in Eastern Europe, and religion was frowned upon during that time. It was seen as backward, ignorant and small-minded. So I was never indoctrinated into it at an early age. And once I had the ability to think on my own, any attempts at brainwashing with that nonsense just wouldn't take.

But there was one thing that really helped. The church near one of the places I lived was converted into a museum of history of religion and atheism. It was basically packed chock-full of examples of religion - an Egyptian mummy, a Pagan sacrifice altar, and a space suit, all packed together into one museum. With a Foucault pendulum hanging off a steeple for live demonstrations that the Earth is spinning. And this was in a church. Sacrilege? Maybe, but effective. Made it almost impossible to be converted, when you saw side by side so many examples of conflicting religions (Christians, ancient Egyptians, Norsemen, Pagans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines, etc). It was impossible all of them were right. And it was immediately demonstrated how many of them were wrong, scientifically (planet is round, planet spins, and how Catholic church punished Galileo for it). And this made it impossible to believe in Jeebus, because the whole thing is utterly ludicrous. 

So I wasn't so much TURNED atheist, as I was inoculated against religion and not exposed to it to get infected before my brain was ready to fight off its influence.",1640959084,"it was seen as backward, ignorant and small-minded.","ignorant and small","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and small","small",NA,NA,1
"hqoinmr","I don't follow. 

Logic is a tool. It is most useful when there are true absolutes. The movements in a vaccum of a perfect sphere at a known velocity across an absolutely smooth surface rebounding off a pefect perpendicular surface can be predicted very far into the future. Or the movements of astral bodies far too massive to be affected by all but the strongest forces.

Yet in the physical world we live in, on our scale, there are often more variables than can be logically accounted for.  A pool ball on a pool table cannot be predicted with the same efficacy as the perfect experiment. The ball is flawed, the surface irregular, the wood of the table is affected by humidty, surrounding vibration, a drink spilled an hour ago. The imperfections of reality limit the usefullness of pure logic in nearly every aspect of daily life. 

This is why many theories in maths and logics are products of inspired moments and can often take lifetimes to prove- logic may be a universal constant, but the variables are far to numerous to account for without computers of great capacity and speed and specialized equipment to collect data, or without that intuitive leap of understanding that may defy the current understandings of the nature of reality. 

Thought exercise has the same value as physical exercise. Technically speaking, moving a weight up and down so that it ends in the same place it began is a worthless act. If one only considers the weight. When the goal is buuilding or toning muscle, the weight isn't the point, the body is. 

Exercising the mind and coming to conclusions that can later be discarded isn't worthless. It's a process. And those early conclusions were necessary steps along the way.

Self awareness is one causal factor in a lack of generally peaceful existance- that is my conclusion. I reached this conclusion over time. I have found that the concept ""ignorance is bliss"" reveals itself repeatedly in observation. Those who move through life without questioning their experience are often easily pleased, easily amused, easily distracted, and find a sort of peace more easily(not peace in the sense of no war, but internal peace); while those who press for answers to existential questions and push the boundaries on knowledge are often exhausted, unhappy, dissatisfied and even appalled and angry at the state of things. The more awareness one has, the less the brain disengages from things of seeming import. Unless those people practise habits of self disciplined focus and acceptance which allow them to work past hangups and not rhuminate on things out of their control. I observe that animals without self awareness are even less likely to lose sleep to worry about things they can't control, to second guess themselves and reflect persistently on poor choices in the past, or to suffer from mental illness not related to a physical pathology or trauma.

I have observed these things to be true. Not as a rule, not as a constant, but just an observable trend to the human condition.

This is not a bad thing unless one sees it as bad. Is it better to be ignorant and blissful, or to be aware and in conflict with reality, to struggle to find peace in a world where humans create most of their own problems? This is only something the individual can answer. 

It is observation without judgement. Personally, i would rather work to find peace than to be unaware. And i am often advised that i would be happier if i didn't think so much.

The self awareness is a biproduct of intelligence- it requires sufficient intelligence to exist. Effectively sing, or even just existing with, the self awareness once it does exist requires more than just intelligence. 

If this were not true, the most intelligent people would also be the most well adjusted people- which is not the case. People with measurably higher than average intelligence- whose use of logic would be very effective in a perfect environment with absolute rules- are not measurably more satisfied, happy, peaceful, or well adjusted than those of average intelligence. 

Instinct and animal wiring are not neccessarily a deficit to humanity. Like most things, it isn't absolute.  Four people in my life set off alarms bells in my body the moment i met them- all four turned out to be predators of a sort and some part of me recognized that. I married one of those people. I overrode my instinct and decided that what i knew that was logical- no criminal record, loving family, solid history of dependability and future planning, clean, tidy, well spoken, that all of that was more meaningful than my gut instinct. My animal brain must be wrong.

It was not. It did not go well. 

Many people speak of the red flags that rise with people and situations, personal and professional, that if they had paid attention to, would have prevented some measure of suffering in their life. 

Our innate instincts are the product of generations of survival. Our base brain is looking for things that our logic brain doesn't consider. Yet, because survival is often a messy business, this does not make all self-preservation instict beneficial (or legal) in the present. Our intelligence and self awareness can help us overcome to succeed, but also overcome to put ourselves at risk without reward. 

Self awareness may only require intelligence in order to occur. But in order for self awareness to be an effective tool, there must be more.",1640958529,"is it better to be ignorant and blissful, or to be aware and in conflict with reality, to struggle to find peace in a world where humans create most of their own problems?","ignorant and blissful","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and blissful","blissful",NA,NA,1

This is always being worried and concerned trolled about, but the reality is that ‘we can’t be honest about what’s happening because people might lose hope’ has just gotten us decades of ignorant and hopeful people making no real changes or progress. 

The reality is that what helps the system *is exactly the viewpoint you’re espousing*. ‘Don’t panic, don’t give up hope, things can change and get better’ is a message of complacency and the status quo. It says do nothing and let the system work it out. What actually drives change, what actually causes people to act, is understanding and accepting the situation for what it is, losing all hope that it will improve itself and get better on its own, and becoming desperate enough to do something about it. It’s clear that you’re still stuck in the former rather than the latter mindset, and that’s the line that is spoonfed to scientists and activists to keep them from doing anything too radical and actually try to cause real change. It’s a way to pigeonhole anyone who would actually possible be a real threat or risk to the system at large. “Just vote and protest, guys! Call your congressman! Donate to Tesla!” 

In reality, the real reason the meteor fails as an analogy is because it is an external threat. Climate change is an internal threat (although arguably the society’s greed in the movie is the real threat). It’s caused by the very system that must change to stop it. And the system at large, much like a biological organism, organically shifts and accounts to defend itself and protect itself from change. Hence us needing to have the above discussion, and us being able to talk about this at all because nothing we’re saying matters and we’re not going to do anything about it that could be an actual threat/cause actual change.

"hqo6sgn","&gt;""I see people, not color"" seems like an ideal world to me.

Certainly. I agree this would be a good ideal.

&gt;Black poor people are still poor people. Which means they would always be apart of the equation.

So, there's a difference between using ""color-blindness"" interpersonally vs. how we develop institutional policy. Not assuming a POC is poorer, less educated or victim to negative cultural characteristics generally is a better way to interact with people. However, being color-blind in policy advocacy; not allowing for protected classes for instance; is harmful. 

Taking a color-blind position in something like voter ID would certainly be an ignorant and harmful position. (although most politicians advocating for these policies aren't ignorant and are actively trying to suppress minority working-poor class voters). If we were to require a government issued ID at the polling station to vote. Both race and class ought to be considered. 

Or an even better example might be with affirmative action-like policies. I think it's safe to assume that in many areas of the US, because of negative biases towards minorities, they're less likely to be hired than a white person with the same qualifications. There have been a few large [studies](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29053) demonstrating this by submitting identical resumes to employers with black or white sounding names. The white sounding names were more likely to get a call back from the employers. This shows that people aren't color-blind in practice and therefore, we probably don't want to be color-blind in our policy prescriptions. 

&gt; In the Spider-Man:Miles Morales game, it ends with a black guy saying he's OUR Spider-Man which makes me cringe because it feels like the implication is black people can't look up to and admire white heroes or vice versa. It's really strange.

Yeah, it probably is a bit and this type of thing is often cynically used by media companies to appear concerned with racial justice.

1. No. You can't reach out to anyone on the VirtualBox forum as you have been locked out. Even if you did reach out, it's not very likely they could do anything for you unless you have an Oracle account they can connect your VirtualBox account to.
2. Yes. If you use the same e-mail address as you used previously with your Oracle account, you will be automatically granted access to your VirtualBox account. If you no longer have access to the same e-mail address, you can create a new Oracle account with a different e-mail address and then contact the VirtualBox forum team to help you connect your VirtualBox account to that Oracle account.
3. Probably not. I have not investigate this, but it's unlikely that the VirtualBox forum allows alternative login options or sidestepping the Oracle login process, for existing or for new accounts.

&gt;Karl Marx was not a real economist

This is an ad hominem attack.

&gt;What Karl Marx called “capitalism” was in fact mercantilism, a   
pathologically bad economic ideology which even at the time of Marx’s   
writing had already been thoroughly criticized by the likes of Adam   
Smith and Frederic Bastiat.

What Marx called capitalism is transferable ownership of the means of production not dependent on labour, which exists today as the world's sole economic system.

&gt;mercantilism

What do you think mercantilism is?

&gt; The economic calculation problem, which is a complex subject that I will not cover here. 

Market socialists such as myself thus do not fit under your argument.

&gt;Incentives. When everyone is paid the same no matter what they do or how  
 good a job they do, nobody wants to work at all so they do as little as  
 possible and make no effort to correct mistakes.

Many socialists, such as myself, do not believe in equal wages, rather we believe in economic democracy.

&gt;Governments are incapable of producing anything because governments are   
funded by the economy and without the economy, a government is nothing   
more than a bunch of armed thugs.

This is false for a multitude of reasons, but the main is the very fact that centralised planned economies *have* existed, and thus this sentence is factually incorrect.

&gt; When you take those three things   
together, it is absolutely no surprise that communist/socialist   
countries always suffer from empty grocery store shelves,   
hyperinflation, and are dominated by firing squads and gulags.

The last two are symptoms of authoritarianism and corruption, both of which have also existed (and arguably amplified) under capitalism. Which, by the way, the Soviet Union was effectively state capitalist because the worker's didn't own the means of production.

The last paragraph is on some conspiracy-age shit. 

&gt;which is that communist propagandists and politicians know that   
communism and socialism are incapable of working. Their end game is not   
communism or socialism, but feudalism. Communism and socialism are   
simply excellent propaganda tools for achieving it because people, in   
general, are very stupid and ignorant and economics is complicated and   
people just can’t be bothered to learn it. 

Can you give examples of these politicians?

&gt; Well, all they need is a base of fanatical supporters who are insane   
sociopaths that are perfectly comfortable inflicting violence on anyone   
who disagrees with them, and who will never admit the failures of their   
ideology and its policies no matter how blatantly obvious they are

I could say the same about modern American populist conservatives.

&gt;By raising children to be obedient sociopaths who riot on command and   
who go around loudly proclaiming that 2 + 2 = 5, modern leftist   
politicians now have both a steady supply of votes and an army of thugs   
to terrorize their political opponents.

\[citation needed\]

&gt; So yes, that wasn’t real communism. Or maybe it was real communism and   
its ‘failures’ were just capitalist propaganda. Or maybe the person   
you’re talking to is just a brainwashed sociopath trying to gaslight you  
 and all those communist countries really were genuine abominations   
which is why they collapsed and why people flee them in droves.

What you’re fed up with is human nature. Advocating for the use of violence as a way to change things, is not only unhelpful but it adds to the problems. The last thing any of us need are to deal with people who have become convinced that violence and destruction is the way forward.

It is not the way forward.

You say voting doesn’t matter, but how involved are you in your local community? Your city, township, or county? Once you get to the state and federal level, yes your vote has very little direct impact. Your best chance for influence is at the local level, to elect better quality people who will then move into state and federal positions over the next few years. They will be the ones capable of enacting changes at the state and federal level.

Or, how about you get into politics yourself, and climb up the ladder so you can be at the table when some of the important climate decisions are being made?

Or how about you build up your social influence by earning a strong reputation, by adding value to other people lives, and use your platform to influence large groups of people who have come to trust you?

Or why not focus on becoming financially successful, and funnel your own wealth towards the causes that you care most about?

 Yeah, FUG is nice little shippies, who definitely wouldn't kill her if she refused. And we definitely haven't seen Hwaryun treating her in S1.

 Irregular is still irregular. In those hundred thousand years they could've made Rachel op, especially with thorns.

 &gt;who will backstab them at the first chance she gets.

 And that's why they picked Baam who run away from them when he got a chance? Rachel has the same goals as FUG, so they have no reason to not trust her. 

&gt;its justified that she wants to kill khun? so its khuns fault he exposed rachel for being the traitor that she is to Dan and then humiliated her for being a traitor.

 Yes it's fully his fault that he spend FIVE YEARS plotting to torture and kill her. He could've easily ask her ""Why?"" and he would've get all the answers. And it's their fault that they are hypocrites who call Rachel a traitor because she didn't let them kill her.

&gt;FUGs fault for her pushing baam right cuz they had a gun to her head lol. youre delusional.

 Only delusional person here is you, little Endorsi stan. FUG and Headon did held a ""gun"" at Rachel's head. If she refused to cooperate she will be dead soon. 

&gt;endorsi only beat rachel because baam is ignorant and endorsi knows that rachel is useless backstabbing POS who will just end up fucking baam again if given the chance like she did on the administrator test.

 Endorsi herself admitted that her reason for attacking Rachel was only that she is jealous about Baam paying Rachel attention. You can't whitewash her when scene clearly said that Endorsi is a petty bitch. And she doesn't give a shit about Baam getting betrayed - she betrayed him on NHS for no reason, lol. 

&gt;endorsi had all rights to fuck up rachel just like how you think rachel is in the right to kill khun lol.

Nope. Rachel saved Endorsi's life few hours before bitch princess attacked her. 

&gt;anyways im not wasting more time in this debate keep worshiping your talentless maid who will backstab even the closest people to her just to climb the tower and be the ""star"". 

 And you can keep worshipping your pure evil pieces of trash, who have power only because of their good genes.

&gt;just as headon says rachel is ugly, nasty, and bad and not worthy of climbing the tower. 

 Headon gave really good description of Endorsi. He used it on Rachel to manipulate her, but idiots like you took it as a gospel of truth, lol.

yeah training with evan then defeating a floor boss for his team afterwards is def plot magic. rachel belongs on floor 30. have you ever seen or heard rachel talk about training cuz i havent. she just wants others to boost her up.  

all youre doing is deflecting the blame. rachel can easily not take FUG's offer but of course she does cuz its the easy way up the tower. As for headon, there is no required end date for this to happen so she can easily just spend time getting stronger before she does anything with baam or whatever deal it was

okay its mentioned in the anime so i guess if you dont believe it i cant blame you since they change things around.

you thinking rachel would be able to use thorn and FUG replacing baam with her is the only theory with 0 proof. the only reason baam is chosen is because he is the son of v and arlenes prophecy.

I think of teenagers that overestimate their intelligence along their education level which is given more credit because it helped them to reach atheism. Rarely have I ever met an internet atheist who has the mental power to study or even know how to study.  Most don’t read anything outside of whatever material they’ve been given within the school system and gives them a grade. Most aren’t that studied on the sciences or history just like your average person. Atheist tend to be the most uninformed because they mistake agreeing with people smarter than them as being informed. 

Though most of the atheist in my real-life circles tend to be very intelligent, introspective, and retrospective. Some of the perspectives they give you will rarely find on the internet anI can have great discussions with them for hours and build.

"hqlb3tg","It kills me how people seem to think it's this ""bad far off thing I don't need to worry about"". Like, I was born in 1981. I can *very clearly* remember a number of environmental things that have completely changed.

Now I'm not necessarily talking about the obvious ones, like how I can see with my own goddamned eyes how much worse storms have gotten and I can feel how temperatures are significantly high ever overall, and the summers are far hotter.

But my biggest thing? The bugs.

When was the last time you saw more than a few fireflies here and there? I visited my home in VA over the summer (I moved further north), and there were hardly any, anywhere. When I was growing up every damned evening had swarms of them everywhere. I remember caterpillars filling the trees and crawling across the road in legions when I'd walk to/from the bus stop. Hundreds of large beetles flitting around the yard on a humid summer day. Bees and butterflies everywhere. Take a ride on the interstate and your car would be covered in bug splatters.

Sure, you might be thinking ""Ew bugs!"" but they're an important part of every ecosystem, and their numbers are at *a slim fraction* of what they once were. Pair that with the increase in air pollution, increase in water pollution, huge increase of CO2 in the air, the changing weather, and we're staring at a crisis that's all but unseen by most.

I don't understand how someone could be my age or older, and just...deny that we're fucking up our own environment? I can't understand how people can completely shut out reality, forget their own personal history, and fervently defend (often to their own deaths these days) a fabricated reality.

Narcissism refers to extreme self involvement to the degree that it makes said narcissist ignore the needs of those around them. To equate an egotistical cocky man to a narcissist is frankly ignorant and inaccurate, as hes shown time and time again hes done more than enough to tend to the needs of those he cares about.

&amp;#x200B;

""But he has access to more money and support to get the help he needs""

First off, money can't solve mental illness, it simply can't, some people just can't be treated. Hes tried to get help all throughout his life, hes been on meds multiple times, has a psychiatrist, therapist etc. To say he isn't trying to get help is bullshit, and just what you want to believe so you can continue to hate on him.

Second off, have you not stopped to think money makes his condition worse? I mean if he wasn't successful, his mother would of never gotten that fatal plastic surgery which he blamed himself for. Would he not be more stressed, as a mentally unstable individual to have such a large amount of money?

&amp;#x200B;

""But he isn’t a role model"" 

Maybe not to you, but to millions of others he is, hes inspired me to take many steps in my life. And lets just act now like hes a horrible person, can a horrible person not be a role model? Can you not learn from a horrible person?

&amp;#x200B;

He would take me to big gatherings at his family’s house, then walk off and leave me alone. Or he would cut me out of the conversation physically when we were with multiple people, like you described. There were so many other things he’d do in public situations to make an ass of himself too, but if I ever mentioned any of it or how it bothered me, I was just being “too nit-picky” or a bitch.

I turmoiled over this for months, I couldn’t for the life of me figure out if he was doing these things on purpose for whatever manipulative reason, or if he was truly just too stupid to understand.

No need to scrape anymore money then is needed. I want people to get ahead living in my places. It’s a win win.

"hqkragl","&gt; You deny any different type of human exists.

From a biological point of view there are no human subspecies as you ignorantly tried to claim. Any ""type"" you're trying to define is merely a social construct which is completely arbitrary. I've already explained this but you were to dumb to understand it. 

&gt;Do african americans exist? are they distinct any different from british americans yes or no?

The distinction is arbitrary and both of them are Americans and YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ORIGINALLY DEFINED DIFFERENCE BY NATIONALITY. So you're attempting to move the goalposts because I've completely debunked all of your ignorant bullshit. 

&gt;And no that's not the definition of racism, but ofcourse you can make up whatever terms you want. But no, racism is if you think another type is intrinsically better, smarter faster than another. I say they are different and should be respected for that.

False. It does not require superiority though that's often the subconscious belief. 

Racism - https://www.dictionary.com/browse/racism 

- a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human racial groups determine cultural or individual achievement

- Racial or ethnic prejudice or intolerance

If you think an INDIVIDUAL can't achieve a ""clean"" family with a person of a different race, then you're fucking racist by definition. You believe their racial group inherently prevents them from achieving individual ""cleanliness"". This applies to both parts of the definition I provided because it also shows intolerance. You won't tolerate a person who identifies as African American having a family with a person who's ""British American"" because of their perceived race. You're racist, deal with it. 

&gt;And was that good no?

Subjective opinions like ""good"" vs ""bad"" are moot when it comes to logical discourse. I can just as easily say ""yes"" and your entire argument is moot. Not to mention, Canada wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the British Empire doing the exact same thing. 

&gt;but this happen long ago.

And this is why your entire viewpoint is arbitrary. Like there's some specific point in time when it was okay and now it's no longer okay. FYI, when this happened is ultimately irrelevant within the context of this conversation because the point still refutes your ignorant bullshit. 

&gt;So you want to do the same but in a different way and do it TODAY, ON RACIAL GROUNDS you want to have some human types hurt, to favor other human types, pretty sure that's racial hatred :D You want a RACIAL REVENGE.. and to do this you want to gaslight people that no different type of humans exist.

You're projecting your own hatred and from this ignorant belief that people are somehow being ""hurt"" when they enter into a mutual romantic relationship with people who look different from them. You haven't provided a single piece of evidence to support that ignorant claim and it's laughable that you argue people reproducing is just like Empires murdering people and supplanting their own governments. 

&gt; i thought the indigenous people were exactly same as british so british just wiping out other british. 

That's because you're an idiot and I never said this. They are both humans and people, but they are not inherently different as individuals because of their physical location WHICH IS THE ARGUMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE. The notions of ""British"" and ""Non-British"" do exist, but only as social constructs, which is something I've already explained. So you don't have a point here except to display your own ignorance and lack of reading comprehension. 

&gt;WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? TO YOU THERE IS NON, trapped in your own web.. of bullshit. 

Nope, you're just an idiot that doesn't understand the difference between social categorizations and biological ones. They are not the same thing and you're the one pretending they are. 

&gt;Oh btw. there are more 'native americans' in USA TODAY than people in denmark and they have 5x more territory.

This is a red herring argument and is typical apologetics from racists. 

&gt;As for china and taiwan, the main biological difference between taiwan and han china is NONE

And this is precisely why your argument is wrong. You're the one who wanted to pretend that different nationalities had some sort of major importance or created a biological distinction and you've clearly been proved wrong. This is why you're a complete fucking idiot and the imaginary boundaries drawn on maps is completely arbitrary when it comes to making biological distinctions between humans. Way to fail. 

&gt;But it's not so much merely ideology when you have african go to japan or something.. This is biological AND cultural/ideological.

This is irrelevant to the fact that nationality is an arbitrary construct. So it's an attempt to move the goalposts from simply nationality to ""biological and cultural/ideological.""  On top of this, I've already explained how genetically, there is no DNA difference that determines specific races. 

&gt;Be careful what you say :D that you don't get stuck in your own web.

I am careful, you're just too dumb to understand shit while at the same time you've been tripping all over your own web of bullshit.

"hqkq4mf","**Nazi Literature in the Americas** and **Distant Star** by Bolaño, distinctly and probably intentionally more Borgesian than the other Bolaño I've read. I actually thought that the final piece in *Nazi Literature*, which went on to form the basis for *Distant Star*, was a stronger work. More chipped away, hollow. I enjoyed both of them, although I wouldn't describe either as top-flight. 

I also read **Pedro Páramo** by Juan Rulfo, which is a fascinating novel, although again I have to say that the novel I *thought* I was getting, right up until &gt;!Juan Preciado is revealed to have died and reader's surrogate is replaced by a series of secondary narrators!&lt; might have been a better book than the one I got. I can't really complain though, it's one of those works that seems almost beyond narrative to me, not a prose poem but prose operating poetically, events occurring not to tell a story but to fulfill some sort of primitive function. Slim little volume whose outsized influence is immediately evident. 

I've also started **The Books of Jacob** by Tokarczuk. Not immediately enjoyable - the writing at the very start comes off like a very conscious historical reproduction as it describes the sensations of the market, like one of those podcasts where they take you on ""*a guided tour of historical Venice*"" or whatever, but by about the middle of the first book everything has, for me, clicked, the book unfolding the way I want it to unfold - a measured, calm prose capable of taking in the heat of a village hearth and the coldness of stars, of dealing with people both profoundly ignorant and little intellectuals scared of implications of subjective sense-experience.

"hqjzou1","I agree to an extent, those that are responsible for the specific decisions that were made in key positions of power are certainly more in the vein of cartoonish villainy. It truly rivals fiction. That being said, the generation *as a whole* I find to be apathetic as long as they get their’s, hopefully a larger some of their’s than you get of yours.

In their later years, I just find them to be blissfully ignorant, willingly mislead by a beautiful lie over an ugly truth, and unwilling to take any amount of criticism due to their complete and total lack of ability to self reflect in an honest way.

Most of them were useful idiots. Some of them were complete and total bastards. It’s a mixed bag, as is every generation. They just happened to live in a time where wealth was bountiful and easy to access, and they conflated that with deserving wealth because they worked hard.

That attitude has permeated every decision they have made, and it shows when discussing things like wealth inequality the most, because they somehow feel as though they stood alone in the world and against all odds made it through, and successfully at that! Instead of the obvious truth, which is in hindsight, there was almost nobody left in their economic world who would have provided much in the way of competition.

Amazing how many of the world’s most advanced societies obliterating themselves in total warfare can make for a seller’s market as they pick up the pieces. America was the beneficiary of an amazing period of growth due largely in part to the destruction of most serious competition to it’s industry, and somehow the Boomers were so egotistical that they thought it was their greatness that earned them their vast wealth.

"hqjv2we","I'm glad to see some sanity for a change! What's actually ""transphobic"" is ignorantly grouping this waste of human life in with actual trans people.

It's always annoying when people on the other side of the world make ignorant and highly offensive statements about a notorious case here in Australia.

Pretty much everyone over here is familiar with the Denyer case and the true story behind it. But, of course, these hyper-woke Americans see Denyer as trans and a poor victim, and not as the manipulative, evil, misogynistic monster that he is.

I keep having to mention to the clowns who cry ""transphobia"" in reference to this case that **six** psychiatrists- you know, actual doctors specialising in psychiatry- confirmed Denyer's claims of being ""trans"" to be false. They **all** determined he was attempting to use deception in order to manipulate others to obtain privileges, and also wanting to inflict psychological harm on his surviving victims and their families.

And it worked. The mother of a teenaged girl, Natalie, that Denyer brutally massacred was horrified when he first started this charade. She said in one interview that she almost vomited. There were newspaper articles all about this in the early 2000s, when it first started.

"hqjtczv","Only partially. 

Pandemics are extremely complex and there are a lot of factors that go into them. In some cases, I'd say, there isn't really ""blame"" to be assigned, because this is the way Life works (Life with a capital L, like, Life for billions of years, not just the human society of the last 100 years). We're just a lot more global and connected now, compared to centuries previously where most people never traveled five miles from their places of birth. 

And it's an evolving situation, with new changes every day, so we learn more and change positions over time, which is normal. When you gather more facts, your theories and actions will change. There's nothing nefarious or scary about this, but a lot of misinformed morons use that as an excuse to further their political crap. My nasty GOP father was complaining over the holiday that ""they don't know anything about \[Covid\], it's bullshit."" We know a lot more than we did two years ago, and two years from now we'll know even more. Americans, in particular, are used to immediate and QUICK events. Short, sweet, action packed movies with lots of violence and rock music. We are not good at slow, evolving, long-term situations, which pandemics by definition are. ""Why isn't everything immediately over?"" we bitch after three days. That's just not how it works. With hindsight, we might say, ""Yes, this technique was ineffective. We needed a stricter policy. We should have implemented this sooner."" But that all takes TIME. It doesn't mean Fauci is an evil liar or the scientists ""don't know anything."" This is actually how science, especially medicine, work. It takes TIME. We don't know everything after one day, one week, one month, or, sadly, one year. We just can't. 

BUT: There are measures individuals can take to keep themselves and their families healthy, and that includes vaccination.  Germ theory is well studied and accepted (by the scientific community, if not the idiots who think the Earth is flat and Jesus rode dinosaurs. Those people are useless, we're better off without them.), and it provides some hints on how to manage pandemics. Look to history too, plenty of plagues and pandemics, and the advice is largely the same: Cover your face, stay isolated, restrict movements, hunker down. And now that we live in the 21st century, we're blessed with better medicine and a greater understanding of disease Yet, the willfully ignorant and hateful, which make up the majority of the unvaccinated (but not all, yes, I know, some people have good reason, but so do the hardcore anti-vaxxers, so, fuck you), ignore and disregard science, because they have no understanding of science or the scientific method. And that's just sad, really.  

The unvaccinated are putting a massive strain on our hospitals, they treat healthcare workers with disrespect and violence, and they're purposely spreading misinformation and lies. This is a time where we as a species really need to show some unity, and if you can't manage that, at least do it for your own community, your state, your country. Instead, it got turned into another culture war, hyped by our evil leaders to purposely kill off the plebeians. ""Show your allegiance to Q! Kill someone today!"" But, the plebeians had plenty of opportunity to educate themselves and think independently, and they didn't. That I do blame them for.

The pandemic would suck even if everyone got on board and did the all the ""right"" things, all the time. It would still last for years with several mutations and several waves. \[The only people at the start who were saying it would be over soon were, if you recall, idiots who don't know anything about science or medicine.\] BUT. Individuals can make a huge difference for themselves and the people they directly contact (family, coworkers). To not do so abdicates social responsibility, and I do blame them for that.

The hardest thing, for me, in this pandemic is to look at all these people and realize how little they care. They won't put on a piece of cloth while they shop, or get a free shot, to protect themselves, their loved ones, or their community. In fact, they spread lies, hatred, and vitriol, and they are actually violent toward others over it (we've all read news stories of retail workers shot dead enforcing mask policies, and healthcare workers being attacked, and scientists and politicians receiving death threats). I was already pretty misanthropic, but at this point, I want to live in a cave and never see another human being for the rest of my life. Hateful, evil fucks.  

TL/DR: I don't really blame them for prolonging it, because it was going to last a while and be messy anyway. But I'll be very, very happy when the unvaccinated die, as it will absolutely help improve the situation. Get on the same page, or die. Move forward as a species, or die.

"hqjmekc","You are being shown literal examples that are significantly better than your non-existent prototype, which has taken you three years. They are unlike yours, because they exist in playable form.

&gt; My approach is creating very detailed characters where the variance is the players choices impacting the way the relationship goes and that affecting everything.

So, Choice of Games or any visual novel? Having player choice and emotional choice be uncoupled is very, very common.

&gt; There's really not much in common with their ideas and mine. I don't generate names, personalities, and the narrative is not generated from squad progression across an open world or generated dungeons. All their variables are more generic/less specific.

Yes, these have more random variables than yours. They also have way more specificity than what you've shared, but you'd have to actually play them to know this. Or watch the whole GDC video shared, which talks about the depth of relationship mechanics.

&gt; My argument is having the additional dimension to branch in which has its own constraining rules and thereby consistent tools for the player to use strategically is a *transformative difference*.

You think.

Not players. Not readers here. 

""Guy who created his system thinks it's good""

People in this space here are repeatedly telling you this is not transformative.

**it was first seen online in 2004, and first appeared in academic literature ""in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language.""**

But Fuck facts right? We gotta hate white people!!!!!

It was meant for people of such origins who were Non Binary to have a seperate identity from the gender set language.

**Nothing to do with white people at all**

And if you are getting angry at the strawman created white person for trying to keep up with modern gender identites you have even less sense than before. Thats been a really big part of our current culture. Respecting gender identities of others. Why wouldnt someone try to respect that?

Trying to do good and follow the identity inclusive language is not the same as speaking for you, the fact you wrote this shows how, again, fucking stupid you are.

"hqiiqeg","It was pushed by the people in power immediately following WWII in most powerful countries. Almost all of those countries had leaders that were on the left side of the spectrum and after the horrors done to the Jews were revealed, these leftists didn't want to be associated with that. So the narrative was that it was right wing despite people on the right typically wanting to restrain government control over their life and it was never challenged to any real extent. The Communists were worse by every measurable degree, but we can't let those facts become widely known now, can we? 

I digress, but the short answer is that it was inconvenient to tell the truth. Instead, they point out vague differences like ""central planning"" vs ""corporate state"". Is the governing body controlling the means of production and dictating how people need to live their life? Congratulations, you're on the left. But when you approach your political views as ""socialism"" being a moderate position then anything to the right of that is far right because nothing further right than socialist can work within the confines of socialism. Notice how there are no facist states left? Only Communist ones, and even those are a dying breed?

The left always changes what their moral outcry is depending on culture and whatever the elites want to drum up and it usually involves dehumanizing whoever is on their hit list ""for the good of the people"" and the right is too busy being willfully ignorant and too scared to do anything that might make life a bit more difficult.

He’s remarkably ignorant and uneducated in the things he talks about, and his big takeaway from Nietsche’s philosophy is the downside of being compassionate. He literally tells people to be a monster, under his Jungian integration nonsense. Bitter and bullying? That is Peterson precisely. A nasty person? Peterson is the epitome of that. The partisan politics game is ridiculous I agree, however, Peterson is a leading figure in encouraging it and building that division.

&gt;There are communist parties virtually all over the world.

So what? There were Jewish Nazis at one point.

No. Communism kills.

Whoop-de-doo. I saw Stalin's gulags and Mao's mass killings and now I can't stop heiling Hitler.

Austria.

So? They have all political movements, inlcuding awful ones like nazism and libertarianism too. Does that make them good ideologies because they exist around the world? No.

The John Gottman bit reminded me of how S intersplices a little bit of psychological studies to promote his narrative about something instead of using your own critical thinking skills.   
Unfortunately, I expect to see of these videos that highlight the LEAST worry some bits about why the divorce was hard to witness.

I feel so awkward with these videos. Here we can have conversation and more proof provided with documents from screenshots, and have back and fourths with disagreements or provide a growing perspective.  We can edit if we messed up and correct ourselves. On video, it just stays. And this video, like some others, completely missed the point on why it was so hard to see this divorce, and KNOWING that we don't even understand the full scope of it makes it harder because the missing pieces make us want to believe it's not as bad as we think it is, but then proves to us that it's worse than we thought. Their first divorce announcement said they were ""amicable"" so of course the learned info since then was all downhill.

Along with the public being treated with hostility from S and then Martina leaving the Rainbow Ladder Support Team-which was her thing, the incoming bits and pieces were NOT showing us the divorce was ""amicable"" as they wanted us to believe. We don't want to be ignorant and naïve. (And in this video, Echo shares her thoughts, but then at the end she wants OTHERS to just move on and watch cute japan vlogs instead of drawing a microscope to the S situation....by making her video on it.... that was very condescending.) 

As I learned more I became worried for Martina and Meemers, even if it was parasocial. I think Martina was struggling to figure out how she can share publicly what she went through yet not trying to crossing boundaries and make people feel sad for her or hate S was a tricky place to be in. I don't fault her AT ALL for sharing some quotes on her IG stories. I think she had enough when S deleted her comment about Meemers being near death so she really came out at that point, things she was holding in. 

There was no mention in Echo's video of Meemers getting sick near death, but lots of talk about potential of covid. She, and many others, keep missing the point.

People keep bringing up restrictions, cvid potential, but really the most messed up thing during this time is that Martina rushed Meemers to the vet (she posted a photo of him in the ICU on her IG after her comment got deleted by S) and stayed by Meemers side hoping he would make it through, to then look after Meemers....while Simon wanted to censor that and his vacation in hawaii. He was then deleting anything about hawaii and banned the word ""travel"" while also being a self-proclaimed travel blog, to protect his own interest. When S finally admitted to going to Hawaii, he made it seem like he was going for mental health reasons, while also claiming he was looking to move there but then he couldn't because the shores flooded, and the only reason people knew about it was because of Martina not respecting his privacy, which all of these make him a victim. I get frustrated when people talk about cvid and hawaii because that wasn't even the worst of it. While censoring hawaii he was censoring Meemers actual declining health, only allowing us to see Meemers in silly costumes and only accepting us to write brainless praise about it.... when he almost died of his preexsisting condition.... which Simon claims that ""Meemers was not sick in my care,"" Yes he was because the condition came about during either korea or japan.

Videos like this weird me out but i know they'll just keep coming now while missing all the main points of concern, yes, including the parasocial relationship with Meemers because of basic human empathy. 

I am hoping martina has the peace, grows any articulation she's missing and finds courage to speak out one day about her life and experience as she has slowly been figuring out and it feels like these videos want to rush that and potentially get the narrative wrong. anything we say s can victimize himself with, and has, just as he did with the whole hawaii situation.  

He's so manipulative and will find a way to make himself the victim, even when Meemers got sick, S was the victim. Even seeing that his several posts about his ""doggies"" was a covert manipulation tactic to see him as a great pet owner so eventually when the public finds out about meemers and his ICU stay we wouldn't immediately think he had anything to do with it. Yet, any criticism was deleted due to ""privacy"" reasons. To summarize, cvid was a potential. Meemers preexisting condition and the ICU stay was real and actually happened.

&amp;#x200B;

people think they have an A-HA moment in regards to this whole cvid thing. but they miss the whole entire point. We do not know if the presence of cvid ever happened between this time. what sickness did absolutely occur? meemers preexisting illness revved up and he almost died. cvid is actually beside the point because of what actually happened. completely ignored in this video. Echo said ""the thing that makes me most upset that he mentioned in the video"" and then mentions cvid... cdc....people don't get it. Meemers did not almost die from cvid. He almost died from crystals and S was censoring both, making you pick which way he can set himself up to be the victim in the narrative. the most thing that upset me was he was whining about setting up a plastic box with cat sand and making it out to be that martina was incapable of caring for meemers. the gull of that creep. and people keep missing the point because they are so up in arms about cvid and the potential for it while at this time s KNEW meemers almost died and was priming with everything he had to set up as if he's the responsible one in this. (including not mentioning in his video but writing in the description that he just ""forgot"" to talk about his deleting Martina's comments about the truth of Meemers state and whereabouts, seeming the more responsible one by hiding his January vacation, and trying to make him seem the more responsible one by bragging that his puppies are so healthy and never sick nor anxious with the postings of covert manipulative pictures of ""doggies"" that are so well behaved that they don't have anxiety- his words). yet people keep bringing up cvid as a main point. No! This is what I mean...when Echo brought up cvid/hawaii and then she started talking about meemers....she never mentioned MARTINA and the VET in regards to meemers being in actual critical state.

&amp;#x200B;

That guy from ""hiding in my room"" did his video better. And another difference is that he's talking as if he's talking straight to S and Martina instead of other random people in the audience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Echo keeps saying that Martina should not have spoken about hawaii (once again...the reality was that Martina had been trying to get ownership of meemers before he got sick and then had to take care of meemers, her posting about hawaii is the least of ""what should not have happened""). And Echo says Martina also shouldn't have posted about narcissists. I disagree, as that was Martina's way of speaking about what she could at the time. How much is she suppose to keep about her former relationship a secret and completely unbiased as if she signed a NDA on her marriage?? As if she can't speak that her and S are not getting along and that she's been hurt through it. When we had S complaining on IG that he ""lost"" his cat when Meemers survived by Martina's care and compliance with the vet. It's like people are nitpicking on the small detail and ignoring the context, all during them battling for Meemers. If anything, her posting those stories were her way of slowly speaking out that things were not okay. She herself might have felt like she shouldn't have spoken out like that. but she WAS heard through this. and i hope it means a lot.   


s didn't just block and ban comments from the audience, but he deleted Martina's comment about Meemers. Echo didn't mention that. Echo claimed ""the community was given a crumb of the tiniest bit of context and they ran with it"" ugh.

&gt;Sometimes it only takes 8ms for a new frame to appear because the input was made in the middle of a refresh.

ABSOLUTELY WRONG. You are clearly confused by crappy nvidia marketing for their LDAT crap.

https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/images/nvidia_reflex/5.png

This is Nvidia marketing. You clearly are thinking of ""input lag"" in terms of including mouse/keyboard inputs, where ""new frame appears because of an input"". That is not what reviewers mean when they talk about ""input lag"".... The monitor does not care.

Input lag when it comes to monitors, comes down to one metric. GPU OUTPUT to MONITOR INPUT. That's it.

Your example, happens within the peripheral and pc latency, where your ""mouse input"" will trigger a change to the render pipeline, BEFORE it goes to the monitor!!!! Which holds no metric to ""input lag"" in RTINGS and TFTcentral reviews....

INPUT LAG as I stated, only has to do with the monitor itself. How fast it takes the gpu output and turns it into a picture to be seen by your eyes.

RTINGS viewsonic monitor, says 13.5ms at 60hz. This IS NOT system latency, nor pc latency, nor peripheral latency. Its purely ""display latency"" as per linked picture. IN ORDER TO FIND INPUT LAG, you have to subtract refresh rate from the equation. Because in order to KNOW the input has happened, you have to SEE the image. So that 1hz required to show the image, at 60hz, takes 16.66ms to change. So If I were to get 30.16ms from my testing, I would then subtract 16.66ms in terms of refresh rate to find input lag. Which would be 13.5ms. That is how its done. Rather you like it or not. I actually do testing for a living. DO YOU? I bet you don't. I bet you don't even have the tools to test. And yet you try to gate-keep with your ignorant information.... its just sad. ""I'm done with the conversation now"" why because you repeat your ignorant statements over and over again you think that magically makes it true? Every reviewer would agree with me if they chimed in. Input Lag for monitors is one metric, and you seem to want it to be something it isn't. 

A monitor cannot stop displaying something just because you triggered a new frame on the back end of things (peripheral/pc latency). A monitor at 60hz will ALWAYS change in 1hz increments every 16.66ms. IT NEVER CHANGES. Unless you change the refresh rate, which then 120hz would be 8.33ms per 1hz. You cannot interrupt those refreshes and display a new frame. Because IF THAT WERE TRUE, I could send 500fps to my 60hz monitor and end up with a 500hz monitor. THAT IS HOW IGNRANT YOU ARE. And how WRONG you are.

As far as ""both being wrong"" well in my testing I generally end up matching TFTcentral results to the number. RTINGS is where I get pissed off because their results are bs. And they admitted to ""making their own tool"" which clearly their tool is a POS.

Speaking for up north here, we're in an era of an ignorant and non-critically thinking voter base, damaging policy and a complicit biased media that rationalizes feelings over facts to the detriment of everyone.

In large part I blame higher learning (universities) for polarizing debates, fostering cancel culture/ authoritarian rule and radicalization.

The energy file is a good example of this.  Life long politicans that've never run a business nor knows where food comes from (a farm, manufacturing, logistics vs a grocery store) and is anti energy, hasn't a clue how difficult it is to produce energy, transport it, refine it, market it and get it to retailers.  They just 'don't like it'.  Or how alternatives can be a part of the existing energy mix and supports the eventual reduction of oil and natural gas.  I honestly don't think they care about the consequences, being lost jobs, lost energy security, lost taxes, higher costs, they're all secondary consequences of their energy reduction religion.

Case in point....our scumbag federal Liberal government appointed a formerly arrested GreenPeace activist as our Energy Minister.  After he made Canada's grand pledges at COP26, the government THEN announced the intent to consult on how to meet their pledges.  What idiot / clown would make pledges to the world without even first  knowing a) if they're achievable, b) what damage they could do to the economy, c) what it means for already high energy prices and d) how they might further drive foreign investment out of the country.  These are secondary issues to them.

Like I said above, so many folks are concerned about feelings over facts.  And then vote with that mentality.  This being the case, having a rational and adult conversation with them that doesn't degrade into name calling is almost impossible, since basic facts can't be agreed upon.

Sure it's all frustrating as he'll, but more so it saddens me to see where society has come, where it might be going, and the brainwashing of our youth.",1640827743,"100%  speaking for up north here, we're in an era of an ignorant and non-critically thinking voter base, damaging policy and a complicit biased media that rationalizes feelings over facts to the detriment of everyone.","ignorant and non","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and non","non",NA,NA,1

Peace that should have helped the kingdom produce many great human savior, made it much worse. People became ignorant, higher ups became corrupted, ignorant and also arrogant. They even started to think magic is for cowards.

The goal was making the Empire conquer Re Estize swiftly, and after that they would kinda rule the Empire from shadows. Jircniv followed a slower action, they could conquer the re estize twice by now. They cornered the kingdom from every direction while they was keep getting stronger.

The reason was simple, my man over there explained it perfectly. PDL didn't allow off-country operations with Zesshi. And the council state he is controlling would have borders with Slane Theocracy.

This goes off of a theory of mine that I was researching during my time in college working in psychology and sociology where very many mental conditions/ diseases have a spectrum in which everyone has a slightly different place in and how it reflects on things they're good at, things they like, etc. I've forgotten so much since I became disabled and couldn't continue my education, though. Really sad honestly, but I digress lol

I use schizophrenia as an example since it's the closest thing intrinsic to the human mind I can think of that is a cause of extremely abstract thoughts and feelings that can be impossible to explain to someone who can't perceive them. Not to mention the correlation between schizophrenia as a spectrum and artistic creativity which is also in the realm of the abstract that can't be explained, but can be expressed to some degree through music, art, etc.

Due to the people who's brains operate in a much simpler way when it comes to this kind of thing, they have never perceived anything close to tripping on marijuana or the type of abstract thoughts that come with being on that spectrum even while sober. They literally can't imagine such a thing, so it's not real to them and they'll try to rationalize its non-existence however they can instead of admitting that they can't possibly know and that maybe some peoples' minds do work in a way in which they can actually trip on weed. Humans are some stupid, ignorant, and arrogant creatures far far far too often, though.

"hqgx9d5","Yeah. The stock ran up in August, as expected. The stock ran up in November, as expected, just in the earliest part of the window, which was a bit unexpected, but not unpredicted. I made $4k and $7k on options on these two runups. $11k that was hedgies' and is now GME shares DRSd in CS. Yet people who are supposedly *for* GME rocketing keep telling me, especially on gherk's daily thread post here, how they're somehow mad about this (gherk, the thesis, options). Further, I expect GME to run up AGAIN (and again and again) because SHFs cornered themselves. I hold far-dated NTM call options for when they are forced to do some buying (which has been what, six times just this year?) Knowing this, and knowing how options can actually hurt SHFs AND contribute to catalysing a squeeze (and as such, probably terrify them), I can only assume the people who show up here fighting against  gherk and his thesis and options are ignorant and uninformed or are working for the other side in order to keep others from becoming informed.

One note, options *are* expensive for GME, and you need to understand them as well as the theories of why the price dips and why it shoots up cyclically, as well as the risks, so they aren't for everybody. I myself keep my shares-held-vs-options ratio at about 9:1 because of the risk of options losing their value (I don't think its likely in this play, but who knows, we *are* dealing with criminals and a fraud-based system). If you're not at higher XXX holder, options probably aren't the way.

That said, options are on sale right now! Price is low, IV for April is low. I bought my August options on Aug 5th and I bought my Nov options on Nov 18.

Racial fetishization is very real and very damaging. But to insinuate that all interracial relationships contain that element is ridiculous and ignorant. And it comes from an overly simplistic )and in my experience, a self righteous) point of view. 

To quickly step into the field of sociology- there are two sets of concepts- definitive concepts and sensitizing concepts. 

Sensitizing concepts are those kind of abstract concepts that alert us to a pattern, trend, system, set of norms etc. They are concepts that are intangible, but help us interpret the world through a specific lens. 

A popular example of this is ""weaponized incompetence"". Which is when a person deliberately doesn't learn a skill, or does a bad job performing a task so that someone else (usually a romantic partner) will stop asking for help and take on that task ad infinitum. I see this concept so overly applied and misused. It's a concept that when people learn, they start to see it everywhere. Even places where it is not present. 

I think the same can be said about your friend's perspective on your relationship with your boyfriend. If she has learned about fetishization, she might be overusing it, misapplying it, and applying it to situation where it is not present. 

All I can say is that her interpretation of your relationship does not define your relationship. If she listens to your description of what turns you on and hears alarm bells, that says more about her use and understanding of fetishization than it does your relationship. 

Particularly since you were open minded to this feedback, considered if it applied, and then consulted your boyfriend and asked him if he felt that way or that concept resonated to him.",1640812598,"but to insinuate that all interracial relationships contain that element is ridiculous and ignorant.","ridiculous and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ridiculous and ignorant","ridiculous",NA,NA,0

Quite easy to explain.  You're making it up.

&gt;if the vaccine is so great why people are dying from covid than ?

Because most of the people dying didn't get it.  Also, no one said the vaccine is 100%.  You can still get it and die.  Just like you can wear your seatbelt, get airbags, get cars with anti-locking brakes, brand new tires, crumple zones, then still die in a car accident.  Shit happens but rarely.

Yes, they said that people more likely to die go first.  Why is that such a puzzle for you.  Also, how many children died from covid getting the shot?  No one knows.  Share a source if you have it.

They have answered these.  You're just choosing to ignore the answers.

The average rich person isn’t bezos or trump. They are ppl who created start ups and added value and innovation to the marketplace.

The average entrepreneur isn’t a billionaire stealings ppls ideas.

I also find it amusing that ppl think if they were given 1 million dollars 1) they could manage it as to not lose it, 2) turn that million into multi millions. It’s not that easy bud. 

My point of reference, besides data that shows most millionaires and rich aren’t just trust fund baby’s and that most are self made, is my own experience. I worked my ass off to advance myself and my families lives. After years of struggling, late nights, almost failing I’ve finally created a lucrative small business. By adding value to the lives of others, by being willing to take risks, by working twice as hard as most ppl around me, by not quitting  I was able to pull it off.  90% of wealthy ppl I know have similar life experiences.  

The fact of the matter is most ppl are not going to put in 80 hr weeks, wake up everyday at 5 am and work till 10 pm, work weekends, eat ramen for 2-3 years, take massive personal and financial risk to pursue their ideas and dreams. Sacrifice personal pleasure. Becoming and *remaining* successful takes years of hard work and extreme discipline. It also takes being smart which unfortunately the majority of society is ignorant and naive.

The fact that you think you can tell anything about anyone because they were born in a specific place means you're racist. It's literally the definition of racism.

&gt;What matters about stopping racial hatred is that we respect eachothers types IN SPITE OF our differences, not pretending that they don't exist

Race is a social construct and there are social differences but those differences aren't defined by imaginary lines drawn on a map you fucking idiot. They can be defined by numerous other things, but those are still only generalizations and don't apply to every person living within a country's boundary. 

&gt;And you go ooh borders are imaginary lines on a map, no it's agreement between those groups, it's to separate territory of a sovereign human type

No, it's generally not an agreement as proven by China and Taiwan and it has more to do with one group of people conquering and killing another group of people and not ""sovereignty"".

"hqfy2at","Again, do you have any sources on that or ""just no"". This is why this topic requires way more education.

Definition of public property in a usa legal sense:

Property owned by the government (or its agency), rather then by a private individual. Examples include: parks, streets, sidewalks, libraries. 

A publicly funded clinic is public property since they are normally owned by the state in usa. If they have a open lobby accessible to public, I am allowed to photograph inside. I have free access to any pamphlets or literature available. It's open to the public. Medical staff are hipaa trained and should not have exposed medical records or turn off computer screens when they aren't near them. I am not hippa trained therefore cannot violate hipaa. If they blatantly have medical records in the open, it's completely on them. If I make it a point to seek out these records, it's on me. (Neferious activity)

Again, if I'm suspected, with sufficient ras, of nefarious activity, they can ask me to leave. Nefarious activity would be trying to forcefully get people's medical information since that is illegal. But I can stand on the lobby of a clinic and film the general area. No issues. Simply filming is not considered nefarious activity.

Maybe some clinics are appointment only. I wouldn't not be allowed to just walk into an appointment only clinic and film because the door would be locked, there would be signage saying appointment only and the whole establishment would be considered restricted access. If the door is open and it's a public lobby, I definitely can record there.

Again, please cite the law that explicitly prohibits me from photographing in a public lobby of a publicly funded hospital or clinic.

The reason a school is different is because they aren't open to the public. A school is open to it's enrolled students and staff only. 
20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A); 34 CFR § 99.3 

So if there is a specific law pertaining to children in school there should be a specific law pertaining to medical clinics. But there isn't.

At no point did you force them or tell them they should adopt. You just asked. And yes, maybe you shouldn’t have on Facebook given you knew they had no desire to adopt but it is a valid question. 
To me the nephew and his husband are the assholes. The statement that he doesn’t want to adopt because he doesn’t want to deal with other peoples “bad genes” is ignorant and honestly ridiculous. I agree a child is a child and a parent is a parent. Having conditions on the way you would accept a child into your life just gives me the impression that if you can’t have children in the exact way you want that you don’t want them at all. 
The husband says that adoption isn’t their first choice but it’s clear after being invested well into 200k with no child that your “first plan” isn’t working. I think you may be the asshole if you had said something like that but you didn’t. You asked and left it alone. 

And further your nephews statement about being “entitled to have biological children like heterosexual couples do” feels like a way to use his sexuality to guilt you into feeling bad for suggesting adoption. Infertility issues are by no means solely an issue encountered by the LGBTQ+ community. Nor does simply “being heterosexual” offer the ability to have children. There are millions of men and women every year that struggle with infertility and to use his sexuality simply feels like a way to manipulate your feelings just because they aren’t willing to acknowledge the fact they may not be able to have children biologically. 

I am of the opinion the entire idea of needing biological children is selfish honestly. Though I understand people have their own values and desires for their lives and they are entitled to that.

"hqfix4c","&gt; Do you think the term ""plague rats"" is a neatly defined technical term?

It's. Salute, I wanted to understand how you use it because clearly you're not being objective about it. I said 40% after 4 months but that falls to 15% after 6 months and that was for Delta which started at 85% protection from spread, Omicron currently at about 75%, so by 6 months there's no measurable difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

  


  


&gt; Its used to express frustration about people that aren't doing their best to help stop the spread.

By that standard anyone implementing vaccine mandates is a plague rat because unvaccinated people aren't required to be tested spreading the disease and prolonging the pandemic.

  


&gt; Vaccinated people are much less likely to spread the virus.

See above comment, beyond 6 months there's no measurable difference, but really unlesss you boosted last month you're more likely then not to spread Omicron.

  


&gt; So someone not getting the vaccine making the choice to be a carrier of disease.

That's also false, if you've had COVID you can't spread it the imunity is more lasting and more diverse then the vaccines, as you have more then antibody imunity but native and celular imunity as well. Furthermore if you generally avoid big gatherings you're not likely to catch or transmit it, as such vaccinated or not less outside contact is the biggest factor, classical modeling shows there's usually just a few super-spreaders it's not a game of averages.

&gt;There are numerous renowned anthropologists and historians who have said the same thing about Christianity and science.

Solipsism is quite an issue in the ""sciences"" you mention. Also irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But where are you getting your information from, outside of Reddit, Rick and Morty, and two-minute Neil deGrasse Tyson videos? You're just making stuff up or repeating stuff that has been made up.

Unlike you, I have no need to make shit up when I can't counter an argument.

You haven't actually answered or refuted any of my questions yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Modern-day science, as we understand it now, did not come from the people and civilizations that you've listed. 

You are very, very wrong.  


&gt;Nobody with an IQ above 90 would equate what the Greeks did to what we now call science. And science certainly didn't come out of atheism. 

EXCUSE ME?

Archimedes, Socrates and Plato didn't lay the foundation of western intellectualism? Algebra wasn't invented by an islamic scholar? Astronomy wasn't first used in Mesopotamia? 

Those same ancient Greeks were in fact put on that particular pedestal by Christians in the late medieval period.

Mathemathics is the foundation of science, architecture requires mathematics. Every single civilization up until today has shaped and formed the scientific method, regardless of their religion (mostly despite of it, especially in Christian Europe).   
You have quite a learning curve, little one.  


&gt;I stand by what Loren Eiseley thought. Science came out of a Christian milieu.

That's your belief and it's horribly ignorant and solipsistic. It's also factually wrong.

"hqdxpeo","&gt;Most feminists that i have spoke to have been against the type of KillAllMen ideology that seems to plague the actual feminists who are trying to make a real difference and find real change.

Most of the feminists are misandrists(man haters). Misandry is endemic in feminism.

When it comes to misandry, you can divide all feminists into four groups:

1. Feminists that claim misandry does not exist. These are the largest majority in feminism. They go out of their way to trivialise and dismiss sexism against men.
2. Feminists that claim misandry is good for society. These are the second largest majority in feminism. They are usually extremely, overtly misandric.
3. Feminists that discourage misandry for selfish reasons. They fear that it might alienate people from feminism. Most of these feminists hate men, but they lack the courage to  admit to their hate in public.
4. The noobs/ignorants. These are those that are new to feminism suckered into the movement by feminist euphemisms 'equality', 'choice', 'freedom' etc. and have yet to be totally corrupted by this ideology. They are rare to non-existent.

So the good majority of feminists are misandrists.

Feminist theorists have written many books promoting misandry, going so far as arguing its an essential part of feminism without which feminism can never achieve success. Take for example one of the most iconic feminist theorists of all time, **Joanna Russ**. In an article authored by herself in 1972 titled **The New Misandry** published in a leading, multi-Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper, she promotes misandry/man hatred and violence against men to feminists/women.

She writes:

**'Gee, isn't it awful for women to hate men?'**

'**People even talk as if hating men meant murdering all of them right away**…Man haters are people who feel a certain way (not even all the time, believe it or not); they aren’t instant murderesses'.

'**To condemn misandry is to have higher standards for women than for men'**

'**Feminists who want feminism to be respectable are afraid the “radicals” will go “too far.” That is, man-hating gives the show away** \- **we aren’t merely liberals; our complaints are drastic; we’re demanding not asking; we’re breaking the mould in the most thorough way possible; we really mean it**.’ Essentially, what she is saying here is that those in feminism who oppose misandry oppose it not because they think it's wrong, but because they are afraid it will expose the reality of feminism to the world. Additionally, she says that feminists really mean their misandry. She goes on in the article to celebrate Valerie Solanas' Society for Cutting Up Men Manifesto and for her attempt to murder men.

Joanna Russ wasn't just an average feminist. She was a mover and shaker in feminism and in this aforementioned article she not only promotes misandry but she actually promotes the murder of men.

The face behind the hate - Joanna Russ:

So yeah, misandry is a very serious and very real problem in feminism, a violent murderous ideology, a huge risk to all men, everywhere.

P.S. This is nothing. I am just touching the tip of the iceberg that is misandry in feminism.

&gt;I've learned that a lot of those types of people use a common strategy of saying very extreme thing just to get attention, just long enough to drag in victims. It's very similar to what a lot of cults use, and it can be devastating for a movement such as feminism.

I am anti-feminist. I have been researching feminism for close to fifteen years and I have been an anti-feminist for just over ten years now.

I am an anti-feminist because I oppose all of the core principles on which feminism is based as well as most of its peripheral concepts.

Most people are followers led in their beliefs like cattle by their instincts, instincts often disconnected from the reality of the ideology to which they subscribe. They all share one common characteristic, near total ignorance. So, I do not ever judge ideologies by the often ignorant and unreliable opinions and actions of their followers, but by their dogma as it is defined by its most celebrated and widely accepted theorists. It is these theorists in feminism and their ideas that I find highly flawed and destructive.

&gt;I have met plenty of ""feminists"" who subscribe to these hateful ideologies as well, but being that i consider myself a feminist as well, it makes me seem a lot less foreign, and despite all their hatred for men that they talk about on the internet, they see this as a reason to not hate me in particular, as if i am ""one of the good ones.""

To be honest, you're being used by them for their cause i.e female supremacy. They see you as an useful idiot.

&gt;I feel that this is the best possible way we can take back the feminist movement and drive it into a direction for equality.

There's nothing you can take back.

"hqd0o11","I don’t know what to say. I’ve been in this spot, having said something  inappropriate, because a student pushed me to the limit. The few times it has happened to me, I ended up berating them and within seconds, knew I had screwed up. Don’t get me wrong. The student was being an asshole, whatever he was doing. But he’s raised by assholes who have literally never shown him how to act appropriately or get attention in healthy ways. 
I waited til the end of the period &amp; told him, in front of the whole class who’d witnessed me berate him earlier, that I handled that situation all wrong. I said I had lost my cool, and that while I was sick and tired of being interrupted, no one deserves to be annihilated publicly. I’m pretty sure I had asked “what’s wrong with you?” &amp; called him an “absolute idiot.” I might have even called him a “crackhead,” which used to be my favorite insult for a student being an idiot intentionally. I circled back to my specific comments and said I wanted to clarify that while Johnny’s behaviors may have been ignorant and inconsiderate, he’s not an idiot. He’s a kid with plenty of potential…as long as he doesn’t interrupt me anymore. I never had to give him a second warning…I just said his name and looked at him and he knew…
“This guy is not just busting my balls. He cares about me.”

He came back to me over a year later, when I wasn’t even his teacher anymore, and told me that I was the first adult who really apologized to him…definitely publicly. I have never forgotten that. If you (the student) are treated like shit, and then no one ever recognizes or apologizes for that, then yeah…it sucks that they’ve landed on our (teacher) doorstep this way…but we either perpetuate their cycles, or try to break them. There’s not a lot of in between that I can see. If I didn’t feel like I could perceive this and break them (sometimes), there’s no way I’d do this job. Kids are too mean and parents suck too bad. A kid told my coworker who’d lost a baby to sids, just a few months later, that she “was glad” the teacher lost her baby because she’s a bitch anyway. Again, you are either going to perpetuate that shit, or find a way, painfully, and with consequences for them that are appropriate, to help them see that these behaviors they exhibit will leave them broke, alone, and penniless as adults. 

I always RUN from drug and sex references, pretending to know and understand nothing of what they discuss. It is the only way. They can not see you indulge in violence, drug use, or sex. Even though we have our own lives and probably need a little of all of the above to stay sane, the students just can’t see you that way. Of course we can’t control how they choose to see us…I guess I mean that we can’t give them a reason. 

These kids these days are bad as fuck. There’s no two ways about it. I have a girl in my fourth period who has told me at least once a week, for the past 4 months, that we were “gonna fight at some point.” 
Instead of saying something like “oh let me tell you, I’m not the one!” Or “that’d be the last mistake you make ma’am!” Like I want to, I try my fucking best to model for her what she does not have in her life: a sane and responsible adult response. I say “Now Kionna you and I both know that you wouldn’t swing on a teacher.” 
She proceeds to tell the class that she most definitely would, and snatched one’s wig off her head before etc. From there I say “Eh, maybe Kionna. That doesn’t sound like you. Regardless of how it sounds though…you know I care about you. Not to be weird, but you know that. Anything you see as me quote “coming for you” is really just me trying to help you pass. Nothing personal Kionna. You know that. We ain’t gonna fight.”

After typing all of this, I realize that it seems bad. It seems like I’m tooting my own horn or something, but I promise you I am not. To me, this is what appropriate responses look like. I made tons of mistakes along the last decade of teaching, before getting to this place of (maybe) thinking I see the point to all this craziness. You HAVE to be able to do this for them. First of all, it covers your ass. Secondly, when the parent or admin wants to meet, you HAVE to be able to convey that whatever happened, was a result of you not trying to win, or get the best of them, but make them better. I tell my worst period of the day often that I want something way better than working at McDonald’s for each and every one of them. The few times some kid said that was rude or disrespectful, I said that I truly care about their earning power when they graduate. I followed up with the very real truth that if they can’t learn and maintain soft skills, they won’t be able to reach above McDonald’s for the $15 hr jobs at CVS and Target, much less the $20 hr and up jobs at Amazon down the road. 

If it’s about proving a point, or showing them they’re idiots, you will never win. 
If it’s about making them better people, you still may not win, but your ass will be covered enough to where your career can continue. At the very least, you can personally win, but continuing to do what you hopefully love and see some fulfillment in doing. 

Now. A gesture of violence is tough to come back from. But it can be done. It’s pretty impossible to come back from making sexual references though. I think the school system dealing with first year teacher behaviors such as these will only take one of two paths. They will either see you as teachable, and move forward with you. Or they will see you as a liability, and choose not to move forward with you because the risks are just too high. 

I think that you should not try to work in this school system ever again, but if you seek therapy and find some clarity on it all…and still have a desire to make a difference in this crazy world of teaching…then yeah I think you can get back into it…with a totally different mindset, mantra, classroom management, all of the above. I don’t think that this first year of bad experiences has to mean that you wasted all your time and money and you can never recover and be successful in this field again. Take some time. Find YOUR place in where things got fucked up, and learn from it. Most of all, forgive yourself and move on. Tons of teachers have fucked up worse. You did not provide what these kids needed this year. But you also didn’t screw them up anymore. Anyway, take the time and own your shit. If at the end of that, you still want to be in this field, I think you can make it. The shortage is real, and not all principals will see this as the end of the world.

"hqd0dnd","It makes sense if you’re from Finland. I mean there, the most influential ideologies were fighting to take over. During this war, it was registered as an historical fact that the regular people (the masses) chose between the clashing ideologies and won by almost a democratic process. The union of the masses for a greater cause. They fought against communism, since they were more convinced by the narrative coming from the capitalist elite. Driven by the ideology of capitalist elites, the Finish people felt a pseudo freedom of thought and choice. The elites managed to convey a good enough narrative for the Finish to die for. Your political choices and beliefs are a joke. A sad one, since you’re compliant in Pavlovian ways to an elites ideology and are quite submissive. Non responding, never tacking action, just eating, reproducing and dying. Sometimes protesting (peacefully) for a couple of reforms. 
But the fight was really between the elites, the elites that believed in communism and the elites that believed in capitalism. Not you, the masses, that don’t have any thoughts of their own. But feel such a part of something greater. This feeling, being part of something, is your greatest delusion. 
The elites that believed in capitalism won, but used and disposed of their masses to win the bloody part of it. The one that implied human lives. Only in that part you had a participation, where you die. A necrophilic one, In which your blood and not that one of elites was spilled as part of the necessary fucking slaughterhouse to impose a new world order. But nonetheless you are proud and feel like you’ve won some battle. You feel free and entitled. As if you, the masses, determined some history. Lol, well yes. You died for it. But you, the masses, didn’t have a say in the systems design. It’s funny that you think you did. You chose, between two options. None of them you designed, you just picked one and hated the other. That was enough to convince you to die and kill for it. 
Whats funnier is that socialist ideas made Finland a fine place to live and not the capitalist ones. In that way, Finland is better than America. People in Finland have access to healthcare, education and all that they need to live a good life. But Americans don’t. Unless they own the world. 
What Finish people ignore is their exploitation of the global south. Here in Latin America we know very well how our tropical resources are sustaining the “good life” of the European and American people. Here, we know how you exploit our people for your good life. Which in most cases is unsustainable. And here you don’t die nor kill anyone to change that. Because it’s not the elites brainwashing you. 
You, the European masses, are just unaware, and a bit racist. 
Your continent is quite boring in terms of natural diversity and culture. But you expect general knowledge (culture) and other masses to know your countries, their history and geography. Seriously expecting people to know the capital of the Netherlands. Like it means something. It’s fucking useless. Irrelevant knowledge for the rest of the world that should focus on knowledge about exploitation. At the same time, you know shit about African cities, culture and even Latin America. Latin America has much broader and interesting history than the sociopathic one of Europe. Nonetheless, you don’t know shit about it. And don’t consider it as general knowledge. You would consider a person dumb if they don’t know about some shitty and unimportant place in Europe but have zero information about Chilenian revolution.
You have no idea about colonialism. Dude, your life is sustained by the exploitation of the global south. Your good life.

First, you are making a generalization. I'll give you that this position you claim might be based on your own anecdotal evidence and experience but it is not an absolute truth.

Second, the right and left aren't these definite groups or entities that aligning with means you fall into categories labeled by the group opposite to you. There are parts you like and parts you don't and you more than likely engage with people who are like minded.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, the way people engage in an argument is how I separate the ideology from the person. More often than not those from the Left how have a more difficult time in engaging with viewpoints they disagree with without resorting to insults and a condescending attitude to which they argue. 

Same can be said with individuals on the Right.

We should all make a more concerted effort to engage with others civilly and take each person as a different conversation instead of lumping them into one category and refusing to participate.

"hqc97jf","Honestly, I'm just disappointed that someone in this subreddit would say something so ignorant and spiteful.

The coronavirus pandemic is a serious global issue that has killed millions of people worldwide and harmed many more. Vaccines are a safe and effective preventative measure against the virus that is widely available at little to no cost to nearly everyone in most developed countries. The vaccine (and booster shot) greatly reduces the risk of catching COVID and *dramatically reduces* the risk of hospitalization or adverse health effects from the virus.

There is no reason to try to persuade people to not be vaccinated, and it is incredibly disappointing that so many celebrities, comedians, actors, athletes, etc. are vocally against the vaccine. Joe Rogan, Aaron Rodgers, LeBron James, Nicki Minaj--they all have huge influence over millions, if not billions, of fans, and they put real people's lives at risk by convincing people to not be vaccinated.

It's ridiculous. [This blog post by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sums up my thoughts well](https://kareem.substack.com/p/dear-lebron-heres-the-covid-19-help).

If you are not already vaccinated, I strongly urge you to go get the vaccine as soon as possible.

&gt; The fear of really being committed when you know it could all go away , and you know you'll just replace the same people with a copy of the same people, like sheets of paper , even though its not really the same white paper.

Yeah I mean, that's the essence of the show. Other Ricks are fine with losing Mortys and buying more of them. The protagonist Rick is different because he cares. Evil Rick mocks him for it when he's showing Rick the images of Morty's childhood

&gt; Evil Rick: You’ve lived quite a life, Rick. It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through.

&gt; (The memories change theme to feature Morty in each one. Rick tears up)

&gt; Evil Rick: You’re crying? Over a Morty?

&gt; Rick: No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.

&gt; Evil Rick: Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe, it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys.

Rick cares about his Morty. He makes actual sacrifices in order to protect him. And that probably drives him crazy because his connection to that specific Morty is irrational when put in context of infinite universes. Making sacrifices for those ones is irrational, and he is ruthlessly rational in every other part of his life.

But his enduring connection to the protagonist Morty actually makes Rick a better person over the course of the show and is even referenced as a way protagonist Rick is superior to other Ricks. And therefore, even if that connection is technically irrational, there is a benefit to it. And I think that is a message of the show. Human relationships are messy, irrational, and ultimately insignificant. But they still matter to us, and that's a good enough reason to care.

Like, a lot of people incorrectly think the show is saying ""everything is bullshit when compared to the size and age of the universe. No one cares, no one will remember you. Accepting this makes you smarter than all of the other people who think their issues matter"".

But that's the exact opposite of what the show is saying. 

&gt; Personally I find happiness comes from having the right balance of ignorance and knowledge but progress comes from only knowledge with no room for ignorance.

I don't think that's true, or maybe I'm misunderstanding you.

I think people can be happy and ignorant, and see the world as only about them. But that leads to a lot of suffering because that's not the way to world works, and therefore you'd always have this dissonance between your perception and reality.

But being nihilistic is also not the answer. It doesn't make you smart to realize that nothing actually means anything. It just ends up hurting you because it can be used as an excuse to retreat from society and give up on trying to be happy.

What I think the show is saying is that the best balance is one in which you know nothing means anything, but you choose to put importance on your life and relationships anyway.

And I feel this as well. I used to (and still do) struggle with depression and it was easy to think ""I don't actually have to do any of this. I can just die and not worry about it anymore"". Most people are so obsessed with staying alive that they have to find a way to be happy, but if you don't care about life you can just not play the game.

However, once you realize that nothing matters but you can still enjoy stuff, it's actually a lot easier to deal with life. If nihilism means your happiness doesn't matter, it also means your suffering doesn't matter. Sure you could stress about everything and agonize over every imperfection, or you could just say ""meh, whatever. Later on it won't matter"". And in the meantime, you can find happiness in parts of your life and you don't need cosmic significance to feel fulfilled.

I think that is the route Rick is on. He is detached from thinks that should stress him, which allows him to never worry. But he's empty. However, he is learning that he can choose to be fulfilled by relationships with Morty, Beth, and Summer, even if he knows that they can all be replaced.",1640728551,"i think people can be happy and ignorant, and see the world as only about them.","happy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"happy and ignorant","happy",NA,NA,0

This user if you see her history only used to meet NRI and IITians and then rant here. I said if she only looks at status of a guy before meeting up for marriage she is more bound to get such treatment because NRI and IITians are high in demand in AM market.
Yes I said the above things and believe that the guy was right at smirking. Your only criteria for this guy was IIT tag. You get IIT tag. Now be happy with it. Also They are not married yet. They are looking around. She will choose the best suitor who has best combination of NRI and IIT. She may choose IITian who is NRI. And she gets what she gets. Nothing to rant. Again , these people are not married yet. 

&gt; Why do you want equal treatment from a higher-earning wife then?

Yes because she is wife. I am not looking at a prospect to marry like in above case. I am married. I don't expect equal treatment from high earning woman when I go to meet them(I don't filter solely based on some woman's income or IIT or NRI status) or when a rishta comes. They can be all asshole they want. And I wouldn't marry them.

I am not sure you get the difference or not. But there's huge difference. Don't marry someone you can't treat equally. If you are married then don't be an asshole. There are plenty of fish in the sea. If you don't respect someone or look down upon someone for their money or college name why waste your own time, effort and money to marry them?

But once you are married it's not him or her. It's them. So act like a team. 

&gt;Sahi hypocrisy hai.

I don't think you understand hypocrisy. Hypocrisy would happen when I am planning to marry a woman who earns significantly less than me and then planning to treat her disrespectfully and then expect that if in some alternate world some other high earning woman marries me she should treat me respectfully.

"hqb91sf","&gt;Yeah, you may have time for this, I certainly don’t. This debate has inflated to way too many topics for me to address, so I will have to pick and choose.

Yes, bodily rights can be ""inflated"" and complicated. The fact that you admitted ""you don't have time for this"" literally shows your refusal to be educated about the topic and why your PL belief, and the PL community as a whole is ignorant and wrong about the abortion topic. Your facile understanding of bodily rights is why you think an unwanted pregnancy does not apply to bodily rights; or at least, bodily rights can be suspended in favor of abortion restrictions.  


&gt;UN Declarations, etc., that every declaration of rights is a work in progress.

How so? When was the last time the UDHR been changed/updated? Has it *ever* been changed or updated? When has *any* Human Rights been changed or updated? Is Human Rights something that is *objective?* Or *subjective?* I'm pretty sure they're subjective. So if you want people to be and/or become PL, you need provide compelling enough reasons.  


&gt;That the UN as a body doesn’t accept a particular position is a fallacious appeal to authority.

Of course. Just as it would be a fallacious appeal to authority had I used the US's Constitution, or any other countries Constitution for that matter. The UDHR is a baseline for human rights, so might as well use the baseline as an example, right?  


&gt;To the extent that the UN as a body wishes to protect abortion rights, my argument is that they are wrong.

So by all means, explain and justify how they are wrong. PL'ers have been trying to do it for over 70 years now, and have continually failed to do so.  


&gt;I reject this statement. I do not believe that a pregnant person’s right to bodily integrity always supersedes the right to life of the fetus inside.

Then feel free to justify this position. It's a universally held belief that you are the sole owner of your body and that no one has rights to it. You'd have to make a pretty convincing argument as to why someone should lose their bodily rights over a fetus.  


&gt;You are simply stating your conclusion without supporting it. You are making a fundamental assumption, one that I and millions of other people disagree with.

This is an **extremely** disrespectful comment, as **ALL** of my responses to you, **ESPECIALLY my last one** (including all of the sources contained within*)*, have supported that position.

Your comment shows that you are not actually reading my comments, nor reading my sources; as I have extensively defended that position. In fact, a fetuses rights aren't even being superseded.

"hqawyy4","&gt;more important than discoveries in physics

They're both important, but to pretend that physics discoveries have the same type of lasting affect and influence that spiritual figures and their beliefs have had on the world. It doesn't take a religious person to acknowledge this very basic fact but it would definitely come with ease from a materialistic fundamentalist anti-theist. Somebody like yourself would find it very difficult naming 5 or six important scientists from different cultures from BCE and before, but find it much easier to list a handful of deities, notable spiritural teachers, and even their specific beliefs. Intentionally disagreeing with this very obvious fact is just intellectual dishonesty at its simplest. Which I believe is funny in a way, considering you yourself are fervish with materialist indoctrination, which makes you have religious-tier esteem for specific physicists and believe their contributions to that field is somehow equivalent to the work and teachings of impactful philosophers and medicants.

&gt;the fictional jesus in your book.

1. Not a Christian, for starters.
2. Please don't repeat that infront of a history major. There is a Roman account of his existence and there were written accounts of him by his disciples around the time of and after his death. If you are going to discount the fact that there was a human being who we referred to as Jesus Christ being real, then you need to also discount historical accounts of Plato, Homer, Heraclitus, Xeno of Crate, and especially Socrates, because the only 'evidence' of their existences are eyewitness accounts and people who studied underneath them. 

&gt;both same books

Very telling you haven't done much introspection on the topic itself, or just blatantly have read anti-theist critiques of the literature and not much beyond that from trying to look up 'cool bible passages to own the fundies with.'

The Gnostic gospels, which are most of the earlier Christian works, don't have Jesus being betrayed for money by Judas and he is given up to the authorities for a completely different reason. Also, it doesn't take much literary skill to recognize that with the other take that both Joseph and Jesus were 'betrayed for money' that they're establishing a parallel.

&gt;it almost sounds like the council of narcia decided what stories made jesus sound more than a mortal

Except he was definitely more particular than the normal person. He's more than a mortal in a similar, but not exact, way that Socrates is more than a mortal. It's not hard to figure out that, if you actually go beyond reading modern English tranations and try to seek out more intact source material, that the Bible, (like the quoran or things like Vedic and buddhist scripture) is 2/3rds words with hidden meaning. Please find a translation of the Gospel of Thomas, as the entire sermon is about finding the 'hidden' meaning that lies in the metaphors and phrases of the teachings. The fact that you can only read the tale as it is literally happening and can not perceive the meaning of the metaphors or words being used means that you are missing basically the entire scriptures. Let those who have ears, let them hear.

&gt;1000 years of anti-blasphemy laws
 
just gonna repeat that you should do more historical research on this topic because it is very clear you are repeating points made by historically and theologically uneducated people. Lots of different societies had different spiritual and cultural practices, which era and which part of the world are you referring to? People who make very broad statements like that typically don't have much knowledge in that topic, like 'the concept of law was created by hamurabi's code'. It's a sweeping statement made by people with not even bare minimum expertise in the subject.

&gt;newton's discoveries will last forever

Ah, this is specifically anthropologically ignorant. Knowledge is carried as far as the people who haul it. Newton thankfully was similar to the spiritual teachers he studied, and regarded himself as another person in a very long tradition of understanding the nature of reality and pointing out to everybody who has not understood it. He was extremely religious and perceived himself as doing work for God and letting its creations understand itself better, he would also not be saying something very ignorant and foolish like his mathematical work is equivalent in impactfulness to the teachings of the most esteemed spiritual figures of All-Time.

You say this in a way that makes it sound like a bad thing to try and be moral or ethical.   I don't invest in businesses that I feel are not aligned with ethical practices.  

I am fully prepared that you will argue that I still purchase things from companies that exploit child labour, and that I am not without sin etc etc, and I do accept that I am not perfect nor do I always make perfect choices, however when I am presented with a situation in which I am very clearly able to distinguish good from bad, such as the cult following of crypto, I do prefer to make what I believe to be the moral and ethical choice.   Not because it makes me feel superior, but because I believe it is the right thing to do. 

I am very ""interested in this space"", as I have numerous friends and family members trying to convince me to get involved, but all of the research I do leads me to be very wary of the whole thing, as it all smells like a cult, and is full of greed, ignorance and hysteria, and I believe it will all come crashing down.

"hq9a50s","Magic. And technology. And how ignorant and illogical and stupid the wizards and witch are (exclude Hermione and Dumbedore).

First, magic is obviously unrealistic. 

Second, technology. The entire wizarding world is stuck in the medieval ages. No electricity, no computers. Magic seems to have some kind of interactions with tech, but sure, they can figure out how to incorporate both. Using computers in the Ministry will sure help with the mess of bureaucratic thingy there. Using electricity will make wizards' lives thousands of times better. Using some machine guns, and no wizard would be fast enough to cast a protego to protect himself (unless he can use charm without saying it, something only a few can do, as most wizard and witches are shown to be very bad at magic, many adults are magically-weaker than schoolboys at Hogwarts).

Third, the ignorance of the magical communities. What the hell is the Ministry ? Get taken by a silence revolt ? Then in 9 months get taken by another revolt lead by a schoolboy just because of your Dark Lord died ?

The illogical fear of Muggles. I know, it is meant to represent the senselessness of racism in real life, but it still bug me, as much as racism. Just think of how wizards could be if they just learn technology from Muggles. Also, they think that they can take over the world of Muggles in a war (not a silence coup by using Polyjuice potions) when the muggles literally outnumber them 10,000 to 1 and have weapons that can delete an entire country in a shot (nukes). And the fact that most wizards are bad at magic (the Weasley brothers said that even in the Ministry, there are few who could cast such a simple spell as the Protection charm).

And they breed soul sucking creatures to keep prisoners in a prison that you could be sent without any crimes (Hagrid's case). And their government is a totalarian dystopian horror like a mixture of a Byzatine bureaucracy and shadow council. Ministers only do things that benefit them. Citizens believe everything the press say.

The US is special, all good things were developed by the US, everything is historically black and white whilst knowing less about their own history than an ant knows about the moon landing.

Maybe the US expats (even the well educated ones) are not representative of the average US person; but it is those expats who are 'the hell'. They aren't stupid, just ill educated and culturally naive. 

They are the ones who have never heard of operation paperclip, who believe Hollywood equates to reality. They are the ones who just don't get it, that the US is not exceptional.

As for the cold war that would have predominantly been addressed by people now referred to as 'boomers' by current US people. Which is quite amusing and reflects poorly on the current us person and their knowledge of history. They certainly don't venerate or appreciate cold war sacrifices.

&gt;&gt;I'm trying to understand his motivation for crossing while the light was still red.

&gt;The motivation is that he is a lazy dumb fuck. People will play into your heart strings in order to get sympathy from others and other material things.

Why did he cross on the red light? You say it's because he's homeless and doesn't need a wheelchair.

I'm trying to figure out what the fuck that would have to do with anything. But I'm also trying to figure out why it matters if he needs the chair or not. Because considering how many wheelchair users get shit from people who don't understand how many people need chairs that aren't stuck in them, it sure sounds like you're jumping in here with things that are very abelist and ignorant, and have nothing to do with the issue at hand.

&gt;For one. The idiot is crossing on red hand. He doesn’t have the right away.

Yeah, no shit. He doesn't have the right-of-way. That's why dude at a minimum made a poor choice, and is arguable an idiot for making the crossing.

That doesn't explain why your previous answer brought in whether or not he's homeless and whether or not he needs the wheelchair.

&gt;This type of behavior is characteristic of someone who doesn’t give a fuck and will utilize his “disability” to get what he want or con people for shit.

You have no clue if dude is homeless or not, but you have assumed. And assumptions that have brought on a whole other cascase of assumptions on top of them.

I'll skip over some other points I'd like to make and just get to this:

&gt;Just because you haven’t seen malicious behavior from people in wheelchair doesn’t mean that it doesn’t happen. Now get off my nuts!

Just because you see some people behave in a certain way doesn't EVEN mean that this person is homeless or faking disability. None of that has anything to do with the idiotic decision they made to cross when they didn't have the right-of-way.

But what you ARE doing is basically saying ""Hey, that dude looks black. Man, I bet they commit crime! This video of them running down the street? I bet they're running away from just having committed a crime!""

It's not a good look on you and doesn't help the negative stereotypes.

You claim to know that wheelchairs can be valid for people who can stand up? Then you, more than the average joe, should know that has little or nothing to do with this person being an idiot.

Even if they ARE homeless, even if they ARE faking a disability, it has nothing to do with them being stupid and crossing on a red. So why even bring it up?

Oh, because it's clear that you think homeless people are bad people from the way you talk about them.

I'm just saying there's a shitload of everything in what you said that shouldn't have been said or even thought.

Are there homeless people that act poorly? Sure. Are there non-homeless that act poorly? Oh, but that's somehow different. People shit on homeless people way more than homeless people shit on property - and if we actually took care of our homeless and didn't lock them out of everywhere, maybe they'd have better places to shit anyway.

So no, I'm not backing up off your nuts. I think everything you have said is highly inappropriate.

Am I perfect? Hells no. I fuck shit up all the time. But you hit some hot button issues with me. lol. And yeah, I'm calling you out strongly, and still have reason to do so. But I will say - I'm sure you're a perfectly good guy, and while I *am* slamming your balls with a sledgehammer, I'm sure you do good things for people in your life and all that business.

"hq7kwsk","&gt;Like, if it was about only diagnosed people I'll be mostly ok with it, but almost everyone there is diagnosing their ex partners themselves and it infuriates me.

I couldn't agree more, this is my primary issue with the sub. They often complain that they aren't therapists and can't be expected to deal with all the bpd drama because of that, yet they're apparently experts at diagnosing others...

Today I deadass saw someone upvoted for saying the sub is ""basically just a support sub for those with abusive partners, it's not important for them to have the borderline diagnosis"". Then maybe you should call it /r/Abuse_Victim_LovedOnes instead? Do they not see how much this contributes to the already awful bpd stigma?

They don't seem capable of recognizing that this causes the cyclical issue of people misdiagnosing loved ones, sharing stories that align more with NPD/ASPD/etc features, and then others with similar experience see it as 'proof' that their ex had BPD, and so the cycle perpetuates. They talk about how so many of their stories are *so* similar without realizing that the majority of the familiar aspects are present in almost any unhealthy/abusive relationship regardless of diagnosis, so they come out of it thinking that those abusive traits and aspects are just what borderline is. That's why people say it's a hate sub, even though that confuses them- the bottom line message they push is ignorant and often hateful.

It's unfortunate for the portion of users who are reasonable and genuinely care for their loved ones who go there looking for help and support, I've seen folks like that be heavily downvoted and insulted for disagreeing with their hateful echo-chamber. 

Oh, and lately it seems they also love to claim BPD is uncurable and only a tiny % can ever improve through treatment and medication, but then go on to relentlessly shit-talk their 'loved one' for being unmedicated or untreated.

Decreasing wavelengths correspond with higher frequency radiation and a higher amount of energy per photon. While UVB radiation is widely recognized for its harmful effects on human skin and links to skin cancer, each of the UV bands (UVA, UVB and UVC) create different risks for humans.

While 207-222nm far-UVC generated from filtered excimer lamps can [efficiently deactivate drug-resistant bacteria without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w), simplistic flashlights [like this one](http://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1640248#comment-1640248) are very dangerous for your skin and eyes and should not be used without certified protective equipment, and make for an extremely inefficient, dangerous, ignorant, and irresponsible disinfectant.

Please read further on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation) and [here](https://www.klaran.com/is-uvc-safe).

Most of this section was copied from the old ""UVC"" bot entry by Triskite.

All of the lights discussed below fall into the UVA spectrum and are reasonably safe. Best practice is to wear polycarbonate safety goggles (cheap generic ones work great) and not to point the light at anyone's eyes or skin.

**RECOMENDATIONS**

Filter: A ZWB2 filter is a filter that blocks all visible light but allows throught he UV wavelengths. It makes flourescent object really pop when they glow because there's no extra blue light bleeding through and lighting up non-flourescent objects. These filters make a huge difference so you should try and get a light that has one preinstalled if you can.

It’s a vulnerable time, even if the birth goes extremely well recovery feels like healing from a war and everything slows down.

"hq6tfzp","The grass is greener on the other side.  The problem is lack of guide in navigating gender roles. Being a man has its perks and disadvantages  just as much as being a woman has its perks and disadvantages.  Biological differences take part in shaping those gender roles. Now if i assumed being a man is more difficult than what its worth , i'd love to be a woman to adopt benefits of that gender role.  Its barganing because i never been taught how to fit into a new gender role and navigating life in a new role would be challenging and require efforts to combat my genetics.  But i will never fully be a woman, i wouldnt be treated as a woman , and i would never learn the struggles of being a woman- never experience periods or giving birth or clitoral orgasm.  Never experience sexual harrassment to the extent women do.  Instead i would be navigating a whole new role of neither being a man or a woman , so logically i would adopt benefits of both worlds while manipulating disadvantages to my comfort.  My role in society would be useless because i would be neither a manly man capable of strengths and protecting the weak, and i can't bare children.  Instead i feel unsafe , attacked from both groups while navigating identity issues. What would i do ? I'd form a community like LGBTQ for safe space to feel like myself and put my worries to rest.  This safespace , cultural appropriation etc in turn inhibits my emotional potential because suddenly i have an army of people who support me despite if im doing good or bad. Lack of critical feedback wont help me navigate who i ought to be , but instead turns me into a snowflake, where my feelings are protected , my ideas cant be challenged and my pronouns can be whatever i say they are despite that no one cares.  

Lets tak about bullying. Bullying exists as a mechanism to facilitate criticism in the most basic format which is hurtful and ignorant and can be abusive.  However bullying is beneficial at establishing social norms- useful if you want to fit in. 

 As a guy i've been bullied for my weight - while at the time it was hurtful , i understand that my peers pointed it out because being overweight is neither attractive  nor healthy and it affected my image.  This helped to motivate me to stay in shape; i would still be oblivious of importance of this if i lived in a safe bubble where fatshaming is wrong and my feelings are protected. 

If i acted camp and gay during my childhood - peers would bully that behaviour to help me adjust to my expected social role as strong and manly guy.  Although entangled in abuse ( expected in children as they havent developed empathetic filter till a certain age),the main spirit is there to help me longterm. 

So how does this affect my identity ? 
Well if i happen to be born a man but with feminine features like round face , small in size , soft high pitched voice. I'd feel more comfortable calling myself a woman because i would be bullied for attributes outside of my control. And would strive to get a sex change to fit in. But that sex change would never allow me to fit in fully despite best attempts and makeup.  

If i dont get a sex change i will be bullied for just being myself. So do i choose the easy way out and safe space ? Or do i become a man through harsh struggle of reality check ?  Life is already hard, i'd choose the safespace  for temporary solution to my hurt feelings. 

Now , if i dont have the choice of safespace, i have a necessity to survive navigating puberty and figuring out my natural gender role through trial and error.  Because those are the cards i've been dealt in life and i have to make due with them.  I have no choice of my gender, my ethnicity , my socio-economic status nor the family i was born into that is responsible for making me a functioning adult. 

As of right now , i identify myself as a human first. Im a living being capable of range of emotions , behaviours and quirks wayyyy outside of my gender roles. I can act masculin and i can act feminine whenever i want. I can dress in any clothes i want.  But i will choose to adopt social norms fitting with my biological gender simply because its easier to be a man if i was born a man than  to completly change everything that i learned through trial and error simply to mimic someone im not but trying very hard to be.   I think this would only add to my confusion regarding my identity and would become a smokescreen for other underlying issues like self esteem.  

We are intelligent beings and we understand that social norms arent set in stone and they evolve just as fast as fashion.  We are only just starting to eliminate toxic masculinity from men , and teaching women that men arent indestructible emotionally despite our best efforts  of proving you wrong through toxic masculinity because thats a trait we learned through trial and error and bullying. 

With that said , we can adapt to be feminine or masculine despite what we have between our legs.  

Trouble starts when we try to find a partner that carries basic standard of expectations. This creates a niche or pool of potential candidates that fit the predetermined expectations.  

 We tend to look for partners that complete us in areas we are weak.  Together becoming a better function.  We didn't have a say in evolution and how it shaped men to be physically bigger than women  and how it shaped women to be more emotionally aware than men. But as a team it doesnt matter because we carry out roles we were predetermined for in a way that all areas are covered for thriving.  And it works because natural selection determined it that way and possibly put us on top of the food chain. 

Now survival of the fitest wired our brains for tasks we are predetermined for. Individuals excelling at these tasks will be more attractive to the opposite sex  creating a social norm. Thats why its attractive for a guy to be tall and strong and able to provide and if i want to find a mate i need to excel in these traits or compensate somehow depending on competition or become obsolete and not good enough to mate with. 

Pretty hard to figure out the dating dynamic between 2 genders while navigating personality, identity and social norms. 

Now add LGBTQ community into the mix , with fluid sexualities because we dont choose what we are attracted to outside from what social norms condition us to  and suddenly its confusing. Especially when social norms evolve and gender roles become blurred due to feminism. It adds unnecessary complexity to already complex world , reducing pool of candidates due to new variations and new niche subgroups. 

Our identity should be based on our personality , not whats between our legs that determins gender roles. 

Now what im saying isn't ' men have to be this this and that while women have to be this this and that. 

What i am saying however is actions and behaviours have consequences which can impact how our peers view us ( think of attraction ). I can fit myself into a certain category like for example a cis male and adopt traits which will enable me to find a partner which im trying to appease to ( cis women ).  So if i act like a man , look like a man , i will be perceived as a man and be treated according to social norms synonymous with masculinity and being a man.  Its a path of least resistance given i was born as a male. 

Concluding , 
  Your identity is your ego, you are just a vessel capable of adaptation to environment. Whats between your legs gives you a predetermined sexual function but ignores social norms- that said acting a certain way has its consequences among peers and there are favoured traits which determine our attractivness to potential mates. 

If you feel like you need to change everything about you to fit a new role that you identify with. It might be simpler to re-evaluate whats causing this decision and consider that being a man or a woman wont change who you are as a human ( your ego). It will give you more lables increasing complexity and making it harder to find a match.  

Safe space and cultural appropriation of new genders and behaviours provided by LGBTQ community can be toxic when not in moderation - producing a flawed characteristic of being sheltered and unprepared to cope with criticism from peers ( creating snowflake people getting triggered over pronouns).

This my opinion - its not worth anything.

I support LGBTQ community and equal civil rights.
I also support traditional gender roles - it gives stability in figuring out this experience called life.

"hq6mlln","TLDR - You are both absolutely correct. People use ignorant as an insult in current nomenclature.  They are, however, ignorant of the dictionary definition and original usage of the word.


Nowadays, it for sure is used as an insult.  The meaning of words seems to depend on the understanding within the current cultural context.  Following the definition the word could be an insult in the context of calling out someone who is speaking on something they know nothing about or acting in a manner that ignores the negative impact on those around you... but in most circumstances it's misused as an insult.  People use it instead of calling someone an asshole or stupid... but the reality is just as a few people have already said... it's OK to be ignorant and healthy to admit when you are ignorant on a topic, as we all lack knowledge/awareness on certain topics.  Without admitting this how would we ever learn.  ""Baby's are the most ignorant humans in existence"", this sounds like an insult and some may even call me ""ignorant"" for saying it.  Definitionally (is this a word?) speaking they actually probably mean to call me an jerk... which I really technically wouldn't be in this scenario because saying a baby lacks knowledge/awareness is a fact of life rather than an insult.  The word is so often misused that it's meaning has shifted in public culture, so technically I'm not even sure if using it as an insult really would be ""misusing"" it nowadays given that most people view it as an insult.  Words are confusing.  I talk to much.",1640634326,"people use it instead of calling someone an asshole or stupid... but the reality is just as a few people have already said... it's ok to be ignorant and healthy to admit when you are ignorant on a topic, as we all lack knowledge/awareness on certain topics.","ignorant and healthy","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and healthy","healthy",NA,NA,1

"hq6laa2","The comment that started this chain is this:

&gt;I figure the direction-ists are the ones fighting in the streets and shouting slogans who have no idea about what anything is or means while everyone else are just people who think something.

You state outright here that you think that these ""directionists"" ""have no idea about what anything is or means"". How is anyone supposed to interpret this hyperbolic and dismissive statement as anything but adversarial? You're also getting upset that I said out loud what your initial comment inferred and since you don't seem to feel any inclination to expand on it all I can do is interpret the scant information I have. 

And yes, that is asking what you think. I added ""they disagree with me so they must be ignorant and stupid"" because frankly that's an extremely common attitude, especially from people who self identify as centrists, which it appears you do at least to a degree. Had that been the case that would be an easy cue to just move on as there'd be no grounds for discussion. It certainly wouldn't be the first time that has been the case in my years on Reddit.

The biggest issue in this discussion, which I think could be a productive and interesting one if you'd be willing to engage in it rather than look for ways you can dismiss me as not engaging in good faith, is that there is literally no indication of what you believe apart from ""directionists are ignorant"". Even then, ""directionists"" remains undefined and through the context of the thread I can only infer you mean the far left and far right. You're upset that your statements are being, apparently, misinterpreted and I sympathize with that but without any context as to what it is you actually believe that's inevitable.  In the interest of good faith I'll go first and describe my basic position and philosophy so that you have a crumb of context to go alongside my comments:

I believe in the abolition of permanent and unjust hierarchies and want any hierarchical position (ranging from elected delegates to factory floor managers to military officers) to be elected by the people concerned and immediately recallable. I want democracy to be more accountable, more consensual and more decentralized and I'm for it's extension into our work lives, which are now run as a series of petty dictatorships.

"hq6h8pc","I'm well aware that people who book last minute are generally unprepared, non-planners and likely to be bad guests, but there is a sweet spot. Being booked solid a full 6 weeks in advance means you have good guests who got cheap rates. Being unbooked 2 weeks out means you are charging too much and eventually going to get bad guests. It's not a linear drop off. 

Every property and region is different. Outright dismissing a strategy is quite frankly, ignorant and unhelpful to OP. I'm glad you found what works for you. For me, I doubled my monthly gross income by raising my prices very high 2 months out, and tapering them down slowly every week until the week of booking. 

Further, you don't need to be booked solid to have optimal income. In fact you're probably better off not being booked solid if you are charging high enough. For example, if you charge $100/night and have a 100% monthly occupancy rate, that's $3k/mo in revenue. If you charge $300/night and you have a 30% monthly occupancy rate, that's the same amount of revenue, but your expenses went down.

"hq691pu","The fact that Caitlyn does not have any cool scene is only the tip of the iceberg. Arcane did her dirty in general.
  


Think about every single interaction between her and Vi, and try to find a single example of Caitlyn having a ""last word"". Of her being actually, and consequently correct in an argument of sorts.
  
I'll give you one. Right after she chases off Sevika, when she blames Vi for alerting Silco's goons.
  
That's it. That's literally it. You won't find anything else. And even here Vi could easily defend herself, which I guess she didn't do because of dizziness...
  


Vi: He's gonna know we're here now...
  
Caitlyn: Who's fault is that?
  
Me: Yours, Caitlyn. Sure, Vi did attack her, and get beaten up, but you COULD just shot her in the head. So you are just as much at fault here.
  


Almost everything else Caitlyn says and does, is either foolish, naive, hypocritical, or all at once. Sometimes she even gets ignorant, and insensitive. Characters like Vi, Heimendiger, and even Ekko (who's in this show for like 20 minutes...) get at least one good quote. A line, which can be used as an advice in real-life scenarios, becouse it does not touches a very specific situation. Name one such a quote from Caitlyn.
  
You can't.
  
Because there is none.
  
Her two most memorable speeches are literal apologies, and they don't go anywhere. They have no consequences. Everything she says is either proven wrong, or disregarded. Even when she is technically right, it does not matter, because someone will find something to say, in order to shut her up (oil and water, anyone...?). And that only makes her look like someone who either does not believe in what he says, or is too incompetent to give a good argument. Or both. I used to like her talk with Vi in the latter childhood home, but on a rewatch I realized a lot of things Vi said, she did while hallucinating, making Caitlyn's words feel empty, since she does not understand what Vi meant. Her scene with a shimmer junkie (love that scene, btw) would be great, even with what happened with the guy later, but when you realize that was literally her only major win, it kinda loses it's meaning.
  


And then we get to her actual competence, which is almost non-existent. Caitlyn is one of the most useless characters in this series. Episode 4 is fine, if you don't nitpick that she got caught in Powder's distraction, or was unable to talk to her superiors in an effective way. It's also the only episode which shows her investigative skills. And what she achived through this skills? Well, she met Vi, who's literally the only reason for Caitlyn's existence in this show. After that it's only worse. Vi just keeps humiliating her on every step, with both her skills, experience and during aforementioned conversations. Caitlyn saves her life by shooting a beat-up woman from a higher position (impresive... -,-), after that she gives away her rifle, and becomes factually useless. She does not do anything that's remotely meaningful, and in every ensuing confrontation she's taken out of equasion in first few seconds, without landing a single hit. Twice by literal ONE punch, and once off-camera. Not to mention some of her decisions actually caused some of those incidents. Then there is her entire body-language during tense-situations, which is mostly limited to quivering and covering, that I understand and would give a pass if not literally every other thing I just mentioned.
  


,,But Caitlyn is not a main character, in addition to being one of many others! There was no time to give her meaningful scenes!""
  


Well, if you don't have time to give someone more moments to shine, how about not using time you have to focus on said character's flaws? Caitlyn actually have all the screen-time she needs, all that was needed, was to make those scenes differently. Make her act in different way, and say different things!
  


Ex:
  
When Vi knocks down her house with one punch, after Caitlyn struggling to do so, what we basically see are two heroines, who are equally smart. But Vi is stronger.
  
How about making Vi actually want to take on shimmered goons in a fight, but also having Caitlyn stopping her and telling her to punch a weak pillar? That way you show both how strong Vi is, how clever Caitlyn is, AND how well they work together!
  


There were so many things you could do! Make her actually suspect Marcus of corruption early on! Make her succesfully convince other enforcers on the bridge of her right, before the explosion, showing her leadership skills, which are damn well needed for a future-sheriff! Make her ask Vi what happened to her parents, instead of assuming she should have them! And since she's giving lessons of trust, make her actually trusting others! All those things does not require more scenes, just few changes!
  


,,But Arcane Caitlyn is a rookie, sheltered by her parents! Her naivety, and incompetence are part of her arc, that's the way they meant her to be!""
  


Oh, really!? Making Caitlyn utterly incompetent, always wrong, or inactive character to THE VERY END OF THE SEASON, whose only redeemable qualities are the fact that she means well, and feels sorry whenever she fails, all for the sake of under-developed character arc, is a good way of directing her, you say? Well, I don't know if creators meant it to be that way, but I sure know I don't have to enjoy it.
  


Making Caitlyn a rookie is not a bad concept on its own. Being a rookie, and lacking experience in certain domains, does not mean she has to be shot-down, or outdone by everyone around. It does not mean she can't have skills that are very useful (and.. Use them, for example...?), or have certain skills in general. It does not mean she has to bo wrong at every step, simply becouse she did not witness things first-hand. She's supposed to be one of the most clever characters around! She's literally Sherlock Holmes of Runeterra! You are telling me, it could never occur to her, that there might be corruption within enforcers ranks? You are telling me, she could never know some people abuse legal power they have in inhuman way? You are telling me, she never thought that many citizens of Zaun were left orphaned at young age? That's just ridiculous!
  


Truth is, Vi did more bad-ass things when she was a teenager, than Caitlyn did in the entire show. And since Caitlyn has less screen time, I think it's especially vital for her to get prominent moments that shows her competence, and her own legitimacy. That could make her... You know...? Likable? Admirable? Favored?
  


And don't you dare telling me it would be unrealistic. The show clearly does not care about that. Jayce - FREAKING JAYCE - is shown to hold his own against cyber-shimmer-mutants, even though nothing indicated he had any fighting training whatsoever! Yeah, having abbs does not equal martial prowess! And Caitlyn was made an enforcer! Are you telling me, they have ZERO training requierd? Are you telling me, Caitlyn couldn't learn anything about hand-to-hand combat, or moving through a city while giving a chase? Even if not (somehow...?), there are tons of other ways you could explain her skills and experience, while you don't have to do it at all, which Jayce kindly showed us (side note: I hate this entire fight scene, solely becouse Jayce is in it. And I am one o those rare people that actually like Jayce).

When you think about it, all the characters are shown to be quite, if not very competent in what they are doing (exept for politics, I guess...). Vi does not seem to need learning much, same is with Jinx. Ekko is doing pretty well with what he does. Viktor and Jayce are amazing scientists, and then there was the Jayce fight scene... Everybody seems to be really good at something. Everybody exept Caitlyn. One bleeding goon found, and three bullets shot into a metal arm.

First, idk why you think I'm arguing with you to begin with, we literally agree with each other (I do think your previous comment is slightly ignorant and very dickish though tbh). I explicitly agree that she's a POS and that the system failed to maintain justice. Her guilt has not been determined yet, so hopefully it ends a bit more fairly but we cant know that yet. 

I think the only thing I disagree with you is whether or not a person can be jailed prior to an investigation is completed. And whether you like it or not, the fact is that you can absolutely be thrown in jail for a period of time with absolutely no evidence. This is why bail is a thing. There are limits to how long this holding period can be, which differ from place to place.

As for the reviewing of evidence you are right that is absolutely part of the process, but of course it takes time, anywhere from days to even years sometimes. So during that time a person can be held (with limits) or released on bail. The man's alleged crime was violent in nature so his bail was denied. And during that time evidence was collected, reviewed, and acted on. Those actions would have included his release as well as filing counter charges against the woman for whatever they decided to slap her with based on the discovered evidence.

As far as her due punishment, its still coming (at the time of the video at least). This story was reported right after her bail hearing.

While selling games you have two options: You can either sell them online for other people to buy at a higher price, which takes some effort, or sell them to GameStop with ease but get less money. Expecting GameStop to both make the process is easy and pay high is hypocrisy. 

I am not saying these to shame people for wanting to save money.

Yes those who are already unhealthy and at risk of larger VL become safer for the general population by being vaccinated, this puts them in relation to a healthier individual, the original young healthy adult is already a low vector quantity and in the history of medicine they would never be expected to be subjected to subcutaneous injection for something that would not benefit them or the general population significantly.

&gt;I found that the nation had at first tried universal suffrage pure and simple, but had thrown that form aside because the result was not satisfactory. It had seemed to deliver all power into the hands of the ignorant and non-tax-paying classes; and of a necessity the responsible offices were filled from these classes also.

&gt;A remedy was sought. The people believed they had found it; not in the destruction of universal suffrage, but in the enlargement of it. It was an odd idea, and ingenious. You must understand, the constitution gave every man a vote; therefore that vote was a vested right, and could not be taken away. But the constitution did not say that certain individuals might not be given two votes, or ten! So an amendatory clause was inserted in a quiet way; a clause which authorised the enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute. To offer to ""limit"" the suffrage might have made instant trouble; the offer to ""enlarge"" it had a pleasant aspect. But of course the newspapers soon began to suspect; and then out they came! It was found, however, that for once--and for the first time in the history of the republic --property, character, and intellect were able to wield a political influence; for once, money, virtue, and intelligence took a vital and a united interest in a political question; for once these powers went to the ""primaries"" in strong force; for once the best men in the nation were put forward as candidates for that parliament whose business it should be to enlarge the suffrage.

These adjectives still seem to apply given your description. What doesn't apply is ""evil"".

This is generally true with past historical practices, in my experience. Taking into account their ignorance of scientific reasoning, scientific knowledge, and their living in violent times, the apparently brutal actions of many people in the past make a lot of sense. Of course, there was murder, rape, dishonesty, and sadism that can't be exculpated in this way, but we have those today.

There really is some truth in Plato's idea that all evil is the result of ignorance. Not the whole truth, but some truth.

"hq4ydeu","I get you, after 35 year with graphic design and advertising I can just say that it is a hard business and I’m not at all thrilled about it anymore. The main problem is that visual creatives serves commercial business for the most part, and most jobs in commercial business are BS - more or less mindless to do tasks to make a living unless you are in core strategy or similar decision making groups. You put that next to communication art and there is a huge gap in the context and what it takes to do the job. That gap does not get recognized because non creatives does not know what it is - they think it is some kind of decoration or some kind of trend related  work, push some buttons and it’s all gonna be fine. Even people in production management often do not have a clue, and those who does often sit in motion, 3D and VFX Were they do need to have.a clue, not to burn budgets and deadline.

GD and related jobs are the hands on in the communication - you are the construction worker and the world is not fair place, those doing the actual work often get the lowest attention. You do not get into GD without some kind of artistic merit - meaning giving part yourself to the job and that might be a key why it will feel much harder than a 9-5 job where you leave and forget about it till the next workday.

There are even books written about all those corporate bullshit jobs that mainly exists to attract similar large corporations.

Visual communication is a very unique art form and only people inside the business understand - but most people weirdly have an opinion about it nevertheless, mention something like programming and nobody claims to know anything because they do not understand the language of programming vs looking at some visual design and decide if you like it or not. I have experienced clients who went home and asked their wife about a design suggestion, which off course returned the most stupendous feedback, since the wife was not briefed, did not understand the target group etc.

This kind of general ignorance is properly what makes the GD job the hardest. Add to it the vast amount of cheap online offers for logos, letterheads etc. All GDs that I know care about the output they create, but you for a large part you are  “feeding pigs with pearls” (no offense to pigs 🐷 they are actually very clever animals). 

So the job as a graphic or visual designer is certainly no walk in the park which is why you should choose who you work for carefully. There are so many assholes around this business, like marketing managers who cares mostly about the name and reputation of the agency they choose to work with - they use it to brag to other marketing managers. Then you have all the covert marketing clowns who plays so smart that they slip through the fact that they know close to nothing - they support projects only if they can sniff success and will obstruct anything that is a challenge and need work from them - it us because they don’t know and are scared of failing even the slightest, because it would blow their cover on any critical inspection.

A very great addition to the GD job is taking a financial or marketing education, add on - that way you can shut down all those ignorant and super self serving assholes with a language and fact they can not ignore. 

Just consider that your jobs demand for a lot of thinking, emotional valuation, reflective and strategic 
Considerations before it all comes together in visual output - all those thoughts are your strongest arguments, but in the end it will not be you that decides which option will be the final output.

There are two kinds of stress - stress because of ignorance, bad briefings etc leaving a GD with nearly impossible tasks, this stress is cancer and should be dealt with immediately with the risk of loosing your job. Then there is deadline stress, meaning overtime work, that stress is okay if you know what to do - it’s just hard work. Just make sure it is not like that all the time and if it is you should be payed plentiful and consider how long time you can keep it up before it wears you out.

I would advise any young GD to consider adding programming, motion, VFX, animation or 3D to their Skills, since they are all areas which most people have no clue how it works, and therefore gets a lot more respect than pure Graphic Design.",1640605528,"a very great addition to the gd job is taking a financial or marketing education, add on - that way you can shut down all those ignorant and super self serving assholes with a language and fact they can not ignore.","ignorant and super","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and super","super",NA,NA,1

"hq4jgw2","Oh wow, yeah this actually kicked off a bit of an epiphany in my brain. It’s a bit “woo”, but the best *analogy* I can come up with involves a *lot* of buzzwords, but since the most notable is “zeitgeist” I’ll allow myself the conceit.

In this case I think that the desire to create these distinct “tribes” is that some people have “stability” as a core value (think Westworld). They create these groups so they can perpetuate the status quo - continued erosion of personal rights to a consolidated power structure. As such power structures tend to project “stability” as a show of strength, in an effort to maintain power.

The thing is, “stability” is a good thing. So is “change”. Every ideal is needed in some capacity, a healthy society would have the capacity for both concepts to be represented equally. My conceit here would be to liken it to quantum superposition. 

Right now, our society is a bit imbalanced, I think it’s natural that people have more than one “core value”, and so there would likely be correlation between the various “axes”. It makes sense, given human history, that core values of “strength”, “stability”, “competition” would cluster together. 

The challenge is that the opposites of those values are *very* easy to frame negatively. “Compromise” becomes “weakness”. “Change” becomes “chaos”. And “cooperation” becomes “defeat”. This is something we can *see* in the talking points of the alt- and far-right. This *IS* how they frame those values *when being exhibited by the OUT group*. However, those who *exhibit* those core values *also need to value* the values of the other side. You cannot cooperate or compromise with someone if you refuse to accept the validity of their “core values”.

*SUPER* important note: This is not, and will never be a justification for intolerance. Intolerance is abhorrent to me (yes yes, tolerance paradox I know), but I also believe that reframing the ignorant and hatful as having those as “core values” you *are* falling into the in and out group fallacy, even just a *tiny* bit. Their justifications for their intolerance probably *are* more reflective of their “core values”, they’re just not applying the necessary *thought* in order to guide their *feelings*. Probably also opposing axes which we should try to balance (Hello MBTI, I was wondering when you’d show up).

"hq4gkds","(No this is not a troll post.)

IDK if this counts as culture war, but reading about ancient societies that practiced human sacrifice has made me more sympathetic towards human sacrifice. 

I have been reading a lot about pre-Columbian Mexico in particular, which is of course famous for its extravagant and large-scale human sacrifices. Even allowing for exaggeration (the Mexica probably weren't sacrificing eighty thousand people in a couple days in a city that wasn't much larger than that), it's clear they did a lot of sacrifice. 

I guess I always had the idea of societies that practiced human sacrifice as especially brutish or as placing a low premium on human life. When you actually read about Mexican civilization, it's clear the situation was the exact opposite. This was not a people that viewed human life as cheap, but rather the opposite. Human life was the most precious thing in the world, and that's why it shows such incredible devotion to surrender such a precious treasure to the gods. 

This is of course true in all societies I am aware of that have practiced human sacrifice (which seems to be pretty much all of them at one time or another--the American civilizations, Egypt, Canaan, China, even early Rome and Greece). Child sacrifice in particular is often seen as the worst of the worst. But I often think of the story of King Mesha of Moab in the Book of Kings, who, on the verge of defeat, sacrificed his only son on the city walls to propitiate the national god Chemosh. It is rather common in modern anti-abortion circles to compare abortion to human sacrifice, but really the two practices could not be more different, beyond the most superficial level. What commonality is there between a woman who gets an abortion because she 'isn't ready' for a child, and the Moabites sacrificing their prince, the king's only, beloved son for the salvation of their people?

The rationale for normalized abortion is that killing people is no big deal, the rationale for human sacrifice is that killing people is THE BIGGEST deal.

"hq3z33n","No problem! 

Something you have to remember is America is a \*huge\* country, and there are \*many\* different types of people with different experiences - and therefore different mentalities. 

There *are* definitely people who don't feel 40 hours is too much/much at all. That could be because these people are just very ""work oriented"" and find themselves needing constant busy work to be fulfilled or happy. 
It could also be because some of these people have found careers that are fulfilling for them and don't feel exhausting, and that pay well enough they aren't stressed about finances/working multiple jobs and can afford healthcare, vacations, etc. 
(35-40 hours of work in a week looks a lot different for someone who is making a comfortable wage, can pay their bills no questions asked, has money for vacations, actually *gets* vacation time, can afford healthcare/medications, and isn't working 2 dead-end and physically destructive jobs versus someone who is living paycheck to paycheck in poverty in horrendous working conditions with no vacation time and unmanageably inconsistent scheduling.)

Some people are, to put it simply, just ignorant and unintelligent. The types that are mocking people in France for working ""so little"" are often the same types who feel that disabled people are ""full of shit and just need to get off their asses and work"" and who will insult anyone who feels things like government benefits/universal  healthcare/higher minimum wages are valid and needed, calling them ""freeloaders"" or worse.
You literally had a huge portion of the US arguing *against* unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, and other protections for workers/Americans during *the entire pandemic* - even at the beginning when things were at their most uncertain and ""dangerous"" - because they felt ""no one should get handouts"" - as if benefits to keep people afloat who were out of work through no fault of their own due to shutdowns were ""lazy"" and ""asking for free money.""


One of the most disgusting things about America/the American people - in my opinion - is that a large portion of them have been completely ""brainwashed"" - for lack of a better word - to believe that the subpar quality of life our government provides is actually *good* and *all we deserve.* 
These people are fighting *against* improvements that would make our country livable, fair for all, and eradicate poverty, because they feel people need to ""to pull themselves up by the bootstraps"" and ""struggle for everything"" if they want to get by.

These are the Americans who ""seem to like working as much as possible"" that you're describing. 
They either genuinely believe that they enjoy this miserable existence - usually because that's how they were raised, in close-minded, ignorant families who do as they're told and never try to fight for better for themselves/others - or they're pretending that they do because ignorance is a lot easier than looking at the realities - which are that for many in the US, life is miserable and bleak.

I would say that most people I know - family, friends, coworkers, workers I speak with out in public, etc. - *do not* like working as much as possible.
*Most* if not *all* I encounter believe we need *serious* reform around worker protections/benefits. 
(We don't have mandated paid vacation weeks like France does, and most people - in ""lower end"" jobs especially - are lucky if they can get *unpaid* time off when they're sick, nonetheless if they need a break/vacation, and they suffer financially if they *do* get it.) 
*Most* if not *all* I encounter agree that we need to raise minimum wage to a livable wage, and enact some *serious* changes around wages in general for workers all over the country. Cost of living has gotten insane in many places in the country, and poverty wages are still the norm. It is *very* hard to survive in a lot of the country if you do not come from wealth/fall into privilege. 

Many Americans *do* work as many hours as possible with little to no vacation time - and often multiple jobs - but I promise you it isn't because we enjoy it or want to.",1640579547,"some people are, to put it simply, just ignorant and unintelligent.","ignorant and unintelligent","ignorant","and",FALSE,"just ignorant and unintelligent","unintelligent","just",NA,1

"hq3vgse","Thank you for the honest reply. I truly appreciate it.

I would argue there's a key difference between ""dishonorable"" and ""sinful,"" would you not? The verse seems clear to me, that God caused them to embarrass themselves with because of the list of actual sins that you seem to have overlooked. 

&gt;&gt; they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles.

This is the sin being condemned, and the text indicates as much. But Paul continues, and context is key:

&gt;&gt; They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious toward parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

Here we see a mix of sins and just bad behavior. Foolishness isn't a sin, I'm sure you'd agree, though it is dishonorable. Boastfulness isn't a sin, though it's ill-advised. So to take everything mentioned here and treat it as equal sin is to misread this verse, no? Or do you believe that if I boast about my grades, or my prowess on the basketball court, I'm damned to Hell?

&gt; marriage is between man and woman

It doesn't have to be -- David's covenant with Jonathan matches marriage rites of the day beat-for-beat, and indeed David adopted Jonathan's son, and when Jonathan died David cried out ""My love for you surpassed the love of women!"" 

To dive a bit deeper than I imagine you have, the Hebrew word translated to ""soul"" (**נֶפֶש**, *nephesh*) in English isn't what we think of when we say soul; it means the whole of your being, including your physical body. And their ""souls"" were ""knit"" (**קשר**, *qashar*) together. Common use of this phrase is to indicate physical or romantic entanglement, or both.

There's also the fact that same-sex unions are a matter of law, and I'm illustrating now they do not violate God's law, so **Romans 13:1-2** seems appropriate:

&gt;&gt; Obey the government, for God is the One who has put it there. There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power. So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow.

--
&gt;He also never explicitly said anything about bestiality. 

This is a weak argument, because His ministry focused only on adding to or augmenting the Law of Moses, which explicitly declares bestiality as a sin in many places. You're welcome to bring up Leviticus here (I hope you don't do so while wearing mixed fabrics!), but that'll just lead to more Hebrew lessons. I'm happy to have that conversation, though.

&gt; Jesus did mention the Genesis account

He quoted Genesis in response to a question about divorce. You're taking a verse out of context to make your point; you do that a lot in your comment. This usually indicates a shallow understanding of the Word, or worse an intentional distortion. This verse is not a condemnation of anything except divorce.

If you can't make your point in context, you have no point to make.

&gt; Jesus also mentioned Sodom

No, he mentioned the *punishment* of Sodom, and he was talking about the End of Days, not homosexuality. Again, you have to take out all context to make your point, which means you don't really have a point to make. 

If you have to twist the Word to fit your beliefs, perhaps you should think about changing your beliefs and not the Word?

But let's discuss that story. Sodom and Gomorrah is *not* about homosexuality; you would be hard-pressed to find a rabbi or Biblical scholar who would agree with that interpretation. First, in that story we see the angels treated appropriately by Abraham (**Gen. 18:1-8**) immediately before they approach Sodom, setting our example and necessary context, then we see them treated in the direct opposite manner. Unless you believe *every* person in *both* cities was gay, *and* that angels even have a gender, *and* that these two chapters are completely disconnected from one another, my hope is even you understand that your interpretation is misguided. Look at the verse you're talking about!

&gt;&gt; Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building

Great opportunity to toss in an opinion about homosexuality, but he didn't. So either you agree this is unrelated to the topic, or homosexuality isn't a sin, and either is fine for me.

Further, we see a different version of this same message (probably an older telling of the story), with the same beats, in **Judges 19-21**. This version doesn't have angels (it's a priest and his concubine), or fire and brimstone (the village is destroyed instead by the tribes of Israel), but the details are otherwise the same, though without any indication of any homosexual acts or impulses. It's a moral fable about how to treat guests in a desert culture. Two tellings of the same story from different times happens a few times in the OT (**Genesis 1** and **2** are a good example since they occur back-to-back; **Gen 2** is the older tradition).

With all this needed context, do you still think the story of the destruction of Sodom was about homosexuality, or do you agree with the broad majority of Biblical authorities who argue it was more the *rape* part, and the degree of mistreatment of guests, and especially guests who were messengers of God, that caused the destruction?

You have to make your case free of all context, and specifically in English, to even try to have a point. Do you not see how weak a position that is? You're justifying persecution by distorting the Word, twisting it to your ends, and I know it's because you were taught these things by someone you respected and accepted them without study, so I'm not condemning you, I'm just asking that now that you've been educated you please stop. 

&gt;&gt; And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters.

"hq3i7kg","As someone with really awful (in similar but different ways) step-parents, I would be partially interested to know how long this guy has been in your life and honestly, knowing more about your entire family dynamics would be helpful but I would only want to know that because I'm a curious person. You wanna know why I know that you are not wrong to feel 'slighted' in some way? Because the socks made you feel bad. Your feelings are always valid.  Those aren't my style but I know my little sister would love them if I gave them to her but she would be fuming mad if other people (like her father/my stepfather) gave them to her. 

But, I want to also give you props for doing a ""reality check"" on your emotions. Sometimes we [humans] can overreact to our own emotions, even if they are valid and based on facts. And sometimes we can distort facts to fit our feelings. Our brains are funny like that.. but from what you said:

* It sounds like your stepdad and you are not close, emotionally, but 
* he has enough knowledge to know that there is stuff going on in your life that might make words like ""crazy"" and ""psycho"" sore spots for you and
* let's also assume that your stepdad is not just very very ignorant and thoughtless. Though, for me, that would be the ""best case scenario"" with my stepdad but he also isn't unintelligent (in fact, he has a very high intelligence, but he is smart enough to play dumb very well) so I know that there is often some underlying ""meaning"" behind the thought (or lack of thought) when he gives someone a present, especially people that he is closer to emotionally. 

So, if your stepdad is the type who always gives you a shitty gift because he is just a bad gift buyer (maybe he just saw the pink and thought ""oh she likes pink and she likes socks"" [obviously, I wasn't there and have no idea if you like pink or whatnot, and I don't know your stepdad; just throwing out an alternative]) then I would say that at the very least you are entitled to feel bad because your stepdad is ignorant and/or unintelligent, seems uncaring and seems to be very thoughtless. 

However, if your stepdad is not just being a daft, bad gift giver, and normally he would or should ""know better"", even with the info that he has, I would share in your offense. Like I said earlier, I am curious about your family dynamics just because I can totally see my stepdad giving those exact socks to me, my mom or my sister and all 3 of us would be mad if he gave them to us, but that is because he would play it off like he is just being a thoughtless idiot when in reality, it is much more calculated. But that's my stepdad; I've known him nearly 20 years now and he and my mom are very close to finally divorcing (after being separated for over 5 years) and many awful years of fighting and DV but thankfully I have a sister from it.  You and your stepdad could be totally different. 

Just know that it's okay to feel your feelings and whatever coping skills you have, try to utilize them (coming here might be a good one for you; I know it can help me) and also, while your feelings are valid, if you have doubts about whether your reaction is too strong for the ""action"" you are responding to, it is great that you thought to ""check in"" and find out other people's thoughts.",1640571154,"our brains are funny like that.. but from what you said:  * it sounds like your stepdad and you are not close, emotionally, but  * he has enough knowledge to know that there is stuff going on in your life that might make words like ""crazy"" and ""psycho"" sore spots for you and * let's also assume that your stepdad is not just very very ignorant and thoughtless.","ignorant and thoughtless","ignorant","and",FALSE,"very ignorant and thoughtless","thoughtless","very",NA,1

Every  hateful views  has ideologcal backing it up.  Racism isn't just discrimination but the ideas behind it.

Nevertheless, there were numerous instances where black people specifically targeted and attacked asians because of the color of their skin.

Those hate crimes  had root  anti Chinese  rhetoric  from Trump  and other far right politicians.  

It was just done by only black but also white people to.

Sure it was act of racism  based what behind  it. Not based  on black people doing hate crime.

&gt;Calling someone a cracker because they are white is by definition, racist. If you are too stupid to admit that, because you're ignorant and racist, at least acknowledge that it is prejudiced and wrong.


Cracker  was original a classist slur used by rich white people against  poor white people.    Then later used against  slave owner  and today used against racist  white people.

"hq2s2du","There's a few ways to think about this. The rough gist though... And honestly, part of the American cultural schism that's currently worsening, is that we were all raised with an extremely skewed perspective on the nature of Western civilization. I remember in the Truman show, Jim Carrey asks about being an explorer, and the teacher's all ""sorry, you were born too late, everything's already been discovered"".

I'm into machine learning research, with a side hobby interest in neurobiology. I know relatively little about that side of things competitively, but it's extremely striking how young this all is. The very first attempt at measuring brain activity was from the 1880's, trying to measure blood flow changes during intellectual activity. MRI's and CT's only date back to the 70's and 80's. Until fairly recently (in the grand scheme of things) most of what was known was just from pathologies. The beginning of the debate about whether the brain has different functions for different parts didn't even start to be settled until the 1860's, when Broca found loss of speech as a common symptom of a particular kind of brain lesion. There's still a PROFOUND amount that's unknown. As methods of getting data improve, and methods of mining insight from that data improve, I suspect that we'll look back at this time period not as the 'world of tomorrow' golden civilization I thought it was, but as something much more humble and young. The two medications I take didn't even exist in their current form until the 70's, as in... Their chemical structure had never been synthesized before. Those molecules had never existed.

This is the world our parents grew up in (diagnosed in my thirties as well). A dangerous combination of confidence and ignorance. But that's just how it is, you know? The victorian medical community I'm sure thought they were hot shit too, but they knew absolutely nothing compared to us. We know absolutely nothing compared to where we'll likely be even 20 years from now. You do the best you can with what you've got and go from there.

My mom didn't know much about ADHD. In a lot of ways, no one did... There's still no easy diagnostic test that I know of. You can't put on a special hat, think about things for five minutes, and get a genuine diagnosis based on something more concrete than ""this is how I feel"". C'est la vie. I think sometimes about my life if I'd been born 100 years ago. No one would have had any tools to help me. I'd have struggled and died, just like all my ancestors and your ancestors that share our particular mix of strengths and weaknesses. I'll sure as hell take an uncertain diagnoses with useful (but not perfect) meds over the big fat nothing we'd have had earlier. I'm stoked that we realistically could see miracle tools in our lifetime that are only beginning to be imagined now. Sure it'd be great to have had those sci-fi tools (or at least our current meds) from the beginning, but we're still lucky as hell. There's no perfect life that can be lived after all, maybe we could have both accomplished more by now, but hell... at least I can hold down a job now and do a better job being a full fledged partner taking care of our family, instead of the space cadet with the stressed out partner.

It'd have been nice if our parents saw more earlier, but... Frankly, I'm sure there's a lot you see more clearly than your parents. My mom still has some wisdom to share, but there's plenty of spots where she's ignorant and vulnerable, just like you, just like everyone else. They were too weak to protect us from our own weaknesses, but what's done is done. It's on us to make sure the next generation gets better than we got, and to forgive the sometimes pitiful amount our parents had to give. I got good things from them too at least, the rest of life is just what we can make of it I guess, same as it's always been for everyone.

Doesn't mean you aren't entitled to grief though. Good luck processing through, took me a year or two of feeling like that too, so don't beat yourself up if it eats at you for a while. It'll settle down eventually though, and maybe you'll even find unexpected strengths that came from your theoretically avoidable suffering. I'm not sure that I'd change my past, maybe it'd make me less compassionate, or creative, or patient... Who knows what I'd be throwing out to erase those decades of my life and replace with something else.",1640558810,"my mom still has some wisdom to share, but there's plenty of spots where she's ignorant and vulnerable, just like you, just like everyone else.","ignorant and vulnerable","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and vulnerable","vulnerable",NA,NA,1
"hq2rzg0","I do think it’s a very well made movie and emotionally it is a very effective piece of art. Everything is great, very gold jokes, brilliant actors and a very well crafted message.

My only problem however was that it was unnuanced and quickly turned into a cry of outrage that clearly divides the people into two groups, namely one that is dumb and ignorant and suggestible to the mischievous plans of the billionaire Trumps and another one is enlightened and is held hostage by the first group. I know it is a movie and it’s all metaphors, but like all problems we can’t reduce it to a single truth that is so obvious that we just have to ""look up"", I believe that reality is insanely complicated and the more you know the more you have to update your worldview to eventually realize that the mainstream low-resolution paradigms on both sides of the political spectrum are far from the truth. I think to just say this half of the country is plain stupid and will doom the other half is very counterproductive in helping eachother see the problems and work together towards solutions, because it is not an invitation to really speak and listen to eachother, rather just another attack from one tribe on the other.

The movie started out very well in its message (or that just my opinion don’t kill me) but then turned into a piece of media that is just an addition to the polarized discourse that we have plenty of today, that caresses the ego of one group (in this case the left) and insults the intelligence of the other group (in this case the right). And given the fact that it’s one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a movie i think its a shame that it has fallen prey to the boorish way we wage war with words today. But it expressed very well the way we deal with information, and how crazy the internet has made us and a lot of other societal issues. 

Good movie, but this is only going to please the believers and will not really convince the non believers or the skeptics.

"hq2lvmr","I've heard that before about cats and dogs, where they'll stop in place and seem to look at something that isn't there.  Just because they might do that, and that could be for any number of mundane reasons really, someone who wants to believe in something totally unquantifiable like ghosts will say, ""Aha!  They must be looking at a ghost!"" or something totally outlandish and completely unprovable along those lines.

Much in the same way that you say I cannot perceive something that I wouldn't be open to, people are also looking to validate something that they *want* to believe.  It's a real phenomenon called confirmation bias: people look for and validate what they want to see, and ignore all evidence to the contrary.  That's the exact type of mental weakness that ""spiritual workers"" prey upon, and then pretend like you are that non-believers ""just aren't in tune"" with this unquantifiable nonsense.  It's a perfect setup for the weak-minded, and it attempts to discredit anyone who doesn't fall for it, all while still remaining totally unprovable.

This is why having a keen eye towards the quantifiable is so important: delusions, the mind and subjective thought is literally endless, so someone can get entirely lost in a world full of delusions and believing in things that don't even come close to existing in reality.  When someone isn't looking at things in an objective way, fortified with skepticism or critical thinking, they then open themselves up to getting fleeced by ""spiritual workers"" or taken in by other ridiculousness that isn't even true.  That's ego and delusion.

So in that same way, most people are quite afraid of death, and would do anything in the world for it to be true that there is a soul, or ghosts, or that they will go on in some way after death.  So of course the ignorant and deluded are going to go to someone like a medium who will ""verify"" what they already want to believe, and that would have value to them, all while being a total sham.

But this all being said I think we're trying to argue too many points all at once, so how about we narrow it down to just one specific aspect of 'spiritual work'.  Let's talk about tarot cards...  how do they work, exactly?  Can you honestly expect us to believe that you can tell someone's future with them, and that this is accurate to a high enough of a degree to warrant someone actually paying for that service?  How do we know it's not just all random chance as to what comes up in the cards, and then the customer doesn't just go looking for those same signs that they were told by the 'spiritual worker'?  Confirmation bias is a real thing, quantifiable by scientific study, and the gullible are easily mislead.

Despite the fact that those same groups were victims of other groups, often to a far higher degree and also despite the fact that historically white people have suffered at the hands of many, many different non-white groups and cultures.

CRT is historically illiterate and ignorant, and is based on lies, collectivist thinking and petulance.

One example of a lie they tell is by trying to link modern day policing to slave patrols in the US. This is untrue in the extreme both in the US and elsewhere.

Modern policing the the UK is traces back to Sir Robert Peel (no relation at all to the slave trade), with most European police systems being variations on that. 

In the US, social scientists and the then-newly created posts of 'criminologists' advocated for a full time professional force in the early 1800's to deal with an explosion in the crime rate driven by the fact more and more people were flocking to the cities due to the industrial revolution. The oldest police forces in the US are, as far as I can find, are in northern non-slaving states and the oldest police forces specifically are the New York and Boston police forces.

Here we all are, fallout from a virus that's killed millions of people, and it's hard to believe a new virus has long-term effects, that it's merely a mental health issue.  Mental health is important; I have a degree in that field, but it makes me angry when I see articles and doctors that make it seem like that's the main focus.  I'm like, duh, anyone whose body is damaged in a way that standard labs don't make clear, who is debilitated health wise, is a medical mystery and spends many months taking on the medical community to figure it out, so therefore no easy answers and treatment, is going to experience anxiety and depression; that's a normal and natural response.  

People can be ignorant and judgmental.  So, when you get asked, ""why do you have a big gap in your work history?"" and the explanation is health issues that are not understood (like a major accident that took a long time to heal from), that effects a person's ability to land a job when they're well enough.  What employer wants to hire what appears to be an unhealthy employee, who has not been able to work due to their health, but doesn't have a clear diagnosis that shows why that was, who got treatment and can confirm they're well since having that treatment.  It has a major impact on a person's life even for those who eventually recover or partially recover enough to take on some form of work.  So, you feel a big relief that you've survived and are hopeful you're on the way to being able to function at a job.  But then, you're dealing with the discrimination having long covid creates.

"hq255zo","So my response to your last comment, u/mysticsoulsista is this: objective reality is the physical and perceivable world, or that which can be measured and quantified in some way.  There is really no question there on that, but like I said before, you seem to be trying to obfuscate the issue by adding in mysticism and subjective thoughts to hard objective scientific reality, and you have a powerful and self-oriented motive for doing so, which is money.  I'm arguing my side without a single thing to gain from doing so.  Are you aware of this potential bias?

Water is water, and concrete is concrete; just because what we are perceiving may not be 'real' in the sense of quantum physics doesn't leave the door open for spirits and magic to exist.  And you say that ""everything I do can be quantified and measured"", and that's not even close to true.  Brains and hearts are real and quantifiable, but just because a brain or a heart could be scanned and there's an irregularity in either one during a seance doesn't make 'channeling' real.  Thoughts can be real to someone of course like you said, but if someone believes in a lie does that make it true?  To them, perhaps, but that's irrelevant and it's still not true to anyone else.

And sure, we are in fact energy first, that's proven by science, but this doesn't automatically equate to that energy 'going on' in some way and allowing for ghosts and spirits after death.

You've made a living of some sort with this mysticism, so you should be aware that you are in fact going to be a biased party towards your side being true because you have a serious vested interest in other people believing it to be true.  Your industry catches the ignorant and gullible at some of their weakest moments, like after the loss of a loved one, and then you merely pretend that you are talking to their spirits, which of course is in no way, shape or form quantifiable because it's all in your head.

"hq24unz","I think at the root of issues like this is an underlying assumption that karma is justice, that the workings of samsara are meant to be viewed as *good* or *fair*. But it isn't, and they're not. The whole samsaric system, from what I've read, is basically just a mindless self-perpetuating cosmic meat grinder with no purpose and no one at the wheel. Siddhārtha Gautama looked around one day and realized ""hang on, this is messed up actually,"" you know? It's not justice, it's not ""they deserved this, they deserved that."" Samsara is terrible. That's precisely why the Buddha went around teaching people how it worked so they could see how to press the right metaphorical buttons to be liberated from it.

If someone throws a rock up into the sky and the rock comes down later and hits a child in the head, does gravity stop to consider if this is fair? Will the rock change course because the person doesn't ""deserve"" to be hit by the rock (whatever that means)? It is pointless, ignorant, and cruel to tell the child ""you deserved to be hit by the rock, stop crying"" - we've all been to hell infinite times, none of us is any better than our fellow prisoners - but it is of the utmost importance to explain to the people currently throwing rocks into the sky that *these are the consequences of your actions, so make the connection and stop throwing rocks and perpetuating it!*

The loss of memory and identity experienced at death is one of the things that makes the samsaric system so difficult to escape. If you put someone in a prison cell with a button that says PRESS ME, and every time they do you give them amnesia-inducing drugs and then give them an electric shock, they will never be able to make the connection between the pain they're ""born"" experiencing and the button they're tempted to push later on. The cycle will just continue, infinitely.

Working to overcome anger, violence, grasping, ignorance, etc. is learning not to throw rocks, learning not to push the button.

Nicely put. I felt similarly with the Elisa Lam case.

I feel like we've progressed since Elisa and Maura that we can talk about these things more freely and take seriously the threat that mental breaks and unwellness pose to our loved ones and hopefully that means more people will get the help they need sooner. I do think society as a whole--even those close to someone struggling with bad mental health--still don't fully understand how serious and nonsensical a bad mental health episode can be. I think there's this concept of suicide that it's ALWAYS something one makes a binding commitment to and plans for.

How old exactly do you think I am? It's been quite some time since anyone called me a kid, haha.

What logic is it, exactly, that leads you to believe anyone complaining on social media isn't doing anything else? By your own admission, you are both currently complaining about people on social media and taking part in strikes. Sooooo.
I will never understand the twisted logic that some people use to assume that if someone complains about something publicly, they aren't also taking direct action.



&gt;I like that you think you did something. 

There you go projecting again! Pray tell, what is it that you think I think I did?
Can you tell me what else I'm thinking? Truly impressive, the ability to read minds through the internet. 
The reality is that I don't think I did anything, except to argue with someone while I was bored on the internet.

Well first off, *you're.
I'm normally not one to correct typos like that, but you're being such a pedantic asshole it seemed appropriate. Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and all that.

Secondly, I'm not here for anyone's validation. Like I said, I'm mostly here because I'm bored at the moment.

I assume that your reference to validation is because of my comments about getting upvotes?
She says I don't feel any validation from that. But you made a specific claim: that ""everyone"" is embarrassed by me. I refuted that claim with specific evidence, that I was being upvoted. I can see how you twisted that into thinking I was seeking validation, but again, I'm doing fine, and you're projecting.

Cons: The people - They're absolutely ignorant when it comes to politics, health, safety, etc. That means elected officials are almost always right-leaning, so you get all the ""perks"" of that as well - Abortion restrictions, no legal weed, decreased environmental regulations (leading to more pollution and BS), more attacks on lower-income families, etc... If you belong to a minority group, it can even be a bit dangerous too (depending on which group you're in and where you live). There are still hardcore racists in most rural areas, and I mean literal neo-nazis when I say that. If you intend to start a family, then you need to home school. Period. End of discussion.

"hq170ha","Ok, I'm not okay with this post. 

First of all, I know someone with FAS and they have NO upper lip at all and the philtrum is non-existent, and that part of the face is very smooth and curves outwards, making them look almost like a chimpanzee (not saying this mock anyone, it's the best way to explain it). Their eyes will droop and the crook of the eye also seems like it isn't there. I don't think this woman has it. Just Google ""child with FAS"" and look at photos and not drawings. You will understand what I'm talking about. Also, women with FAS tend to be introverted and quiet, or at least the ones I know. Their behavior is ""strange""; they often can't write or read and they are mentally disabled. Being ignorant and mentally disabled are two very different things. Let me explain: 

I know a girl with FAS. We went to junior high together, and she would be super clingy and depended on us for everything. We had to message her and tell her to do her homework, had to remind her that recess was over, remind her to eat her lunch, we were basically babysitting her for free because no one wanted to admit she had FAS. I know who her mother is and she is vile. She is white trash and then some, and they were five siblings and all of them are weird because while the parents weren't abusive, they just didn't care. They were just ignored. I remember when Emma worked at her mother's job as a waitress for one day for a school project, her mother's boss had approached Emma and given her money to ""go buy herself a sexy thong"" - and the mother didn't care! She was 14 at the time! So I can certainly imagine that she drank while pregnant. And Emma needed help and never got it, because no one cared. I think I was the person who cared the most, but I was a kid. She was just a total mess and even with our help, life was too difficult. During presentations she would read EVERYTHING on the note I had given her, even if I'd written ""Emma, read THIS part out loud, the part I've highlighted."" She would even read ""Johnny's part"" out loud and we'd be like ""no, read your part"" and she'd start reading the whole note over again. I don't know if it was because she struggled to read and then thinking and reading at the same time was almost impossible, or if she just didn't understand the instructions, but that's what a mental disability does to a person. They don't get how normal everyday stuff works. They may have learned how the remote control worked and then forget and you must teach them how to do it every time. They may struggle to understand who their cousin's mother is, even if they call them ""auntie"" and the cousin ""cousin"". They are not usually attention-seeking. There are, however, plenty of stupid narcissists in today's world, so I think that is more plausible. There is a difference between doing and saying stupid shit for attention and actually being mentally disabled and having a low IQ. Their behavior is strange, but not ""OH LOOK AT ME I MUST HAVE BLEACHED MY BRAIN LOL! OH, LOL, MY BOOB IS SHOWING, HAAAH!"" 

I think these reality TV stars and influencers are in a different category altogether, the ""I do stupid shit for attention and money so I can buy myself a new body"" category, but really, everyone with a normal IQ who watches that kind of trash should be ashamed of themselves. I mean, you get to live in this world and not like 10 000 years ago, giving birth to your first baby at 12, losing 6 out of 7 babies to the flue or starvation and dying at 25 because a snake bit your leg. Go read a book or listen to an album instead. Just don't waste your wonderful, wonderful lives on garbage people, even if you HATE them and think they are shallow. These people thrive on your hatred. It's like Paris Hilton. She wanted people to despise her and even admits to having talked in this fake nasal voice to make people hate her even more, because all attention is good attention to these talentless losers we call ""reality TV stars"" and ""influencers"". Yikes. 

FAS also shouldn't be used as an insult. Posts like this one will make people with FAS feel like shit if they read them, and I actually tried finding posts about how people with FAS feel about their disorder and ended up here. So please be more mindful. Don't compare trashy narcissists to innocent babies who were born with this illness because their mothers are either addicts or losers. They deserve our respect. We are the lucky ones. We won the lottery and got at least one half decent parent. Most of these babies are born and, once the mother realizes ""damn I broke the baby by drinking"", they will give them up for adoption without telling anyone they drank during pregnancy and the foster parents will spend years trying to figure out what's wrong, if they are less developed because of the abuse they suffered or maybe they have autism or ADHD, and for every doctor's appointment, the kid will feel more and more upset, alienated and different. They'll probably be medicated for something else and pay for their mother's mistakes all their lives. 

So please, don't make stupid posts like this one. It's stupid because a) you are wasting time on someone you say you hate who doesn't deserve the attention and b) you are potentially hurting someone with FAS. Not your intention, I know, but when you spend negative energy, the outcome will always be negative.

Subjective thought is not real, while objective truth is real.  Someone can confuse themselves and *think* that they have the ability to fly, and then die when they test that concept when they jump off of a cliff.

These are all quantifiable and verifiable scientific happenings, while anything going on in your head is not.

When someone confuses what they think with objective reality, then you get all sorts of wild and unquantifiable claims, and of course anyone who challenges those claims is ""wrong"", because you believe what's going on in your head is truth when it's not.  It's just all based on thoughts.

[Good to hear some sense from a young guy about this. Way too many threads (since the GME effect) about 14-18 yr olds wanting to start trading as their be-all in life, and putting school and college education and career training sense behind in priority, seemingly.  And OP, skip the options. Way too dangerous, imo. If you're going to try trading, best do it with micro-futures, where you can get a lot of practice and screentime on sim and then tiny leverage at about $1.25 per tick, basically 1/10th the leverage of regular futures. I would just keep practicing and just keep it small if live while your priority to 21 is some college or career direction and training. It's like independent sports, very rare to get into the tiers that can make a living right away from teen years, and even then a consistent career can be highly unstable. So best to have a regular ""day job"" occupation, while trading is part-time or just put off until mid 20's or so.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpwk8la/)

[It made WSB go from 2 million following to 11 million. Which gave many a full sense, ""trading is easy I should do it too"" when reality its not. Its much like the casino, you will win the first few times, then in the end you will lose. Seen a lot in the past year, many just quitted after losing cash.  Not to mention GME thing also helped Wall Street more than it did hurting it. All banks reported high earnings from investment banking, of course theres other factors for it, but reddit did help. Plus the big guys that hold GME when it was like $7 or so made billions, one of them was Michael J Burry (made more than the short of subprime if I recall) who was against the movement.  Edit: Remember the whole Citadel is bad and everyone made fun of them for losing billions? Yeah they made it back, predictable, from the surge of traders thanks to the movement. The movement was really ""noobs who don't know banking participated in a movement while pretending to know banking, just take money."" Only Wall Street really knew what was going on and who would win. The only best way to hurt Wall Street are taxes, nothing else.

[Yeah I was there for all that, but I don't understand where you're getting all your info from. I don't remember people looking at GME and thinking trading is easy, people were just trying to hop on a short squeeze and make some money. A couple years back when Keith Gill bought his options people actually thought he was a nut job and that he was going to lose it all, but he actually did the research and knew the true value of the company.   Also, how did GME help wall street if it literally bankrupt an entire hedge fund? Archegos fell due to GME and it almost took Melvin Capital out as well. Hedge funds never closed those short positions, any time the price rises they are in the red, the SEC have said so themselves.  I'm not trying to argue or anything but it's interesting to see how people interpret everything that happened. As you can probably already tell GME is about 90% of my portfolio. I believe a short squeeze is possible, but I also just believe in the company. They have paid off all debt, raised half a billion dollars in capital, started opening fulfillment centers, made many other changes within their company, mainly focusing on e-commerce and are currently developing and I believe are very close to launching an NFT market.  It is literally the most manipulated stock in history, but it's a little annoying to see people blow it off as a meme stock or use it as a bad example when it is a rapidly transforming company with a bright future.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpu1fmm/)

&gt;Yeah guess what Sgt. Smartass, if those companies sell less phones the SoC manufacturers also sell less of their product.

SoC companies sell their chips to all Android smartphone OEMs. The Android maket itself has to shrink overall quite severely for the chip demand to weaken which in turn could have a negative effect on companies thta design and sell SOCs and simply it hasn't happened and it doesn't look like it will happen. Like I've said the simple truth is that Qualcomm directly competes with Mediatek, that's the company that threatens their bottom line, period.

&gt;No they don't, that's exactly the point you fail to understand. Apple competes with other manufacturers at the price point iPhones are available. People who haven't got enough money and buy a 100$ phone will most likely choose a low-end Android phone, yes. But as soon as we come into iPhone SE territory the game is on. The better an iPhone is, the more likely it will persuade customers to choose one over Samsung, Xiaomi etc.

Yes they do. I don't fail to understand anything.
The SE barely made any dent in the Android maket share, it's irrelevant for most Android phone buyers as it has a small battery and screen. It's mosty preferred by people that use older iPhones not Android users. 

&gt;The better an iPhone is, the more likely it will persuade customers to choose one over Samsung, Xiaomi etc.

You do realize thta at this point you aren't talking about the SOC but the phones overall? Nah, you obviously don't.

&gt;If companies like Samsung sell less of their phones because more people buy iPhones that leads to less phones manufactured which in turn means SoC manufacturers sell less of their product. So ""they buy those chips either way"" is complete and utter nonsense, of course Samsung for example will buy less SoCs if they expect their phones to sell less.

If Samsung would sell less of their phones it will be because of how good their phones are overall and how well they compete on the market and not primary because of the SOC. There's no ""complete and utter nonsense"". 
Again, you do understand you are talking about phones completing between each other and not SOCs?

&gt;That's not because they are so popular, quite the contrary.

It is one of the reasons why actually. ""Quite the contrary"", LOL 

&gt;Samsung designs their own SoC and uses it in many variants of their phones, and Google also ditched Qualcomm.

Actually they mainly use Exynos in their Galaxy S models now and have switched to Qualcomm for their mid-rangers, which are the bulk of Samsung's volume. They actually relly way more on Qualcomm now than they did in the last 5 years.

&gt;They can't keep up with demand because we have an extreme shortage of CPUs and GPUs for around 2 years by now, something you are either to stupid to factor in or just too ignorant to take into account.

I'm ignorant for stating a fact? LoL, you have problems. I mentioned the chip shortage to help you understand the current reality of companies that design SOC and you call me ignorant and stupid? Aren't you the one that keeps insisting thta Qualcomm directly competes with A series chips, or you already forgot about that?

&gt;They can't ""meet demand"" because there isn't enough capacity to produce it, not because demand is suddenly so much higher.

LoL, than was a good laugh. There's isn't enough capacity because of the general higher demand, Qualcomm. Qualcomm always books capacity in advance so if demand wouldn't be higher they wouldn't have any problems.

&gt;Even car manufacturers can't ""meet demand"", not because they suddenly sell much more cars, but because of the chip shortage.

Terrible example, you should know that that's totally different.
And it's not because of the ""chip shortage"", it's because when the pandemic started they canceled their chip orders and when people started to buy cars again car companies made new orders but they were placed at the bottom of the list with delivery times of 6 months or higher because foundries realocated their capacity to other orders.

All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated. In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka.""

"hpz5tgd","Hi there, I wanted to reach out because what you're experiencing is very similar to how the last few years have looked for me. I was in denial about a lot of my abuse, and even when my therapist talked about CPTSD it was never with enough focus for me to really realize that diagnosis could explain almost everything. Though I had a lot of intrusive thoughts growing up, and much of the discomfort/pain I do now, I didn't know what it was caused by exactly, I just had some vague and muddled notions, a very foggy memory. As I got older/smarter, I started putting things together, and once that stuff wasn't living in the background of my mind anymore it became all I could think about. I had constant flashbacks and could focus on little else. It sounds to me like you're in a similar phase of acceptance. 

I never could have imagined it changing, some days it seemed liked I'd have hundreds of flashbacks in just a few hours, it left me keyed up and full of panic. I always felt like everything was going to fall apart around me, to the point I tried to get on Disability, and even went through and met with a lawyer before I realized all the pain and fighting the path implied. I never thought it would be any different for me - and to be honest, some days, it doesn't feel any different, I will just be going through an emotional hell that day, and it's completely out of my control what that experience is going to be. That being said, I hold the experience completely different than I did in the past. I'm not ashamed to have survived what I have, and it has taken a lot of work on myself to get to the point where I can string together that kind of sentence. 

We live in a world that promotes the idea that a persons struggle and experience are deeply shameful things that should never be spoken of, especially when they turn into really dark things that no one wants to hear. It's a really ignorant and outdated narrative, understanding that I didn't support the way the world viewed traumatized/disabled/sick people was an essential part of understanding I needed to view myself independently of that lens. I also had to work to understand the reason I was obsessing was not because I was flawed in some way, but because these were dangerous patterns my brain had developed an obsession with, as it was primed to do by the experiences themselves. Taking the judgment out of the way I viewed my flashbacks was an enormous part of beginning to heal. My roadmap is all over the place and sometimes I don't feel like I've gotten too far from where I started, but every step you take towards trying to heal yourself is a step closer to manifesting a reality with the peace you can have, even if it isn't the version of peace we saw for ourselves.",1640481672,"it's a really ignorant and outdated narrative, understanding that i didn't support the way the world viewed traumatized/disabled/sick people was an essential part of understanding i needed to view myself independently of that lens.","ignorant and outdated","ignorant","and",FALSE,"really ignorant and outdated","outdated","really",NA,1

You are profoundly ignorant and apathetic about what people with severe disabilities go through, and how also being forced to live in abject poverty because we're too sick to work makes our lives even more difficult. I'm doing the best I can. What would you have me do? Go on a two year wait list to be put in an nursing home? How am I supposed to get food for two years while I wait for that?

When you figure out how wheelchair users living in isolation and extreme poverty can get groceries delivered into their homes for low or no cost and without contact with another human being, please let me know.

And as far as Instacart being contacless: Before I even opened an account, I looked into this issue extensively and came across articles, etc., that confirmed that I could get the groceries brought into my home. I know of an elderly lady who uses a walker who told me she gets groceries from Instacart delivered right into her apartment  I'm not going to spend a long time finding those search results again to post them here.

Again, what an idiotic statement: ""If you can't afford the service, I don't think you should use it."" Again, how am I supposed to get food? What other option do I have that is free of charge? Why would I be using Instacart if there was another, cheaper option?

This is the reality people like me (and the OP) face. Nobody gives a fuck that we're in wheelchairs or that we have serious medical issues preventing us from working. We are left to fend for ourselves and if how I'm managing to keep myself alive offends you, you can just ignore me (just like the rest of society does already) and quit criticizing how I'm handling my life.

As far as defending that shopper...her health conditions? Seriously? She is able to drive a vehicle, walk around stores for hours a day, lift heavy bags of groceries in and out of her trunk, I could go on. Yeah, she sounds in way worse shape then me! And more nonsense: you think she can't get a higher paying job? So according to your rules, she has no option but to work a low paying job BUT, a wheelchair user in very poor health has many options to get groceries and therefore has no need to use Instacart. You got it backwards. I'm the one with no options, not her.

Of course I am aware of the dangers of contact during a pandemic. But the fact is, I have no other way to get groceries. I can't lift up and carry anything that's been left in the hallway outside my apartment door. I could carry one item at a time but with my severe medical issues that cause me severe pain and fatigue, it would take me days to get each item out of the bags in the hallway. I'd have my groceries left in the hallway the whole time? Do you think I should do it that way - leave the bags in the hallway for days as I slowly, at the pace I can handle, bring in one item at a time?

You wouldn't have a clue what to do if you were in my situation so be grateful you are able to walk around a grocery store and carry food back to your home.",1640481520,"you are profoundly ignorant and apathetic about what people with severe disabilities go through, and how also being forced to live in abject poverty because we're too sick to work makes our lives even more difficult.","ignorant and apathetic","ignorant","and",FALSE,"profoundly ignorant and apathetic","apathetic","profoundly",NA,1

You’re so clearly misinformed, and simultaneously so confident that it’s hard to determine where to start. First, transgender people do not uniformly go through gender alignment surgery where their sex organs are changed. Some certainly do, but many elect not to. Of either population, many do not feel dysphoric about their genitals. 

The entire rest of your comment can be completely discarded as **sex and gender are not the same thing**. Also Jesus Christ sexual orientation is a completely separate and unrelated topic entirely. 

What I find exhausting is that I don’t know you at all, but I feel comfortable making the claim that your ignorance on this, and likely many other topics, is detrimental to our society as a whole. 

Like you’re completely and factually incorrect - individuals with infinitely more experience, education, and exposure than you have assembled an incredible amount of knowledge on the differences and relationship between sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Same goes with many other nuanced topics. And yet you feel confident enough in your limited intelligence on the topic to make ignorant and objectively incorrect statements while holding exactly zero room for growth in the event you are confronted with new information.

Labels aren’t an issue for me, or for most people I know in the modern, developed world. We understand them because it’s actually incredibly simple to do so when you are too scared to engage in learning something that doesn’t reinforce your existing beliefs. Ignorance is an issue, and it’s why as as a country we have entire swaths of people willing to vote against their interests and pull society back into a literal dark ages because knowledge and information you don’t understand frightens you.

"hpyz5yb","Tell me you’re entirely uninformed about the transitioning process without telling me.

It’s not child abuse. At all. It’s actually far more abusive to not let someone present and transition as their preferred gender than to not let them do that. There are numerous studies and articles to show that access to proper treatment actually improves the mental state of transgender youth, including reducing the risk of suicide. I will link sources at the end of the comment. 

But you seem to lack a fundamental understanding of how youths are allowed to transition. It is not the same as adults, who are allowed access to HRT (hormone replacement therapy). Minors are NOT allowed to take hormones. They are only allowed puberty blockers, which are entirely reversible and are often prescribed to cisgender people as well for non-gender dysphoric reasons (endometriosis, idiopathic short stature, prostate cancer). What they do is simply stop the production of male or female growth hormones before they ramp up too much. That’s all. And if you want them to resume as normal, all you have to do is still taking them.

Most of the time, “transition for youths” is literally just wearing different clothes, being addressed by a different name and pronouns, and possibly being prescribed an entirely reversible drug that stops the production of testosterone or estrogen and variants. Most of the time, parents and the state do not agree to have puberty blockers prescribed anyway, due to ignorant and uneducated mindsets like yours, so there should be nothing you need to worry about anyway. 

However, access to puberty blockers and not being forced into a life that isn’t theirs reduces suicidal ideation by quite a lot in trans children, and honestly that sounds more than worth it to me. 

Puberty blockers linked to lower suicide risk for transgender people: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1122101

“There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who ever wanted this treatment. These results align with past literature, suggesting that pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7073269/

“…transgender youth who have fully socially transitioned to their identified gender, and have been supported in doing so, do not have elevated depressive symptoms compared to the broader population.”
https://www.childtrends.org/blog/research-shows-the-risk-of-misgendering-transgender-youth

“More than half of transgender male teens who participated in the survey reported attempting suicide in their lifetime, while 29.9 percent of transgender female teens said they attempted suicide. Among non-binary youth, 41.8 percent of respondents stated that they had attempted suicide at some point in their lives.”

"hpy4knj","Ok I just saw from your profile that you’re in high school so I understand why you’re trying this whole “facts and logic” approach and throwing around the term strawman incorrectly. Your view of women as a group that “plays the victim” and “uses excuses” is very unhealthy for you and the people in your life. It’s simply not true and it tells me that you either haven’t had a significant relationship with a female, or you had one that went poorly and you’re immature enough to equate that person to their entire gender. I hate to say it bc I know when I was in high school I’d hate to hear it, but you have an extremely limited understanding of the social relationships between men and women, the different difficulties they face in life, and the history of extreme sexism that still clouds our social perceptions of periods. I just encourage you to be aware of your own limitations in understanding privilege as it can take a lifetime to fully comprehend your place in the world and the advantages you’ve had compared to others, no matter your age.

You have a lot of misguided ideas about women that will likely take awhile to resolve, so I encourage you to start now. Your comment about how women could just choose to bleed everywhere if they chose to and how men find periods “gross” just reflects how little you’ve thought about what having a period must be like. Like it’s genuinely just a ridiculously stupid take. You owe it to yourself, the women in your life, and your future romantic life to correct the sexist views you hold. Because you are sexist, that much is irrefutable.

Laconia power suits might be that much better and she is a properly  trained marine so she xan use hers better. 

I think she was trying to appease the Laconias and negotiate in good faith. So shveisbokayigb the card , ook how good we are that we keep 100% of our sofe of the deal please do the same. She has family on the planet so... any other armor suit might have come up on the scans on Tanaka and that would be registered as potential threat and terminate the negotiations.


She is a newbie negotiator,she doesn't understand the concept of always negotiating from  a position of power and that at this level as soon as you are at a disadvantage you are eaten alive. Uou can see she is arrogant and ignorant and regrets her decision the moment Tanaka sets her foot on the station, but it is too late of she goves the order for everyone to suit up then the deal is over so she pays along.

After that the brain goes in to flight or fight so she might didn't thing about the PDC, but I think there is better explanation for that 

She is betting on one of the two ships to go rescue Tanaka so that she can fight the other and give time to the Rocci to escape. This is mentioned in the book too when she thinks about the strategy. 

If Tanaka was dead then they would have captured Rocci  you can see she is sacrificing herself to give rocci a chance.

So overall good tactician as soon as bullets start flying, socks at the political game.

She is out of her league like Naomi explains. Holden and Naomi know that no matter what fascist/authoritarian goes don't stick to their ends of a bargain. You can appease them, the only way to win is crush them, show force and stand up to them. There is a recent example in history.

The Nazis allying with them recognized their heritage and assigned them a high ""aryan"" share or whatever (Nazi race science is so fucking stupid), but they ultimatly saw the nordic people as the purest.

Fascism isn´t inherently antisemetic, because it is inherently a made up bullshit ideology. It´s about assigning worth to humans based on whatever the ingroup deems important, and then promote the belief that society shold be structured along those lines.

Now hirachy alone doesn´t qualify something as fascist. As I said above. What makes fascism distinct is, that they assign that worth of humans to immutable qualities of people. The color of your skin, the form of your skull, the sexuality, disabilities, whatever. And of course anti-communism.

One could say tankies have quite often been anti-communist and reactionary in that way, but even the homophobia they did display was not rooted in something they deemed inherent. They thought it was a ""disease"" that could be ""treated"" by work, while Nazis thought it was a taint that needed to be eradicated.

**SAFETY**

The UV spectrum is separated into four parts: UVA (315 nm to 400 nm), UVB (280 nm to 315 nm), UVC (200 nm to 280 nm) and UV Vacuum (100 nm to 200 nm). Decreasing wavelengths correspond with higher frequency radiation and a higher amount of energy per photon. While UVB radiation is widely recognized for its harmful effects on human skin and links to skin cancer, each of the UV bands (UVA, UVB and UVC) create different risks for humans.

While 207-222nm far-UVC generated from filtered excimer lamps can [efficiently deactivate drug-resistant bacteria without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w), simplistic flashlights [like this one](http://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1640248#comment-1640248) are very dangerous for your skin and eyes and should not be used without certified protective equipment, and make for an extremely inefficient, dangerous, ignorant, and irresponsible disinfectant.

Please read further on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation) and [here](https://www.klaran.com/is-uvc-safe).

Most of this section was copied from the old ""UVC"" bot entry by Triskite.

All of the lights discussed below fall into the UVA spectrum and are reasonably safe. Best practice is to wear polycarbonate safety goggles (cheap generic ones work great) and not to point the light at anyone's eyes or skin.

**RECOMENDATIONS**

Filter: A ZWB2 filter is a filter that blocks all visible light but allows throught he UV wavelengths. It makes flourescent object really pop when they glow because there's no extra blue light bleeding through and lighting up non-flourescent objects. These filters make a huge difference so you should try and get a light that has one preinstalled if you can.

[Yeah I was there for all that, but I don't understand where you're getting all your info from. I don't remember people looking at GME and thinking trading is easy, people were just trying to hop on a short squeeze and make some money. A couple years back when Keith Gill bought his options people actually thought he was a nut job and that he was going to lose it all, but he actually did the research and knew the true value of the company.   Also, how did GME help wall street if it literally bankrupt an entire hedge fund? Archegos fell due to GME and it almost took Melvin Capital out as well. Hedge funds never closed those short positions, any time the price rises they are in the red, the SEC have said so themselves.  I'm not trying to argue or anything but it's interesting to see how people interpret everything that happened. As you can probably already tell GME is about 90% of my portfolio. I believe a short squeeze is possible, but I also just believe in the company. They have paid off all debt, raised half a billion dollars in capital, started opening fulfillment centers, made many other changes within their company, mainly focusing on e-commerce and are currently developing and I believe are very close to launching an NFT market.  It is literally the most manipulated stock in history, but it's a little annoying to see people blow it off as a meme stock or use it as a bad example when it is a rapidly transforming company with a bright future.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rn03ck/18_years_old_want_to_get_into_day_trading/hpu1fmm/)

My other is PLTR, I didn’t feel in the next 1-2 years it’s really going anywhere. They’ve had massive growth and massive wins and only gone sideways. It would take an unbelievable event to send that up in that time frame. I cashed out, and bought something with more short term positive catalysts coming up, as well as longer growth outlook (BB, shoot me for loving memes). I don’t even feel comfortable with 2.5 yr DTE options on PLTR based on last years post GME apocalypse event.

1. Why didn't you mention to ask short people who would have heard numerous hurtful comments from friends families and even strangers.And are reminded of it on dating apps. Whereas dusky people are not discriminated on dating apps. 

&gt;Colourism affects more people. Short height disproportionately affects men whereas colourism is more of an equal opportunity offender and men are not spared either

2. God you are so naive. So have you heard ""tall dark handsome""? The sentence itself says heightism and colourism doesn't affect men because dark is preferred. So colourism is not equal opportunity. Also there are so many solutions in market to look fair. you need to spend money and there are no to little sife effects of using those products or surgery available. Dermatology deals with it. Where as no surgery or products or medicine available to change height and whatever is available is painful and has so many side effects and is rarely advisable. Only in case of some genetic bone or muscle disease.

&gt; There have been multiple campaigns, advertisements etc.

3. This is because of feminism. Feminist only talk about issues women have and fight for it. Heightism is not an issues for women but men. Men don't fight for it or dont care.  Since there is no movement such as feminism for men they keep suffering.

I'm sure they both new nothing would be the same, but he worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week almost the rest of his life trying to make it up to her at least in a financial way, and she let him. Eventually they figured out the best thing for him would be to live elsewhere, but she refused to divorce him. 

It affected me in that he was back but I still never really saw him, and when I did, they were constantly fighting. When he moved out, the only time I saw him was she'd drive me every week to his work and she'd send me in and get the money he'd give her. I absolutely hated being used like that, but just seeing him for that brief time was everything to me, then I'd have to go back to the car and act like I wasn't happy to see him.

"hpvw8h1","plot twist, Islam is a politics. Muhammad was a slavemaster and wrote the koran because no one translated the holy text into Arabic at the time. the slavemaster inserted his selfish desire into the text. Islam is a story built on slavery, people captures were forced to convert, those who did not felt the weight the jizya or tax implemented on them, others had no choice if they wanted a higher social status. Bragging that islam has 1.8billion followers is like a slave plantation bragging about its workforce being diverse.

Islam, plaguing and enslaving Africa for almost 2 millenniums. Putin and China will have to pick a side because a lot of non Muslims in Africa hate islam for the genocide they bring to the continent. 




&gt;One of the most commonly invoked argument by political online groups (alt-right, tankies, nationalists etc...) is that the NATO intervention of 2011 is responsible for the country's instability and concerning rise in slave markets. I would like to tackle this talking point in order to clarify what actually caused all of this.

 

&gt;Who are these slaves?

 

&gt;The slaves are usually Sub-Saharan African immigrants or asylum seekers that have fled instability or impoverishment. Some of these immigrants wanted to go to Libya and stay there, while for others, Libya was just a station on the way to the real final goal: Italy (or southern Europe, in general). Keep the latter in mind, as this will be important later on.

 

&gt;How exactly is Gadaffi to blame for all of this if these slave markets appeared after his death, and how exactly did his policies contribute to this mess?

 

&gt;The answer is simple: There was already widespread persecution and enslavement of immigrants before the NATO intervention of 2011. There was simply less reporting involved around the matter due to restrictive policies that made it difficult for anyone to investigate thoroughly under the presence of Gadaffi's police state. However, the research was always there. We had reports of slavery being a huge issue in the region since 1996.

&gt;Gaddafi’s Libya also regularly brought slaves back from its “adventures” in other African countries (Claiborne, 2011). Speaking of the Gaddafi-supported Arab supremacist terror campaigns in Sudan and Mauritania, Jeff Jacoby wrote in the Boston Globe, April 2, 1996, “Tens—maybe hundreds—of thousands of black Africans have been captured by government troops and freelance slavers and carried off into bondage. Often they are sold openly in ‘cattle markets,’ sometimes to domestic owners, sometimes to buyers from Chad, Libya and the Persian Gulf states.[1]

&gt;According to a massive study from Sara Hammod (American university of Cairo, 2006), Gadaffis police state contributed heavily to this predicament as they would capture immigrants and facilitate them to slavery auctions/prisons or exploit those immigrants and freeing them only on the condition of a bribe [2]

&gt;HRW (2009, 55) gives us this story:

&gt;Aron, a 36-year-old Eritrean who was detained at the airport jail in Tripoli in 2007, said that the cost for a bribe was either $500 in cash or about $800 for a wire transfer. After he paid the bribe, Aron said that a policeman in uniform took him from the jail in the police car and put him on the street in Tripoli. He later made an appointment with the policeman and “gave him money to release my friends.” Aron said, “It’s a rotating business. They take people out in the city, get money, and replace the prisoners with other Africans.”

&gt;Perhaps, one of the biggest reasons that Gaddafi is admired by the Western alt-right, is the fact that he struck an immigration deal with the notoriously right-wing PM of Italy Silvio Berlusconi. The treaty between two countries basically dictated that Gaddafi would capture immigrants and refugees and prevent ""ignorant and barbaric"" Africans (Yes, he said that, among other racist remarks [3]) from overflooding Europe in exchange for financial aid. This sort of rhetoric parrots word for word the style and lingo of the ""White Genocide"" conspiracy theory. According to multiple accounts of asylum seekers at the time, MANY of these people who were captured on the way were forced to work for no wages, while being abused and imprisoned and this mistreatment of asylum seekers eventually devolved into slavery. [4,5]

 

&gt;But why? Why these policies and all this racism?

 

&gt;Two things:

&gt;1) The legacy of Slavery in East Africa by the hands of Muslim Arabs seldom gets a mention, even though it was insanely horrific.

&gt;""Only estimates, some of which vary widely, exist as to how many Africans were sold from East to North Africa. This is also due to the fact that many of the slaves perished. Scientific research concludes that about three out of four slaves died before they reached the market where they were to be sold. The causes were hunger, illness or exhaustion after long journeys."" [6]

&gt;The fact that this topic is almost never discussed, not even within Arab circles, goes to reflect how much the discourse has failed many Africans and minorities.

&gt;Racism within the MENA region exists. The fact that many never account for it, and try to find a way to blame Western interventionism for a problem that had already existed far before NATO did anything in the region, is exactly why I am writing this. Many are unaware that Arab supremacy is a very real thing. As one example shows:

&gt;Tomas, the 24-year-old Eritrean, remembers the racism as well as the abuse he experienced in Libya: “They called me ‘n*gger’ as they beat me” (HRW, 2009, 89).

&gt;""For sub-Saharan Africans, there are additional difficulties faced from society at large, notably racism. Testimonies of some of the Egyptian respondents, as well as those of sub-Saharan Africans, describe a situation in which sub-Saharan Africans face greater difficulties both from state officials, such as police officers and prison guards, and from ordinary members of society by virtue of the color of their skin."" [6]

&gt;2) Gaddaffi clearly held beliefs as shown by the above statements. More importantly, the sort of racism that drove Gaddafi was mainly fueled by a twisted sense of paternalism and a ton of ignorance.

&gt;From the ""Green Book"" by Gaddafi:

&gt;""the inevitable cycle of social history, which includes the Yellow people's domination of the world when it marched from Asia, and the White people's carrying out a wide-ranging colonialist movement covering all the continents of the world, is now giving way to the re-emergence of Black people.

&gt;Black people are now in a very backward social situation, but such backwardness works to bring about their numerical superiority because their low standard of living has shielded them from methods of birth control and family planning. Also, their old social traditions place no limit on marriages, leading to their accelerated growth. The population of other races has decreased because of birth control, restrictions on marriage, and constant occupation in work, unlike the Blacks, who tend to be less obsessive about work in a climate which is continuously hot."" [8]

&gt;Notice the return of ""birth rate"" rhetoric. He poses that safe sex would have been a bad idea for the Africana, because African can only dominate the globe their sheer numbers. Suffice to say, not only is this a ridiculous statement by a ridiculous man, it also pushes an arab version of the ""White Saviour"" complex, where he prescribes keeping black people in worse off conditions because they will one day take on the hegemony by having multiple babies.

My plan has always been to transfer from community college tbh.

She told us we were a blessing and she would be praying for us, and it was just like super awkward because her religion liked seeped into the lessons.

"hpv0w15","This has to be THE worst take I've ever seen in my life.

&gt;No. He didn't. He won his first game as a rookie and he did not have a full team of backups nor did he play a full team of starters. He had, and has always had, an elite WR, elite TE and at the time an elite HB. As well as an elite coach and a solid defense.

Wrong. Not a single starter played in that game for the Chiefs, including Hill or Kelce as you alleged The Broncos played their entire starting roster. Want proof? Von Miller said it himself in Mahomes' Top 100 players video for 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lol oh he had a good 4 game stretch cool dude. He's fallen 1000-2000 yards short of your imaginary milestone every year.

Nobody said that he could have gotten 6,000 yards? That's ludicrous. The entire point was he performed admirably and threw for a LOT of yards where he didn't have his best and fastest WR. Aka, doesn't need him to have success.

&gt;And then got embarrassed in the SB. Even when the Chiefs won Mahomes was unimpressive. Also, Brady had an undefeated season. Mahomes didn't.

Uh, unimpressive? He had a rough stretch in the middle. He did fine in the first half and then proceeded to lead three TD drives against the best defense in the league in just over 7 minutes. Unimpressive, heck no. Mahomes also didn't get ""embarrassed"" in the Super Bowl. He made some unbelievable throws that his receivers straight dropped and that Bucs players were losing their minds on the sidelines over. He escaped defender after defender time and time again only to find nobody open. Give me a break.

&gt;By 4th and 5th stringers you mean they were missing 2 starters?

No, I mean a 2nd string tackle, a 4th string guard, a 3rd string guard, a starting center and a 4th string tackle. Do your research before you speak next time.

&gt;Signed, Chiefs fan since 2018. Mahomes has always been surrounded by elite talent at every point in his career. He has never, ever, been on a bad team. He's never even been a good team. All of his teams have been stacked every single year.

Signed, a Chiefs fan since before Andy Reid even came into the picture. He has not been ""surrounded"" by elite talent every year of his career, he has had a small handful of star players in the NFL but that's it.

One example, consent was barely even talked about thirty years ago, and now here we are with things like the #MeToo movement able to happen and have an impact.  Another example is that the BBC now requires there to be at least one woman panelist on all their talk shows after a run of misogyny in their programming a bit over a decade ago.

The name Métis would be agreeable to all, because it is not exclusive and have the advantages of mentioning in suitable ways, the contingent by which each nation would contribute to generate the new people.  ( letter de louis riel a paul proulx 10 mai 1877 (translated from French))""

He also wrote:

""When it comes to the Eastern provinces of Canada, many Métis live there persecuted under the attires of the Indian costume. Their villages are villages of indigence. Their Indian title to the soil is however as good as the Indian title of the Metis of Manitoba.” (our translation from French)""

How can you support that claim?

&gt;I don't blame you for not believing in God who would like to believe in a God who seems wicked.

What? I think I know what you are trying to say but the grammar is all wrong... do you mean ""I don't blame you, who would like to believe in a god who seems wicked, for not believing in god""?

&gt;I've asked these moral questions when I wasn't Christian. I debated about these questions in college when I was in class and no one could argue with me. I use to hate the bible so basically I hated the Christian God.

Irrelevant. 

&gt;Then God let me have a taste of what it felt to be God(the Judge of everything.) I destroyed everything, because I thought I knew better. I was so ignorant and arrogant.

Irrelevant. 

&gt;was such a traumatic battle and journey to realize I don't get to decide what's morally right or not. I am not God.

Congratulations on sacrificing your humanity. 

&gt;When I found out the bible was true, I sobbed because I didn't want it to be. At first glance the bible seems to be controlling and too evil to be true, but it's not. I truly believe God is Love now after I started understand more and more.

Irrelevant. 

&gt;I can answer your questions 

Then how about you do that, rather than giving me a word salad that adds nothing to the conversation. 

&gt;Or do you just want to condemn the bible because you can't understand it or don't want to understand it?

I want you to answer the fucking question. Get that arrogant attitude out of here. 

&gt;To be honest it's all up to you of what you decide to believe or not.

No, it isn't. Beliefs aren't a choice. 

&gt;Or you might be seriously trying to figure out why Christians believe God and the Bible

Yes, and so far you're doing an absolutely terrible job. 

&gt;Only when my delusions literally began to torture me and even put me in the hospital did I start to question my own faults and beliefs.

This is not exactly convincing.

Ok: 

* A. You claimed to have a direct line to God, and then when I ask you a question you provide me with a link you found using Google. Please provide me God's answer. 

* B. That apologetic is absolutely cringe. It basically boils down to ""... well yeah God said slavery was ok... but it was nice slavery"". Fuck off with that shit. Slavery is always immoral. 

&gt;I can still give you my personal answer if you like?

Why didn't you do that rather than writing so much irrelevant shit?

&gt;do you just want me to answer so you can reject my belief?

https://youtu.be/1Q1AF00SqXE?t=1287 here is a minute where there is a security person trying to get the crowd back, I do not understand why they did not communicate this, what logic would ruin a set by stopping a few seconds? none. also travis stopped several times even for bullshit like (there is someone in the tree look at him) do you know what I want to tell you? I am completely sure that Travis did not notice or communicate the seriousness of the situation, it was not because he did not want to ruin his set.
  

  
Keep in mind that people died for 50 minutes, there are even reports that state that the first victim fainted before the concert began, the entire German security team was alert from very early, and they took measurements VERY late.
  

  
He could have been worried when that security car was inside and he did it wrong when I encouraged those people to sneak in, those are the only reasons I can see direct blame towards travis scott.

They have no knowledge where the issue of female infanticide stems from and why it exists and how to fight it but they sure know how to make it about them and feel superior while being completely ignorant to the high gender violence in various forms happening in their own country and society.

However, I wonder why the culture where female infanticide  ( White culture) isn’t an issue have child marriages or are being  the biggest consumer of child prostitution and pornography especially from countries where female infanticide and female genital mutilation are talked about.. Maybe it’s because white men still see women of color as objects. I mean native and indigenous women and girls go missing in white dominated countries and there are so many cases of white men getting slap on their wrist for raping/ sexually assaulting minors especially those from brown and black communities .

"hptdvb9","Hearing it as you pass by the streets or while a friend or family member is playing it through their speakers isn't really the same as actually looking for good artists or songs in the genre. First of all, a lot of mainstream rap or the type of stuff that plays in the radio and that people listen to the most is.. pretty bad. That's not to say there isn't plenty of good rap though. Hip-hop has a ton of variety and different subcultures. I don't know exactly what genres you like, but some recommendations I'd give if you actually wanna give it a fair chance are:

If you're looking for something noisy and abrasive that also dabbles on some political and philosophical themes and takes influences from punk and industrial, I highly recommend Death Grips. They're somewhat of an acquired taste but if you're already into punk, metal, or some of the noisier subgenres in rock, they shouldn't be that hard to get into.

Or if you want something that's more personal and talks about mental health, Earl Sweatshirt is one of my favorites. Abstract rapper that talks about different themes such as grief or depression over experimental beats in a sometimes pretty poetic way. Like Death Grips, he's somewhat of an acquired taste but I highly recommend him. 

If you just want a display of creativity and skill, Aesop Rock and MF DOOM are amazing in how they use their ample vocabulary to make complex rhyming schemes and wordplays.

Billy Woods is also another rapper that I haven't got too into yet, but the few songs I've heard from him are really good. He's an abstract rapper with many complex wordplays and lyrics, but he's also a bit hard to get into.

Finally, I'd recommend Kendrick Lamar as well. He's released two of the best rap albums from the past decade and is great at storytelling, I specially recommend ""good kid, m.A.A.d city"" and ""To Pimp a Butterfly,"" two amazing albums that have a great story and concept and talk about a variety of themes, To Pimp a Butterfly also takes a lot of influence from Jazz, Funk, and Soul music, so that might be interesting to you since you aren't into rap.

Either way, whether you listen to my recommendations or not, what I'm trying to say is that hip-hop is a huge genre with tons of variety and different subcultures surrounding it.

I've experienced too many paranormal encounters and supernatural events to not believe that there is not an explanation for it. There are areas in my life where people would have died and I would even be in jail if it were not for the miracles of God.

I don't blame you for not believing in God who would like to believe in a God who seems wicked.

I've asked these moral questions when I wasn't Christian. I debated about these questions in college when I was in class and no one could argue with me. I use to hate the bible so basically I hated the Christian God.

Then God let me have a taste of what it felt to be God(the Judge of everything.) I destroyed everything, because I thought I knew better. I was so ignorant and arrogant.

It was such a traumatic battle and journey to realize I don't get to decide what's morally right or not. I am not God.

When I found out the bible was true, I sobbed because I didn't want it to be. At first glance the bible seems to be controlling and too evil to be true, but it's not. I truly believe God is Love now after I started understand more and more.

I can answer your questions, but do you really want them? Or do you just want to condemn the bible because you can't understand it or don't want to understand it?

To be honest it's all up to you of what you decide to believe or not. If your initial plan is to reject a belief then what's the point?

"hpt20ua","I see what you mean. I believe in God and would believe he is evil before believing He doesn't exist. I've experienced too many paranormal encounters and supernatural events to not believe that there is not an explanation for it. There are areas in my life where people would have died and I would even be in jail if it were not for the miracles of God.

I don't blame you for not believing in God who would like to believe in a God who seems wicked.

I've asked these moral questions when I wasn't Christian. I debated about these questions in college when I was in class and no one could argue with me. I use to hate the bible so basically I hated the Christian God.

Then God let me have a taste of what it felt to be God(the Judge of everything.) I destroyed everything, because I thought I knew better. I was so ignorant and arrogant.

It was such a traumatic battle and journey to realize I don't get to decide what's morally right or not. I am not God.

When I found out the bible was true, I sobbed because I didn't want it to be. At first glance the bible seems to be controlling and too evil to be true, but it's not. I truly believe God is Love now after I started understand more and more.

I can answer your questions, but do you really want them? Or do you just want to condemn the bible because you can't understand it or don't want to understand it?

To be honest it's all up to you of what you decide to believe or not. If your initial plan is to reject a belief then what's the point? Or you might be seriously trying to figure out why Christians believe God and the Bible. I actually felt both ways before I was Christian. Only when my delusions literally began to torture me and even put me in the hospital did I start to question my own faults and beliefs.

"hps2dgh","&gt; Instead of pasting a link explain how we have more freedom than America, I don't think you can.

I already did.  The US is a corrupt oligarchy, where the people benefitting from laws write them (lobbyists).    A country with the largest debt due to medical bills of anywhere in the OECD.  A country where the police are heavily armed, use military equipment, and routinely get away with literal murder.  A country where votes in the middle of the country count for far more than votes on the more populous coasts, because of a deeply flawed parliamentary structure.  (small p, as in, the Upper and Lower Houses).

A country where it is more difficult to start a business than NZ, more difficult to be ""other"" (race/sexuality etc).  A country where it is more difficult to change social class (start poor, become well-off) than any other in the OECD apart from the UK.   And finally, and most tellingly, your paragon of freedom has more of its own citizens in jail than any other Western nation.  By a factor of 2.  There are currently 1.8 million Americans in jail.

So, a corrupt political practice, where police are unchecked and the ordinary citizen is at far greater risk of violence, debt slavery and jail.  This is not a free nation.   

&gt;Guns aren't just tools for hunting they are tools for self defense against not only criminals but a tyrannous government

Go ahead, try that argument when getting your gun license.  Do you think it'll fly? (Hint:  Saying that you want a gun license for ""self defence"" will disqualify you.  And we don't have the second amendment here, or well-regulated militias, so it's not really a point.  Even the best-armed gun-nut is far worse armed than a platoon full of 19-year-olds.  Your ""rising against a tyrannous government"" would, if seriously tried, last about a day.

&gt; the Enfield would've been good a hundred years ago. 

I know what it is, now.  You're ignorant, and unwilling to look things up, so you just make up what you ""think"" is going on.  The Lee Enfield is a good gun - the police in Bangladesh still use it.  In better hands than mine, it is a very good sniper weapon - to the point of still be issued as such in the mid-90s.    It's still made, as a hunting gun, and is very good for that.  A robust weapon, which will stand bush use in NZ, it'll knock over any animal we have here quite easily.  

Incidentally, my guns are just for hunting.  I haven't had to fight of a home invasion in simply ages.

&gt;Although in America i'm pretty sure you can file a lawsuit if you're property is seized without reasonable cause.

https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/asset-forfeiture-abuse

From there ""Owners need not ever be arrested or convicted of a crime for their cash, cars, or even real estate to be taken away permanently by the government.""

This can be done by local law enforcement and small-town judges.  Can you put in a lawsuit to get your property back?  Yes, you can.  But you will bear the cost of the lawsuit, which will often be greater than the value of the property seized.  (Lawsuits like this START in the 10's of thousands of dollars).  It isn't a free country, if redress only lies in the hands of the rich.  

In New Zealand, the application has to be heard in front of the High court.  The court must satisfy itself that the person has, on the balance of probabilities, profited from crime, and what the amount should be.  It's about the person, not the property.  To explain the difference - if I'd just sold a GTHO Falcon for $400,000 cash, and got stopped by the police in the US, they could say it was proceeds of crime - without specifying what crime - and take it.  In NZ, they would have to prove, in front of a High Court judge, that I had got the money through nefarious means.

&gt;I think you can at least concede my initial point was correct that communism leads to totalitarianism which often leads to fascism.

Where the tuppenny fuck did that come from?

No, I don't.  Communism and fascism are opposite ends of the political spectrum.  Fascism is a RIGHT-WING movement.  Communism is a LEFT-WING movement.  

Even Wikipedia knows this.  Fascism ""Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy[2] that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[3] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries.[3] Opposed to anarchism, democracy, liberalism, and Marxism, fascism is placed on the far right-wing within the traditional left–right spectrum.[3][4]""

Communism, on the other hand ""Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal')[1][2] is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state.["".  

Do you see the ""M"" word, in the bit about Fascism?  About what they're opposed to?  Which Marx do you think that refers to?

"hpri4w4","Are you well? Legitimately are you well? Your approach to this has been completely disrespectful. You want a debate fine, here is all the things you have done wrong, after that you're going to respectfully excuse yourself and think about your actions.

1. Your curiousity (which is fine with sexualities you don't understand) proceeds on the basis that sapiosexuality is not real, therefore you came here, not the right place for it, to debate it's existence. 
a) This was completely counterproductive to say the least. If you're inviting debate on it you might mind your tongue, considering that if you are wrong (which was the whole point of debating it) the language used was very insulting. Better safe than sorry (which you should be).
b) To add insult to injury after discussing it with another person (who actually had coherent reasons) you casually followed up a word vomit of a paragraph with ""wanna fuck?"" So either way you were you were going to disparage the seriousness of the conversation with some lousy disrespectful comment like that? 

2. You're clearly somewhat familiar with philosophical arguments. So to witness  reductionism being butchered like that is quite the sight. Memes are reductionist, like what??? You're going to dispute the existence of a sexuality because of memes?
a) The people who make those memes are probably people like you, ie not members of this sexuality. Essentially you have no idea if sapios made the meme.
b) Even if they did or didn't just because they share it in a community (if they do idk) doesn't not mean it's reflective of the sexuality and it also does not mean it affects the whole of the sexuality. For example, there have been many sex repulsed memes on this sub. That does not mean all Demis are sex repulsed. 
c) Just because people share memes or laugh about things doesn't mean they believe it.
d) To say Memes = reductionist to x = sapiosexuals have to prove anything just does not correlate.

3. Memes are not a treatise on the laws of the universe. Also the people you refer to who use these online forums in that manner (which you've betrayed your preference to) probably waste too much time online because they have nothing better to do. Dumb, ignorant and wasteful people are everywhere. 

4. There are many reasons why young women marry old farts. Just because one person said so does not make it so. Just because someone, say yourself, repeats that then does not make it any more true.

5. Just because the dictionary doesn't have a definition for something doesn't mean it's wrong. Similarly, just because sapiosexuality or demisexuality or asexuality isn't well defined or understood does not mean it is wrong.
a) Of course that does not mean it's right. Although I think no one has professed any of those things to be. These things are in their infancy of being understood.
b)  NB. That's how you use reductionism correctly😜.

6. Perceived and experienced are completely different. You can perceive things without experiencing it. But you cannot experience something without perceiving it. 
a) This is a self defeating argument. It filters into your position of it's too broad or too narrow to be useful. You've dug yourself a hole because surely it has to be one or the other to lack use, which is it? 
b) You then show us that actually it is useful because semantic use of ""intelligence"" seems to vary. Disproving the rest of your argument. 
c) 6(b) reinforces the point of 5(a).

7. Demisexuality is clearly different to sapiosexuality. Demis take significant amounts of time to form a bond, that is not the case for sapios. Hence why this author has very kindly shared this crossover community.
a) Demis often know the kind of character they would be interested in pursuing to see if a bond devolopes. That doesn't mean it's strictly confined to that character. Sometimes it can randomly happen thanks to circumstances. Demis prob don't say it because it is heavily individualised. If you think about it that makes perfect sense otherwise you would have sexualities whose partners are so similar to each other you would think they were all the same person. And that DOES NOT happen.

8. Being attracted to intelligence does not mean being attracted to anyone in Mensa. The sapios aren't frothing at the mouth to find the Mensa members and seduce them. Intelligence clearly is related to the person's own intelligence level, you can't have people at opposite ends at the spectrum. That would mean there attracted to complete bewilderment. 
a) Its probably safe to say they would have to be close to each other in terms of intelligence level. 

9. It's completely self defeating that you highlight different kinds of intelligence and then say being attracted to intelligence is too broad. I'm sure certain kinds tickle different people's fancy more than others. In the same way some body shapes, gender etc, sexually arose or excite to some people more than others.

And with that I hope you end the disgrace that was your argument.

Resident evil 4 had enemies that had different move sets, scythe ganados would toss the weapon, pitch fork wielders did the long reach stab, dynamite tossers were a thing, unarmed ganados which would chase you with out streched arms... Very good stuff. On gamecube. 

So much replayability too. The chapter scores encouraged better performance. Mercenaries was fun as fuck.

Resident Evil Village.

The enemies will lazily take some side steps before charging you. They may stop and do a leaning in glare at you. Welcome to ps5.

Should I add Leon had MMA moves? Ethan has a shitty counter that looks un natural and ""jank"" as fuck because its a poorly animated outstretched kick that should by all rights do fuck all.

Final Fantasy 7

After a 3 hour romp through midgar you are introduced to an expansive world. You need a car, a boat and a plane to navigate it all. So many secrets to uncover. Optional bosses and characters to find as well as side activites and encounters. Well designed world.

**In the thing they call a remake you only go from one end of the map to the other. All secret bosses are in one location there are no optional characters and nothing of value to find really. Of course the story isnt even complete either after being neutered and bastardized by a hack director and his fan fiction shounen trope BS**

So please explain how Coca-Cola is anti science, since it fits that definition of religion, and let's be realistic for some people out there it really is their religion. https://youtu.be/KTVC2uVGEL0

Oh coke is to fringe of an example? Please explain how ancester veneration is anti science?

Houston Oasis? (Here's a handy link since you are so dismissive of religion you clearly haven't heard of them https://www.houstonoasis.org/) 

What about alcoholic's anonymous, which is to be clear, actually a cult?

What about an Orthodox Jewish atheist, of which there are many. How are they anti science for taking their culture and heritage seriously?

Here's an entire Wikipedia article about the definition of religion, because religion is such a complicated and nebulous concept that scholars have been debating it's definition for hundreds of years https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_religion

I honestly don't care what the fuck you believe, and since you're on this sub I understand that you might have a bad taste for religion, but just because you got a raw deal and had to get out of a cult doesn't give you the right to disrespect other people's beliefs.

"hpqt6vb","Um, so a lot to unpack here…

First off, I’m all good on the sex and love drive. It’s completely “normal” if maybe even a bit high, this goes for a lot of other aros and aces too. As an asexual I don’t feel sexual attraction, meaning I don’t feel drawn to people based on their sexual desirability, but I do absolutely have a sex drive and can definitely feel arousal. Those are different things that don’t actually have that much to do with each other. So I’m not missing out on sexual sensations or pleasure, I just don’t feel drawn to people in that way. Being aromantic is different from being asexual, and you can absolutely have romantic attraction without sexual attraction. Many aces still have romantic relationships because romance ≠ sex. I, however, am both aromantic and asexual. As an aromantic I am not missing out on love, in fact, I love more deeply than anyone I know. I still want affection and to feel loved by others and am fully capable of giving them the same. I’m not lacking a fundamental human emotion, I just experience it differently from most people. I don’t feel romantically drawn to people, but that doesn’t mean I am missing out on human connection or love. In fact, I am a small subset of aromantic called cupioromantic, which means I still want a romantic relationship despite not feeling romantic love. I’m even currently looking for a partner!

Talking about grade 9, I think it's a few grades prior that you're introduced to the nervous system and taught that it's responsible for everything you feel. Guess what, plants don't have any. Plants can't feel for exact same reason as rocks, there is no mechanism for it. 

Funniest thing about all this is that even if plant could feel (never happening), a lot more plants are needed to feed farm animals. So not only non-vegans are contributing to tremendous amount of animal cruelty, but many times more ""plant abuse"" than vegans, those who are ignorant enough to believe it.

Imagine the absurdity of this situation. A thinking and feeling animal is screaming in front of you for its life but you go — ""Nah, imma kill you anyway because I think that plant over there can feel, which I'll feed to you anyway."" Common sense is not so common, especially when it comes to things you are indoctrinated about.",1640302330,"can't tell if this is satire or if you really are so ignorant and delusional.  &gt;also if you look up the definition of sentient and then do some research on plants to realise they do react to chemical/physical stimuli, well then by definition of the word sentient, they are sentient.","ignorant and delusional","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so ignorant and delusional","delusional","so",NA,1

I asked him how we were supposed to help help poor women and girls receive health services and birth control to prevent pregnancies on a large scale.  He said he made donations through his church that went to the cause, but he truly failed to realize what a tiny drop in the bucket his little donation made. But in his mind he was a big hero, helping the poor and helping women with those services. No amount of conversation could convince him of the national need for financial assistance.

"hpqpzic","If it's any explanation (not to argue with you) I'm a gay woman with some of the opposing bias. The thing is that gay men and gay women aren't necessarily a group by nature. By definition we are people who are attracted to people of the same gender, and while many gather to form a shared culture later on, it's *because* our formulative experiences are quite different.

Some of that revulsion is resentment: the anger that society pushed us into heterosexual relationships, made embarrassing displays when we *have* interacted with the opposite gender. Perhaps dealt with issues of consent based on that heterosexual norm (teasing for their ""girlfriend"" or ""boyfriend"", encouraging people of the opposite gender with crushes to repeatedly violate boundaries, etc)

The second, and perhaps most unfortunate, is straight up misogyny. If you don't have female role models, friendships, relationships, you may not have an example at all. Moreover, you may not ever have the desire to seek one out, actively or passively. Why would you, if your boy's club tells you that men are best and women are accessories that drag you down? Being gay practically means you've ascended.

The proper conclusion is to hate society and the ways it has made the people around us ignorant and inconsiderate. But for some people, it's hard to hate or criticize the flawed people you've grown up with as friends. Those conflicted people will try and speak up as a ""moderate"" or ""expert"" to defend the people they want to have faith in, the idea being that if they are properly good then they'll be given the best of both worlds. Pulling a Blair White so to say, though I haven't heard from her in a while.

And following the previous point, though perhaps a bit of a stereotype, hatred of the ""bad ones"" stopping them from acceptance and ""true"" equality. There are gay men that hate ""fairies"" for supposedly stereotyping the whole group.  Revulsion of the feminine, fear of the perception of *being* feminine, paranoia to be persecuted by the people you know as an accessory... (and the outsiders. There are people determined to see gay men as feminine sidekicks)

Trump has the egosyntonic Cluster B personality disorders (Narcissistic, Anti-Social, possibly Histrionic).

Halfway through, I jokingly said to someone ""this is so soapy I'm half expecting Ciri's dead parents to show up and be the enemy all Darth Vader style"" and WHAT DO YOU KNOW. 

So much of the plot could have been amazing if the writing weren't so shit. When you have to rely on characters being ignorant and useless (which is essentially the plot for all three of our protagonists; Geralt doesn't know what to do, Ciri is trying to train because she's not good enough, Yen lost her powers) to have the plot, it's not good.

LMFAO yeah right, looks like you've been crying about Rittenhouse on Reddit almost obsessively since it all happened, like most days in your comment history. Kinda sad, go outside dude.

&gt;Same people are calling that kid a hero for trying to defend himself and other students. This is contradictory.

What an utterly ignorant and idiotic comparison. A school shooting is ALWAYS bad, super bad, there's never an instance where someone pulls out a gun at a school and it's for anything other than murder. Someone trying to take a school shooters gun is an act of heroism because that person is without a doubt an active shooter. Kyle was not an active shooter nor in a similar situation, Kyle only shot after those neanderthals chased him until he tripped and then tried to jump him. What a braindead analogy lmao.

&gt;Most of the Kyle Rittenhouse supporters I've brought this up to for some reason agreed that Arbery was in his full right to take the gun away, which is completely contradictory.

Not as brainlessly stupid as the other analogy, but you're still reaching. In this case, these hicks were literally holding Arbery at gunpoint and refusing to let him pass, preventing him from leaving. This is without doubt a very threatening situation where most people would go into some form of fight-or-flight, so it's completely rational and understandable Arbery tried to take their gun to defend himself, as the hicks were clearly aggressors. The neanderthals who got shot by Rittenhouse were clearly the aggressors, they were literally chasing him with intent to disarm and beat him. He was trying to run away until he tripped. Entirely different situation and context.

It's really easy to rationalize self-defense in all 3 of these cases, if it's difficult for you, I believe you're either slow in the head or you just want Rittenhouse in the wrong so desperately that you're deliberately ignoring the facts of the cases. You claiming anyone in support of Rittenhouse, ""were happy to see BLM protestors die"" is petty and without evidence, just highlights your victim bias with regards to BLM/white people.

The right attitude, the healthy attitude towards life is SKEPTICISM geared towards all forms of authority along with deep self awareness of one’s own values and beliefs — including the knowledge of all external influences that lead you to believe in certain things (e.g. if you are an atheist, where did you get the idea that atheism is a superior philosophy? Where did you first hear about this idea? Did you hear it from a primary, secondary or tertiary source?). The cost of not having this attitude, whether if you call yourself an atheist or a religious person, is being unaware of who is trying to manipulate you.

"hpo2bwr","1. The Transferred Nation's Unnatural level of power - Self explanatory

2. Easily-Avoidable Civilian Casualties - Some fanficsz especially copy-paste, often repeat these types of casualties from Min-Min's NHS. Primarily in Gim and the Kingdom of Fenn. These transferred nations could've easily been written to aversion due to the MC nation's disposition.

3. Excessive reaction - I've seen some fanfics that bear rather unnecessarily copious amounts of reactions along the lines of: Pißer-pants Horrified or Comical Anger. While such things seems quite plausible and even expected, the pitfall is that it gets amplified and repeated so excessively.

4. Political Inaccuracy - depending on the type of civilization, era, world, etc... the MC nation comes from, the political ways may differ. However for simplicity I'll state this from a modern standpoint; The political disposition of the fanfic narion can sometimes be either; Forced, Inconsistent, Childish, Naive, Poor, Excessive, Impossible, Inaccurate, or to put it simply... Incorrect.

5. Increased Arrogance - So far, I've only seen one fanfic (which I prefer not to disclose) that presents this. The antagonists get unbelievably more arrogant, ignorant, and prideful, this gets even worse if the nation in particular is undoubtably powerful, as an example: Better than the United states of america.

6.

"hpnhybr","Your idea is interesting and the supposition is reasonably ... not supported but perhaps at best insinuated (hill not worth dying on). I wasn't saying otherwise. But factually it is more speculation than was my point, it does assume its own veracity, contradicts the author, and it's weird to draw lines in the, hmm-ahhh, sand, as if with testosterone laden piss by claiming, ""that way of organizing information is more *disrespectful* than the way I've attempted to do it, heathen!"" Geez lol. Relax. Disrespectful to what? You? Neither of us are dolts either and we're both familiar with the entire work. Like you say, interpretation and all that is fluid both on the parts of a reader and an author. So again, relax, because I'm not coming to take your Mightiest Dune Fan Pendant. Lol. ""Disrespectful."" Gosh, the position must be quite fragile if simple arguments against are treated like blasphemy.

**Be fair and admit that your original point was that Herbert mixed up Halleck's and Idaho's backstories.** That's what I addressed. When the foolishness of that was questioned, suddenly it's now become about retcons maybe, or intentionally inconsistent details used to develop a story (which is congruent with what I'd said actually. It's *not* with what you'd said however, so thank you for supporting my super obvious point.). **Your condescending rebuttal is both a red herring and a straw man, and I think that's more disrespectful than reading a book or discussing it is.**

You didn't mention cannon of course so forgive me for referencing that sort of common debate as an example of the ways people try to establish what is and isn't ""genuine"" to the storyline. Seemed like an intellectual such as yourself would have taken that as it was intended.

&gt;I'm not saying it's not canon. It can be canon and inconsistent, or canon but originating as a mistake, or canon and a retcon.

So, agreed. Just none of those things are the same as ""the author forgot."" No? Even ""originating as a mistake"" means the mistake was realized and then capitalized on wilfully. It can't be a retcon because nothing else was ever established prior.

I concluded with something like ""whether it was planned or evolved as the author and story matured I don't care, but asserting the author accidently wove such a focal part of a focal character's origin/motivation in is ballsy. And arrogant."" All this, ""you're like a religious zealot and a fool hanging on to the words of this guy like he's a divine prophet is the epitome of idiotic"" stuff is misplaced and, Frankly, no pun, insulting. But, a red herring has no other goal does it? I did say I just love great storytelling and don't mind layers and evolutions within a story when they *fit* so well. You're being a little weird about it tho. 

Not concerned with Farok. We are discussing main characters who span book one to book six.

The brief statements about Pardot and Liet are interesting. But they are brief and vague. Did Pardot the character evolve into Liet? Maybe so. In your estimation the same as in mine one evolved into the other but I appreciate how that happened in the artform of storytelling while you're actually the one hanging on each word like orthodoxy is The Only Way or something.

""Deeper meaning."" Hmm. Well, it's about mechanism. As someone looking for a way to sneak around the final draft's clear declaration that Idaho had such and such a history by citing other authors' logical and illogical mechanisms it's surprising you seem to miss the central mechanisms Frank's whole universe were based on. I like Dune so much because it's an extension of one very insightful man's conceptualization of humanness all the way from how he wrote it to what it ended up being. It's super good from inside to out. Thought you'd agree lol.

You can see the traces of his mechanisms throughout the whole production. Can't remember where the first draft was published most recently, was it *Dreamers of Dune?* That short story about some Duke's off-planet son falling into a spice blow or whatever evolved into the Dune universe. ""Paul and Pardot"" evolved into ""Leto and Liet"" as the voices of the outer world who came and injected their offworld seed into the ripe local legends and visions and all of that. Halleck's juicy setup evolved into Idaho's action potential.. believably, as pointed out previously. If the shoe fits wear it. It's not about ""deeper meaning,"" what are you a third year philosophy student(?), It's quite clearly about literary mechanisms. Funny how we both seem to acknowledge that but since you need it to *mean* the author simply mucked up while I think it's just a part of that particular story's mechanistic evolution I'm the witch to your New England Parish lol. Damn Bene Gesserit whores amaright?

It's the mechanisms of the storytelling. It became a brilliant series beyond a compelling novel because it evolved as the author's ideas evolved. They were always based on his own notions of the mechanisms that contain time, space, and therefore people therefore our famous indomitable spirit.

Dune is the modern Gilgamesh. It's the modern human/demigod/god(?) apotheosis or, conversely, ""divine right to rule ... into decay"" story thing. It explores the inherent yearning to ""talk to fate hoping for a favor"" thing our species has always embodied that inspires legions of folks to do this or that for awhile before everything inevitably blows up and crumbles, dragging all its servants back into the evolving entropy from which they came.

Like reality as we know it, Dune evolved into what
It became. Where you see literal foolishness I see the exploration of universal mechanisms a guy developed as realistically as he could that clearly all fit together by their end. Then, when you backtrack and talk about evolving concepts in storytelling and mechanisms or retcons instead or whatever, it's curious why we can't be allowed to be on the same page and I have to be a hippy fanatic or something. Seems disingenuous.

When you say FH forgot who his characters were my eyes can't help but roll nearly out of their head. It really does *sound* like when folks split hairs over canon in order to miss all that's relevant. When I say, well, seems like he was intentionally evolving concepts that make up the whole mechanism of this story's telling that transfer or overlap rather nicely dunno why indignation is the primary response. 

It's great you've got technical knowledge of the series. Kudos. Try to discern the forrest past those pesky trees however. Paul and Pardot begat Leto and Liet so characters like Duncan and Stilgar could serve them while not serving them at all but instead slowly come to realize one shouldn't blindly serve a charismatic leader, and we're all doomed to die anyway, species be damned but also exalted, do your best unless/especially when it's your worst, Amen, everything's fine but no it's not. It's all seamless paradox and that's why it's so good. Acknowledging that details fudge and overlap is great because that is how the story was told, but accusing the author of not being aware of it to sound edgy and enlightened is not as impressive as may have been desired. Two people often have come from the same place. Giving Halleck and Idaho that similar background motivation FITS seamlessly into the whole story while your proposition doesn't. Own that and your points might offer more than cluttered details.

Tl;dr

I don't think Duncan was nobleborn like you speculated. It's a cute theory, but Frank did not establish it in any real way. If he *did* hint at it, like you said and like I do not see good reason to *believe* that (blind belief being that thing you projected onto me intending mockery), he still later established concretely Idaho came into himself on Geidi Prime. Say what you want, but I'll take the author's intention instead of yours without being called ignorant and gullible, thank you. Lol, the unintended irony.

"hpngrso","&gt;it wont matter how much information I give you or how many research papers I link, you will only believe what the government says and be happy about it

I don't give a shit what the government says. I care about what the data says. The government has fucked this whole situation up completely. 

So how about you focus on my points instead of trying to guess where my bias lies?

&gt;The goal has always been herd immunity with literally any virus ever in existence even with this one until now it seems and they estimated it would require roughly 80% for this virus but its nto the same for every virus...

70 - 80% is a pretty standard range for a herd immunity target. And given the infection rate of covid I'd say the 80% sounds pretty reasonable.

&gt;Based on the CDC's own tracker 87.7% of people at or older than 65 Years of Age have been ""fully"" vaccinated. With 72.6% of people at or older than 18 years of age are ""fully"" vaccinated. That 61.6% of the ""total population"" includes all of the people that even you agree should probably not be getting the vaccine anyway, it also includes the demographic of people who have not been impacted by the virus in the slightest.

That's not how herd immunity works. Main figure that matters is total population vaccinated. It doesn't matter that certain age groups are over the 80%, those age groups don't exist in isolation, they're part of the population as well. Herd immunity only works if the total population is above the immunity threshold, not just the vulnerable portion of the population. 

&gt;Again, looking at the CDC's own trackers those at and under the age of 17 years old are highly unlikely to catch, fall ill, or die from this virus so forcing them to take this drug in order to ""protect themselves"" from the virus in order participate in society or go to school is extremely ignorant and unscientific. 

That age group doesn't need to take the vaccine to ""protect themselves"" they should be taking it primarily to protect others.

They are much less likely to get sick or die (catch is highly debatable), but they are high contact risks making them the prime age group to spread the disease (which is also made harder because they are often asymptomatic)

&gt;Then we factor in the percentage of population who have caught and survived who would now have the natural antibodies which is another 12% give or take...

Where are you getting that figure from?

The recovered unvaccinated likely have highly [variable immunity which likely wanes over time unless vaccinated in addition (or reinfected) ](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/covid-immunity-following-natural-infection-likely)

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-08-06/cdc-covid-19-reinfections-among-unvaccinated-twice-as-likely-than-among-vaccinated%3fcontext=amp

The only way to guarantee these people have immunity is to get vaccinated.

&gt;So if we blow away the FUD, those who would be most impacted by the virus (65+) are above the 80% herd immunity. 

Again. Not how herd immunity works. You have to factor the whole population (the ""herd"") togethor.

&gt;But there are no studies that present any evidence to suggest they are safe either...?

No... That's my entire point. It's impossible to know with 100% certainty what the long term side effects of covid or the vaccine is. So I don't understand why you were initially only worried about one but not the other?

&gt;You actually believe that taking away an individuals means of providing for themselves or their families if they don't take this drug is totally okay

[Vaccine mandates are nothing new](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211029-why-mandatory-vaccination-is-nothing-new). Many jobs have always required vaccinations of various types.

I was really trying to convey that to the woman who was stealing and being aggressive.

It conveys the wrong impression that I think I’m better than everyone else and superior - I honestly don’t) That is why the first thing I did was remind her that there were Families with children present - to wake her up to the gravity of the situation and the fact that her actions would pass on to the next generation that were witnessing her and her partner carrying on like they were. 

I didn’t go in there saying what I thought about her appearance and I only made the “Get a job like everyone else has to” comment after she made the excuse that she had mouths to feed. I have mouths to feed as well, as I’m sure you do too - I don’t go out and steal. 

I don’t completely agree though with the notion that the woman who was choosing to steal and getting threatening and violent towards staff and customers should be portrayed as the victim because that further pushes notion that this person is docile and cannot be held accountable for her actions - that’s not possible.  Unless someone is suffering from a mental condition or has an intellectual disability or is under the age of 18 - if they carry out actions that are detrimental or make choices that are not beneficial to them, they cannot then be free from the consequences they then face as a result.

"hpmf7r5","&gt;	I would bet anything, if you took people who struggled to pay their bills on $8/hr and suddenly gave them $80/hr, they’d be in the exact same situation in 3 weeks.

I know this is intentionally hyperbolic, but it really shifts responsibility in a problematic way. Massive amounts of debt cannot just be explained away by people having no impulse control with their money. The amount of normal, everyday expenses people have are increasing relative to income regardless of how well you can budget. People with no money aren’t just ignorant and impulsive spenders. They are taken advantage of because people have to sift through more and more predatory marketing schemes than ever. 

People in 1800 didn’t drive around in Jaguars because they were financially sensible people. They didn’t drive Jaguars because Jaguars weren’t an option. They literally had no way to acquire enough money to buy one. Now banks and creditors hand out inappropriate amounts of money to people left and right because long-term credit card and car debt is normalizing. The people taking on the debt have responsibility for their finances, but it’s disingenuous to frame the debt issue like “they just need to stop spending” and the problem ends. The market is not benign.

I know it’s anecdotal, but I made about $9/hr in my first 6 months out of college and absolutely struggled to pay for things, including a few bills on credit cards. Then I got a job at $25/hr and I literally didn’t change a single spending habit for the first year and still ended up with several thousand dollars in savings even with a car payment and student loans. I literally just bought whatever I wanted and still couldn’t outspend the income. 

&gt;	Which is why so many jackpot lotto winners go bankrupt so quickly. If you can’t manage $10.00 you’re not going to be able to manage $1,000,000.00 dollars

"hpm2trm","&gt; At least, I assume you're not offering sacrifices in your backyard. If you aren't offering sacrifices and bringing all the different tithes, you're not really fully observing the Torah.

This is how it almost always goes with people who are against God's ways. If I had a nickle for every time I heard the ""sacrifices in your backyard"" comment, I could buy something substantial. People say that I should be doing something that is **against God's Torah** and since I don't do things that are **against Torah** then I'm not observing Torah. I really don't understand the logic. Perhaps it comes from people not reading about God's ways. 

&gt; You also failed to recognize the inherent flaw in your own logic. Yes, we are granted into the NEW covenant - not the old covenant. We are not under the old Mosaic Law.

I had suggested that you look into the new covenant, to see what it is. Apparently you didn't look into it. Jeremiah is the first and most direct prophecy of God making a new covenant. This passage is quoted in Hebrews 8 and 10. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. **For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my Torah within them, and I will write it on their hearts.** And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”      Jeremiah 31:31-34

Hebrews 8 and 10 quotes this, saying exactly what the new covenant is, God's Torah (the ""Mosaic Law"") put within believers and written on believer's hearts. 

&gt; Lastly, you failed to address the verses from Galatians I posted. I could post many more from throughout the NT that deal with the law, not judging others with regards to diet and feast days, but I suspect that would be equally fruitless.

There a couple of important things to consider. Paul delighted in God's Law and said that ""with my mind I serve the Law of God"". In Acts 21 Paul completed a Nazarite vow to prove to the world that what was being said about him--that he was teaching people not to keep the Law--wasn't true and that he himself ""lived in observance of the law"". Did you know that Paul ""lived in observance of God's Law""? Did you know that Paul fully intended to go to the Temple and make a sin sacrifice? We know from other passages in Acts that Paul was insistent that he return to Jerusalem for God's feast days. **Paul followed Torah**. 

Another point that can't be overlooked is the fact that Paul is the only Bible author that we have a warning about, that he is hard to understand. 

&gt; And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are **hard to understand**, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with **the error of lawless people** and lose your own stability.    2 Peter 3:15-17

Peter warns us to not misunderstand the things that Paul says, especially concerning God's Law. But Paul is always the go to for Lawless people. Nobody ever quotes the PRO Law things that Paul says. Nobody counts the number of times that Paul tells people to keep various Laws, and there are MANY. 

Contrary to what most people think, Paul didn't side with the man of Lawlessness, he said we should imitate Jesus....who followed the ""Mosaic Law"". 

&gt; If you want to follow the Law, then have fun I guess?

Thank you for granting me permission to walk in God's ways. I had been a little apprehensive about being obedient to God, but since you at least questioningly approve, I can be at ease about emulating Jesus.

"hplxqdk","In day-to-day human experience we are faced with various types of suffering and evil. The concept of suffering causes some people to lose their faith in the existence of God. In other cases, it may cause a person to have more faith in God. One thing is certain however, the reason of why we suffer has puzzled humanity since the dawn of time. Sikhism has provided an answer to this apparent paradox, which shall now be discussed.
Defining Suffering
We are going to first try and define what we mean by suffering, by putting it into following categories:
Natural – Brought about by natural causes e.g. a disease or natural disaster like an earthquake
Moral – Brought about through human choice e.g. the Holocaust or a murder
Relative – Dependant on how we view a situation e.g. death of a freedom fighter may be viewed as bad by his people but to their enemy it may be seen as good
Absolute – Evil in all situations e.g. Hitler’s regime is generally regarded by people in all walks of life as being evil
Metaphysical – Apparent unfairness of all the suffering e.g. a baby dies of cancer who has seemingly done nothing wrong but at the same time a man who commits many murders lives comfortably
It is important to note that absolute evil does not exist, because what is regarded as absolute evil to one person may not be seen as absolute evil to another, it is therefore dependant on the perception of an individual. Also, it is important to note that any given moral situation may fall into multiple categories.

Apparent Paradox
The major world religions generally agree in the triad of God, that God is all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful. However, for those who believe in God, the concept of suffering appears to contradict God’s all-loving and all-powerful nature. The questions people pose are, ‘How could an all-loving God allow God’s creation to suffer?’ and ‘Why would an all-powerful God not use his power to intervene and stop the suffering in the world?’
The major world religions have different ways in justifying suffering:
Christianity, Islam &amp; Judaism – Suffering is due to our sins and there is a Devil who tempts us to commit sin
Hinduism – Previous and current bad deeds (karma) cause suffering
Buddhism – Desire and attachment cause suffering
Atheism – There is no God, so nature and humans are responsible for all suffering
Sikhism – Previous and current bad deeds (karma or kirat) as well as desire and attachment cause suffering

Individual Karma &amp; Samsara
The theories of Karma and Samsara are an integral part of Sikhism. Karma may be defined as the law of every action having a consequence:
“As someone sows, so he reaps” (Bhai Gurdaas Vaaran, p.1).
Samsara is the cycle of reincarnation of 8.4 million rebirths and deaths:
“Those who come, must go in the end; they come and go, regretting and repenting. They will pass through 8.4 millions species; this number does not decrease or rise” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.936).
The rebirths continue until a person achieves liberation (Mukti) from this cycle of transmigration of the soul, which can only be achieved as a human being. This is why human life is regarded as being a very precious and rare opportunity to get out of the system of reincarnation.
Collective Karma
Sometimes groups of people are killed through either natural or man-made disasters and wars. This is known as collective karma where people are reaping the fruits of their individual actions at the same time individually, but as a collective whole.
Effects of Actions on Karma
It is due to our previous actions, from our current and previous lives, that we find ourselves in our current situation. People often blame God for all the suffering in their lives, however nobody is responsible for a person’s suffering other than themselves:
“Why do you slander the Lord? You are ignorant and deluded. Pain and pleasure are the result of your own actions” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.695).
Effects of Desires on Karma
Our mind’s desires of lust, anger, greed, worldly attachment and pride keep us from achieving a suffering-free life, because they make our actions reap negative fruits. Once we are in control of these 5 desires then we shall reap the fruits of good actions:
“In the field of karma, plant the seed of the Naam. Your works shall be brought to fruition” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.176).
The Need for Suffering
Sikhism provides a reason for why an all-loving and all-powerful creator allows suffering to continue. Our entire concept of suffering as being a bad thing, is wrong. Suffering is the mechanism that God has put in place to make us remember and love God again:
“Suffering is the medicine, and pleasure the disease, because where there is pleasure, there is no desire for God” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.469).
A loving mother sometimes punishes her child, so that the child may reform their bad ways. Similarly, just as iron is beaten by the blacksmith, even though the iron cries out in pain, in the end what is left is iron without the impurities:
“Putting iron into the furnace the iron is heated. Then it is put on the anvil where it bears the strokes of hammer. Making it clear like glass, its value is set” (Bhai Gurdaas Vaaran, p.14).
Another way to look at good and evil is to consider instead light and darkness. Darkness does not actually exist, it is merely the absence of light, but without darkness, how can we hope to understand light? Similarly, evil does not exist, it is merely the absence of good, but without the concept of evil, how can we hope to understand good? Without suffering and pain, we would not be able to understand the value of goodness and pleasure.
Is Death Really Suffering?
Death is seen as a negative eventuality by most people, but is it really suffering? Ironically, death is the one thing life guarantees since it is certain that one day we will all perish. Also, it seems odd that we have our entire lives to deal with the certainty of death, and yet we find it to be very distressing when someone dies. Finally, for someone that dies, death may be seen as bringing the end to their suffering and so may be seen as a blessing, for example, a terminally ill patient.
The Perfect Guru’s Example
Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth master of the Sikhs, was made to suffer death by torture as ordered by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The Guru was made to sit on a red hot plate whilst burning sand was poured over his bare body. Even though the Guru had the power to stop all this suffering, instead he told his people that this suffering was God’s will and that he would submit to God’s will. Guru Arjan Dev Ji then sang the verse:
“Your actions seem so sweet to me. Nanak begs for the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.394).

The ultimate example of the suffering of the Guru should give us the strength to get through times we consider difficult. Also, when we are in a difficult situation we should think ‘it could be a lot worse’.
From every experience of suffering there is usually a lesson to learn. This is one of the functions that suffering provides, so do not forget to grow from the experience.

The Way Out
Sikhism offers people a number of ways of dealing with suffering, and these include:
Meditation – Spending some time to meditate on the virtues of God (Naam)
Sharing – Selfless service without reward (Sewa) which may involve serving in the free kitchen (Langar) or doing community work, or even donating a tenth of your time and money (Dasvandh) to needy causes
Honesty – Always speaking and acting truthfully
Good actions may end suffering, but they do not alone give liberation. Liberation is obtained by meditating on the virtues of God (Naam) with love, which connects a person to the Infinity of their True self – their soul.
“Remembering God in meditation, a profound peace is obtained. Pain and suffering will not touch you at all. Forever and ever, work for God; He is our True Lord and Master. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall become absolutely pure, and the noose of death shall be cut away” (Guru Granth Sahib, p.44).
Conclusion
We are responsible for our own suffering due to our desires not being in our control and individual past actions (individual karma)
Suffering is the mechanism which brings us back to the reality of God
Evil is just the absence of good and allows us to understand the value of goodness
Death is not suffering, it is the one thing that life guarantees and is not the end
Guru Arjan Dev Ji’s example should give us the strength to get through suffering
We should realise that our situation could be a lot worse and to learn from the experience

Where have I shifted goal posts? Link a specific example. My arguments have been consistent, the post is a long form clarification of my argument. I have not shifted importance of sources either. I have at least attempted to provide proof, which no one else has even attempted to do. Not even a direct quote from an actual expert.

I do believe that he fell for Rashta's innocent and naivety more than her beauty. And these reasons totally feed into how his relationship with Navier is broken in a sense that she doesn't rely on him emotionally openly as he desires partially because he's an idiot who can't listen and she doesn't take shit from anyone even him. And partially because she is so caught up in being a perfect empress, and you can see how much it affects her when she overhears that she is going to get divorced by him. She has been molded into a prime example for the role and it is a huge part of her identity. Their marriage was arranged and they grew up together more like friends than anything since they never experienced romance beyond this very preteen level or with others. Which probably explains her slight regret after contemplating that it hurts far more than she thought despite dealing with him taking in a mistress for like a month at this point. And we've seen how Sovieshoe reacted. He reaped what he sowed and took their bond for granted and didn't talk to her at all about his plan and even more importantly the reason for this batshit insane plan.

It blows my mind that there are  people who mis-remember that Navier gifted that dagger to dunk on Rashta and her child when it was Duke Ergy who planted that thought into Rashta's head.

The only public policy and aid intervention that reliably drops a population's birthrate is educating girls. Communities with stubbornly and dangerously high birthrates are ones with high female illiteracy, where women simply do not have anywhere near the educational and occupational opportunities as men. In such a community, becoming a mother is really the only way forward for most girls. Mothering is the only pursuit women have for competing with other people and vying for social status, and for feeling a sense of personal accomplishment.

Educated women, who can do any job a man can do, have options for both social and personal fulfillment besides mothering. And in communities where this is the norm, these other options are often a whole lot more fun and attractive to young women than mothering. So they delay having children, and end up having fewer of them, if any at all.

The lowest birthrates are seen in communities that are very highly educated but poor. Eastern European peoples are perhaps the best examples today. In some ways if you're doomed to poverty for the rest of your life, it's better to be ignorant and dull, because at least you can continue to believe that someday things might get better. If you're well-educated and bright, by contrast, you are well aware that you have no chance of escaping your situation, and understand exactly why. This is a source of great unhappiness and pessimism, and is not at all conducive to wanting to have children. It simply doesn't make sense, and you can't see how it ever will.

For similar reasons, poor and corrupt places with low educational levels tend to be ""angry"" places, where revolutions happen frequently, but the new boss is always same as the old boss, and the people who support revolutions are not well educated enough to see the greater pattern of promises made and promises broken. By contrast, poor and corrupt places with high educational levels tend to be ""sad and despairing"" places. They see apathy, not revolution, because everybody *knows* that any new boss they put in power won't be any better than the clown they've currently got.",1640202657,"in some ways if you're doomed to poverty for the rest of your life, it's better to be ignorant and dull, because at least you can continue to believe that someday things might get better.","ignorant and dull","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and dull","dull",NA,NA,1

I was so excited when they announced the vaccines were being rolled out. I was waiting to be eligible to get my shot when one of my Facebook friends posted a story asking if anyone else has experienced heart palpitations and chest pain immediately following the vaccine.. 

No one replied but then I researched it and it turned out people around the world were suffering the same. 

Based on this I decided to wait for better long term studies and shortly after heard about blood clots from the shot in the media and that solidified my decision to wait. 

The way people have commented sarcastic and really snarky dismissive and straight up rude replies on my comment when all I'm attempting to do is have a discussion about this in a polite manner is really disheartening. 

I hope you guys don't feel virtuous or in the right for reacting this way because this type of behaviour is ignorant and short sighted. 

As I said before, please go ahead and prove me wrong with facts, statistics and evidence that show's your contrary objective opinion is correct. 

I don't want this jab to be having bad side effect. I want it to be efficient at granting those who take it immunity. The statistics and FACTS as of now show it is not even remotely efficient for this purpose. 

It does prevent severe covid-19 syndrome in many, which is a positive. 

All Im attempting to ask are the undiscovered and unknown short term, intermediate term and long term side effects from the shot a price worth paying for something that doesn't stop the spread? 

You do realize that Pharmaceutical companies are well known to engage in deceptive marketing, non-disclosure of known side effects and have been responsible for unforgivable crimes that have already altered the fabric of our societies? 

Purdue marketed Oxycontin as a non addictive safe pain killer for the masses and before they were taken to court, it cost the US alone tens of thousands of lives. Sickeningly, they still made multi billion dollar profit after fines were settled. They are objectively the beginning of rampant opiate addiction and the cause of the opiate epidemic. Fentanyl becoming so rampant presently was driven by so much demand for Heroin caused by the amount of new addicts from big pharma's prescription opiods.

This is just one of many examples of pharmaceutical corruption.

"hpla6ab","Religion isn't necessarily fake in the way you're describing and I don't suspect most prophets or religious figures were out to tell lies. They were just very ignorant and very wrong.

First, I think religion has been a natural part of intellectual evolution. It stems from questions humans asked before we had the necessary intellectual and technological tools to discern ideas that are probably true from ideas that probably aren't. Yes, religion has been used to control the masses in some ways, but I honestly don't think that's the origin of primary reason for religion. Mostly it's just our ignorant first attempts to explain the unknown.

Second, I don't think we truly know what prophets or religious figures actually said. There's no reason to believe that most religious holy texts were written by the specific prophet or religious figure they are credited to be from. More likely, for very old religions, there were rote stories passed on for countless generations until someone was able to write them down as best as they could remember the stories being told to them. Have you ever played the telephone game? Not a good way to reliably pass on information. It doesn't mean they were dishonest, just ignorant.

Some authors like Paul in the Christian new testament may well have authored their writings with complete sincerity, but Paul's convictions, however sincere, do not give us reason to believe Jesus actually intervened with him on the road to Damascus. If we take all such claims at face value without evidence, then we would have to believe all manner of insanity.

So, I'd say that religion isn't necessarily fake, as in a lying conspiracy, but it is fake, as in it's claims about the supernatural and the nature of the universe are almost certainly not true (some more certainly than others).",1640200326,"they were just very ignorant and very wrong.","ignorant and very","ignorant","and",FALSE,"very ignorant and very wrong","wrong","very","very",1

""There is demonstrable evidence that children who are put on puberty blockers do not desist. London’s GIDS clinic reports that persistence is correlated with the commencement of physical interventions such as the hypothalamic blocker (t=.395, p=.007) and no patient within the sample desisted after having started on the hypothalamic blocker. [90.3% of young people who did not commence the blocker desisted.](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/07/21972/) Another 2010 [Dutch study](http://www.pinktherapy.com/Portals/0/CourseResources/de_Vries_Puberty_Suppression_in_Adolescents_with_GD.pdf) showed that 100% of the children put on puberty blockers went on to receive cross-sex hormone treatment. And while the numbers vary, there is a general consensus among the [various studies](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html) that **anywhere between 60 and 90 percent of children with gender dysphoria who receive no medical interventions desist when they reach adulthood.**

&amp;#x200B;

[This link](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html) compares more than 10 long terms studies of kids with GD, even one conducted by the person at the head of the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders group in 2008 for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, also known as the  DSM-5.

"hpkp5li","yep. I wasn't aware of my racial biases, since I wasn't raised with the kind of overt racism that many here are talking about, but I'm a privileged white man raised by a conservative christian family in a mostly white state, that's gonna come with some bias.   


went and lived in mexico for a few years, came back seeing and hearing things a different way. ""funny little comments"" about immigrants carry baggage, people don't realize when they make jokes about certain labor, funny little voices, talking about conditions in other countries (incorrectly), and making assumptions about both legal and illegal immigrants, how demeaning and strong those comments are at putting down an entire continent of peoples.   


The perspective I gained there flipped my thoughts on their head. I still don't think i'd say I was raised with racism, but I was raised with ignorance and preconceived thoughts on how others should behave. My family still makes very ignorant and defensive comments when referring to BLM, HBCUs, or other things that they do not understand, and it makes me sad, but idk how long it would have taken me to come around to wanting to understand these things without time outside of white america.

"hpkkwxv","I really needed this today. Thank you. Things have been really difficult these last few weeks on top of learning to accept whatever is happening to me. My doctor was very kind and comforted me when I started crying, talking about how much self doubt I am dealing with worsened by the actions and words of other people.

I am sorry to hear about David and your other friends. I know he would be happy knowing that you still love him. I know what you felt seeing the person that preyed on your friend still visiting the areas David worked. My late friend's SIL found the address of the dealer that preyed on my friend. He was just a little kid. He had so much life ahead of him just for it to be snuffed out over a single bag of fentanyl. I did my best to teach him how to be safe. About hot spots, how people fall out easily after being sober for even a short period of time, I got him narcan and taught his family how to use it which his friend ended up stealing and using because he thought it would get him high- they were young and ignorant and I saw myself in them. I tried getting him into treatment multiple times. You can only do so much. 

Please try to allow yourself to let go. I have never stopped mourning my friends. There are so many things I wish I did. Maybe if I didn't cut contact with X, he would have called me when he came home before calling his friend. Maybe if I allowed Y to continue staying with us after he got out of the hospital, he would have at least had a place to stay where people knew he was using and actually had narcan. Maybe if I stopped calling his phone when he was reported missing, someone would have been able to pinpoint his position on GPS. Maybe if I visited him that last time when I knew he wanted to see me, something would have changed. Maybe this maybe that. It'll drown you. While I have accepted that I did what I needed to do to keep myself and my partner moving toward the right track, the pain is still there. Always in the background. If you are unable to see a therapist to talk about what happened with your friends, there are meetings specifically for friends and family members of addicts. You do not need to have any relation to drugs, yourself. It is different than NA and AA support groups.

I found that the main things that helped that were free were talking about my friends to people that didn't know them. Talking about the good times. Remembering how they were good people in bad situations. And writing letters to them. Originally, I messaged my late friend on snapchat for... god... months... before I checked one day to see the messages had been opened. I later found out that snapchat has a bug where it marks things as open if it's been a certain period of time since the user hasn't logged in. I'm hoping that's the case. But even if it wasn't, I hope his family saw how much I loved him. Writing out your feelings and burning the letters helped. It felt freeing. There is a complicated feeling of guilt and remorse associated to when you are an addict that used with someone that ended up passing away. Regardless of housing them, feeding them, listening to them and holding them when they felt so fucking broken, supported them in getting sober, you still feel like a toxin. It's part of why it haunts me. But I know my friends loved me. Their secrets will die with me. I know what I did to help them and I know it was appreciated. I know what they did in turn. They were good, good people. Such kind men. Complicated, but beautiful, generous, funny people. 

It gives me comfort knowing that we don't truly disappear from this world until the last people that knew us pass away. I hope that whenever I talk about these tragedies, people see that there are real people affected by this epidemic. I don't want people to give up on us. Once the last bridge to the life you once lived before falling into addiction is gone, it makes it so difficult to come back. So, so difficult. I cannot find the words to explain how thankful I am for the people that knew what was going on and didn't push me away. I am also thankful to people like you that see how complex this problem is, have been personally affected by loss, and haven't closed their hearts.

"hpkju96","So, now you're an antivoting troll? Your last post you wanted better candidates, now your temper tantrum widens into a total refusal to vote? That's stupid.

If you want different candidates in general elections you have to vote in primaries, not throw ageist temper tantrums.

If you don't like the candidates in general elections, look in the mirror: When you refuse to participate in primary elections to promote people that share your point of view, they will simply NEVER accumulate the power required to implement the policies you claim to believe in, never be in a general election, and never win a general election and get to make policy.

The things you claim you believe in are farther away because of your weathervaning and your threats of non voting.

Here's a thought: You might be taken more seriously if you had some argument besides ageism. Honestly, when I hear some little shit complaining that a candidate is too ""old"" as their primary concern, I hear a person whose opinion I don't give a shit about unless they have some other justification and Also have some pretty huge redeeming qualities to make up for the ageist bigotry.

Democracies only work with consistent participation. Just shutting down throws away your power, completely. Primary elections, local elections.... The ""boring"" ones... That's how you get real changes made.

"hpkhtxd","I started answering from the bottom and as I went up I realized that there is not point in this anymore... it wont matter how much information I give you or how many research papers I link, you will only believe what the government says and be happy about it. Even using their own words and statistics to build a case against them wont make a difference in your eyes because its not being told to you by a government approved authoritative source. Starting to seem like you, and many like you, have been trained to only listen those in governmental power and reject anything that didn't originate at that source. 

Here are the parts that i did address, seemed wasteful to just delete it...

&gt;That link shows that just over 60% of the population has been fully vaccinated. That's nowhere close to the 80% goal.

The goal has always been herd immunity with literally any virus ever in existence even with this one until now it seems and they estimated it would require roughly 80% for this virus but its nto the same for every virus... Either way we are there based on statistical data especially in the demographic of population that the virus is actually impacting.

Based on the [CDC's own tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-onedose-pop-5yr) 87.7% of people at or older than 65 Years of Age have been ""fully"" vaccinated. With 72.6% of people at or older than 18 years of age are ""fully"" vaccinated. That 61.6% of the ""total population"" includes all of the people that even you agree should probably not be getting the vaccine anyway, it also includes the demographic of people who have not been impacted by the virus in the slightest. Again, looking at the [CDC's own trackers](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics) those at and under the age of 17 years old are highly unlikely to catch, fall ill, or die from this virus so forcing them to take this drug in order to ""protect themselves"" from the virus in order participate in society or go to school is extremely ignorant and unscientific.  

Then we factor in the percentage of population who have caught and survived who would now have the natural antibodies which is another 12% give or take...

So if we blow away the FUD, those who would be most impacted by the virus (65+) are above the 80% herd immunity. The group who are being impacted significantly less (18-64) are also over the 80% herd immunity assumption if you factor in the 12% of that age group who have natural immunity from catching it(72% vaxx + 12% nat immun = 84%) give or take.

&gt;Yes, exactly that's my entire point about the vaccine. There's no significant studies presenting any evidence of long term adverse side effects from the vaccines. Anyone who brings this up as reason to not get vaccinated is misguided or fear mongering.

But there are no studies that present any evidence to suggest they are safe either...? You actually believe that taking away an individuals means of providing for themselves or their families if they don't take this drug is totally okay.. even though we don't have long term studies to ensure the vaccine is safe? Does that not sound evil to you?

But what we can all do is vote vote vote and increase the majority in both house and senate so proper legislation can be done without worrying about the filibuster.

And don't forget the states, vote vote vote for democrats because while both parties want the power, the democrats want the power and want to do good, the republicans want the power and want it absolutely, and they only serve the wrong people like the ultra rich and the NRA.

Look at how many Democratic governments helped the economy (and elevated that standard of living) and how many Republican governments ruined it (and lowered the standard of living). Look at Democratic run states and compare them to Republican run states in standard of living, health and wellness, education, and so on. So I wish most people would stop repeating like parrots the messaging that the republicans put out. The reality is Democratic governments are good for the country, Republican governments are bad for the country.

Go more democratic and the ignorance of Americans will be replaced by education, the narrow sightedness will be replaced by critical thinking and wide scope analysis, and the standard of living will be much better. Drug prices will be comparable with global prices, medical intervention will be available for everyone, and the amount of homeless will diminish, guns will be regulated properly, a woman will get the right to choose, people can actually make a living working one job and get rich working two. 

Now, most Americans are ignorant and uneducated, the standard of living sucks, drugs are out of reach pricewise, unless you have insurance, homelessness is unbelievably high, guns are in the hands of the undeserving more than in the hands of the people that actually care about safety, a woman cannot chose in many states (and increasing), and most people have to work two jobs to just eat and sleep under a roof.

There isn’t any evidence of most rapes or sexual assaults, if you were in charge of our Justice system then I shudder to think of the world that you’re ignorant and naive viewpoint creates. 

The girl is WELL DOCUMENTED to be telling the truth about many aspects of her life; she WAS a baby groupie, she DID have sex with many older rock stars and hang out with them (there are photos), and her timeline for the accusations has always lined up. 

There is nothing pointing towards her claim being untrue (she didn’t even make it as an accusation but a brag, she’s on record saying she doesn’t regret having sex with him, so she’s not trying to demonize or attack him with a false accusation) except your stupid belief that if explicit video of it happening doesn’t exist, then it didn’t happen. 

All of the facts lead to a basic conclusion; David Bowie was a sex pest. He frequently would see or meet women and make statements such as “she’s mine”. He would have threesomes or even orgy’s and was a serial cheater; literally sometimes cheating on 3 or more people at a time. 

He developed an immense cocaine habit which, and in his own words, “lead to blacking out for days or weeks at a time”, even he self admitted that he didn’t remember writing an entire album because he was so high. 

His sanity began to slip. He became an advocate for fascism and developed a fixation on “hitler’s narcism”.

Doesn’t mean they’re all horrible dogs, doesn’t mean an owner who is responsible and knows what they’re doing can’t keep one under control, but to say they aren’t aggressive is simply ignorant and factually incorrect. You can see in every video of a pit attack, they aren’t angry, they aren’t scared, or defending themselves, they’re wagging happily and excited. They’re doing what they were bred to do.

All this nonsense with calling them “pibbles”, or “nanny dogs”, or “velvet hippos” is dangerous, because it encourages people who can’t handle a dog like that to get one, thinking they’re just poor and misunderstood, and that people are just “racist” against the breed. It’s irresponsible to misrepresent the breed that way.

I don’t think they should be banned necessarily, but they should be controlled and only responsible, experienced owners should be allowed to have them. The breed standards should also be changed, breed out the aggression and high prey drive, the bite strength, the tenacity, and the love of fighting.

2) the most abusive cases of what? People using the accommodations they've been granted by the office? Students being abusive towards their professors? Going to need a bit more context here.

&amp;#x200B;

Sokka gets shit for being a sexist pretty consistently in the fandom, and rightfully so I suppose, as he was sexist. But Sokka was 1. a literal child when he expressed those views, 2. he naturally grew out of this ignorant mindset as he learned more and met more people and realized his generalizations were not right. 3. he was literally the only ""man"" in his village for the entirety of his formative years- from childhood to \~16. Lastly 4. he saw his ignorance for what it was, apologized and learned his lesson. He lost his mother and then his father as a small boy and all the men left because it was their gender role- hard to not have some hardwired gender generalizations when those gender roles stole your dad. To accept that these roles are not universal and often fairly arbitrary is to have to admit his father leaving was not a 100% necessity, and yet he still does eventually learn! I think expecting him to have a developed sense of gender relations in such a bizarre circumstance is pretty unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

And more importantly, I have no idea why Sokka's sexism at the beginning of the show is constantly brought up, but Master Pakku is framed as a good guy. He was old as hell and had decades of life experience to draw on in order to not be ignorant, and yet he does something more sexist than Sokka literally ever does in refusing to teach a woman to bend, even throwing a hissy fit at the /literal Avatar/ for having the gall to teach his friend things. He cared more about being sexist than literally the fate of his tribe and the world. Psycho shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, he realizes he wanted to bang Katara's grandma, and this is \*literally the only reason\* he relents on his sexism. He has no other arc where he learns he was ignorant and IIRC didn't apologize either (yet Sokka did). Then grandma takes him back? and Katara is giddy about it? And it is never mentioned again that pussy is the only reason he stopped being a sexist, and not the looming genocide of his people or seeing Katara's power and realizing he was wrong, as happened with Sokka.

"hphoxyr","So to recap because you deleted your comments and are passive-aggressively apologizing: you blamed women for men not knowing sex ed, then you doubled down on blaming women because the education system is incompetent and men are also apparently (???) Incapable of learning themselves, and claimed with no proof (?) that 9/10 women don't educate men on what they've done wrong, *on a thread where a woman is doing JUST THAT*. 

And apparently saying that it's not the woman's fault if a man is ignorant and belligerent about it makes me naive? A bad partner? Wtf? Lol

I'm 30+ with a partner of over five years. There were things he didn't know, because his previous partner didn't communicate well. And he was honest, asked for advice, and he got answers - some of which was me sending him articles by female sex educators.

"hph3vnh","The scientific evidence for lucid dreams, and research on OBE's. The scientific evidence demonstrating the validity of lucid dreaming is presented - if you choose to ignore it, or if you fail to understand it - that's really not my problem, that's you. It simply displays willful ignorance or scientific illiteracy on your part. Do you even know what lucid dreaming is by the way? It is simply becoming aware that you're dreaming, while dreaming. It existed long, long before it was scientifically confirmed, and I've experienced it many times myself. Lucid dreams have been scientifically recognised since the 1970's, their existence demonstrated in numerous independent studies. So my choice is to either be informed by the weight of scientific evidence supporting their existence...or your opinion, with the evidence this is based being ""Dude - trust me"". Now call me crazy, but I think I'm going to go with the scientific evidence thanks.

I'll say it again, because it doesn't seem to be getting through your thick skull: the OBE is indeed a scientifically recognised phenomenon. It is the *mechanisms that underpin them* that are scientifically debated, not that the experience itself occurs. You seem to keep suggesting that because you doubt people physically leave their body (which I do too by the way), that it somehow invalidates the subjective experience...which it doesn't. I don't tell lies, and don't like people who do. I have a PhD in ecological science and have published numerous scientific papers on a range of topics, and I'm also a psychedelic research collaborator. You don't have to believe me...I honestly don't care. But that's the truth. I just shared a selection of research studies that demonstrate that the OBE is a valid, scientifically researched phenomenon. Who said anything about the OBE being paranormal or supernatural? You keep trying to make ontological inferences about this experience, which I haven't done at all. Also ""proving"" the experience in what context? That the experience occurs is beyond doubt, it's not a mere anecdotal experience (just because it's subjective), as all the research studies clearly demonstrate - it's the mechanism behind that remains unproven. But they're different things, and you seem to keep conflating one with the other. Important to judge the experience not purely on its roots, but on its roots, and how and why it psychologically impacts people deeply, which it often does. My first spontaneous very brief OBE occurred while I was stoned...so what?? I've experienced it numerous occasions while stone cold sober. I don't see why that would invalidate the experience. And no I'm not a liar, as I've said before, I've had this experience on multiple occasions, as brief as the experiences were, they were very vivid and distinct from any dream or lucid dream experience - if you've not experienced it yourself, why would you have anything of value to share on this subject? It's akin to talking to someone blind from birth about the colours of a rainbow.

"hpgz7ok","There is sitting back with a sullen face and hearing the other talk and there's actually listening. I was asking which one OP believes she does. 

For example when he says something she believes is ignorant and absurd does she mentally roll her eyes and just think he's a moron or does she ask calmly, without accusing, why he thinks such and such. If his reasoning is feeling based she can isolate the part of the topic that is causing said feeling and ask him to dig deeper about why he has such feelings about it? This is listening and really getting to know someone.

The other way you just shallowly learn what they think they know, believe, or feel in the conversational way they are willing to talk about to anybody else. Like what he is saying to OP is likely the same response to he'd give to anyone because it is his current view as he knows how to express it and they are like a script he'd repeat to anyone else who'd ask the same questions and not ACTIVELY listen. 

She says she wants to understand him and know if he really has the intolerable to her views or if it is an issue she can discuss at length with him and come to a better understanding. But the way she conveyed it is that she just sits back let's him talk and gets emotional and this leads him to want to avoid such topics altogether as he does not like the way she is getting all heavily emotional over said topics in a way he can't understand. Probably because she's also not good at expressing herself and getting overly sensitive about the subject while trying to talk about it makes it worse.

OP expressed herself she doesn't know how to have such discussions and he stops wanting to talk to her about them because she does so in a way that brings his mood down. Also if she is not actively listening, then he probably isn't really feeling heard and just repeats himself until he's sick of talking about it. 

They are both young, and probably are a typical of their genders in her wanting to sympathiser and be emotionally invested in said topics while the guy just wants to quickly fix the problem. This is what leads guys to think girls are emotionally irrational and girls to think guys are callously ignorant. Neither feels heard, it becomes an argument almost, and she seems to shut herself out of the conversation and let him talk, which is why 'mansplaining' became a term in the first place. 

As women are generally more passive, and don't know how to express their opinion without getting emotional and combative. And guys when they feel attacked to any degree are quick to get defensive and rise to the fight. It is the most common pattern of an argument starting to what should otherwise be normal discussions.

If she really listens she could find out that the reason he feels people in bad situations can always ""just fight back"" comes from an abusive childhood of his from the school bullies who were picking on him and kids of his ethnicity and fighting back fixed the problem. Or it could be based on something else he was told growing up that is one of his foundational truths and he doesn't know how to view the topic at hand in any other way that doesn't compromise his internalized truth and he sure as hell ain't going to upend said truth over a history discussion he doesn't much care for and would rather drop the topic all together.

"hpgyovr","Friend, let me put this on the table. This is a fighting game. If you have some experience with fighting games like Mortal Kombat, Guilty Gear, Street Fighter and so on you will understand that some of these complaints lack base:

&gt;Highlander: the CCU changed him into a mean machine but they ruined everything

Highpander has always been garbage and he is not any less or more garbage after the CCU

&gt;Shugoki: So this is a bit of a toss up for players but after his rewrote he lost his best mixups for just a bash? Bashes are not the be all end all and it sucks that they did that for what? So noobs can pick up the controller and just hold it to play? They made him way easier to play and it’s like fighting a brick wall unless you know what to do to a tea and have a busted mixup or have a hyper armor or a side dodge like kensei

Shugoki never had anything, he gained a LOT from the reworks and by far one of the best examples of what a basic moveset paired with a bash can do to a character. Look at Warlord, he is basically bad Shugoki.
Learn the moveset, predict the next attack, right reads win the matches. This is the core of any fighting game out there.

&gt;Orochi: Orochi’s rework made him good, but again they gave a character a bash too? Not to mention it was feint able for the longest time making him busted with his undodgeable kit making him one of the best characters in the game for more then 3 months! 

Orochi was never the best character, high A tier at best with Shaman either ahead or super close depending on the matchup. His kit is fine, the only problem was the FDL being undogeable which was kinda stupid. His dodge recovery gave him so much more depth but the community is so ignorant and loud on how to balance the game that shit shows like this nerf and Gryphon's killed the flow of the entire character.

And yes, a bash, all other fighting games utilize pretty much the same mechanics for 70% of the rosters but they make it LOOK different and For Honor is no different. Every character needs a bash and if not, reliable unblockables and/or soft-feints

&gt;Few to mention: Raider rework made him basically unstoppable, his stamina was absolutely broken among other things you have experienced fs so I don’t need to explain.

Only his damage was broken, the rest was fine. His kit is basically Peacekeeper but big axe. The only thing differentiating them is how bad PK is in 4v4s but she is one of the best duelists.

&gt;Why talk about this? It’s because the devs are basically running the characters to 1000% and change them from who take skill and precision to use

This is straight up misinformation. The reworks are more on par with what other fighting games do to balance their characters. Offensive Prediction Based Meta IS THE ONLY WAY A FIGHTING GAME CAN PROGRESS.

As a final thought: This is dumb, you are not looking at facts and proper game balance, you are just commenting on how you FEEL about the heroes when it seems like you have never played a proper fighting game before. Now that the devs are turning For Honor into a proper fighting game and you're feeling how overwhelming it can get when you play against a high skilled player that understands the mechanics, you criticize it without understanding the bigger picture.

""But Mortal Kombat is a side-scroller and For Honor is 3D"" - Outside of gank scenarios, every competitive fighting game carries the same principles. Offensive Prediction Based Meta ALWAYS.

Look at Shaolin for example, HOW DO YOU OPEN A GOOD PLAYER? His only openers are basic lights and heavies WHICH ARE REACTABLE and you will get paired and blocked. He is the worst hero in the game and needs a complete rework while maintaining his gimmicks

Oh, and you're complaining about how easy it is to pick up a hero and just play them. That's how other fighting games works as well, all you need to do is put 2 and 2 together and learn what buttons to press, it isn't rocket science",1640119862,"his dodge recovery gave him so much more depth but the community is so ignorant and loud on how to balance the game that shit shows like this nerf and gryphon's killed the flow of the entire character.","ignorant and loud","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so ignorant and loud","loud","so",NA,1

"hpgdq65","&gt; A hormone banned in Canada. How is that fair to our businesses in Canada. And a hormone health Canada bans should be allowed into our country? Is that what you are saying.

Supply management has nothing to do with Health Canada regulations. We could get rid of supply management, have free trade in dairy with the US, and still not allow the hormone milk in if we didn’t want it.

&gt; By the way the non hormone milk is the same price as ours.

Wrong. The US milk price is subsidized and actually lower than what the market price would be. In Canada, tariffs, import restrictions, and dairy quotas all combine to send the price of milk way above what the market price would be. These are ceteris paribus effects.

&gt; If supply management was gone, a small town area with 40 local dairy farmers would be replaced with 1 or 2 corporations making their own milk. 

Great. That way economies of scale would be maximized and the price could be lowered even further.

&gt; Do you realize how many businesses would be out of business?

If you can’t compete, out you go. That’s how a market works.

&gt; What you would end up with in the long run is just way more poor people and a few more richer giant companies.

No, Canada would get richer as a whole. While a few uncompetitive dairy farmers would indeed have to change sectors, the fact that poor Canadian consumers would no longer be subject to a regressive price hike that doubles dairy prices would be a great boon to them. And remember, it is only because those uncompetitive dairy farmers were able to profiteer off their countrymen’s impoverishment that they were able to stay in business to begin with.

"hpgbpqt","&gt;I'm explaining that very thing to you: racism is a serious problem based around bigotry and discrimination. It is often systematic, and when systematic disempowers people. 

I strongly agree with you.

&gt;Secondly, nothing here impacts you in the way that racism and bigotry impact victims of racism and bigotry. Comparing the two through analogy shows a naivety.

[1][3]Yes it does. You say this as if atheists are not also a mistreated minority. You say this as if I haven't personally experienced mistreatment because of atheism. Maybe nothing here impacts you, but not everyone is so fortunate. Not only am I am atheist, but I belong to the LGBTQ+ community. That's why your dismissal is so frustrating, because not only does it impact me but I have a point of comparison belonging to another minority group with a history of mistreatment. Would you react with the same hostility if I was criticizing a comment about ""online queers""?

Also not everything has to be a lynch mob. Somebody making destructive comments about the stereotypical mannerisms of a particular ethnicity isn't ending in direct physical violence, but that's still racism. It's not a the oppression olympics; intersectionality is a thing.

&gt;This isn't dismissive terminology. It's a shorthand description. I've not seen it replace discussion, or be used to try to shut someone up. In fact, when I see it I see it with people trying to explain why they dislike the position, and I've seen people use to refer to themselves. It's peculiar that you think it is dismissive, or that I am using it dismissively, since I routinely engage.

[2]If that's really the case, then you should have no issue granting a polite request to use a different term. You never answered my question about preferred pronouns. If I asked you to label to me as ""they/them"" would you respect my request? I suspect so. But you are knowingly refusing my requested labeling preference here. **Because disrespect is the point for you.**

&gt;Then you're selective about what you respond to: I care about one thing here: your ignorant and harmful analogy. The rest is fonder. I have said why I find it problematic, and what the purpose of my comment was. Despite this, you asked ""why did you bring up your dislike of them?"" This doesn't address the criticism.

It hard to take your accusation of selective responses seriously after you choose not to answer many of my questions.

&gt;But also, I haven't brought up disliking anyone. I wrote:

&gt;*The reasons people dislike ""lacktheism""*

This is the reason the reason people think you're incredibly disengenuous. See, I never brought up that **I** think you're disenguous so you can't hold it against me?

&gt;I'm happy to call you a complementalist. But I'm happy to all other people lacktheists, and I'm happy to call people ""proponents of the psychological account."" Why would you ever believe otherwise?

Because you have repeated demonstrated the contrary. I made a request for you to use the term complementalist before and you ignored it. That was weeks ago so it is entirely understandable you would forget, but then I remind you here and you still refuse to do so.

&gt;You haven't defended the analogy between racism and ""online atheism""/""lacktheism"".

"hpg5rne","&gt;Actually since this sub will now become a hate relationship with lol, it is a VERY VERY big topic among the lol community because many people comment that when they make new account to play with their friend or when they watch them play, they see them getting totally demoralised being destroyed and having no positive feedback/input because their opponents are smurf or the matchmaking thing them being lvl 30 mean they should fight people level 230...

Hate relationship with LoL, I see it just as a jaded sense of loss and inability to cope (actual cope, not the meme). Like, oh, MY cool video game universe is being tainted by this BAD video game. Which got old about seven years ago, but here we are, since fg genre is kinda behind the times. Of course, a lot of that can be simply countered with prompting people to look in the mirror proverbially, with their game or genre of choice - or just by pointing out they are either exaggerating or not knowing what they're talking about or misrepresenting arguments (""I was diamond in lol easily, it's an easy game"" - ok, dude, you might be very gifted, is all).

Smurfing is a really big problem across the board, even in puny fg's, or more accurately, those that have enough players to make smurfing feasible.

It remains to be seen will they handle it in Project L. On one hand, more accounts - more money and all that jazz, on the other hand, people leave if the ecosystem is completely bonkers.

&gt;Many fighting game players pretend that casual are shit and bad and satan but honestly if you can't even have fun being trash playin with other trash, what is the point?

I will now be snarky, because many fighting game players for some reason are more insular than a 90 year old Okinawan fisherman. Things I've heard from fighting game players were sometimes completely insane, ignorant and weird. Of course, hashtag not all, however, I am talking about tendencies. I have noticed this with several groups, but not with majority. For example, you can observe a phenomenon of a ""Blizzard player"", who, surprisingly, since Blizzard made different games and was a really in-the-limelight company, sports the same insularity. 

But, majority of players (not talking about people who at some point in time might have played a video game, but regular ""hobbyists"") play all genres and have some basic, osmotic understanding of prominent titles in various genres, game design elements they can expect from respective genres and have played at least like three games from the genre they never play. On top of that, they possess some very basic general knowledge, ie install windows or put in ssd or whatever or this mouse is better than this other one because these numbers. I am not even talking about someone tech-savvy, I am talking about common stuff that is around you.

Then you see upper echelon of fgc being completely oblivious to bunch of these things. Again, not all. And deflection to that observation has been completely bizarre - for example, ""they're boomers, how would they know"". That's the argument for the opposite side lol. I couldn't google stuff in the nineties. I had to do interventions that are more complex than now (installing windows 3.11 or whatever, as well as collecting info about installing it vs installing windows 10), I had to deal with cracks, emulators, ms dos, disk space... I had to buy physical magazines and read articles in order to see what games came out etc. Even the adjacent factors go in favor of ""boomers"" knowing stuff. Because we aren't talking about boomers who never touched an electronic device, we are talking about a subset of them who basically pioneered ""gaming"". How the fuck can the argument go in the opposite direction? Try organizing a quake lan tournament in '99 - or a fg event, for that matter. Easier to do with fg event, but not as easy as installing strive on steam and just playing it.

However, you constantly see some blunders from those players when it comes to basic understanding of some highly popular genre or device. Not that it makes them ""lesser"", of course, but it's indicative of this insularity.

From this can stem a lot of repeated beliefs, misconceptions etc. The elusive casual often being one. The way I see some people on kappa imagine casual players, I don't know if Escher could draw those casual beasts. I have never met a casual, if we believe descriptions from kappa. That is very strange, since I met a lot of people who play games, casually or ""hardcore"". Like, hundreds. And I have yet to meet that casual kappa is talking about. I am not memeing or misunderstanding sarcasm or exaggeration when people describe casuals, I take all that into consideration, I'm not dumb. Yet, 30+ years of playing games and meeting people and talking about games etc. and not a single kappa verified casual.

And this isn't a kappa exclusive, just to be fair. You find this anywhere, like, if you go to apex subreddit, you'll find it there. However, it won't be a concentrated majority like here. But it does exist. I still remember  someone saying, I think on youtube, about Overwatch, how a mid-gm player doesn't know BASICS of the game. So, not ""mid-gm player isn't good enough to go pro"" or ""compared to top500, mid-gm is significantly worse"", nope. Doesn't know basics. Not even understand basics, but doesn't yet know them. ""basics of the game"" isn't a relative statement. So, yeah, you'll see that completely perverted notion of what is casual and what isn't and how far each of them go, everywhere. But on kappa it's a specialty. As well as on ""fgc twitter"", let's be fair.

&gt;tho I think I really suck

This is almost always relative and you have fallen into the trap yourself. What does that even mean? It means you suck compared to someone who doesn't suck. But, those points are completely arbitrary. I played basketball money matches ""in the hood"" and was considered godlike by the kids, ""very good"" by the city street players etc, but what do you think happens if you put me against a professional player? We can even go further and pick that professional from some underdeveloped league and it's still no contest. Do I suck at basketball or am I ok or am I godlike?

&gt;I still think that if you fucking force player to do a 632146 to do a super when the 63214 input is available, it is dumb and that we got too used to random input motion being used when there is a lot of command move who can be use with 236/214 + 3/4 button.

Inputs have a balance role as well. So, the first input takes more time and it might be that exactly that aspect was the goal.

Or, the first input requires you to sacrifice blocking twice, instead of only once with the second input.

a dp has you going forward. so, if you want to anti air like a chad, you have to ""earn it"", by risking those moments, because you forego blocking even if you attempt a dp and it doesn't come out. That's not the case with regular anti air button, which allows you to block for the entirety of the time before you press that button. But rewards for dp might be greater, like greater damage and positioning and knockdown and better hitbox/invuln etc.

Perhaps the input you are talking about is made as such just because, but in many cases, that's not the case and there's a deliberate balancing design behind it.",1640108442,"things i've heard from fighting game players were sometimes completely insane, ignorant and weird.","ignorant and weird","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ignorant and weird","weird",NA,NA,1

Do you understand what pronouns are? Because you seem as

illiterate and dumb as you are ignorant and queerphobic. Pronouns

are ""HE decided to wash HIS clothes"" or ""SHE like to do makeup in

HER house"". If someone doesn't use pronouns everyday they just

don't talk as it's nearly impossible to not use them.

IT and THEY are pronouns. You literally used pronouns trying to say

that you don't use them. A single google search would reveal that

you're just making stuff up.

It's a supposed first world superpower where the middle class is on its way to extinction, and millions of people are below the poverty line, with starving children and no universal healthcare. Also, with the existing system, not only is it required for you to be set up for success, but there is a hard limit on the percentage of the population that could achieve it, since the system is built upon exploitation/theft of the masses.

"hpfyg4k","Oh my, your situation sounds unbearable! I almost froze my eggs when I lived down in LA but didn't because I had no idea where I would be in 5 or 10 years. This sounds like such a headache and a I really feel for you. Hugs.

I took a screenshot of the search results from my insurance web portal which shows 0 providers taking new patients anywhere within my network. I'm so tired of my doctors telling me to call ""the big list of doctors I should get if I just search online"" 🙄 I was actually discharged from my women's clinic yesterday. The same one I've been going to for the last 10 years... because I requested sedation. They said my request was a sign that the doctor patient relationship was lacking trust and was ultimately broken. Just....WHAT? I honestly think they are just trying to cull their patient loads. And doing so in what feels like pretty unethical ways but I digress.

Regardless, I'm letting myself feel it when the waves of distress wash over me. It's worse when I try to suppress the sadness. Partner is helpful and understands I need to do this in order to get on with my days. Thankful for that!

The population here has increased so much and everyone is competing for what feels like the same number of providers, maybe even fewer with retirements and such, that have been here for the last 15 years.  

I am contacting clinics out of state at this point (ready to look into international 'healthcare tourism' options). I got my initial surgery referral from ORM and have ironically been referred back to them for additional workups for both my partner (just in case) and me. I can't believe I've already been on this journey for almost a year and I still can't see the horizon :( 

My labs have thus far always indicated I ""have the fertility of a teenager"" (still not sure how I feel about that wording, docs!) and all of the women in my family didn't start menopause until their 50s and many had cases of the ""oops"" well into their 40s. My maternal grandmother complained of hot flashes into her 80s and my mom's older sisters are in their 70s opening windows in the middle of winter lol. The more I learn about all of this the less I realize I actually know, so who knows, maybe these are signs of something else.

I totally understand people wanting to keep their painful stories private but I really wish I had SOMEONE in my family who at least has some empathy. Being told to ""just adopt"" or ""just use a surrogate"" is so ignorant and hurtful. I know these comments come from a place of love, they don't know what else to say, but I'm just like ..  .""have you ever heard of Google"" because I guess I'm just super selfish for pursuing the only real options available to me. Adoption is super restrictive, expensive and also takes forever. Surrogacy?! Are you kidding me. 

This is such a lonely and isolating road to travel even with a supportive partner.

Which is fine, if you get there with a person who wants that too. But she’s stubborn and manipulative and will do anything to get her way.

Of course these are all things you don’t know about a person you have a sex only relationship with a handful of times. Like we never even talked on the phone or had many conversations. Like after a few times I realized that she was very ignorant in the lacking intelligence sense and that’s why I never pursued more with her. I met somebody more my type around the same time and began dating her instead. I cut things off with kids mom, amicably as there was no relationship to agonize over. I think she knew that’s what was happening and tried to trap me, but by the time she knew she was pregnant I had moved on. She did tell me she was pregnant. I asked her if she thought it was mine and she said no it was someone else’s. She admitted to lying to me in court. I think she was trying to pass it off as the other guy’s who was actually interested in a relationship but after my son was born it was obviously not his (guy was white). The next 2 years she hid him from me while she tried to date other men looking for that husband but I think her parents made her track me down. I was in college. I asked for a DNA test but she refused for a few months instead opting to contact my family and girlfriend.

Aggressively turning away from an empty sight, downing the light from the shadows, there stood an imposing man, covered in red, black and adorned in heavy jewelry. His shadow stretched eons,  covering up to shoulders an elderly figure struck at the gold arch. Finally, silence.   
    
Mind emptied, finger faded into pale shade as his fingernails tore into his palms, yet silence was there when words needed to break it. Baby blue eyes of elderly man framed by his shadow stood wide and panicked. Order was given, and after years of wars and turbulence finally peace was achieved. So many blood, steel, carbon and bones were sacrificed only to be met with this moment, to this consolidation to ensure future eons of peace.

Shame, agony, rage and anger boiled trough his veins pulsing together with thunder. This wedding would bring peace, would conjoin the people and government, will do so much good, yet it feels so wrong. A pair of blue eyes stared back at him, with focus and determination. Unable to remain imposing due to sympathy for the old man, who only tried to do what is right, figure stepped away - taking his burdening shadow with him.   
    
\- ""Well..."" - baby blue eyes sparkled - ""go get my stupid son then.""   


A figure now in light, covered by royal colors with an familiar blue eyes laughing with the corners stood alone and directed. It pierced trough the vail of silence as a fresh hot knife, as king showed himself. Smiling, reminiscing about two dumb kids who used to chase each other over court yard.

We can agree and disagree on things but i cross the line at statistically supported facts that are often denied by people in intentional and unintentional attempts to promote and uphold the blatant and utterly deadly misogyny that takes place in our society, so unless you are living in some fairy happy-go-lucky utopia world then you need to do some serious research and reconsidering. 

In case i wasnt clear enough, ill dumb it down for you: society does not prioritize womens’ health. Women are (in America, at least) denied abortion rights and consequently the rights to their own body, similarly in many cases of sexual assault they are denied validation that what they went through was traumatic and awful which is extremely detrimental to mental health (which they are often denied access to in the first place). Society does not prioritize womens’ safety. Women fear walking alone in public (for gods sake, being in public in general) for they understand the likely possibility that they will be catcalled, kidnapped, groped, sexually assaulted, raped … Any of these can happen to men, too, but statistical studies have proven that women are far more in danger of these occurences than men. Society does not prioritize womens’ comfort. The collective guilt and shame that women feel for nothing other than existing in their bodies and having female or female-presenting sex organs as a result from seemingly endless catcalling, sexualization, online sexual harrassment or feelings of pressure into having their bodies exploited and more is something that no one should have to put up with, but women experience it nonetheless, and far more than men mind you.

""19 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 20 Above all , you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. 21 For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. "" 2 Peter 1

""15 Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 16 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. "" 2 Peter 3

&gt;Not really especially when those disagreements are based in ignorance

And you argue that that comparing gender dysphoria to other mental illnessess is silly? 

So what are they ignorant about? And what is so silly?

It would have to be about the conception of gender and gender identity. Because that is where we have had all of the arguments about. How people view gender.

And ignorance implies an intentional willingness to avoid new information and facts — but when I asked you to produce any evidence of gender the best source you gave was nearly old enough to vote and locked behind a paywall.

That is not an open source and definitely not widely available. To call those people ignorant when the best info isnt even available sounds asinine.

You would have to assume that these people dont need to see hard evidence and just need to understand and accept that internal gender identity is a real thing and that is seperate from sex.

You never said that directly, but by calling these people ignorant and silly for not immediately believing in a brand new science that does not have any physical evidence or biological evidence to support said science is really unfair.

And as for the second part, many people have beliefs that people born with penises are men and people born with vaginas are women, to accept transgender identities is to upheave many peoples societal views.

[Here's another](https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/social-science/law/crime/gulag) 

&gt;The Gulag scheme was adapted into the infamous concentration camp system used during World War II

[And another](https://thetogetherplan.com/holocaust-in-the-soviet-union/)

&gt;But the concentration camps are not where most of the victims of National Socialism and Stalinism died. These misunderstandings regarding the sites and methods of mass killings prevent us from perceiving the horror of the twentieth century.

[Scholarly article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/151474)

&gt;How reliable are the available estimates of forced concentration camp labour in the Soviet Union?

[Encyclopedia](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/crime-and-law-enforcement/gulag)

&gt;An acronym for the Soviet bureaucratic institution, Glavnoe Upravlenie ispravitelnotrudovykh LAGerei (Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps), tasked with oversight of the Soviet forced-labor concentration camp and internal exile system

[So many sources](https://gulaghistory.org/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/)

&gt;Concentration camps were created in the Soviet Union shortly after the 1917 revolution, but the system grew to tremendous proportions during the course of Stalin’s campaign to turn the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power and to collectivize agriculture in the early 1930s.

Here is reference to what I was talking about with the forced farm labor or go to concentration camps for the forced farm labor. In the 30's, according to our histories, the Saami were forced to either give up their nomadic life to become farmers or go to concentration camps. 

[Here we have Gulag used for concentration camp in North Korea](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korean-gulags-terrible-or-even-worse-nazi-camps-auschwitz-n828751)

&gt;Satellite imagery shows the Sinuiju concentration camp (Kyo-hwa-so No. 3) — a reeducation camp in North Korea, on Oct. 29, 2016.

I don't know how you can still argue this is not true. 

&gt;The only thing the USSR did that you might disagree with is collectivize agriculture and raindeer husbandry.

There were 3 unique Saami cultures in the Kola peninsula, with at least three languages. Those languages are dead, those cultures are dead. Dead to concentration camps, dead to forced labor. 

You self admittedly know nothing about the Saami and now you are *telling me a Saami* my history?

&gt;And during and leading to WWII, it was the Norwegians who were aligned with the NAZIs who tried to genocide the Saami people.

Saami have been the target of genocide for over 500 years. There have been **two attempted complete genocides** in the last 4000 years. In the last 100 years there have been 120k+ Saami sterilized between Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia. 

&gt;I'm going to need some real sources that 20K Saami people were sterilized by the USSR, because even the most anti-communist propagandists don't claim that.

No. You insult me and ask me to educate you. Educate yourself. Go buy the books of the histories, don't read the propaganda on the internet. If you want to look at that propaganda there's some pretty ridiculous racist stuff like saying we bite off reindeer testicles. It's pretty fun.

I doubt you will but as an olive branch I can give you books to read - primary sources from the Saami ourselves. 

&gt;I know you don't care if I think you're lying because you're a disgusting propagandist and NAZI apologist, who is trying to pin the war crimes of the SS on the Soviets.

The Saami were in the Nazi concentration camps. I don't know how much you know about WW2 history, but here's some free education. There is this idea that 5 million Jewish people were killed and 6 million others. Well, that second number was made up on the spot when someone needed a number to compare the Jewish dead too. 

According to Jewish historians in the last couple of decades it looks more like 5 million Jews and 30 million other ethnicities.

You're seriously barking up the wrong tree there. 

&gt;You're probably a holocaust denier too

The Saami were in the Nazi concentration camps. When the Nazi's fled into Norway they destroyed a massive amount of Saami cultural infrastructure. 

This is like telling a Jewish person they deny the holocaust because they have information you simply **don't want to accept.**

&gt;who is trying to pin the war crimes of the SS on the Soviets

In your world, did the Soviets not commit war crimes? Did they not commit atrocities? 

The Nazi's targeted us. The Soviets targeted us. The Norwegian government, the Swedish government, the Finnish government - they all targeted us. The catholic church stole our spirituality from us. 

The Swedes had an exhibit in their national museum dedicated to Saami genetic inferiority using actual Saami bodies.

&gt; I’m sorry, but I don’t work out 5 times a week, eat right and keep my presentation on point to date some fat, lazy loser simply because I’m not tall. Fuck that.

When did I say you had to date some fat, lazy loser?

It's also probably important I mention that presentation isn't the only thing the matters in a relationship. Someone can appear to be put together and of high value, but beneath all the superficial and physical attributes, can lie an abusive, entitled, ignorant, and just overall mean-spirited person. 

While working on your physical health and appearance are important, no amount of exercise and healthy eating will make up for the fact that someone is boring, ignorant, and unpleasant.

&gt;As a short guy, it’s been made abundantly clear to me that I’m expected to settle across all aspects to have a partner.

Short men aren't unattractive. Short men with an obvious complex though, are a turn off. If you're short, just own it, and the right person won't be bothered by it at all. I know short guys who are in relationships in which they certainly didn't settle.

That said, I'm curious though, would **you** be willing to date a woman who (for example) is tall, has a lot of body hair, thin lips, a big nose, small breasts, or broad shoulders? You clearly view being short as a negative on your SMV. So as a short man, are you willing to make that 'compromise' and date within your own league, or is it only okay for you to have physical preferences?

&gt;How can you not have contempt for such people? And if that drives them away, great. Who the fuck wants them anywhere near you anyway?

Sure, have contempt for bad people. Not sure where I said you had to out to put up with shitty people. To assume though that they're representative of all women (or all men) is nonsensical. I know women who've been used, cheated on and assaulted by men. Should they therefore hold all men in contempt? Of course not.

&gt;The main problem in dating is women bring fuck all to the table but a body that will be used up and worthless by the age of thirty.

Ah, and this is why you seem to be having problems. You view women as deprecating assets who exist to serve you. What do you bring to table? Besides a bad attitude. I've already said it, but why would any woman chose a man who views women this way over a man who treats them with love and respect? Why would any self respecting woman settle for man who will view her as ""used up and worthless"" by the age of thirty?

"hpcfml0","&gt;I have read most of those studies

I don't believe you.

&gt;Many of the studies left out many important variables like previous crimes committed

Variables that would be impossible to measure when cops let off white people with a warning and bring in minorities for misdemeanors. If the records are not kept accurately in the first place then you use what data you have access to.

Less complete data does not mean useless data. It just means it's pointing in a direction that deserves more study.

&gt; Among STEM scientists, sociology is not regarded as particularly robust, and that is putting it kindly. 

STEM scientists are progressively up their own ass about everything the further up the chain you go. Mathematicians think physics is watered down, physicists think chem is watered down, chem thinks biology is watered down. I've met chemists who don't believe biology is science and psychology might as well be fairy tales. They're stupid as fuck and so is your dogshit appeal to authority argument.

&gt;Furthermore, read what I said again. I was talking about minimum sentencing. Minimums are created through law, a judge has no discretion in that. So, to suggest that a judge somehow got around the law for white people is just an incredibly ignorant and stupid take.

If you'd like to frame this as Texas just not giving a fuck about lives in general I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with you. But laws in this country have what would look like highly variable minimum sentencing laws by state on the surface while they look highly congruent if you use different parameters to measure them. Race is one of them. Class is another.

Mandatory minimums are different across what crimes white people are considered to commit more often than other minorities, *especially* drug offenses. Cocaine, viewed as a ""white person's"" drug, has much lighter minimum penalties than crack, a ""black person's"" drug.

https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/crack-vrs-powder-cocaine-one-drug-two-penalties.htm

This shit is widely known. It's not a secret, not only do different states place different values on crime based on race, they change their sentencing depending on class. Eric Couch, subject of the OP, is a particularly famous case of affluenza, and if you'd like me to not divide this down racial lines I can divide it by class lines. Eric Miller, who committed actually a less severe version of Couch's crime (only 1 dead while Couch killed 4) and was sentenced by the SAME JUDGE was given 20 years for his manslaughter DUI.

The decision to even give minimum sentencing was made by an inherently biased judge. It would be not only naive but laughably absurd to believe his only bias was class related, or that no other judges hold these biases. Judges are not gods, they are not machines, they are not impartial despite what their profession would have you believe. They are flawed humans.

Your denial and argumentative fallacies do not change that, and neither does your incessant and baseless accusations that I'm uneducated and ignorant.

I (27 Female) and my husband (29 Male) have been married for almost five years now. Even when we were dating, we always agreed to spend every other holiday with each others’ families so that we can spend the holidays together but spend equal amounts of time with both our families. If we spend Thanksgiving with my family, we would be with his family for Christmas. And then next year, we’d make sure we were with his family for Thanksgiving and my family for Christmas. We both get along with each others’ families, my family loves him and his family loves me. However, it’s been quite a while since I’ve been able to see my family. 

When my husband and I got married, we moved to a neighborhood where all of his family was, and my family is almost 3 hours away. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, my family was super huge on staying home and social distancing, so I didn’t see them for that entire year because they understandably felt uncomfortable. This is especially because I have elderly grandparents and a cousin who is immunocompromised. My husband’s family was in our town and didn’t care much about the ongoing pandemic, so we saw them as much as we used to since they were comfortable visiting us. When 2021 came around and the vaccine began being distributed, my family jumped on the opportunity and everyone got their vaccine including me. When having the conversation with my husband about getting vaccinated, he was completely ignorant and rude to me. He believes all the BS statistics he sees on Facebook and listened to the conspiracy theories about microchips and magnets and whatnot that the rest of his anti-vax family were ranting on about. The argument ended with me in tears, but I realized that nothing would change his mind, so I stopped pestering him about it. When I told my family this, they told me they were uncomfortable with seeing us since he could be infected and possibly get my immunocompromised cousin sick or get my brother’s kids sick due to them being too young to get the vaccine. I’ve had many conversations about this with my mother begging her to let us visit, and she agreed to let us come over this Christmas. 

Even though my husband and I have been fine throughout this whole pandemic, he suddenly caught COVID last week from one of his friends and gave it to me as well, though I am symptomless and he is near hospitalization. Now my family understandably doesn’t want me or him coming over for Christmas. I told my husband that if he wasn’t ignorant and just got the vaccine that this whole situation could have been avoided and I could’ve seen my family for the first time in two years. He apologized and said he’d get his vaccine when he could, but that I’m the asshole for saying that we’ll be with my family for every holiday next year and not with his. It’s not like he doesn’t see his family outside of holidays, because his parents visit us frequently, only live minutes away, and eat lunch with us every Saturday. Am I the asshole?

They could turn in well researched papers, but if they don't come to the exact same conclusion as the professor, they get an F.

"hpc6nhr","As much as we critique and downplay ourselves (jokingly or seriously so), there's a lot of people on the outside who see South Africa as the ""Gateway to Africa"".

 It's the corrupt, greedy, self-defeating, ignorant and foolish actions we see our political, administrative, judicial and even corporate/business leaders do that keeps us back from really stepping up to that title.

* South Africa is still a country rich with so many resources that if utilised correctly will push us really far;

"hpbyks5","from an article posted in Yale review:

""Kerala’s successes are the result of a long history of division and struggle. Up through the 1900s, people in that area were bound by a rigidly inflexible caste system.  Subtleties of dress and speech “ensured that a person’s place in society could be recognized at a glance” (Jeffrey 1992).  These highly visible classifications in turn determined how wealth was distributed and how different social groups interacted.  Higher-caste groups were considered pure; they owned the land or were priests, while lower castes were relegated to the most menial labor and considered contaminated or polluted.  Though this system was in place throughout India, it was both particularly elaborate and exceedingly strict in Kerala.  In the nineteenth century, Indian reformer Swami Vivekananda called the region “a madhouse of caste” (Franke and Chasin 1994).  Chief among the restrictions imposed on the lowest castes were their inability to own land, interact with higher-caste individuals, or enter Hindu temples, but other instances of structural violence against lower-caste Keralites were innumerable and utterly pervasive.  These inequalities were doubly entrenched in tradition and religion in India, making them especially intractable.  However, as described later, education for critical consciousness works to counteract the systemized violence of the caste hierarchy by teaching people to question the system rather than just adapt to it.
  

  
The caste system epitomizes traditional authority, which social theorist Max Weber described as “resting on an established belief in the sanctity of immemorial traditions and the legitimacy of the status of those exercising authority under them” (1964).  Traditional authority differs from bureaucratic, or rational-legal authority in that it is historically derived.  Because of this, policies are determined by custom, or the whims of whoever custom selects to rule.  The utter lack of meritocracy in such a static caste society meant that edicts from the ruling class could only be enforced as long as the tradition on which they were grounded continued to prevail.  As challenges to the traditional system came in the form of the caste liberation movement, they also inspired challenges against the idea of top-down authority at all.  When the caste system finally fell, those who had been most disadvantaged by it had also learned that social and governmental structures were not infallible – that they could be agitated against.
  

  
Education played an important part in Kerala’s tremendous transition from a rigidly caste-divided society into one of India’s most egalitarian states.  Though the region historically had strong literacy rates, it was the early-1900s expansion of the education system into the countryside which paved the way for the mass mobilization and active citizenry which today define Kerala.  However, this early emphasis on vernacular schools (schools which taught in the native language, Malayalam) was actually implemented with much the opposite intention.  A Maharaja of Travancore explained the pro-education policies by saying, “a government which has to deal with an educated population is by far stronger than one which has to control ignorant and disorderly masses.  Hence education is a twice-blessed thing – it benefits those who give it and those who receive it” (Jeffrey 1992).  Though advocating for education, he and other elites believed it would lead to a less barbarous, easier to control populace.  In this case, limited knowledge about the effects of literacy and education, led decision-makers to implement policies with results almost diametrically opposite of what they intended, a phenomenon Robert Merton called “the unanticipated consequences of purposive social action” (1936).  Ironically, the very education reforms structured to make the populace easier to govern would help inform the radical movements which later swept Kerala.  This gap between expectations and results shows most clearly in the selection of Booker T. Washington’s Up from Slavery as a required text.  While educational authorities applauded “Washington’s emphasis on deference and slow, peaceful change,” low-caste Hindus read it as a manual for how to go about challenging their oppressive situation.  In this case, the maharajas were simply unable to fully understand the impact that the texts they selected would make, and because of this they never anticipated the revolutionary seeds their own purportedly placating school system would sow.
  

  
**The school system in Kerala directly challenged the traditions of the past.  It mixed the castes, even as it heightened awareness of ethnic identities by using them for scholarship distribution and other such organizational purposes.**  These hardened social identities challenged traditional modes of hierarchy and deference in Kerala, giving rise to a much larger movement.  Schools became a testing ground for little acts of rebellion, and as Gandhi’s nationalist non-cooperation movement swept the country, it found many student followers.  Rebellion was literally taught in class – teachers were paid little and irregularly, and they objected, noisily.  “From the mid-1930s, vigorous teachers’ unions spread new ideas and forms of protest into distant corners” (Jeffrey 1992).  This idea of dissent, of critically examining one’s situation and working to change it, strikes at the heart of structural violence, which perpetuates its injustice by being unnoticed.  For this reason, the very first movements of the educationally engaged Kerala citizens were to combat these systemic injustices, mostly through land reforms""

"hpboaq1","&gt;Men started almost every war, men have been the main reason for genocide,

Queens in Europe were more likely to start wars then Kings. Does this change anything in regards of how you view history? It should..

Which ""men"" are we talking about aniway? You mean the peasants or the sellswords? Or the people in power? If we do know for a fact people in power done horrible things regardless of their gender, then is gender the issue really or the corruptive nature of power and human's inability to resist corruption without lifelong preparation? Plenty of men also fought and died resisting genocide and futile wars, do they matter? Plenty of men in power raised their voice for equality and done good deeds to humanity.. Do they matter? Or only the bad things count, when it comes to ""men""?

Do you pay attention to those women done evil deeds and started wars for selfish purposes, or your focus is only on those sacrificed their life for good causes? 

See, this binary understanding of history (men=bad, oppressive; women: good, victimized) that you and many others in your crowd possess is toxic beyond comprehension.

&gt;Men control religion.. 

Which ""men"", which religion and at what point of history? An other vague and massively over generalised claim..

&gt;men have most of the high paying jobs, most billionaires and millionaires are men

Why is that? Perhaps because men in general are more likely to sacrifice far more time from their life, often 60-70 hours per week and they are more likely to take risks..? Idk.. Just perhaps there's some deeper issues here other the just gender.. Again, overy simplified binary understanding of complex social issues won't do you any good. Who established/found those fortune 500 companies? Men. Women were ""not allowed""? How many counter examples do you need to change your view?

&gt;men get to go to space first,

Nope, the first living creatures in orbit were fruit flies followed by Laika, a female dog, the next milestone was set by Yuri Gagarin followed 2 years! after by Valentina Tereshkova. Oppression right? Again, freakin' complexity!

&gt;men get to control womens lives in the Middle East,

Yes, let's help liberating women there. As long as there are valid issues people will rise for the cause. Though we are generally talking about the West here.

&gt;controlled by men in the work space, head chefs, fashion designers, owners of cleaning companies.

Yet again.. Why? Is it because of ""oppression"", or something far more complex?

&gt;Men get to have it all so guess what men also get to take a lot of heat for it.

Nobody ""get to have it all"". This is bullshit. Those people are there in most cases because they fought their way to the top or because they built something from nothing or came up with a revolutionary idea, not because they were placed there based on their gender. There are plenty of examples to show that when women are willing to make the same sacrifices and life choices, they do end up in the same positions. 

Is there bias against women? No doubt. It won't change, by placing more women there. More accurately, the bias will shift towards men as we see it in female dominated areas. It is - again - the nature of power and the preservation of it, nothing to do with one's gender. We live in a merit based hierarchy, if this wasn't true our society would have collapsed.

&gt;Men need to be better.

And women too. We live in a society and all our problems are intertwined. We all ""need to do better"" in order to increase the quality of outcome for all.

&gt;Women are living in fear of being rapped and kid napped,

Some women are. Some men are too. Or do you also claim that men ""can not be raped""? Men are physically stronger then women. Men's abuse is generally physical, less covert/verbal/emotional. Women's abuse is covert, emotional, done trough speech, trough manipulation, trough blackmail and is less physical.. No, women are not saints, nor are men. The manifestation of abuse may show gender specific patterns, the prevalence of abusive behavior is not! Again.. COMPLEXITY! If women were stronger then men, do you really think, that physical abuse would still be done by men in most cases? Or do you think there would be significantly less abuse? If so, you are dead wrong!

I do work in data and I can tell you that when you look at a level of engineering on a time scale there is the innovation curve right

It starts off being some randomly weird thing and then some people have success and because everybody doesn’t follow this initial pattern bridges falling metal fails because they’re not following these initial processes of mechanical engineering.

This also comes from experience when you have experience do you know where our history works and you know how people who ignore history repeat history.

It takes people like me with patience to explain people like you with ignorance and ego that medicine is still very much a young science and it was barely 100 years ago that doctors refuse to wash their hands after surgery.

That the car was around for60+ years before we got seatbelts.

Then when many lives are lost and bridges continue to fail and buildings collapse the industry regulates itself saying hey we’re going to establish that all steel meets these requirements and we’re going to regulate the industry.

So now software engineering in comparison to say mechanical engineering or electrical engineering is invertible dark ages and many software engineers right now or somewhat considered wizards for how much work they get done and how little many of us understand how it actually works.

So no because I understand the industry that I work in I also understand that there’s a limit to what I know and so I’m patient because at some point you have to admit that I don’t know what goes beyond a certain point.

There’s the whole big discussion about it’s recent handling of politics too. I think the recent pair of episodes have shown that the show’s current problems exist well beyond that shit, but it is a factor. 

Ofc that’s not to give any validity to the alt-right folks going “oh it’s so PC and political now”; like, no, the show’s always been political and often had a leftist slant. But it *is* handled differently now. For most of the show, it felt like the political issues being brought up were largely just props for the characters to do comedy with. You could read stuff into it, but ultimately it felt like the focus was on the characters and their reactions to it rather than the issues itself. The target of those jokes were, well, the type of people the gang satirizes in general - ignorant and apathetic straight white Americans (the Friends crowd). 

The newer shit more often feels like it’s just trying to talk about those issues directly, and as much as I love the show and the crew behind it, I don’t think they’re equipped for deep dives into such topics. Shots are thrown at everyone, from alt-right rioters to Kanye supporters to fake-woke Hollywood liberals to young politically-active people. And despite all that, nothing is really being said of any value, humorous or otherwise (imo ofc), just “boy politics sure are whacky, huh?”.

The insinuation here is that either a) they feel they are above the law and willfully comfortable with the spread of the disease or b) they didn’t think this was a big deal. Either way the picture here painted is ‘one rule for thee and another for me’ and it IS a deadly disease and in having such gatherings, runs a fair chance of spreading a disease that at that point, they knew little about. Boris caught Covid, as did some of his team. The rules in place were to minimize stretching the health services. In meeting like this you’re running a high chance of further stretching those health services, no? The impact of this is what frustrates me. There are soooo many people who will see this and think ‘well if they’re not bothered, why should I be’ and that will just further the spread of this disease.

"hpau5j3","Oh no, I'm not offended, I'm just pointing out how absolutely fucking hypocritical you are in calling me ignorant and arrogant in the same breath. No, I don't deny evidence brought before me. Like I said, when I alluded to Double Time being more effective then Lightweight for mobility, I was shown the opposite and I effectively conceded. You're projecting so hard here that's it's almost funny. You're the one who's ignoring evidence in favor of taking a metric like popularity as ""evidence"" of Lightweight's effectiveness, when that's a purely subjective metric. 

No it doesn't, it only links to what is popular. There's a reason the word ""underrated"" exists and is commonly used to describe weapons that are less popular then people give them credit for. Lightweight in BO2 did not give you a noticeable difference, especially with the percentage of increase being lower then it is in Vanguard. I've never even seen anyone recommend it over Ghost or Flak Jacket because those two both grant actual noticeable effects rather then one that is minute. And even a 2.3 mph increase for SMGs specifically wouldn't even be that bad and would give Lightweight enough value to not to get outcompeted by Demolition alone. Very ironic that you say you have to experience a change in game rather then purely look at numbers, considering I already admitted this, and the same principle applying to your assertion that it would be too much. 

I didn't say you did, I pointed out the difference between the two in a relative sense, and why High Alert's unique effect gives it actual value that can compete in its class instead of a very small boost in speed that can be granted with certain stocks. Forward Intel is also a great perk, but it doesn't outclass High Alert because the latter's effect is still unique and more versatile, since it's not just useful as a way of gauging spawns.

"hpanv7o","The books are pretty long, and I would say the books are going to give you the same gist of a story as the TV show, but there are a lot of changes in the show from the books, and they feel very different because they are tonally very very different. There are a lot of elements, such as Rand and Edmond's fielders being much more ignorant and naieve while being good people that shines through heavily that was changed to 'modernize' and make the characters more palatable to a wider audience in the show, yet dozens of pages of the books will have this characterization, which to me makes the books way different. No character is the same in the books, all were changed for the show, with Moirane probably being the closest to her book counterpart, if a bit more severe and less Gandalfish(she is most definitely a Gandalf derivative in the first book.)

As another poster said though - the books are deceptive because of RJ's style of constantly wanting to refresh a reader's memory. In this way he was exactly the opposite of Steven Erikson in his Malazan series: Erickson literally never explains or refreshes lore and plot, where as RJ will, after book 1, spend a paragraph on almost every page, every single time a concept that was in a previous book comes up, use a paragraph to remind the reader about them. If you get this, and begin to just skim those rehashes, lots of the book, specially after book 4, will become half as long as they appear, as huge huge amounts of these books are just going to go over the plot events that lead up to that moment in the story. For example book 7 might go to Nynaeve's story, and spend a few paragraphs just reminding the reader about the journey to get that far, and then she talks to another character, who then gets a paragraph explaining who and why they are there. If you've followed the plot this is all unnecessary and you can skim it all in 20 seconds - doing this will save you over 100 pages a book after book 6 until Sanderson takes over and make the books fly by as though they are only 300-400 pages instead of 800+. No lie. 

If you like fantasy, you really do owe yourself the gift of the series, as while book 1 is a LotR derivative heroes journey, after book 1 the series opens up into itself and builds one of the more complete and robust fantasy worlds you will ever encounter, with a massive cast of characters, many of whom are very interesting, and a plot that twists and turns in compelling ways. The series does a good job of setting up and executing these massive climactic scenes and meetings of key characters that are very enjoyable to read - it's pretty much why everyone loves the books: is for these singular moments(post book 4 anyways) where huge huge events occur that make you want to get to the next one, usually with 600 pages of exposition before it, but the payoff is worth. The show will almost surely truncate all of this down into a 3-6 episode lead up with a major payoff episode, but it should be fun, but probably nothing like the books in truth.",1640009358,"there are a lot of elements, such as rand and edmond's fielders being much more ignorant and naieve while being good people that shines through heavily that was changed to 'modernize' and make the characters more palatable to a wider audience in the show, yet dozens of pages of the books will have this characterization, which to me makes the books way different.","ignorant and naieve","ignorant","and",FALSE,"more ignorant and naieve","naieve","more",NA,1

These people never worry about the consequences and they never questioning theirselves so they thrive to life easily because they are ruthless and ready to do everything to succeed. And the world is made this way that nobody would validate a person with low self esteem, who feels bad with himself or had struggles to face who ditch his spirit. On the contrary modern psychology will enable this feeling by saying that you have the problem and you need to be fixed rather help you to accept and forgive yourself. To become the perfect slave and be inferior while others will have the best of their lives.

So I'm sorry if I'm sound too negative but I don't believe that the kind and compassionate, sensitive people are the lucky ones.

I love it how after Mac came out in a very respectful way now he's out and proud and it's leading to hilarious scenes. It's still typical Always Sunny humor but the way they got to it doesn't make it homophobic. It's the best of both worlds really.

I love it how they didn't turn the whole gang into anti-vaxxers but their behavior is perfectly fitting with their characters. Most got the vaccine, even though they're still pretty ignorant and irresponsible. And their (lack of) reaction to Dennis 1) not getting vaccinated, 2) getting sick, 3) putting others at risk without anyone from the gang showing the least bit of concern... Again, typical Always Sunny humor without the need to make them obnoxiously antivax for easy laughs. Best of both worlds again.

I love it how after Mac getting a wholesome coming out episode, now Charlie got a wholesome encounter with his dad. And in both cases, Frank was around to make it hilarious without ruining the wholesomeness (so far.) I know that some viewers don't want anything like this in Always Sunny but I feel that after all those years, it's fine to include some feel good moments.

"hp9yoen","I recently moved to Medina (within the last 5 years) and I have to say that it is a completely different place than I expected. I had been there before for sporting events and even knew some kids from the area growing up. But the political and social climate was completely unexpected. The people of Medina, and generally the immediate surrounding areas, are quite possibly the most ignorant and uneducated bunch I have encountered. Its indoctrinated at a young age, so much so that I heard a 4 year old yell “Lets go Brandon” at a restaurant the other day, and the whole table laughed. I am not surprised by this “movement” or whatever they would like it to be called (what really gets me is the idea: lets hold a white supremacy gathering in front of a Mexican chain fast food spot) as it really sums up the population of these areas as a whole. A good friend of mine recently told me he believes that white people should have a month dedicated to them because in his words “Everyone else gets one, but they are prejudice against white people and won’t give us one.” I looked at him, extremely confused. He reiterated it again, that white people are being discriminated against and hated on and given unfair treatment because we dont have a month. I very plainly looked at him and responded “It is almost never a bad day to be a white person in America. Were your ancestors shipped here and forced to work as slaves because they were white? Do you get hate speech thrown at you everyday for being white? Are there violent groups rallying against you because your white? Do you fear unreasonable violence from law enforcement because your white? Was your right to vote non-existent and threatened because your white? Is it hard for you to find employment because of racial boundaries and biases because your white? Is your ability to go out in public with the person you love, in jeopardy and at times a dangerous risk, because your white? Were your people stripped of their land and forced to leave because you are white? These are all things that happened to the groups who have months, don’t be so ignorant and selfish to think they wouldn’t trade a month to not have any of those things happen to their people”

The kids are completely uneducated and every single one I have spoken with has told me, in their schools they are provided “tutors” who basically just give them the answers to tests and write papers for them, in order to keep the high graduation rate. This has lead to a group of young adults who cannot grasp simple english concepts or do simple math problems. That leads to them being more vulnerable to the potential brainwashing from the propaganda  in support of some really important issues. The age of misinformation is upon us and the people most affected are those with limited ability to form rational opinions on their own. 

 I am someone who’s opinion differs from many around me and, even coming from a bread-and-butter white suburb before, was shocked to see such blatant hate and ignorance. It seems encouraged by everyone around too, as though if you are able to accept people that are different from you, you go against your own people. When saying it like that, as opposed to using a race or religion or whatever demographic chosen for the subject, it sounds kind of ridiculous. 

I am definitely more open minded and have different beliefs than these people, and feel demoralized that this is the reality that we are currently living in. I cant wrap my head around some of the things that people believe and are so forth-right in sharing. I am just wondering how this gets rooted so deeply in people, this idea of color, or race, or religion, or sexuality makes up your entire identity, and you we should just group everyone alike together.

Here’s the thing, what your ignorant self construes as fascism is usually not. What now, CAA is fascist? Or is 370’s removal fascist now? Or is it that banning cow slaughter is fascist? What exactly do you even know about the Indian constitution’s directive principles of state policy that suggest all of these things? A constitution, which, btw, was written by anti Hindutva, low caste but highly educated man called Ambedkar. He certainly was no fascist, so why are we fascist for following the directive principles of state policy? 

&gt; We all know what happened in the Gujarat riots, we all know what the RSS stand for, we all know where the BJP is headed. Let's be honest with each other here.

Except you do not know what happened. What exactly triggered the Gujarat riots tell me? Was it the train full of devotees including women and children that was burned to a crisp by Islamists angry about Hindus having re-claimed their Mecca and medina equivalent? The Ram mandir? Why should we not reclaim our temple destroyed by Muslim barbarians? Tell me that? We did it legally, no Muslim was killed, we demolished it, the Supreme Court also agreed this was the site of the Ram mandir, so I don’t think an ignorant and illiterate white fella can tell me what is or isn’t right. 


&gt; 've had the good fortune of widely travelling both India and Sweden, and there's basically no comparison in women's rights and women's safety between the two. Sexual assault in Sweden covers everything from unwanted sexual comments upwards, and this is actively policed across the nation. Sexual assault is newsworthy in Sweden. In India, it's far from unheard of for children to be sold for marriage, and sexual harassment is so incredibly common it's not even mentioned most of the time.

Luckily I am lawyer and I know that sexually coloured remarks as well as molestation do come under outrage of modesty of woman, S. 354 A of the Indian Penal Code. I don’t think it’s actively policed as well as it could be in Sweden, I’m sure it’s better than india though, but the rape stats don’t lie. Also, in india, statutory rape is huge. Meaning, a man can be accused of rape merely by the fact that he promised a woman to marry her if she has sex with him, any consensual sexual inter course resulting from such an arrangement not backed by the promise of marriage itself will be grounds for the man to be charged with rape.

"hp9jvje","I think this might be a learning opportunity, and I hope you take it, the same way I'm taking my time to try and explain why your two comments were problematic and offensive. When you voice offensive/racist stereotypes towards a group of people, some things happen, in this case, you achieve the three I list below:

1. You might hurt people. In this case, you got to add an extra shitty layer to an already stressful situation for someone that hasn't done anything to you. Learning to shut up the little voice full of prejudices inside our head is an opportunity to grow empathy. There might be situations where your comments can hurt someone you care about or it's relevant for your life and not just a rando. 

2. You reinforced a racist an offensive statement, and put it out there for others, that might have never thought of it, to see and repeat. These types of statements grow like a snow ball and usually come from ignorance. Yes, my country has had issues with drug trafficking, but did you also know that our airports are some of the most effective when it comes to detecting drug trafficking? Did you know our passports are some of the safest in the world, with features like eye scan? Are you aware of how much pain is connected to your cocaine comment for a Colombian? You probably don't. Please inform yourself, knowledge is the best way to fight hate and discrimination, both in huge and tiny (like this one) scenarios. 

My original post had nothing to do with drug trafficking, it was about asking for help and guidance regarding a lost passport, yet you took the opportunity to jump into an scenario where someone is smuggling drugs from my country. It was unnecessary and rude, it didn't add to the conversation at all.

3. You kept reinforcing your offensive comment with a fake apology. Sometimes, if you feel like you didn't do anything wrong, it's better to keep quiet if the other option is to use a fake apology to double down on the offense. Saying ""sorry but..."" is never an apology, and again, it brings statements grown from stereotypes and misinformation. Think for a second how would you feel if someone made an offensive generalization about your country (and oh, boy, I'm pretty sure you know what type of ignorant and horrible things people can say about your country), and then, instead of apologizing and learning, they came up with a fake apology where they put the blame on you and your country's history to stand their point, to keep believing their offensive and racist stance is valid.

"hp97kkz","I find the Tartaria and pre-reformation History buffs are better communities than UFO folk.  UFO folk are so invested in their mythos, they're incapable of accepting they could be being hoodwinked, made fun of by a simple death cult and a few tower based maser effects generated by antenna array.

I can convince everyone that Little grey men from Outterspace are real... It's simple, I just draw the sword from the stone and show them Excalibur.  You pick up this lump (archaic meaning: ""man"") of stuff that fell from heaven, it's an iron meteorite... OK, everyone sees it's real?  A little man from outterspace?  Right?  OK, now watch this - I chop it into ingots with a band saw...  look at the pattern inside?  When I heat and hammer this, and draw it out into shape, will be Excalibur, the sword of first kings of the earth, a strong weapon with a beautiful /_\/_\/_\ ""sacred geometry"" pattern that becomes like that seen in ""damascus"" steel.   I have thus drawn the sword from the stone...

These stones make a scythe shape as they fall to heaven during cometary cataclysms (which alternate history historians will know all about - lookup napoleon's comet, the Comet of 1811 (when the real war of 1812 was fought)).  Maybe thousands of earthquakes in new-madrid alone with the earth opening and eating entire villages and armies of men... had something to do with Napoleon's victory?  Maybe the hidden hand cult that hides god's ruthless ""iron fist"", has something to do with why napoleon would hide his hand in paintings -- or why cities were already on fire when he got there to mop-up survivors?

OK, so Saturn is the God of Death, these meteorites make scythe shapes when they fall, the flying saucer is the shape of Saturn.  The Liam cult (of the great determined protector), along with Crowley's OTO promotes the [Lam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Supposed_channeled_entity_by_occultist_crowley.jpg) ""egregore"" (look up that word, it's a thought form) sometimes via think tanks like Tavistock Institute.  Maybe secret cults that conspire to put their sleep paralysis demons in their children's heads, would conspire to have followers air their ""experiences""? And oh, look how the stories are so similar... Wouldn't that makes their grey alien egregore more powerful, after all?  Kids aren't scared of witches and goblins anymore, but even scientits say Little Grey Men from Outer Space might be real...  So they might believe that story, and after some sleep dep torture, become an Alice in Wonderland, like Alec Baldwin (Alice/Baal), or Alice A. Bailey (Alice, Baal lie), or Alister Crowley (Crow lie), or H.P. Blavatsky (blab at the sky), or H.P. Lovecraft (Crowley's ""sex magic"" is a ""Love craft"", and H.P. = H.P.)...  So many of these A-list (alice) celebrities make your whole world their stage, and have CIA handlers, but nope... nothing to see or hear folks.  One could go on and on showing the incestuous connections, and false fronts of these hidden hand cults... but you scrimp and save any little bit of gov disinformation.

Here's the real kicker: Human life proves that aliens visited this world, but it's not comets or metors or trans-dimensional ""hypedimensional"" IYAM, Lam, IAM egregores who were in the beginning just words with God, and the Word was God, and it was just words written by madmen who defamed any transcendent folk as de-men, and chose themselves to be gods, and cover over the evidence of demigods and kings of old...  Those are the ones you'll wait for disclosure from?  OK, whatever, folks.

It's hard as hell to show the UFO community anything that doesn't fit their insane ""space balls"" world view...  They're enchanted by the spells of a death cult, the great delusion of the bible, happens yet again.   Everyone of wisdom seems to know the truth about the cyclic death evidenced in the old world cultures, and how the fire flies or fiery faeries or witches or kobolds or disembodied spirits of Iroquois, or etc, descend in the multitudes during the end of days - products of non-human tech that we got from our forerunners / forefathers... Our birthright to have and to hold, till death do us part, for they grant the invisible mantle of the king, and make the emperor be as naked before this godwife... She reads the hearts of men, and Her all seeing eyes have looks that can kill. This little mermaid, a Whore of Babylon, who was also the Holy Spirit married to the Kings, granting divine right to rule, she fornicates with the ""kings"" of this earth still. /i\

Stop saying UFO, they're phenomenons, plasma balls... they defy physics like a laser pointer's red dot would if you assumed it was a physical item.  UFO folk are like cats chasing laser pointers, but it's maser pointers ""crossing the beams"" and making plasma at the intersection instead of red dots.

Don't wake me when you're ready to wake up and understand the references in your media, like [Niea.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntZSApKMvkE&amp;t=18m) or ""Grave of Fireflies"", ""Fire in the Sky"", [Fireflies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4) etc. Because everyone of wisdom is growing tired of putting the information you seek right in front of your eyes, while you complain it's not there... No one is supposed to speak about fight club because of the ""precious"" little golden god that lurks unseen by most, only the stupid can't notice the invisible cloak of power about the king, Amen, God of Invisibility, Hidden Powers and Air [waves]...  The emperor needs no clothes (armor/amore) because he has the great and determined protection of a god that loves him.  No, that Emperor's New Clothes book couldn't have made an arse out of those who repeat the call of the ignorant child in the story... Of course it wasn't referencing the invisible old gods that all the wise folk know about... Lies in news, truth in fiction...

Perhaps small fire balls do loom about while witchy folk make crop circles - as they used to loom in the forest as will-o-the-wisp to visit orgies of wizards and witches, inviting the love god, Red woman of the City, to come play while the city folk yet sleep.  The UFO are not even unidentified now, eh?  The new silent shy god has had her magic taken by the militaries and the new world order is really that the nations will control the powers of the little god WIFIes, and rule the world without any gods above them...  until the next cataclysm anyway, and then they'll use the powers to hunt people with those UAP plasma balls burning the wize-ard and witch, and anyone who opposes their bullshit history and reformation... Sieze the day [of the cataclysm] and drag us kicking and screaming back to the stone age to do it all over again.

IMO, no one will talk to UFO folk about UFO, because the mundane want to stay ignorant, and most UFO folk have gone insane with a tiny taste of the enchantment spell from a death cult. Whatever it is they believe is set in stone, and basic PSYOPs are their religion, go against gov disinfo and you're a heretic.  These UAP are made by tech older than ""ancient"" Egypt, might as well be called human tech now.  ""it's not on of ours"" (plainly outright lies, unless referencing the fact they have no legit claim or right to hold such power).

Knowing absolutely nothing about what Biden said, or what he was talking about, I'm going to go ahead and answer you anyway, because you really seem to struggle to understand this.

We (Liberals) do not think Biden is a God, okay? We don't treat him like he's the messiah, we don't hold rallies for him, we don't buy his salad dressing, we don't worship him and defend him until our final breath.

Again, that's you guys.

Biden isn't someone that I consider to be very intelligent. He says stupid shit all the time. On covid, he had the worlds attention, so he didn't say anything Joe Biden would say. He said what the health experts told him to say. That was a very wise decision, because it helps to save lives. I don't expect him to do that all of the time, because that's not who he is. I wish he would, but I don't expect him to.

So, I don't give a fuck what Biden says, I give a fuck that he recognizes how important it is to follow the science when it comes to a pandemic. Really smart people have spent a lot of time working on stuff like this. Listening to what they have to say is a good thing. It's a smart thing. It's how buildings get built, it's how airplanes fly, it's how microwaves ... microwave, the point is that listening to smart people tends to pay off. Trump is not a smart person. He didn't say what health experts told him to say, he just made up shit off the top of his head, and figured that had to be the greatest idea in history.

Ignore /u/CMGPetro - their advice is not only the least helpful, it's actually distracting (i.e. their advice is tantamount to your asking for red wine recommendations, and them offering white wine recommendations).

That, and their suggestion bourbon is somehow ""basic"" is laughably ignorant and closed minded (and I say that as a Scotch and bourbon drinker).

Based on his favourites your Man likes bourbon. That being the case, it makes the most sense to pick a special ""wouldn't normally buy this for myself"" bourbon.

Eagle Rare is from the same distillery as Buffalo Trace, but it's distilled separately, 8s from their premium stock, and is at a minimum aged 12 years (doesn't say that on the bottle). It's fricking delicious, will be reminiscent of his favourite, and is in your $60 window.

Stepping outside of that, you're in luck since the Limited Spirit Release took place in November, and there's still remnants of that at any BCL.

&gt;first off, ""answer 2 of these questions correctly""😂😂😂 you're wrong, your ps as you intended it is supposed to be 'answer 2 of these questions as i would answer them'. there isn't one way of answering those questions ""correctly"", there's only one way to answer them 'like you would answer them'. but why do you need that?


Ya the part that explains the questions is all a lie. If anyone actually read that and took it seriously they are not like me. I guess you could say that the correct answer is to analyze my post and answer every question accordingly as a way of giving me false hope that one like me exists. 


&gt;""deflects blame"", ""excuse to do nothing"" i disagree... i think he shows the person what's the cause of the behavior. it doesn't change the responsibility but, it allows the person to understand and try to fix the cause instead of wrestling with the symptoms (example: take the flu, you get a fever, but that's the body trying to fight off the disease. trying to lower the body temperature might make the fever go down but can sometimes also exacerbate the underlying cause, the flu)


I only recently got into this guys youtube channel, and watched the ""Gifted kids are Special Needs"" one. And honestly I didnt like it because I know a few gifted kids who didnt experence burnout. So the target audience is gifted kids who HAVE experenced burnout. 


I dont really have the time to go in detail over everything wrong with this guy's youtube because I would have to respond to every video but if you want I could have you request one and ill tell you everything I find wrong with it. Allthough dont sabatage me and make it a charity vid.


And I dont like how you used the Flu example. When you have the flu your body goes through various changes such as an increase in body temp. When I get the flu I will not try to lower my  body temp but increase it as much as possible. Last time I got the flu I ended with large burn marks on my back not from direct flame but the heat. 


&gt;""quiet, smart, gifted, happy""/""how am i flawed""/""how are you flawed"" quiet, i am like that and never thought anything to be wrong with it, never saw the cause. recently I found out some psychological bullying made me like that. I'm not saying this is the same for you, but there might be an underlying cause you're not aware of.


Ya I asked the question ""How am I flawed, and How are you flawed"" just so someone could say ""If you are trying to find someone who is the exact same as you arn't those both the same question"".


I would say my flaws are just that im too optomistic and I blame everything on myself.


An example of this is when I flip a coin I will criticize myself for not getting the correct answer, same with stocks, anything bad that happens to someone I know, or when someone else makes a mistake. I will blame everything on myself and I know its ignorant and stupid but atleast it gives me a reason to try to fix it.


&gt;let me ask you this, do you have friends? if so how many? would you care if they ceased all communication with you? smart gifted, I've been called smart and lazy ( turns out adhd, diagnosis last month). idk about you, but I've always said, I'm stupid... just like the rest of humanity


I allready have friends that have ceased communication with me. I think we just drifted apart over time but I still think they are great people. We still go to the same church also.


And FYI even if you didnt get diagnosed with ADHD you would still have it. It is a part of you so getting diagnosed with it changes nothing about you or who you are. Im pretty sure I have adhd but I am not going to get it diagnosed just so I can use it as an excuse on why I am the way I am.


Humanity is not stupid. Claiming so is your excuse to be stupid. ""If everyone else is stupid its ok for me to be stupid""


&gt;. if you're as smart as smart as you say you are, can you tell me a reasonably feasible but different way of tackling climate change than the braindead ""reduce emissions"" thing? or how about, how can you fix a corrupt country without a coup? happy, I've been reasonably happy for the most part. happy playing my games and watching tv, internet shit... until I realized that it was mostly a coping mechanism.


The best way to solve climate change is to invest in new technologies that dont use fossil fuels. 


And its hard to fix a corrupt country without a coup. You are giving no information about anything, and anything I say is merely speculation. But the best way to fix a broken country is to increase civil communication.


And this is the part I dont understand. Why is it that all people who I thought were similar to me have to think that they are deppressed. If you are using the internet as a coping mechanism simply fix whatever you are afraid of and you will still go on the internet.


Saying that tv, and the internet are the problems when you are just using them as a coping mechanism is just you avoiding the real problem.

"hp8mu5u","Yeah, I don’t know why but I swear in Canada a lot of docs have some weird idea that ADHD is only a childhood affliction that a lot of people just “grow out of.” My hypothesis is that that false (and frustratingly  ignorant) belief, plus the potential for abuse/demand on the black market (and the fact that there’s no shortage of stories about  patients who turn around and sell the pills from their scripts to students on high school and university campuses) makes a lot of doctors hesitant to prescribe for an adult whose history they don’t know. Especially those doctors at walk-in clinics in urban centres, perhaps due to the higher frequency of addicts they treat on a weekly basis, who knows..

Regardless  the system is obviously not working as it should if  a legitimate and verifiable need isn’t being met. And then if even a fraction of those undiagnosed and unmedicated patients turn to  sketchy street deajlers, as I have had to do before, those same docs are creating more market opportunities for organized crime, as well as exposing their patients to a completely unnecessary  amount of risk and trouble.

"hp8kuxj","I'm native Maltese who has now immigrated to the UK and become a British citizen. Whilst I understand your issues with some people in my home country, the way you phrased it made it sound like we were all alike. Obviously, in the following points I speak of my personal experience given that we are alike in our nationalities.

Since you have done me and everyone else the pleasure of discussing the issues with Malta, allow me to do the same with our shared homeland. The Maltese are obnoxious and loud but at least they are open and blunt with you if they dislike you. You said it yourself that people were clear with you that they disliked what you had to say. You have no idea how difficult it is for someone coming from a Maltese background of loud but clear opinions to face certain English people telling you they like you to your face whilst chatting shit behind your back. My mother has been reduced to tears by the catty gaslighting and bullying that goes on in the British corporate workplace. I have faced the same in school, university and work. You may say the same takes place in Malta, but as we are ignorant and small-minded, we shouldn't be hard to read for you, right?

As a European we dislike the English coming to our countries and gentrifying our countries into little Englands every summer and on top of that, insinuating we are savages because we are not as ""refined"". Would it be fair for me to plaster every Englishman as backstabbing cultural-colonisers and make a prejudice of every Englishman I meet before properly acquainting myselves with them? No it is not. It would be offensive of me to do so. 

I love my new country but it has hurt me in many new different ways I may never forgive. But I recognise also what benefits I have been given as a result of living in the UK and love the people for that very reason, choosing to ignore the bad FEW who have hurt me so with their xenophobia and other such issues. I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given by the UK and it has made me who I am today. I understand the Maltese are abrasive at first and different to Northern  European culture, but we are strong together and if you choose to create a family with your partner, you will know no greater warmth and fierce protection than our communities and families.

So, how could you slander my homeland for a mere percentage of its people and act as though you are better than them? My country and its ""obnoxious"" people saved your country as part of its colonies during world war two by taking more bombings than London and Coventry combined. Our cultural heritage was destroyed as target practice by the British airforce because we understood the sacrifice that had to be made for the greater good. 

Instead of talking about your girlfriend and friends to discuss Maltese behaviour from a positive light, you use them as footnotes to disguise how you really feel. Isn't every nation in this world blighted by its people? Our flaws as humans escape the bounds of nationality so what did you expect? I love England for all of its warts and if I hated its people so, I would leave and take my partner with me.

I assure you, the island will continue without your donations so if at any point we are too overwhelmingly obnoxious please do not feel restricted in leaving. The fact is, you enjoy the benefits of the island to an extent that it made you leave a significantly more developed country so I don't really see why you are complaining as you are the master of your own destiny here.

You cite the celebrity like culture for politicians and seem to forget that clown in No. 10? Please. 

Our country may suck but it sucked less than it did 10 years ago. And it will continue to suck less until one day we become ""refined"" and ""uncorrupt"".

I'm not asking you to. I'm merely asking for you to present the evidence that convinced you a god existed after you seemingly were convinced no gods existed for an extended period of your life. 

&gt; I began learning about animism and polytheism (while still an atheist), and just..believed after a while. I don't know why.

That's not a valid explanation and you know that. A person does not come to the conclusion that no gods exist through rational thought and critical thinking skills and then one day just all of a sudden believe the opposite WITHOUT some significant empirical evidence that changed their mind. You cannot blame me or anyone else for taking you and others like as liars or at least being disingenuous.

&gt;I was a hard-core atheist

I'm not a ""hardcore atheist"" and you even using that phrase just feels like a typical theist pretending they understand what it means to be an atheist. We aren't focused on the god belief or the religious doctrine, we just care about holding beliefs for GOOD reason. And good reason is typically determined by massive amounts of empirical evidence that you can share with others and that is convincing enough to change one's position. 

&gt;My whole comment was about how people who hold your opinions often display a lack of empathy

And i'm saying there simply is no correlation at all. I have empathy when i'm in a position to understand someone else's position. But when they can't even articulate their position or how they arrived at it how in the hell would i be able to empathize? 

I'm willing to give YOU (although not OP) the benefit of the doubt that you are being genuine here. But my problem with you is mainly how you are supporting people like OP who are very clearly either lying about their experiences or have so little understanding of them that they come off as incredibly ignorant and arrogant. 

If you actually were an atheist who valued rational thinking and empircal evidence, great. 
If there was actually some big piece of evidence that convinced you to change your mind, great. 

All i'm asking is that you don't make comments on posts talking about how there are all these ""ex atheists"" without actually providing the explanation for how that would be possible. Because simply waking up one day and all of a sudden believing something different is a major sign that you 1. were never actually an atheist in the first place and 2. never valued empirical evidence or rational thought either.

"hp8evhp","&gt;Speculation.

Your whole position is speculation. Can you address the argument?

&gt;So, you're going to ignore the fact that they lied for decades about the danger of smoking?

Which they were persecuted for. 

&gt;Look, you're obviously not debating in good faith here.

Non to be had, your point is absurd. You are comparing a self-administered drug produced by a company (That is paying a shitload of taxes) to another country, willingly letting a engineered virus escape and telling everyone ""Nothing to see here"". 

We are talking about officials making the conscious choice to let Covid spread around the world, just because they wanted to take a chance. The decision of one person, maybe a handful of men. And you compare that to half a country, deciding to take a fucking drug.

If you are unable to process the difference, I'll just leave it at that.

&gt;I can't even tell what you're claiming here. Iran isn't a nuclear power.

How old were you, during 9/11? The whole Iraq war started under the premised that the government was constructing nukes. Or, do you mean to imply that you believe in conspiracy theories?

&gt;I have no clue what your point is about OPEC.

You complained that Iraq and Afghanistan (Indirectly Pakistan, but that's still contested by you) didn't have the same economic leverage as China, bc countries weren't reliant on them economically. But they are, the world is far more reliant on oil and they are part of OPEC. You can get cheap labor anywhere, the rest of Asia, Africa, SoAm..

&gt;So, no, I don't see that as a valid example.

Right, the president of the country just pulled that out of his ass and there are plenty other explanation for the complete 180 on their foreign policy. Got it. You are hurting my head. 

&gt;Thank you for that amazing revelation, Captain Obvious.
  


Seems like it's not so obvious. Let's try this again: 

Why do you see positive reports on the head of the Chinese Party, which controls the media? Any closer yet? 

&gt;Politicians

Dictators are politicians now? 

&gt;referring to notes

Notes that contain the questions and answers? lol Man, I am getting the feeling that you live in north korea. or maybe texas? 

Imagine the fucking outcry if the New York Times have the questions to politicians, before the Interview. Let alone the fucking answers. 

&gt;Trump has done at least a hundred things that were ten times as dumb or worse

Trump admitted to staging his interviews, while visiting another state? Really? 

&gt;Remember when he tried to draw a new hurricane path on the map with a Sharpie because he's a fucking moron who can't admit the slightest error?

Remember when Xi didn't understand that he has to come up with his own answers, in an Interview?

Remember Xi letting people die in jail, for using the words ""winnie pooh"" to mock him?

So how this is getting redundant, really really fast?

It's funny how you just keep repeating this same incorrect assertion over and over and over again, never once stopping to listen or learn or ask for genuine clarification regarding how it does actually work. 

&gt;Sad that apparently ""older"" and ""matured"" people need the use for rather disgracing words instead of having a solid and respectful discussion

How do you expect that respectful discussion to occur, exactly? You are *objectively* wrong about how the real world works. You are expressing beliefs based on pure ignorance that would be impossible to hold if you properly educated yourself. I am willing to explain these things to you but you are not willing to listen. You want only to believe that your ignorant and wrong assumptions are somehow true, but they're not. In short: you are the only disrespectful one here. If you'd shut the fuck up for a moment, acknowledge your misconceptions, and be open to learning something new, this would've been a very brief and very polite conversation.

Redditors always do this. They always say the dumbest shit on the planet, repeatedly double down on it, argue with anyone who tries to teach them anything, then freak out when someone is anything less than infinitely nice. Why? What makes you this way? Why do you think this is an acceptable way to behave?
