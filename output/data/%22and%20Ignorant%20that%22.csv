"hq2gkhf","&gt;  looking back

This is the key thing.  Not just because of the benefit of hindsight and everything we've learned in the last 20 years, but also because the average person has access to a lot more current event information today than we did then.

There is one event though that you are familiar with that's actually really close in a lot of ways to what things were like after 9/11...and that's Covid.

Think about all the changes our country has gone through over the last couple years.  Various measures and restrictions and requirements that have happened in response to a threat.

That's very close to the impact 9/11 had at the time.  Travel changed forever.  Our feeling of safety changed forever.  Government intelligence agencies and efforts changed forever.  All of this in a very short amount of time, and there wasn't any guarantee that more attacks weren't going to happen.

Now, instead of having a virus as the enemy, we had a group of people and a region of the world to target.  Almost no one pictured, or could even imagine, that there was any way it would be a long drawn out occupation.

For context of the time, it had been a long time since Vietnam and we'd obviously learned our lessons since then.  Our most recent conflict in the Middle East had been an incredibly quick and successful campaign.

Yes, there were protesters.  (Way less politicians protesting it though than now claim to have been against the wars though, just look at the voting records.)  Most people seemed to think we could get in there quick, get some revenge on the people that had hurt us, make sure it never happened again, and life would go back to normal.

Now though, it's common knowledge just how naive and ignorant that viewpoint was.  We were so clueless about so many things, and a lot of it we only learned because of the last couple decades.

For example:  I went through some ""counter-terrorism"" training when I was in the military shortly after 9/11.  It was a joke.  Now there are highly trained teams around the world that specialize in that, but the training I had was basically a few days of how to pay attention to people and vehicles around you and to figure out if you're being followed, combined with a little wargame where we were defending a location and having to decide who to shoot that approached us.",1640553485,"now though, it's common knowledge just how naive and ignorant that viewpoint was.","naive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"how naive and ignorant","naive",NA,"how",0

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

My friend, you've mistaken the history books for fairy tales.

&gt;If you had studied history you would know that Germany was not universally resigned to the rise of nazism as a result of the end of ww1 and up to the point where they were literally dragged out of their homes and murdered on the night of the long knives, Hitler had many people fighting against him and the rise of fascism.

Yes, he did have opposition, did I ever argue that the Nazi party was universally endorsed in germany?

But Hitler is not some magic mind controller who turned people into mindwashed nazis. The nazis party had significant support and hitler was able to gain that support off the back of how fucked germany was post WWI.

&gt;They died doing what they knew was right even when the vast majority were swept up by the rhetoric and the lies. It's a shame we don't remember them but you're far more willing to recognize the poor nazis that were just upset about how the victors of ww1 treated them.

What kind of mental gymnastics are you trying to perform here?

I'm here saying that we should try to prevent causing a situation that resembles post WWI germany so that we prevent the rise of a group similar to the nazis. 

Then you're just trying to somehow attack me for being ""nicer"" to the nazis than the people who died in a losing political battle against the nazis.

"hpiko83","February and March of 1945 were drenched with literal fire, as Dresden was firebombed in Europe and during the same month there came the firebombing of Tokyo. On March 9, while the bombing in the Pacific was still ongoing, a holy man in Chicago was crucified.

His name was Fred Walcher and he was found under the L at Lincoln Park. He was nailed to a cross with five spikes and a crown of thorns. He was an optician from Austria who wanted world peace with something called ""American Industrial Democracy""; he wanted a United States of the World with 1 representative for every one million literate adults.


Fred Walcher was an Austrian who rented a room in the basement of a bar located at 1638 North Halsted Street in Chicago. He was an Optician by trade. Walcher believed in universal brotherhood and was worried about the state of our civilization. His concern had caused him to start a movement for world peace called the ""American Industrial Democracy.""

Walcher originally claimed it was three strangers who did the deed, but the police, finding his story erratic, eventually realized it was a publicity stunt; in the end Walcher was fined for disturbing the peace and the incident was closed; Walcher was disappointed that people were not interested in his pamphlets.

Police also alleged Walcher was sympathetic to the Bund, a Nazi organization. This is fairly confusing because Walcher was also friends with Emanuel Bronner, also known as Dr. Bronner: soap entrepreneur, but also virulent anti-Nazi and anti-communist crusader (and a lifelong conspiracy theorist).

...

Emanuel Bronner was born into an orthodox Jewish family with a soap-making
tradition that went back two generations. (His last name was originally
Heilbronner but he changed it later for what are hopefully obvious reasons.)
Emanuel grew up to receive a soap-making master certificate and was enmeshed into German culture
but -- as he got older -- had increasing concerns about anti-Semitism, and eventually
went to the United States in 1929.

His family mostly eventually made it out of Germany, but Emmanuel's parents stubborn
clung to hope that the Nazis would eventually lose power and refused to leave
(they even had an opportunity during a 1938 vacation to Switzerland). The same
year as the vacation there came the Night of Broken Glass and the terrors to come;
they were forced to sell their business under Aryanization, and finally got
documents to leave the country at the end of 1941, but it was too late: they
were deported to and died in concentration camps.

When in American, Bronner moved to Milwaukee (the third largest
German population in the US during the 1930s) and met his
first wife, Paula Wolfahrt there.

Wolfahrt was a Catholic, Bronner was of course still a Jew, and
they had three children together that they baptized as
Lutheran. This is the first stirrings of his All-in-One philosophy.

It sounds incoherent spelled out on a soap label, but in essence the
idea is just: all religions should combine into one. While he was
at it, he thought all people should combine into one for global
peace.

Paula died in 1944; this was a ""turning point"" according
to Bronner and from then he became a ""searcher for truth""
and gave himself the designation ""Dr""; he claimed
that his earning $60,000 from six patents was a ""sign of God"".

A year after Paula died was the cross incident, and Bronner 
was there by Walcher's bed on the crucifixtion day; he said Walcher had claimed

&gt;...that people were so stupid and ignorant that something violent
was needed to awaken them.

Bronner stayed friends with Walcher; his ideas were integrated
into his as he gave public speeches. After a somewhat ambiguous
incident in 1946 at the University of Chicago he was arrested
(he claimed it had to do with his lobbying against flouridation of
water) and this directly led to him landing at the Elgin
State Mental Hospital. He claimed he was put to electroshock therapy
and tried to escape multiple times, making it out on his third time and
heading from there to California.

(Aside: flouridation of water began 
in the US in 1945 and was one of the central locuses of
conspiracy theories. It even ended up in the movie
Dr. Strangelove. /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov has written
more about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6zfv35/in_dr_strangelove_gen_ripper_alleges_that/dmve7l9/)).

Note that as part of this he essentially abandoned his children -- the one
who ended up keeping on the family tradition most, Ralph, went through 15
orphanages.

In Los Angeles he started selling health products, including
 “Dr. Bronner’s Organic-Mineral Salt” in 1953, and roughly around then also
 making soap. By 1961 he had a factory at a rate
of ten gallons a week; and this is roughly when the new design started
to be made as the label wasn't catchy enough. (In other words, there was a _bit_ of calculated capitalism in making an eye-catching rambling label.) The label didn't obtain its blue-and-white look until 1968
when the company made a deal to give 100,000 bottles in Israel (the
deal fell through, the design was kept). The label went through many
iterations -- according to *Esquire* in 1972, the text was changed every month --
and while a 1978 article claims Dr. Bronner converged on a ""final text"" the
1972 *Esquire* article claimed the same. 

&gt;Perhaps that is why he revises them so often, even holding up a shipment of orders while he throws out thousands of already-printed ones, agonizing over the rewording of the tiny print, then exultantly announcing, as he has time and again, that the new one is the final, ultimate version.

I haven't found a comprehensive document detailing the endless fiddling, but
the claims roughly converge on:

- Lots of quotes talking about All-in-One, the merged super-religion.

- claims that Dr. Bronner was Einstein's nephew (not true)

- bizarre statements like Thomas Paine's books not being taught since 1799

- claims about ""Easter Isle"" type overpopulation that will ""destroy God's Spaceship Earth""

- rambling about ""Nazi-Psycho-Communism""

&gt;...ready to help teach the whole Human race the Moral ABC of All-One-God-Faith! For we're All-One or none! ALL-ONE! ALL-ONE!

The odd thing about all this is, despite the popularity amongst hipster leftists, the general conceit is a very right-wing one: essentially what Walcher conceived so many years ago, having peace through having a world government, as opposed to a diversity of countries having everything merged. Simultaneous to this the far right was opposing the UN as a crypto-world-government, so maybe Dr. Bronner simply is breaking the left-right directionality altogether and shooting off into his own world.

Dr. Bronner was most definitely a true believer, and kept evangelizing about All-in-One until his death. He was willing to talk with anyone who would listen. The reporter William Poundstone for his book *Bigger Secrets* once found a poster given away by the company (sort of a super-extended version of the label) with the direct phone number to Dr. Bronner; he called and Dr. Bronner not only answered personally and went on his typical lengthy diatribe.

At the very least, the company was and remains devoted to ""benevolent capitalism""; 70% of its profits are donated to charity.

"hphb6tb","From my perspective, I think the idea of attempting to classify economies based on the system of ownership isn't going to lead anywhere useful. It's an old fashioned idea, from the 19th and early 20th centuries when European intellectuals were very scathing about medieval peasants or poor farmers in existing poor countries, assuming they were backward and ignorant. That was when people believed that the English enclosures of common land from the 16th-18th centuries had prompted a boom in agricultural productivity. 

This view has been overturned in the 20th century - Robert Allen measured the returns on enclosure and they turned out to be only 10-15%, not remotely enough to explain the increase in agricultural productivity. Deirdre McCloskey made a strong argument that medieval farming with its scattered plots was efficient. Elinor Ostrom showed the effectiveness and efficiency of communal property. On the other side, economists like Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz and F. A. Hayek (as well as the experiences of the 1970s) made the case for the importance of prices in coordinating economic activity, and economic historians like Douglas North the case for the importance of inclusive social institutions. More sadly, the many costly errors of economic development institutions in Africa and Asia led to a growing awareness that perhaps the locals knew more about their local farming than the Western educated ""experts"". (I recall attending a seminar by a very experienced development economist who recounted an anecdote of his first trip to Africa. It ended with him gazing at the ruins of his experimental fields left by the hippos, when one of the locals slapped him on the back and said ""Wait until the elephants come."")

While you might not agree, I think we're both coming at this from a well-meaning place, but there's some sort of mismatch in our communication, which I'll take blame for. I will also admit that even though 14 quotes doesn't show ""the true nature of the PL movement"" or something, it does show that a not insignificant portion of people in the PL movement hold horrible views. 

Thank you. I appreciate it. Tbh I'm not going to respond to your replies because it really is quite disturbing to me to see anyone minimize or dilute the horrificness of that one no. 7 quote, which I think you were going with.

&gt;Thankfully, they seem to be a minority.

I'm not convinced of that and I don't know why you're assuming that. Do you really think that there are only 13-ish people in the entirety of the PL population who hold these views, and they happened to get elected to public office / became news commenters? I think the fact that they all have prominent positions and feel free to say these things tells me that they are broadly popular. 

&gt;Why is the ""man"" relevant? Is the implication that men can't be raped? But you are right, while I have been a victim of a lesser violation, I can't grasp how horrible rape is.

First I want to say that I am truly sorry you have been a victim of violation. That sucks and should never happen to anyone. 

So, men can absolutely be [raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender#:~:text=Rape%20of%20males,-Part%20of%20a&amp;text=A%20CDC%20study%20found%20that,an%20intimate%20partner%20or%20acquaintance). But it is far less frequent than women experiencing rape. I believe the current stats are [1 in 6](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence), and anecdotally I would say most of my friends have been raped or assaulted. (Me too). Whereas for men it's [1 in 71](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf). In addition, of men who are raped, most are raped by other men. Men do [almost all of the raping.](https://stoprape.humboldt.edu/statistics)

This isn't to demonize men, just to be realistic. Men, by and large, do not walk around with the threat of rape hanging over their heads. Men are not told to modify their behavior and make their lives smaller to avoid rape. Men don't carry their keys between their fingers while walking to their cars late at night just in case. 

Whereas these are universal experiences for women. We are always told, from puberty on, that it's a danger. Many of us have been mentally aware this could happen our whole lives, and know many others who have had it happen--often by the people we trust most. (As most rapists aren't psychos hiding in bushes, but people we already know--our friends, boyfriends, husbands etc. Mine was a boyfriend).

Are there women who say horrible, rapey things on this sub in support of abortion bans? Sure. But a position like ""making me have a job is rape"" or ""taxes are rape"" is just so blindingly insensitive and ignorant that the only way I can imagine someone saying or thinking that is if they have never been raped themselves and genuinely can't imagine being raped.

Like I said, hate taking the hard line but too many people seem to get off on immediately discounting any change or advancement in technology, assuming that what we currently have is working so well.

The world's food supply is fkd and is only going to get worse as the climate continues to change. Nobody is comparing costs of vertical farming to traditional farming in the past 100 years, they're talking about the next 100. Traditional farming isn't going to cut it, and is going to get very expensive to keep operating. Might have free sunshine going for it but it also relies heavily on water, fossil fuels and hell if a lot of infrastructure to make it all happen. The world is rapidly losing its arable land and we'll need alternative farming methods to make up for it. Nobody is saying park the tractors we got a better idea... it's to be used in addition to, not in replacement of. Localizing and stabilizing food production closer to urban areas where it's needed most is just sensible whether it's efficient or not. It'll become more feasible soon anyway with the current exponential growth of tech like renewable energy and power storage, as well as our advancements in building science and engineering.

Oh wait, what do you mean it’s one of the most common religions in the world and anyone in the West can barely take one step in their waking hours without being inundated with references to it?  Still, fuck you Zach.

I love the implication that Zach was super shy about his religion. Growing up in a suburb in a highly religious state, the super Christian kids dominated discussions and the social fabric in general all the time. We had ultra fundie teachers, medium religious teachers, and teachers that didn’t mention religion, but certainly no publicly-atheist ones and vanishingly few of other religions. It was the non religious or non Christian or even casually Christian-in-name-I-guess kids who had to watch what they said. 

Meanwhile Zach is over here being *coy* all *shy* to tell his bestie all about his *real* bestie, JHC.  UwU  better stop blushing and tell him already so your true bestie doesn’t set your friend on fire, Zach!

That wasn't an assault rifle you nitwit.

First of all, he experienced consequences. Being charged and caught up in a legal battle for a year or so is definitely a consequence.

Second, it was self defense. I don't get how you don't understand that. Nothing before mattered. What mattered was at that moment, he was acting in self defense. It is on video. You're arguing with video.

&gt; when your mindset is clearly for confrontation and you've expressed wanting to kill looters or whatever. 

The idea that anybody carrying a gun is looking for confrontation is just idiotic and ignorant. THat comes from you being ignorant and not understand the role guns play.

And I think you are talking about the video. There's nothing there that indicates he wanted to kill looters. And I believe that was actually an armed robbery. Fuck him for wanting to stop that. He should just let the police take care of it...

Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `Abdur Rahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, `Aisha said, ""I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"" Sahih Bukhari 5825, Vol. 7, Book 72, Hadith 715.

"hkkngla","&gt;What would have happened if Sang-Woo's plan didn't work in Tug-of-War. It didn't seem like there was any contingency for Il-nam.


This is a good question and definitely up for discussion. Maybe the man would have been fine to actually die in this scenario and it was worth it for him. Or there would have been some trick that occured while the losers were hanging while the rope wasn't cut yet. I don't think there's a real answer to this and everyone can decide for themselves.

&gt;So was the entire thing about ""equality"" in the games just BS? Il-nams presence is a complete violation of that notion. Even if he didn't tell others, he clearly knew the games and came equipped with strategy for his allies.

Well yes. The gamemakers talk about how equality and fairness is so important but it never is. I think that's one of the main themes of this show, how they are so privileged and ignorant that they think this game is in any way fair or positive for the players.

“Depends what you want. 
 
GSync with VSync will use GSync when below the monitor's maximum refresh rate, then switch to VSync when you go over it. This will prevent tearing, but in the event you go over your monitors refresh rate, you may encounter the input delay that VSync can cause. 
 
GSync without VSync will use GSync when below the monitor's maximum refresh rate, then turn off GSync and allow the game to run above the monitor's refresh rate if you go over it. This means you don't get the input delay VSync can cause, but it also means you may encounter tearing when over the monitor's refresh rate. 
 
If you have VSync enabled in Nvidia control panel, you should have it off in game. If you have it on, there's a chance it will try to use VSync when below the monitor's refresh rate as well.”

Regardless, familiarity does not need indifference here. It comes down to the parents being idiots. Millions and millions of Americans teach their kids correct firearm handling. MILLIONS. These kids grow up to be responsible gun owners. Our not, their choice. I couldn't care less of my kids want to own one eventually. But they'll learn the proper respect in case they do.

There are twice as many guns as women in the US, but we find it proper to teach the birds the right way to use their ducks, *just in case*. This should be right along sex ed.

"hhib8qy","This article will help you understand how gender and sex differ. To sum up quickly, sex is biological, gender refers to roles and traits determined by societies. This is also a hard fact to come to terms with and not something up for debate. 

https://www.coe.int/en/web/gender-matters/sex-and-gender

""The World Health Organisation summarises the difference between sex and gender in the following way:
Sex refers to “the different biological and physiological characteristics of males and females, such as reproductive organs, chromosomes, hormones, etc.”
Gender refers to ""the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. The concept of gender includes five important elements: relational, hierarchical, historical, contextual and institutional. While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviours – including how they should interact with others of the same or opposite sex within households, communities and work places. When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health17.”

As you can see, those who confuse gender and sex as you have done are simply, wrong and ignorant. That really is all there is to it. None of this is unsettled.

I am reminded of an anti-CRT law that was being debated in Tennessee, I believe. There were a few left news articles about how it was outrageous and ignorant that Tennessee was going to ban CRT. Then some right counter articles came out that specifically listed what was being banned by the legislature, and it actually seemed like a not horrible proposal. That was then countered with some more left articles pointing out that the things being banned were a bastardization and false representation of CRT in the first place (which is to say that the Tennessee legislature wasn’t actually banning CRT at all).

So I'll keep it simple -

I lived in Brooklyn. My one building on my block had 1,000 units. It was a minimum of $150,000 in annual income to afford the minimum rent requirements to live there. Many people had roommates or were a couple. The 1br, 2br and 3br were even more expensive and required more income.

That's $150,000,000 in taxable revenue my one building had living in it. Let's pick a low-end tax rate... at 30%, that's $45,000,000 in taxes that the denizens of my ONE building generated for state and federal taxes. ONE building on ONE block in ONE neighbourhood of NYC. There were a dozen other buildings around me with even more units and more expensive requirements.

So yes, our building contributes far, far more into revenue than whatever crap, podunk town you're in. By \*several\* orders of magnitude. If you receive state or federal funds? Our money, not yours. The vast, vast majority of that revenue was generated by the wealth of a city.

Your gas taxes, tolls and town taxes? Nope, they don't cover the costs of building and maintaining roads, not even slightly - it's us, the tax payers in cities that fund your lifestyle and car-dependence.

Doing Ouija boards as a new witch is just very very stupid. I have been told this way to many times. Your ""new-age"" friends seem to be using that as term for ""jumping into witchcraft because of a fad and getting themselves into trouble due to being disrespectful and ignorant"" That may not be the case they just didn't do the research but when I hear stories like this - it is what it usually turns out to be.

If you are conjuring spirits, there are steps you should take. Cleanse your space, meditate, make sure you have protections in place. I.e. Wards, sigils, protection bottles. Make sure you have a protected space. Use a contained medium. Or best of all don't do it unless you have a veteran practitioner to help you. Not all things are good and even things that are good can hurt you if you are ignorant or disrespectful. My friend told me of a genuinely horrifying story involving one of his closed practice deities when somebody was being ignorant - it didn't turn out well.

You can attract negative entities with your mood, fear, actions or intentions. And you get rid of them by banishing and or cleansing. So again, if they were doing something without protection that they weren't supposed to they can get a negative entity.

There are some theories I have as to why the Jesus thing ""works"" I think. One is its kind of like putting blinders on. The entity is probably still there making them tired, leaching, they just closed themselves off my constantly ""turning to Jesus"" when they see it. Another would be that if it is a trickster or other leaching entities, the entity gets bored and leaves or the person doesn't have that negative emotion they latched on to anymore so they leave.

She's right. And I'm going to be kind but honest with you. You're a parent. You've been a parent for 10 years. You should know how to properly feed your children.

Which lead to the realization that I can't take what the church teaches at face value. It didn't invalidate Catholicism in my eyes. After all, the pope and cardinals and everyone else are human and could theoretically (maybe even unknowingly) reject god out of arrogance and push their own views as his.

But I now needed to know where I could find a reliable way to know the ""god's truth"".

Which lead me down a path of trying to figure out who I can trust. Can I trust the cardinals? Can I trust the Catechism? Can I trust the bible?

Turns out that after looking into it all of those things are unreliable.

I also learned that while I was always taught that Jews reject Jesus for bad reasons after listening to their arguments it seems clear to me that they have very valid reasons to reject him. Jesus couldn't have been the messiah. Christians twist the OT in extreme ways to try and make him fit that description, at times even changing it. Also the Christian obsession with painting Jews as incapable of understanding their own scripture is (quite honestly) disgusting.

"hfkzue5","That's a seriously ignorant and dishonest argument, for four reasons:

1. You've made the same old lazy and baseless presupposition that even our most advanced societies are structured with a fundamentally male hierarchy (patriarchy), which hasn't been true in the workplace for decades and hasn't been true in any other facet of most Western societies for centuries.  
There's absolutely zero evidence for it because both men and women are perfectly free to choose any career path they want within their abilities. I'll also add that some of the most powerful rulers in history have also been women.  
We all have to face competition in our respective careers if we want to excel, and not all of us prevail against it, but idiots think that just because this also applies to women must mean that they're being gatekept from jobs, despite the fact that all of the ones ***most*** male-dominated are the tough and dangerous ones like in this video.  
It's funny that feminists only acknowledge the jobs that fewer women take a voluntary interest in, and out of those they only complain about the ones that happen to be high in income and/or authority.

2. You're making the claim that these people are only working to keep your lights on as pawns in some scheme to keep them down, and you're using their very existence as some self-evident result of a corrupt and oppressive system.  
By the logic you've used here, the only way you'd consider society to not be corrupt or tyrannical is if you didn't have electricity, as well as supposedly all of the other vital utilities and facilities provided by hard and hazardous male-dominated job roles that you denigrate the importance of so thoughtlessly.  
Not only are these highly skilled jobs, but ones like these pay far from minimum wage, and they keep your lights on as I said. Somebody has to do it, and you should be thankful that they do, instead of maintaining your strange combination of contempt and pity for them - we can't all be managers or doctors.

3. You somehow reconcile your claims I've outlined in points 1 and 2 to be in any way congruent with eachother.  
You've insisted on the existence of a systemic patriarchy for male dominance, but also use the claim that it hurts men just as much as women as some kind of proof of its existence, when in fact it's the opposite. If it's hurting men just as much as women then it's not a patriarchy by definition. It's just corruption, if not simple reality.

4. You claim that men only dominate the tough and dangerous jobs because they want to feel manly. Words can't describe how disgustingly sexist and ignorant that is, it's in fact one of the most misandrist things I've witnessed someone attempt to claim.  
What if someone said that women only dominate the careers of nursing, pharmacy, animal care etc because it lets them appear and feel womanly? Wouldn't that be an abhorrently sexist thing to suggest?

You need to seriously take a look at the deceitful double standards you use to excuse your resentment for men, and develop your axioms beyond that of a teenage third-wave feminist.",1633510028,"that's a seriously ignorant and dishonest argument, for four reasons:  1.","ignorant and dishonest","ignorant","and",FALSE,"seriously ignorant and dishonest","dishonest","seriously",NA,1

If anything the real propaganda is that he was a Saint. Much like how we're taught about Thomas Jefferson.


But Gandhi also wrote his views down.

All quotes taken from Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG).
Sept. 26, 1896: “Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir* whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.” — Vol. 1, p. 410


Sept. 24, 1903: “We believe as much in the purity of race as we think they do… We believe also that the white race of South Africa should be the predominating race.” — Vol. 3, p. 256


Feb. 15, 1904: “Under my suggestion, the Town Council must withdraw the Kaffirs from the Location. About this mixing of the Kaffirs with the Indians, I must confess I feel most strongly. I think it is very unfair to the Indian population.” — Vol. 3, p. 429



Sept. 5, 1905: “The decision to open the school for all Coloured children is unjust to the Indian community, and is a departure from the assurance given… that the school will be reserved for Indian children only.” — Vol. 4, p. 402



Sept. 2, 1907: “From these views expressed by a White we have a lesson to learn: We must encourage the Whites too. It is a short-sighted policy to employ, through sheer niggardliness, a Kaffir for washing work. If we keep in view the conditions in this country and patronize the Whites, whenever proper and necessary, then every such White will serve as an advertisement for the Indian trader.” — Vol. 6, p. 276



Feb. 29, 1908: “The British rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that, like the Kaffirs who can be pleased with toys and pins, we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.” — Vol. 8, p. 167



Mar. 7, 1908: “We were all prepared for hardships, but not quite for this experience. We could understand not being classed with the whites, but to be placed on the same level with the Natives seemed too much to put up with.” — Vol. 8, p. 198


Mar. 7, 1908: “Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised – the convicts even more so…. The reader can easily imagine the plight of the poor Indian thrown into such company!” — Vol. 8, p. 199


Jan. 16, 1909: “I have, though, resolved in my mind on an agitation to ensure that Indian prisoners are not lodged with Kaffirs…. I observed with regret that some Indians were happy to sleep in the same room as the Kaffirs…. This is a matter of shame to us. We may entertain no aversion to Kaffirs, but we cannot ignore the fact that there is no common ground between them and us in the daily affairs of life.” — Vol. 9, p. 257



Jan. 23, 1909: “I acquainted the Governor with what had happened and told him there was urgent need for separate lavatories for Indians. I also told him that Indian prisoners should never be lodged with Kaffirs. The Governor immediately issued an order for a lavatory for Indians to be sent on from the Central Gaol. Thus, from the next day the difficulty about lavatories disappeared.” — Vol. 9, p. 270



June 5, 1909: “I received from General Smuts two books on religion, and I inferred from this that it was not under his orders that I had been subjected to hardships, but that it was the result of his negligence and that of others, as also a consequence of the fact that we are equated with the Kaffirs.” — Vol. 9, p. 355



Dec. 2, 1910: “Some Indians do have contacts with Kaffir women. I think such contacts are fraught with grave danger. Indians would do well to avoid them altogether.” — Vol. 10, p. 414

The term “Kaffir” is a pejorative South African term for black people which is equivalent to the ‘n’ word. Use of this term has been a criminal offense in South Africa since 1975. Despite always using it to describe black Africans, Gandhi was fully aware of the offensive nature of the word. This is demonstrated by Gandhi’s comment during a religious conflict in India, when he said: “If ‘Kaffir’ is a term of opprobrium, how much more so is Chandal?” [CWMG, Vol. 28, p. 62] “Chandal” is a racist term for low-caste Hindus.",1632427828,"29, 1908: “the british rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that, like the kaffirs who can be pleased with toys and pins, we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.” — vol. 8, p.","lowly and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so lowly and ignorant","lowly",NA,"so",0
"hdzh0o5","A rather large group of people took great pleasure in hacking someone. A popular bully decided that their latest victim was so weak and ignorant that they could do anything they wanted, for as long as they wanted, as openly as they wanted. We're not talking just a simple hack. This is systematic breach of civil rights and federal laws taking place over a period of years.

See, this group preyed on person's good nature, hacked her phones (yes plural). Set up a smear campaign, and so much more. Then they talked smack to her fully admitting to a number of their crimes. 

What we have here is what I like to call a light bulb moment. A particular member of the group loves to go overboard with their abusive rhetoric. Last night that person was told a few keys phrases that might have let slip just how obvious, traceable, illegal, and potentially damaging to the group their actions really are.

A key bit of info was dropped last night. After conferring with one another the team thinks that further obfuscation of their activities is necessary. Waste of time but even so there are protocols. You're gonna see a lot of people metaphorically 'running for the hills' today. 

We've now gotten to my favorite part of K-Dramas! Will the group of bullies realize just how far away from dry land they are? Do they have a realistic take on how deep the water is? Will they lash out? Will they attempt make amends? This is the critical moment folks!! The *hunters* paused briefly to gloat after breaking federal law for the third time this week! There was something about the steely resolve, and the no nonsense confidence that could be heard in the voice of their prey that has the senior members of the pack spooked. 

They had to stop and ask themselves, did they catch themselves in time? 

I don't know but I wonder. You gotta give it up for the underdog folks! They don't know what, they don't know when, they don't know how, because all they were concerned with was a a why! You know what that means ladies and gentlemen? At some point during the last few rushes the pack's star group of beloved *hunters* FINALLY noticed that they had actually become ***the hunted***!!!!!!

"hd126h9","&gt; No, I'm just not going to waste my time reading and responding to you. You are not the harbringer of ideas, you're just a little man who's obsessed with politics and attaches himself to a dying ideology. I have better things to do than to talk to someone who ignores half of what I say and has lost the context of the words I've written. I don't care for such bad faith argumentation.

Yeah because you lost and you have no way of making the claims you do about anarchy without yourself becoming authoritarian.

&gt; There are better ways to learn than from a man as obtuse and dull as you who's main project here is to desperately try to confuse anarchists into being Marxists while having so little actual knowledge of both anarchism and my own ideology that they think I support direct democracy. How are you supposed to succeed if you A. don't know anything about anarchism and B. go into it demanding that it isn't different from Marxism or that it's illogical? It appears you're just a stupid mother-fucker

Nah I already clarified the direct democracy thing youre just being a liar and in bad faith at this point. And yet theres still no example of irreoncilabities between anarchism and Marxism so it seems you have failed to prove this point throughout the entire debate.

&gt; A man who thinks everyone in China accepts Marxism let alone knows anything other than that it exists and that they adhere to your very specific variant of it (when their Marxism is nothing more than red-colored nationalism). A man who is so delusional and ignorant that they'd patron a dying political party they aren't even a part of. I can learn from people who are less decietful, ignorant, and intentionally dismissive of concerns than you. You're worse than me; at least I respond to everything other people write. At least I am willing to admit my faults in discourse.

You literally said you weren't gonna respond to what I said in that other comment chain. I ask again. Are you a bot dude? Id believe it. Explains a lot of the *not quite right* responses and how poor your reading comprehension as been. Im just trying to make sense of the daftness demonstrated by you.

Oh and obviously not everyone, duh lol I never said that.

&gt; This will undoubtedly hurt you because it is nothing more than the truth. I wondered why you intentionally ignored my comments, the parts where I talked about my activities, why you took my comments out of context. I know why. You have no real way of addressing what I said in full. This entire conversation, even the idea that anarchism and Marxism share goals (which relied on you refusing to properly define the relationship between dialectical materialism and science) is purely was always in bad faith.

Dude Reddit comments suuuuuuck for debate. Im saying the exact same thing you are in this paragraph right back at you. Which is why we should actually have a VERBAL debate on discord.

&gt; This has always been desperate for you. I haven't insulted you besides dismissing your ideology and yet you go ballistic when I do. It appears to me that you're not as comfortable in your beliefs as I am. I am perfectly willing to go do something else with full faith in my own ideas; regardless of whether you understand them at all.

Nah you've been insulting since the beginning and now you are denying it when its literally timestamped in our comments. Once again I have proven the lies from your mouth.

&gt; It's odd how you ascribe my having of a life and a desire to do other things than talk with a brick wall as being an example of anarchism. Especially given that you still don't know anything anarchism to such an extent that any conversation about it with you goes nowhere because you always assume what anarchism is. And then you complain when anarchists don't bother explaining it to you, lie that no one on these forums has tried to explain it. How do you know what's an example of anarchism if you don't know what anarchism is?

Oh Im not allowed to draw conclusions about all anarchists by how you're acting but you are about Marxists? Pretty authoritarian bruh.

&gt; Perhaps this is an example of anarchism. An example of disassociating with someone as pitiful, stupid, and dull as you, a person liked by nobody and relies on delusions to keep them going. A person whose completely committed to a cult and is incapable of recognizing that they are. There are always better things to do. You are worth ignoring not debating or conversing, just like what people have done to you your entire life.

Cool, more anarchist harassment. And you are using anarchy to justify it, very interesting.

"hcv35p2","&gt;You've said earlier that this isn't about safety, its about control. That would only be true in the vaccine was ineffective and a vaccine mandate did nothing to protect the public from covid.

No, this is not a binary split.  This isn't a yes or no.  This is not a safety versus no safety.  

To make this point extremely clear, if the government were to make it mandatory for every person to drink a glass of milk each day, it can be justified using the same exact logic of ""safety"".  Forcing this would increase the amount of vitamin D and calcium which are important to your health and safety.  Now, if the government forced you to drink a glass of milk every day, what would you say to that?  Would you say that they are doing it for your safety and therefore are justified in their actions?

This is control under the guise of safety.

&gt;Thats not strictly true. They will have to undergo weekly testing but it will be their companies who fire them.

No, that's bullshit and you know it.  The government is literally going to fine companies for not complying with their mandate.  Saying it's the ""company"" that will be firing the person is like going to jail for robbery because you had a gun to your head and were told to empty out the cash register.  

&gt;And its not like time will be an issue as federal works will have around 75 days to get vaccinated and healthcare workers until late October.

The issue is the forced vaccination.  Who cares about the time issue when the first part is already trampling all over people's rights.  That's like saying ""You need to get a tattoo of a penis on your forehead.  Don't worry though, you have 6 months to take care of it.""  The problem isn't the 6 months or 75 days.  The problem is the getting a penis tattooed on your forehead.

&gt;It isn't though. Vaccine mandates aren't a human rights violation.

Yes, it is.  When you restrict access to jobs that are federally required to mandate vaccinations, when you start pressuring businesses to require vaccinations in order for people to shop there, when you start restricting services based on vaccination status, you are violating a persons civil rights.  

That's what your little media article failed to mention.

&gt;If the government was pinning you down and jabbing you while you were restrained, that would be but mandating a vaccine to participate in society is not a human rights violation.

What's the difference?  If the end result is exactly the same, what's the difference between them pinning you down to give you the vaccine or letting you agree with their decision?  The end result is the same.  You don't need to pin someone down, just destroy their entire life until they submit.

&gt;The US isn't the only country in the world. Global trade will facilitate infections.

I'm replying to your comment which specifically stated the US.

&gt;What about the number hospitalized? 

[~4,000 hospitalizations amount youth.](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html)  

That's just slightly more than the number of kids that commit suicide in a given year for reference.  And suicide means they died which is far worse than being hospitalized.

&gt;What about the adults those kids come into contact with?

Kids are less likely to transmit the virus.  A lot of this is due to the asymptomatic nature of the virus in kids.  The most common bit of misinformation around kids transmission talks about ""viral load"" as the key component but viral load isn't the same as transmission.

&gt;What about their covid contraction rates across their life time?

No clue what you are saying here.  It's arguably better that they get COVID if they are young such that their body creates the antibodies and antigens against it.  We won't know if that's going to be a consideration going forward since we don't know how long COVID will be around.

&gt;Also, this has nothing to do with Biden's vaccine mandate. Schools already mandate vaccines.

Did Biden's vaccine mandate somehow not apply to private schools as well?  I thought that it was pretty clear with the ""Every business with more than 100 employees"" statement which would include private schools as well.

&gt;If you're arguing about lockdowns, then you have to look at safety risks to people outside that age bracket as children will act as infection vectors to their parents.

Is that worth more kids committing suicide?  Is that worth more kids getting depression?  Is that worth increases in domestic violence?  

This is what bothers me about people like you, you are so hyperfocused on COVID that you don't give a shit about anything else.  I'm very aware that you completely ignored everything about suicide rates in kids.  It's noticeable that you ignored it.

How many kids need to blow their brains out before you start thinking ""maybe there's a bigger concern than COVID for them""?  I don't think you care about any of these factors.  I don't think you care about the impact this has on anyone.  I think the thing you care about is COVID which is so childish and ignorant that you are going to cause more harm than good.

&gt;Your allegory falls apart when you consider you taking a risk and getting ill puts other people at risk. 

Your health is not my responsibility.  It's amazing how selfish people like you are when it comes to COVID.  You are responsible for your own health.  You choose how you want to mitigate your risks.  You choose what risks are acceptable for you.  

I guess it's just easier for you to blame everyone else than to take responsibility for your own actions.  

&gt;And unlike vehicles, covid cant be easily detected and easily avoided from a distance away.

Just like with the example of crossing the road, you can take precautions to mitigate risk factors.  Social distancing.  Wearing a mask.  Going to places where you feel safe.  Not ignoring obvious health concerns.  Taking vitamins.  Eating healthy.  Exercising.  The list of ways that you can mitigate COVID is extensive.  

For example, if I'm outside at my son's baseball game, I can effectively social distance and so I don't feel that something like wearing a mask is mitigating any meaningful risk.  If I'm sitting on a bus on the way to work where I can't control the environment in any way, there are increased risks so I may take additional precautions.  I might move to a different area of the bus if an area is congested.  When I get off the bus, I'll wash my hands with soap or at the very least with sanitizer.  

This is all extremely simple concepts to help mitigate the chances of you getting COVID.  

&gt;If covid somehow wasn't infectious and you were just risking your own life, you'd have a good point here.

The point is perfectly valid.  The idea that you can dismiss your own responsibility in any of these cases because of COVID is just wrong.  You are responsible for your own actions whether you want to blame others or not.  The sooner you realize it the better.  COVID doesn't care who you blame.",1631650261,"i think the thing you care about is covid which is so childish and ignorant that you are going to cause more harm than good.  &gt;your allegory falls apart when you consider you taking a risk and getting ill puts other people at risk.","childish and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so childish and ignorant","childish",NA,"so",0

For me, it was a first date. I decided to try one of those apps that blur your photo, and as a result the woman I was matched with was larger than I was used to.

What did I do? Well, the fact that our fifth wedding anniversary is coming up in a few months is probably your answer.

Now, don't get me wrong: you have a right to be attracted to whatever you're attracted to. We, as humans, don't control attraction. But you should also reevaluate your emphasis on attraction. The problem with appearances is that they change over time. Let's say you meet a woman who looks exactly like you want a woman to look like. Well, what happens when she gains 15 lb in what my wife calls ""happy weight""? (I gained more like 30! To be sure I was close to ""underweight"" on the BMI when we met.) What happens if she gets pregnant? What happens if neither of these things happen but 10 years past and you suddenly discover gray hairs or wrinkles? _Looks change._ What doesn't change is personality... And if you want to create a relationship that will stand the test of time, you root it in personality.

Do you not see how small-minded and ignorant that is? Do you not see how little effort you've put in to understanding the *actual* arguments against govt run healthcare? Not what mainstream Republican senators say, but the *actual* arguments?

I have my beliefs *because* of what I've seen, what I've researched, how it will impact my family, etc. My wife is in a social media support group for her disease, which is extremely rare and consists of multiple benign tumors growing on her intestines and intestinal wall, causing massive inflammation and flare-ups which can disrupt her ability to digest food. 

The consensus in the group is: you make it to America or you die. That includes from the UK, from Nordic countries, the middle east, east Asia... Why? Because universal healthcare systems are SHIT at handling rare diseases. They have a lack of specialists, and the government budgeting care means that they do cost/benefit analysis of who is worth devoting large amounts of resources and research to help. Rare diseases often get tossed to the bottom of the pile.

My wife is alive *because* of the system we have in place here. Is it too expensive? Yes. But things can be done about that. The reason why it's expensive is not just ""greed."" That's like blaming the snow on top of the iceberg for the Titanic, it's just so confoundingly ignorant and demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the real roadblocks in place.

That’s like saying women with small breasts or butts are oppressed, that people with large noses are oppressed, etc. You do not have prolonged societal repercussions for being “short.”

"hbiquph","It is a massive part of the problem! In fact, I would say it’s the bulk of the problem. However, the problem needs to be addressed before that public encounter happens. 

Women need to understand how men feel and how they perceive the world…but here’s the thing, and I know it absolutely seems like this is opposite to your own experiences (and I don’t belittle that at all)…

But it seems to me, in talking to women, that the interest to understand men and how they perceive things is absolutely there and very genuine. Women have these conversations with each other all of the time. They go on women forums asking what certain behaviors from men mean and what they should do about them…

But speaking as a female, myself, when we ask men these same questions they appear to not feel safe speaking about them, not think it’s important to share that information, or not want to waste the time or word count on it. 

For women, as well as men, I’m sure, it really feels like we’re being asked to empathize with the opposite sex without being given any information as to how. 

I figured out a way to kind of hack my way around the barriers there, but most women seem to give up and decide it’s impossible. 

If we could just do something to resolve this disconnect of communication between the sexes, I think that a lot of the issues of men’s rights would cease to be issues, because when women heard men advocating for their rights, they would be able to empathize on both sides of the line. 

As it stands, it’s easy for me to empathize with being raped, as a woman. It’s not easy for me to understand what it must feel like to be raped as a man. Some things are obvious - like the humiliation, the disempowerment, the confusion, the way that it forces you to distrust and fear the opposite sex in a way you can’t possibly help or control…I can get that far, because I’m sure those feelings are the same. 

But there are other feelings involved in what females experience when they’re raped by men that men wouldn’t experience when they’re raped by women. Like the fear of being mutilated and murdered, and the terror of waiting for your next period, having to imagine the horror of being faced with a choice to have a baby out of wedlock or get an abortion, feeling like your body can’t move because you’re not strong enough - these are things that men wouldn’t experience in the same way. 

That being said, and correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that men are more likely to commit suicide as a result of being raped than women are, and I assume a portion of that must be society’s psychotic reaction to a man coming out with the truth about his rape. I also don’t know if this includes men being raped by men, or what… 

I’m assuming that, much in the way there are emotional realities that would be predominantly female, there must be emotional realities that would be predominantly male. I think, for example, the sense of shame and humiliation may be far worse for men, given the functional nature of female on male rape. 

But all I can do is spend hours of my time imagining and running through hypotheticals, or trying to find one rare male online who will actually see me as a human and talk to me. 

Every time that I try to approach men to better understand them - this is the reception I receive. 

I was once of the school of thought that women can’t rape men because I just didn’t understand how erections work. I never had a penis. I feel absolutely, horrendously, atrociously horrible for that now - because I spoke to men who corrected me and I realized how ridiculously sexist and ignorant that was…

But I just couldn’t empathize with something I had no information about. 

I think you guys think we women don’t try, and I think a lot of women are actually trying so much harder than you think they are…but it’s unfortunately true that they fear you. They fear the way men treat them when they try to talk or ask questions. 

I do blame feminism, but I think there has to be something more going on here because this has been a problem since I was a kid, and men were not hated when I was a kid. I’m not going to stand here and tell you that there was no systemic sexism and that men were not oppressed with responsibility and groomed to be work mules by our culture - because all of that was absolutely true. 

But the perception of the male sex when I was a child was far different than what it is today, and the communication barriers seemed, if anything, possibly worse back then, then they are today. 

So what can we do to fix this problem of this massive divide between male and female perceptions? 

I’ve tried to share female perceptions with men before - the overwhelming response is that they do not care. I’ve tried asking, but they don’t seem to share, by in large, either. 

Why does it seem like men hate women this much? I don’t try looking back at history any more than I have to because if I do, my perception of what I’m reading will simply confirm that bias.",1630720307,"i feel absolutely, horrendously, atrociously horrible for that now - because i spoke to men who corrected me and i realized how ridiculously sexist and ignorant that was…  but i just couldn’t empathize with something i had no information about.","sexist and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"ridiculously sexist and ignorant","sexist",NA,"ridiculously",0

Some people say that but they never explained why.

It's obviously bs.

1. You lose the 20 base damage on maxed E no matter what your build is.
2. Q max is not gonna be stronger because Q has not been changed (no brainer) and E is actually still very strong (obviously it gets nerfed because the base damage is a bit too cheesy), even after the nerf only 2 maxed E shots will still have more base damage (2x105) than hitting both parts of maxed Q (2x85), also most of the time you hit more than just 2 shots, also E can reset.
3. Total E damage including base damage interacts with crit, attack speed and increased crit damage (IE passive) and gets multiplied, which means builds with more crit are hit slightly harder by this nerf than builds that have only attack speed and less crit
4. The AD ratio increase is so low that you only compensate the lost base damage at full build.

I listen to country music, and where I live in Boston that's not really popular. There's a girl my girlfriend hangs out with who I can't stand for many reasons, the main one is how ""progressive"" and ""woke"" she is and she makes everything out to be a racial class gender etc issue and how she's standing up to it, we all know that type of person. 

She has complained how she has to listen to my ""racist music"". She called the ballad of Ira Hayes racist, which is a song literally celebrating the heroic deeds of a native American, by Johnny cash who spent his career fighting for native rights. He called Merle haggards ""fighting side of me"" racist, and ""okie from muskogee"" ""fascistic"".

My gf wanted me to pick her and her friends up and my music was playing in the car. She kept complaining about country music and I just ignored it, it was getting annoying then came the point where she flat out asked me if I was a racist because I only listed to music by white people. I responded with ""you are so fucking dumb and ignorant, that sing playing, ""burgers and fries"" is by Charlie Pride, he's probably my second favorite singer. He's black, and I don't think about the skin color of the artists I listen to"" 

Her jaw dropped and her face turned red. I told her to be quiet and one more word out of her and she's getting out of the car. 

After this ordeal my girlfriend said I was too harsh on her and I embarrassed her. I told her I don't care, I'm so sick of her. I told her I'm never driving her friend again and now my gf is pissed

According to her, it’s actually somewhat expected to give up your seat for certain people- namely the elderly but also for pregnant people. Obviously some people decide to be rude and not give up their seats, but it’s quite common, especially when compared to the west.

She thinks it’s rather rude and ignorant that westerners don’t give up their seats and honestly I have to agree with her on that.

"h8jwcfp","In games my friends group runs, we've introduced the concept of the ""player contract"" which is literally a chance at the beginning of the game to talk about exactly this stuff.  The GM describes the flavor of their game and the kinds of themes we might expect to see and asks what kind of a game the players would like to play.  It's allowable to amend the player contract during game.  You can stop play and say ""this isn't working for me.""

When my son was really little, I found violence against children to be incredibly triggering and always asked that we **not** have that kind of stuff happen in game.

Anyone who complains about this kind of ""limitation on their expression"" (I've seen people do it) is someone I don't want to play with ever.  

I run one shot games called ""the Adventures of Captain Atom"" which are based on cheesy black and white era rocket punk SciFi movies.  The players play a bunch of 1950s SciFi stereotypes on ridiculous cosmic adventures (Captain Atom on the Planet of Dinosaurs, Captain Atom vs. the Ant Men, Captain Atom and the Menace From Mercury).  I have a sound board of old timey movie music and terrible sound effects and I get a kick out of describing the terrible special affects and how the cave of the giant beetles in Planet of Dinosaurs uses the same set as the asteroid mine in Ant Men.  We often have brief cut scenes where I, as the GM, play the director and the players play the actors playing their characters and I berate them for going off script.  These games can get all kinds of misogynistic, but part of the player contract is that we're doing this to parody and poke fun at how over the top the culture, and especially film culture in this era was.  My director character regularly sexually harasses actresses, expresses skepticism about female characters fighting or piloting rocket ships and uses words like ""dame"" and ""broad."" He's not intended to glorify that, he's intended to be a caricature of how stupid, toxic and ignorant that kind of person was (and is). 

The point is, that prior to running any of these games, we explicitly have a conversation about misogyny and toxic masculinity in old B movies.  Also racism (the robot / bug man / swamp monster is the only black guy on the cast).  I ask my players and if they're ok with parodying this behavior to laugh at it and poke fun at it.  I've never had anyone say they're not, but if I did, we would tone it down.

I encourage people to introduce this kind of an idea to their gaming groups. If your DM had just had a conversation and made some mature and clear agreements with his players, he wouldn't have hurt you and lost your friendship.",1628700195,"he's not intended to glorify that, he's intended to be a caricature of how stupid, toxic and ignorant that kind of person was (and is).","toxic and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"toxic and ignorant","toxic",NA,NA,0

"h8f8ugk","&gt; youd be ok with the government coming in and taking action against people for certain things they say publicly?

I don’t think that’s what they’re saying. They said, “Public health concerns . . . can override certain individual freedoms.” That’s the same position the U.S. Supreme Court has taken on the First Amendment right to freedom of speech: a person does not have the right to tell “fire!” in a crowded theater.

All of our freedoms are limited, and can be suspended if there is an overriding public interest, because we live in a society and humans are susceptible to irrational behaviors and extreme conditions. When humans hear someone yell “fire” in a crowded theater, they do not respond with rational inquiry into whether there is actually a fire, and if so what they all should do about it; instead, they literally act like livestock, with panic spreading until they stampede and trample others to death. Humans create extreme conditions through social failures, resulting in war in which we openly kill one another. As a result, in order to get back to some semblance of normality, our President is authorized to declare martial law and suspend the right to habeas corpus, as Lincoln did in the Civil War.

Similarly, humans are subject to extreme natural conditions, like the outbreak of a deadly pathogen. If there is a terrifyingly dangerous pandemic and you have people spreading misinformation that causes significant harm to society—because people are animals and not always governed by rational behavior and thought processes—it might be worth strictly limiting the right to freedom of speech.

Are we there yet? That’s a judgment call. COVID isn’t Ebola in its fatality rate, but it also isn’t the seasonal flu. Combine that fact with (A) a cult of personality surrounding a polarizing and influential political leader who lies all the time for his own personal gain, which tends to align with being reactionary, (B) a movement among public intellectuals whose existence depends on their viewpoints being reactionary, and (C) a public so excessively selfish and ignorant that they feel like mask mandates are significant limitations of their freedom, and you get over 600,000 excess dead Americans in about 1.5 years.

For comparison, World War II resulted in about 420,000 American deaths over the course of 5+ years. At the time, the American people and its leaders thought that was a sufficient threat that it justified the suspension of the civil rights of Japanese Americans, confiscating their property and placing them into concentration camps. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that action in the *Korematsu* case. Although the Court later held that *Korematsu* was wrongly decided, hindsight, as they say, is 20/20.",1628610987,"combine that fact with (a) a cult of personality surrounding a polarizing and influential political leader who lies all the time for his own personal gain, which tends to align with being reactionary, (b) a movement among public intellectuals whose existence depends on their viewpoints being reactionary, and (c) a public so excessively selfish and ignorant that they feel like mask mandates are significant limitations of their freedom, and you get over 600,000 excess dead americans in about 1.5 years.","selfish and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"excessively selfish and ignorant","selfish",NA,"excessively",0

"h7zzlq9","I guess you missed the I spoke about DFS certification and testing. But you apparently just overlooked it.

I'll reiterate again so maybe this time you will see that I stated that DFS radar detection is tested but it's only tested At least for the purposes of FCC certification to confirm it will detect legitimate radars not that it will not trigger false positives, And that it is likely and probable that it would lean on the side of triggering a false positive rather than continuing with a false negative because a false negative would allow it to interfere with a lawful user of that frequency and interfere with radar whereas a false positive would only affect a user who is a secondary user of the frequency band anyway, and would only affect that user's Wi-Fi which is a much lower priority.

Also you've basically proven my point partially, Because apparently you're saying that a random piece of junk access point is just coincidentally making a transmission that just happens to look like a specific radar signature, based on what you said it needs to be a very specific signature. Yeah that's probably pretty unlikely.

And here's the other thing. You are talking in absolutes. It could very well be possible that the DFS detections are legitimate that due to a change of conditions the radars signature are now detectable or it could very well be possible that none of the access points around the OP But some other device is causing the issue, could even be an incidental radiator. But again you are absolutely convinced that It couldn't possibly be the Unifi's. And again no matter what you say you do not have the information available to you to make that statement.

And again I never said it was the Unifi's fault, But yet you are So hell bent and ignorant that these Unifi's have perfect DFS detection that there could be no other possibility that it must be those other access points, you didn't even seem to think for a second of any other possibilities that it just had to be those access points.

"h5qyfgi","In the 60s, some researcher wanted to see what would happen if he created a 'utopia' for rats by providing them an unlimited supply of food, water and nesting materials in a safe enclosure. He wanted to study the effects of overpopulation.

He did design the cage with some caveats though. One side of the cage had feeders that were slightly more difficult to eat from, and nesting apartment-like structures that took longer to climb to. The side of the cage with the resources that were easier to access could only be accessed by two narrow bridges.

The rats ended up creating an incredibly fucked up society. All the female rats ended up in the side that was easier to live in, and basically became harems for the alpha rats, which would spend all day guarding the bridges to prevent the other male rats from getting across. The vast majority of male rats just ended up in a massive pile eating all day and doing nothing. These rats were also extremely violent and often hurt each other.

There was an entire population of 'homosexual' male rats that didn't compete with the alpha rats and were allowed to pass freely. The alpha male rats even mated with these homosexual male rats. It was theorized that these rats weren't actually homosexual, it was just a strategy to survive more easily.

The females eventually stopped caring for their young. Infant mortality went through the roof as they started to ignore them. Female rats in the wild will usually try to escape the males if they don't feel like breeding, but in this case there was nowhere to go so they were continuously raped.

The final generations of rats were extremely strange because their mothers neglected them too much while weaning. The males seemed to have no interest in breeding at all and just spent all day grooming themselves and eating. The females didn't care either and even when they did bear young, mostly left them to die.

The researcher concluded that the rat population would eventually go extinct if left to continue, and the rats were too socially fucked up to be rehabilitated into a normal rat enclosure. Overpopulation never ended up being much of an actual issue. His takeaway from the experiments was that a society of animals with no stimulation in the form of mental stimulation via foraging, avoiding predators and actually having to work to survive would eventually go extinct.

The experiments depressed him and he feared a future where the same thing would happen to humans. That once resources were abundant enough and we no longer needed to innovate or work, we would become so lazy and ignorant that we would go extinct. Most modern science disagrees with these conclusions because obviously it is difficult to compare rats to humans, but the experiments are infamous and horrifying.

So they just decided to take a piece of paper allegedly given to SEGOB (again why SEGOB) at face value despite the fact that they couldnt track it to any individual or couldnt confirm its legitimacy in any possible way?

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know how that would make it better, that means the president is so stupid and ignorant that its willing to believe anything as long as it suits his agenda and everyone around him is so equally stupid or lacks the balls to maybe think ""well this is a serious allegation, maybe we should look a little into it instead of going public and saying its true"".

&amp;#x200B;

Its that or the president is simply following fascism 101 and starts inventing conspiracy theories and pooling all his enemies together and claiming they are the problem of the nation, and yet claims ""i simply heard it somewhere"" when people point out the obvious slander.

&amp;#x200B;

Their cultists will repeat it like the sheep they are and the less informed would fall into the Big Lie fallacy and believe it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which secretariat digitalized the document is irrelevant and informs nothing about where it was made or who made it.

No, its not irrelevant, if government had indeed received a serious allegation the original document would be in the hands of security organization, like FGR or CISEN who would be looking at the legitimacy of such a leak before anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your reduction to absurdum twisted the argument so much that it made itself useless. No side has proven anything about where the document was made or who made it, nor has claimed anything absurd about where it could have been made or who could have made it.

Nope, im merely illustrating the problem of asking someone to prove a negative, which is impossible. That pretty much illustrates my point, AMLO isnt simply a politician with supporters, he is a cult leader with cultists.

The fact that you are so willing to debase your intellectual honesty to defend such a ridiculous fabrication and claim proves it. Basically anything that AMLO says is the absolute truth because he is the cult leader.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't think your final rebuttal made complete sense... I'm not entirely sure what you tried to say there.

Of course basic scientific logic doesnt makes sense, if it did you wouldnt be an AMLO cultist wouldnt you?

So during another tuesday of warchief killing, i was leaving the soon to be mine fort to go attend to other business, i was looking for a necromancer i think? It doesn't matter, i don't remember this part very well just the end so i could be wrong, but some random captain decided to interrupt and ambush me, he was not alone which was fine, i killed him and decided to kill his grunts too, until suddenly i got hit, it was the last hit i could take before death, who hit me? It was a grunt, an ugly, smelly, fat grunt, he finished me off, he was confident and cocky like all the other lucky ones, i didn't care i would just kill him and be done with it, it's how all of us always work after all, but then, lithlad had no space for more captains, especially in the bottom, he had to make himself some space as usual. He could have chosen 5 of 7 spots, but. he. HAD. to. take. one. of. the. two. forbidden spots.

It feels biphobic, as at least some of these writers may well have been involved in same sex relationships earlier in their lives that we don't know about, and it is unfortunately still common to erase bisexuality in the community by making these kinds of statements toward people who lean more hetero in their attractions despite being attracted to people of the same gender. 

That said, my hope is that we see an influx of MM centered stories in the traditional sphere. FF stories have found a foothold to a greater extent than MM outside of romance and erotica, or at least that has been what I've noticed. I admit I don't have as much time to read as I used to, though. 

In any case, I find it tactless and ignorant that publishing trends in queer fiction appear to isolate MM stories to the romance genre while seeking to present FF stories as asexual in order to appeal to a cishet audience, and it boggles me that they've been so reluctant over the years to sell fiction with the explicit intent of marketing to a queer and/or trans audience.

Your argument is literally that nature is somehow the ultimate arbiter of reason. But you would not be able to substantiate that assertion without appealing to religion.

There are people who are delusional, and maybe some of those schizophrenics are wanting suicide based off of a psychotic delusion, and not because they authentically don't wish to continue living. Even in those cases, if we cannot help those people to a point where they want to live, it is torture to forcibly keep them alive and suffering. But most people who are suicidal do not fit that kind of profile.

Other notable versions I've seen also lack mint and allspice (like in the 12 bottle bar book which is lemon/lime, or Shannon Mustipher's Tiki book which is grenadine/ango).   Smugglers' Cove's version has all spice, but no mint.  (I don't count a garnish as an ingredient IN a drink)

Smuggler's Cove itself, states ""there were nearly as many recipes as there were planters to enjoy them."" and says to ""play with the formula"" (which is one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak, NOT rum, sugar, mint, allspice).  (Cate, 258)

"h11z6w3","Chomsky's review was and remains silly and ignorant. That was my main point. He didn't ""destroy"" behaviorism. The cognitive revolution was, again, a reaction to perceived failures of behaviorism. Today, the predictive processing paradigm and the 4E (enacted, embodied, extended, and embedded cognition) approach are more popular, and the ideas associated with Chomsky and Fodor are now met with less enthusiasm.

Has Chomsky's notion of a universal grammar been destroyed by these developments? Some would argue that the answer is yes. And that would be just as stupid as to argue that Chomsky destroyed behaviorism. I wouldn't say that research on universal grammar has resulted in any sort of consensus as of yet. I'd be happy to see evidence to the contrary.

Even if the best way to explain the origin of language is via cognitive modules shaped via evolution, the process of language development is obviously shaped in a way that would make sense in the framework of behaviorism. Which is partly why it's so stupid to say that Chomsky destroyed behaviorism. Learning by consequences is hugely important. Even meta-learning can result from RL, as demonstrated by Botvinick et al.

So tell me, if you have something you prefer are you not explicitly saying ""this thing is superior""?  Try and tell me something you prefer without describing how its superior in your opinion, you wont be able to because that statement is a direct indication of your opinion of superiority and inferiority.

Can we agree Trump meant to only insult McCain, maybe, maybe we can say he is that fucking dumb and ignorant that he had no idea the words about to tumble out of his mouth, but you voted for him as your spokesmen, that is literally the point of a leader to speak for those who support them and you chose a man who ""accidentally"" told every POW that they are inferior in his opinion because he prefers soldiers that weren't captured, while I prefer people who didn't dodge the draft like the coward Trump is.

As for the tan suit I don't get it either, but fox news sure did spend a few months complaining and bitching about it as somehow unpresidential, what did they have to say about Trump being a childish prick who orchastrated during the anthem?  What did Fox news have to say about Democratic politicians not standing silently in respect of the Anthem hand over heart compared to Trump doing that childish bullshit?

Silence on Trump and OMG DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS ARE TRAITORS TO AMERICA, I didn't mention kneeling and the specific reference I am making was to a man who put his hand under his suit over his heart, but the photo they used was taken from an angle that didn't show that, TRAITOR they called him for that.

Kneeling for the anthem btw, just so you know was a suggestion BY A VETERAN because its what they do to SHOW RESPECT TO FALLEN TROOPS.  A veteran contacted Kaepernick angry at how he chose to sit during the anthem and after talking he convinced Kaepernick to kneel because it was more respectful TO THE VETERANS, yet here you are calling it less respectful than childishly orchastrating during the anthem.

Take a moment to think about that, because Fox news never even reported on that video even to defend Trump, absolute silence because a republican president can do no wrong ever in any situation and people like you will grasp at any straw they can find to not just say ""yeah it is hypocritical and a little disgusting and we should be better than that"".

I give you some credit because unlike most conservatives you at least give a mild disapproval of some of Trumps actions, but your mental gymnastics to diminish those acts from disgusting to just ""childish"" while you simulateaneosly call saluting with a coffee cup in your hand as classless belies the truth.

When a democrat does something as bad as Trump you can be damn sure I will be calling them out for it as strongly as I call out Trump, your comments here show you can't say the same thing.

I am a 40F, and my partner is a 40M. Almost every single time we have sex, I literally lose track of how many times I orgasm. And it is because he will not even start sex before I have had *multiple* orgasms. And then, I have to actually tell him that I cannot cum anymore because I'm SPENT from orgasms....and ONLY THEN, will he allow himself to cum. Granted, there are times when I just want to get fucked, and I don't care about cumming, and I tell him so. But the vast majority of the time, he will stop at nothing to make sure that it's pleasurable for me, and I get my cookies, too.

Additionally, I find it unacceptable that he tells you that he is too tired because of work to ensure your pleasure, but yet has absolutely no issue, and all the bloody energy in the world to make sure that he gets fucked and his own rocks off. 

Then, when you tell him that he doesn't make you orgasm, and that he shouldn't only focus on his pleasure only, he tells you something that is so ridiculous, asinine and ignorant that I don't know if I should laugh my ass off at him, or cry in frustration. Not only is what he is telling you ridiculous, asinine and ignorant....it is flagrantly wrong.

The ‘I Love You’ food truck is ran by Café Gratitude. The owners of that company aren’t vegan, they only run a plant-based business. They raise and kill their own cows. They’re making a killing while still doing the killing!

That is the company that Jaden chose to partner up with. Well, I dunno, maybe because they have the audacity to charge $16 for an Indian Curry Bowl. Oh, I forgot to mention, the dish name is ‘I am Humble’. Like Hell you are! All their other entrees are pretty much priced the same (that is, with the exception of one $10 item which was basically brown rice and beans). Some are even more expensive, if by only a few dollars more - and by God are these the most bland dishes that you’ve ever tasted in your life! Even as a vegan, having gone raw before and Liking “bland”, I’ve tried the food and it was disgusting because it’s just not worth it to chew on tasteless experience of buyer’s remorse.[There was this one Burrito from Café Gratitude here in San Diego I still wince at how awful it tasted. Well, didn’t taste because there was no taste. By far, the Blandest And Most Expensive Food I’ve EVER experienced - and I’ve eaten crispy, nasty fish eyes and gut-wrenching, grainy cow liver prior to my veganism - not vey proud of that, but truth be told I’d rather not waste my time. I probably wouldn’t have been so upset if I had known there was such a place and what to expect, but I’d heard rave reviews from people too embarrassed to admit they just blew their check on BS.
As LeVar Burton says “...but don’t take my word for it.”

This is a business endeavor first and foremost. This is how he advertises:
“I Love You Restaurant is a movement that is all about giving people what they deserve – healthy, vegan food for free,” the star wrote on Instagram.

That sounds like a sales pitch if I’ve ever heard one because it is.
Unless you are pumping your food with lots of excess sodium to make up for the lack of “taste” meat-eating homeless people will miss, then you will be doing them a disservice selling them bland food.

It could go either way...if they make it more palatable for the homeless, it would be super unhealthy for their heart, many would suffer hypertension and go back to eating meat if they had given it up beforehand. If tey would be forcing themselves into veganism, it would be hurting the cause. I guarantee so many will look back and be so joyous and ignorant that they could go back to meat because of the lacking education. Let’s say the clients who go there and say there will be no such thing get offended by that remark: then you are able to care about the sentient beings in this world and it won’t happen, more power to you! That’s what we want - for people to remain vegan.

The fact that going vegan is a trend that people don’t take seriously because if they did, they would.


It would be great if Mr. Smith said that he was going to run workshops encouraging the homeless to be a part of the community by teaching them to speak up for the animals. Imagine if these people have the opportunity to enhance their meals and ingredients based on their contribution? Basically, What if the regular homeless people were simply given rice and beans (which would cost a regular person $20 to buy for them - ****see below - , for the ‘I Am Humble’ dish if they do serve that item since I’m going off the Café Gratitude menu). Then that’s great! Nobody likes a hand out and the people who take advantage will continue to do so, so of course being a part of positive change will help their self-esteem as well as their bodies. This would be a huge contribution to positive change. 

Who the hell knows a homeless person who isn’t craving Carl’s Jr. over a good helping of fruit or a bowl or hardy veggie soup?
Which is, of course not what Café Gratitude sells, if you see their portion sizes, it’s a fancy place(meaning little servings).

Of course, Skid Row (where the food truck this restaurant is being based off of) is truly filled with homeless people, but we know they have no food because they have no house and no hygiene.
Does Jaden realize that this does not end homelessness, just makes it easier on them...which in turn can lead to even more homelessness? I’m Not saying NOT to help people, but teach them to help themselves is a major step up.

Homeless People walk into grocery stores all the time and they do to eat because they're That desperate. If the community that helps Jaden’s food truck and restaurant are no longer able to, and the food stops, what resources do we have for these people?


He has the ability to open up a homeless shelter and I believe that would be a better contribution because he would the be able to aid more people in the long-run because like I said, the hand outs are a great temporary solution. The homeless crisis in Los Angeles is ever-growing even with food banks.

Maybe if he were to give these homeless people Jobs, then I’d be on board. There’s a start, you know?



Well, that’s the kind of food you think when you hear “vegan”, but 
He’s having regular citizens who aren’t hoarding all of their “New Balance” ad deal money pay for it.


https://plantbasednews.org/news/celebrities/jaden-smith-vegan-restaurant-feed-homeless/

The article on Plant abased News reads:
“The celeb says anyone can order plant-based food from the eatery, but customers not suffering from homelessness are required to 'pay it forward'”
and
“This is where customers purchase a meal for twice its original cost, to provide a free meal for somebody who can’t afford it.“


****He is making other people pay while he gets all the credit for it. A food truck has little to no overhang costs, working multiple food trucks is better than investing in a building for a restaurant. Regular Joes or people coming out from their Hollywood Hills are the ones who would be funding this community service.


No thank-you, I’d rather give that extra $20 I’m spending on overpriced food Directly To the homeless person next to me...who probably wants a beef burger or a pack of cigarettes to deal with all the spoiled hipsters living out of their cars and who leave less resources for the real homeless community who is desperate for shelter in this awful too-cold-for-California weather we’ve been encountering. Manipulating the poor into further poverty is really disingenuous, I really wish people would see that.
Not very well thought-out, I don’t believe. On the other hand, having people pay for good quality and at a decent price and being able to directly buy for these homeless people instead of keeping this all anonymous, now we’re talking. Then the person feels more accountability knowing they are being helped directly and it’s not all a big machine they can take from at whatever cost, even if it means cutting in line or whatever negativity comes from the population having to support the less fortunate rather than the Big Businesses Jaden sure knows a heck of a lot about.",1621030401,"i guarantee so many will look back and be so joyous and ignorant that they could go back to meat because of the lacking education.","joyous and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so joyous and ignorant","joyous",NA,"so",0

The only ""fortune"" the US ever experienced was built on the back of people it exploited through force. Be it native genocide, slavery, oil wars, anti-communist mass murder, etc. All American wealth and success is stolen. You know how there is a stereotype of the ""dumb barbarians raping and pillaging peaceful, progressive countries"" throughout all of history? The US is the 21st century version of that. Just like the Nazis and Japanese were before them. And here's the thing: In the long term, they lose. Every single time. You know which country always won throughout all of history and has a perpetual history and culture for thousands of years now? China. A pillaging, inhuman shithole like the US is nothing compared to China. Absolutely. Nothing.

The US is a total failure of a nation. It never was good and never will be good as long as its people stay this completely fucking stupid and ignorant. It will continue to crumble while democratic nations with an actually educated society and pro-intellectual culture like China will dominate. All Americans are good for is causing wars and murdering people then stealing from their victims. That's all the US ever did and ever will do until it collapses and socialist revolution has converted it into a free and democratic country.

"gx8e8il","&gt; I get that it makes the premium really high on the sold option, but you also have to buy further OTM to cover yourself, which will also have a high premium, right?

Well, there's more than one way to cover yourself. For example, you could use the underlying to hedge your option position.

But more to your point, the problem with your thinking is that you're visualizing the difference between premiums in linear terms, like you would with the underlying, but options pricing is non-linear, so when you get a contraction of the spread, it's happening according to non-linear mathematics, so you are basically getting destroyed by a set of quadratic equations and their differentials. 

That's why people struggle understanding the risks of options trading, because you are entering the world of calculus and the pricing dynamics are not easily understood with simple linear algebra.

&gt; I just can't wrap my head around why exactly high IV/more expensive options=better for sellers and none of the websites explain it very well


Websites won't explain it because it requires a greater understanding of mathematics than the general population has and even so (my first degree was in math) it is extremely dull stuff!

If you are sufficiently motivated to study this, pick up a copy of Natenberg's Option Volatility &amp; Pricing. It is extremely dry but well worth the effort. For a book, it is expensive but still costs a lot less than the money you've already lost and will help you avoid losing more money in the future if you study it well.

I wish I could explain this to you in a simple sentence, but I can't. There's a reason why Natenberg's book is 500 pages long.

Maybe someone else can chime in here with a clever explanation, but the way I think about it is going back to the old expression about how ""time is money."" Options are more valuable when you have more time or more volatility, because that increases the probability your option will expire in the money. So volatility gives you time and time potentially gives you money.

Implied volatility is not realized volatility, it's just an opinion by the market about the future volatility and it's calculated backward based on the price. Prices are often wrong, because people are stupid and ignorant. That sounds harsh, but it's true: people overpay for things when they can't ascertain the fundamental value. We are also all truly ignorant because we don't have the capacity to see the future.

For these reasons and more, options prices are often way overvalued. When the price is subsequently reevaluated, it is done so by a mathematical model that is non-linear (think about how compound interest is very nice when it is working in your favor and then reverse that so it's going against you) and therefore you get crunched to death by the calculus. That's what has happened to your option value.

Anyway, until you get a chance to study this stuff in more depth, just accept that with options ""volatility is price"" so high vol is expensive and low vol is cheap.",1620357518,"prices are often wrong, because people are stupid and ignorant.","stupid and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"stupid and ignorant","stupid",NA,NA,0

This is a mirror image of the ""99%,"" a third of whom are Democrats, with 39% independents and a quarter Republicans.

"gwre4iw","I am the equivalent of a minister, or teacher, in my religion, so I am **super** religious.  That said, I do not personally care whether someone I'm dating is religious or not, nor do I care what religion they are.  I get along equally well with atheists and religious people, and I have close friends in just about every major religion.  In fact, I often get along better with atheists or agnostics, because I find the fanaticism and lack of critical thinking on the part of many (not all) religious people to be lazy and ignorant.  

That said, even though I date people who belong to other religions, or even who have no religion at all, that does not mean that I compromise on my religious principles.  Primarily, that means there are certain things I am not willing to do in the bedroom because they would violate the tenets of my religion.  That often means that other people opt not to date (or continue to date) me, because they desire certain sexual activities in the relationship that I am not willing to engage in.  

So functionally, my religion *does* filter a lot of people out of my dating pool, but I never apply that filter myself.  I am always open to a relationship with the other person, regardless of what they believe, and I leave it up to them to decide whether or not what I offer is compatible with what they are looking for in a relationship.",1620031218,"in fact, i often get along better with atheists or agnostics, because i find the fanaticism and lack of critical thinking on the part of many (not all) religious people to be lazy and ignorant.","lazy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"lazy and ignorant","lazy",NA,NA,0

However, there was once a group of Indian tourists who showed a complete lack of understanding for the culture, customs and appropriate behaviour of the country they were visiting. They were on a whole new level when it came to rudeness and ignorance, even for a McDonald's restaurant with many international customers. After they had ordered a massive amount of vegetarian food items, they decided not to use the chairs and tables like everybody else around them. Instead, they spread out all of their food on the floor and proceeded to eat on the floor in the middle of the restaurant, totally ignoring the complaints of staff as well as other customers who then obviously had a hard time passing by to do their job/find their tables etc.

Apart from how rude and ignorant that was, it was very unsanitary on their part. They made a total mess, so that we had to apologise to other customers and ask them to clear the place and find a different table, so that we could clean the place.

"gwkeyqx","&gt; Look up effective altruism. I'm not going to do your research for you just because you're lazy. I don't owe you that. 

""Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?"" Direct quote from the first search Mr I don't owe you that because I rather type an essay on my reddit phd rather then referring it here. 

Thank you yet again for reporting my point at the start, how to use resources most efficiently. As I have said before being pedantic and throwing random terminology isn't going to make you look smart, you are just beating around the bush and running back to the same starting point.

&gt;You're wrong that ""most"" are corrupted. That's an asinine claim based on nothing. I was making the distinction that *some* being corrupt does not mean *most* are. Your statement also implied that because ""most"" are corrupt, it's pointless or a waste to donate. That's what I was replying to. 

Maybe you are the one who need to reread what u actually wrote.  ""Corrupt charities exist therefore it's pointless to give to any of them."" That is the most typical example of twisting someone words. Being stereotype and imagining what others have in their mind thinking its their exact thought is the most idiotic thing ever.

You're wrong that ""most"" are corrupted. That's an asinine claim based on nothing. How about I hit you with your own logic, ""no, you.""

&gt;You're not even making any sense. Of course I'm not going to tell you about my personal life, you psychopath. I don't talk about my personal life on here at all. Because nutcases like you do things like dig through user histories, as you did elsewhere in your comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's hilarious that you think you have some upper hand when you're just blindly assuming things about my life, which is just impressively stupid. I hope you're not actually that stupid, and this was just a fluke for you.

You are actually ridiculous to even type this kind of stuff, because word by word is exactly what you are doing. Making countless claims about someone without knowing anything, putting words into someone's mouth, accusing people not having evidences while doing the same in the previous paragraph. The only thing you can claim is the second hypocrite in the world, cuz I am sure no one will dare to claim first.

Maybe you should stop these personal attacks and feel good about yourself if you can't take any of them. Being a cry baby saying you are getting your history looked up while not able to respond to any only make you worse when you are the one who started it up. 

&gt;Why would I? That's not my job. Besides, I never said it's a waste of money. I never said it doesn't help. My entire point was that you were bragging and shitting on other people because you committed the Great and Noble Act of spending a whole 3 months doing some unskilled manual labor. My point was that it's not as impressive as you seem to think, and your efforts could have been far more helpful in other ways. 

Worst argument ever, is not my job therefore why would I. Thank you Mr. Obvious there are lots of things that are not your business yet you are still going on. You can attack me all you want with your ""unskilled manual labor"", but at least I won't be a discriminate and look down to people who actually does these kind of jobs in order to survive or feed his/her family, what a fucking disgrace you are without any conscience. 

&gt;What a strawman argument. All I said was that your money could have been more effectively used. Nowhere did I say or imply that it's some magical solution.

Can you stop repeating my point? Do you have some sort of mental disorder which has numerous of characteristic like the movie split? You ask what part of your response did you even ignore? Well there you go again calming that was my money when I legit said countless time that it was the organization's. How thick is your skin to ever claim that you were not ignoring?

&gt;You didn't have to. My entire point is that **you didn't help nearly as much as you think you did**. It sure as shit wasn't so helpful that it gives you a pass to shit on people donating money to a charity that has helped literally millions of people more than you have. Meanwhile, you're dumb enough to think that that charity **buys water**. Is your concept of charities seriously so simplistic and ignorant that you think that's what they do? Do you seriously choose to be that stupid? Or do you just not have a choice in the matter? 

Wow are we in poe the absence of value and meaning? Are you the elder? I didn't  have to say things for you to claim? I guess after all you are a creature with testicles. Parasite.

##Was I wrong to out my boyfriend to his parents after cheating on me with his bestfriend?

Throwaway account and also sorry for the wrong grammars because English is my second language.

2 months ago, I caught my (18F) boyfriend of 2 years (19M) having sex with his best friend of 9 years (19M) during a sleepover in his house while his parents are out of town. We got into an argument over this a few days after and decided to break up with him. I always knew he was gay but was afraid to admit it because i've seen him act gay with his best friend a few times like one time when they make out with each other and he said it was just a joke. I was so angry and ignorant that I decided to called his parents while they were out of town that time about what happened.

His parents are pretty religious and conservative so i'm not surprised if they are homophobic.

When he found out I outed him, he started sending too many texts on me of how he will be in deep trouble with his parents that they found out he is gay and when his parents came back home a few days later, he got beaten and even got kicked out of his parents' home and now he is currently staying with his best friend's house whom he cheated on me. I haven't heard of them, ever since.

I am not homophobic, I am still gonna be okay with him if he is gay but I guess this is the reason why he got in trouble with his parents

From his ""diaries"" and computer writings it is 100% clear that A) he never read Darwin, or B) he didn't understand even the basic theories and explanations if he actually read Darwin's works... 

...And both A and B here are equally embarassing for someone thinking he belonged to the übermensch category. 

Also, about the much flawed superiority ideas they had, it was either Dylan or Eric who wrote a short note on a paper mentioning Nietzsche, and any educated person can immediately tell that none of them read Nietzsche, ever, and that thing is very clear. They would not have understood Nietzsche at all, I base this opinion on having read and analysed their diaries, notebooks, webpages, rants, and so on and an attempt to put it in philosophical-political-psychological context (interesting to compare some of it to Cioran, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche) and there is seriously nothing in there containing any original or thought-through ideas, thesis, conclusions (ranting teenage misanthropes often think/feel it's them against the world, that they are most unique, their suffering is much deeper than anyone else's, etc, without knowing there exists thousands of just like them in their own country and have existed many many more in history, even a modern world masskiller misanthrope isn't the ""unique individual thinker"" he often think/imagine that he is), analysis or criticism against their targets.

Especially Harris' rants are often very empty, void of content that any serious person would ever take seriously in a serious criticism of it; they are shallow, flat and truly ignorant (in the real meaning of the word!). It's really the opposite to any serious criticism of society worth reading  and much more similar to the no-logic-and-only-emotion-driven rantings of someone mentally ill who didn't know what to do with the constant(!!) untreated feelings of total inferiority, inner oppression, emasculation and his whole tragic demoralized unman self. 

It's so typical (not unique, not daring, and least of all, heroic in any way, but quite the pure opposite of all that) of such a person to be so fascinated by the feeling/thoughts of owning a gun and be able to build bombs ""to strike terror in the mass society"" when he couldn't get respect from anyone in any way. 

It would have been natural selection if Dylan and Eric, who didn't/couldn't fit in and didn't adapt to the environment, were cast out from the majority in the school and perished. It sounds harsh but that would have been more like natural selection. It is rather anti-natural selection that the ""misfit"" goes to the mass-society with a gun to destroy those who actually adapt to their environments the most succesfully.",1618580244,"eric harris was so unintellectual and ignorant that he didn't even understand the basic teachings of the natural selection process.","unintellectual and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so unintellectual and ignorant","unintellectual",NA,"so",0

Luckily, this isn't an ""either or"" situation, it's a gradient with complete ecological collapse at the bottom and ecological stability at the top, even if we were **all** doing as best we could, we'd still be nowhere near the top because life creates damage no matter what. So the only sane answer is for everyone who can, to do as best as they can, so we can get as far up the gradient as we can so that maybe climate change, which is already hitting us hard, doesn't keep ramping up until it kills us all. The reason we all need to do everything we can, is because we don't know what ""Sustainable"" looks like, what we need right now is to stop the escalating damage we are creating so we can then step back and see just how much damage we can sustainably do without destroying our children's future. 

If every person in the world was going to act together to help stop the problem, we may be able to do it without everyone doing everything they can, but as a very large portion of the world is denying reality and continuing to consume like climate change doesn't exist, it does need us who care to do as much as we can so we create less damage and so that governments take more notice and start to force the selfish and ignorant to follow suit. Demanding the right to do less because ""I don't wanna!!"" just makes you one of the selfish and ignorant that will need to be forced to do more later.

&gt; I have evaluated many philosophies on the subject.

And yet you're unable to communicate any of them without making up terms for them where the terms already exist. 

&gt; It is a subject I came from both sides as I knew the standard view and the subjectivist view of morality, and so I could see different perspectives.

This is a false dichotomy. 

You REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY need to read that book I recommended. Here's the link again: https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Moral-Philosophy-James-Rachels/dp/0078038243/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GIJCQ4TYO4CH&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=elements+of+moral+philosophy&amp;qid=1615357947&amp;sprefix=elements+of+moral+p%2Caps%2C208&amp;sr=8-3

Your view of ethics is SO narrow and ignorant that it's hard for me to even have this conversation with you. 

&gt; One could claim there are many I haven't seen, as I always admit fallibility and ignorance.

You're a couple pages into your responses in this thread and I've not seen you do it yet. 

&gt; Victorian society was largely predicated on duties; so was roman society; so was mongol society; so is taoism; so is hinduism; so is judaism; so is christianity, and so are the societies that have been heavily influenced by them. 

Argumentum ad populum fallacy

Many of these had similar notions to duty. Again, ""duty"" is a great way of framing ethics you can't justify in order to control populations. Military's are VERY duty driven. It's because that's how you convince people to follow orders without question. So no surprise that a lot of religions find their way to that notion too. 

&gt; Remember, also, that I am not talking of academic philosophers, I am talking of people. I don't care if Wittgenstein would disagree, most people have a notion per their intuitions and their intuitions indicate an objective morality, regardless of whether you would argue that their intuitions are false, those are the intuitions at large. Grab 20 people at random on the street and ask them: ""Is raping your mother objectively wrong?"" and see what people answer. Ask the same thing in another country and see what they answer. I am making the claim that most people would say yes, and they would say the same regardless of whether you ask the question in the US, in the UK, in China, in Germany, in Mexico, in Russia, and whether you ask it in this century or in the 1900s or in the 1500s. 

1. Argumtum ad populum

2. Of course most people would say ""raping your mother is objectively wrong."" This doesn't demonstrate or even remotely relate to ANYTHING you were addressing. Remember, you were arguing duty here. I don't need a sense of duty to recognize that raping anyone is wrong. Nor does the fact that most people believe that make it true. 

In the 80s, if you asked people what the best color was, you would overwhelmingly receive the answer ""red."" Does that mean red is the best color? NO. It's preference. But preference is influenced by a lot of factors. The same way you might prefer red car because every fast car you see on TV is red, your ethical preferences are formed from your experiences.

First of all, you don't even understand what is happening here. Nobody is banning Madrid fans shitposting about Barcelona on their own subreddit. The no-trolling/brigading rule applies for ""outsiders"", or in other words Barcelona fans coming to their sub and vice-versa.

So as far as we are concerned they can ridicule us as much as they want on their own territory, but that's none of our business.

Second of all, these mass trolling and bridages or whatever you want to call them not only will lead to negative consequences long term, but the latter can get our entire subreddit in trouble. This is why mod teams of different football subs often communicate with each other so situations like these can be avoided and discouraged.

Third, just in case it's not common sense already, trolling by itself is just stupid and indecent.

While it can stunt brain development in people under the age of 23ish, it's better than getting whiskey and beer with the football bros or getting tequila and trulys with all the volleyball girls. 3, the stigma around marijuana is literally an advertising campaign for paper companies. Humans have been smoking weed since before the great wall of China was built, and it's only been considered medicinal, right up until the last century or two when people decided out of nowhere that inebriation of any kind was wrong(caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, amphetamines, narcotics, etc.).

"gnajc8m","an excerpt from Stanislaw Lem's ""Summa Technologiae   
 

""By metaphysical information, we understand a kind of information that is not subject to empirical verification---either because such verification is impossible (we cannot verify empirically the existence of purgatory or nirvana) or because such information by its very nature defies the criteria of experimental verification (i.e. in everyday understanding, religious truths cannot or should not be verified empirically). 

If this is the case, then the phrase ""experimental metaphysics"" seems to be a contradiction in terms, because how can we analyze something by means of an experiment if it, by definition, does not yield itself to experimentation and is impossible to be judged on its basis. 

It is only an apparent contradiction, as the task we have placed before ourselves is relatively modest. Science cannot say anything about the existence or nonexistence of transcendent phenomena. It can only examine or create conditions in which *belief* in such phenomena manifest itself---and this is what we shall be discussing.

The emergence of metaphysical belief within the homeostat is a state in which any further changes to its input, no matter how contrary to the produced model of the existential situation, are unable to disturb it any more. Prayers may remain unheard, reincarnation may be abolished on the basis of an internal logical contradiction, religious writings may contain some obvious untruths (in an empirical sense), yet such facts do not really shake belief as such. Of course, a theologian will say that if someone has lost his faith on encountering those facts, he only had ""weak"" or ""small"" faith in the first place, because true faith means that nothing---that is, no future ""inputs""---will be able to abolish it. In practice, a form of selection often takes place. A metaphysical system is never truly consistent. Desperately trying to confirm it with empirical facts leads to a situation in which the kinds of inputs that seem to confirm the validity of the belief are accepted as its additional verification (someone is praying for someone else to be cured, and then this other person gets better; during the drought, a sacrifice is being made, and this it start to rain). At the same time, the inputs that remain in contradiction with the belief are ignored or ""explained away"" with the help of an extensive arsenal of arguments that the metaphysical system has created in the course of its historical development. 

Significantly, empirical verifiability is the only necessary and required characteristic of scientific propositions that differentiates them from metaphysical ones, yet the nature of the proposition is not determined by the presence of unverified information within it. Thus, for example, unified field theory, which Einstein developed toward the end of his life, does not bear any consequences that could be tested by means of an experiment. The information contained within the field theory has not therefore been verified, yet it is not metaphysical , since its (so far unknown) consequences will be subject to an experiment, as long as we manage to draw such consequences from the formula. The information contained in Einstein's formula is therefore to some extent ""suspended,"" ""latent,"" or awaiting an opportunity to be verified. The formula itself needs to be seen as an *attempt* to present a general law about material phenomena, an attempt whose truth or falsity we have not yet manage to determine. Of course, there is a difference between expressing a conviction when making such an attempt about the possible behavior of matter and *believing* that it certainly behaves in this way. A scientist's proposition may be the product of a flash of intuition, and its validation with facts can be rather weak at the moment of its formulation. What is decisive, however, is the scientist's *willingness* to subject this proposition to empirical verification. And thus it is not the amount of information in his possession but rather the attitude or stance toward it that differentiates  the scientist from the metaphysician."" 

I've touched upon these ideas in the past but since reading Lem he helped me get a lot of them in focus. The feeling mentioned by OP that you get when you meet someone who is religious differs for me. I know and work with a lot of Christians...the difference being that the less outspoken ones or those receptive to criticism or acknowledging of the many hypocrisies the faith they have chosen entails are easier people for me to both get along with and be friends with. I've used the teapot argument many times mentioned later in this thread to some degree of success, not to say I'm out seeking to add to a flock but merely as a means of standing my ground in the midst of the usual flurry of questions you get when you finally let them know what you really think. ""but what do you believe?"" ""what will happen when you die?"" The attitude Lem mentions at the end of the excerpt is kind of been my instinctive guide post in dealing with religious people, if they're willing to listen, as open minded as they can be under the circumstances, or just accepting it contributes to an atmosphere of mutual ""misunderstanding"" I don't think less of them for what they think or choose to believe because in hindsight I can't claim to not be in the wrong also. For those who will listen I have found are actually quite a bit closer to agnosticism than they are willing to realize but societal pressures placed on them since childhood often lend to a need to belong and be seen as a part of this group or flock so to say. It's the zealots that deter me, either through malicious means or the pure, unequivocal choice to remain blind and ignorant; that end friendships on learning of an opposing view or manipulate the minds of children or developing teens so as to groom them to give continuity to that zealotry. The use of these beliefs for financial gain and things of that nature all I find abhorrent. Not to say the scientific community is exempt from the same scrutiny as there are ample examples of those who in no way follow the pure example of the empirical pursuit of knowledge as laid out by Lem. It's critical thinking skills, a checked emotional response, both the *attitude* and *willingness* to learn and move beyond your current state that marks a good person (good being relative here and a different discussion) but hopefully you know what I mean.",1613250916,"it's the zealots that deter me, either through malicious means or the pure, unequivocal choice to remain blind and ignorant; that end friendships on learning of an opposing view or manipulate the minds of children or developing teens so as to groom them to give continuity to that zealotry.","blind and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"blind and ignorant","blind",NA,NA,0

The west doesn't care about us, I can assure you that  💯.

China is borderline neutral as long as it doesn't include invovle terrorists.

China does scare the families of terrorists. This is a common Asia tactic to increase compliance as asian cultures are shame based. 

Secular uyghurs eat pork occasionally. Maybe a broth with noodles when living in Shanghai for college for example at the cafeteria at school. Many Hui eat pork. Nobody is being forced to eat pork. They are trying to push every agricultural product everywhere. Why didn't they do a clip on china pushing xinjiang raisins on ppl in Shanghai? Cuz it is also a Thing. Uygurs have no recipes for pork though so secular ones just don't know how to prep it really. Moderate ones abstain. .

I'm not going to do a deep dive bc I think this forum is for studyn' them heirglyphics oops I mean Chinese characters 😇 (which is rewarding but painstakingly inefficient)

So I'll just summarize my opinions,

1)The west sees china as a threat (largely racialized) Also, it's getting harder to achieve the american dream, and the middle and lower class are upset. 

2) this makes rich Americans scared of those below them: protests revolts etc

3)This decreased competition of the west is bc of crap STEM training, crap policy, we have a crapload of useless college majors and policy whose only motive is to keep the politicians relected each cycle. 

4) it is easier for the west to blame china than to fix things. This also soothes the middle class from revolting. 

5) doing the above keeps the populace satisfied and ignorant that the real reason is poor american educational focus and the concentration of 50 percent of USA wealth in top 1 percent of households. These ppl hide their money in layers of trusts and behind gated homes in new england, etc.

6) shit talk china

7) find other countries/areas that also hate china due to personal reasons to join in on the shit talk (HK Taiwan, etc

8) go look for said shit talk in china.

9) most of the happy ppl r too busy with life to connect with western journalists.

10) (in my opinion) inbred southern emotionally unstable Uyghur Radicalized Islamic separatists only out for themselves on a power trip that are mad bc they can't hack it economically bc they are incompetent and unable to get women , they want to separate and create a jihaditist state to oppress women, honor kill, no education for women, keep old poor way of life, did multiple knife attacks all over china, they want to be the rulers and have power. Some are staunch believers in radical islam, some just wanna be a ruler of a kingdom one day. -----&gt;these people go out of their way to seek out western journalists.

12) Separatists are locked up as criminals in jails and treated very poorly. Separatists family members are put into camps that are basically just low cost boarding school.

17) west pulls investments from Xinjiang.

20) xinjiang industry suffers even more

21) regular uygurs loose out. ALOT

22) west gets what they want, to create a public enemy aka China, to divert from attacking rich wealthy Americans...remember the movement of hating the top 2 percent a few years ago?

"gmlya0j","You know once people got through the game soon after it came out and I saw all the derivative takes of the story I thought that maybe in due time they would be eventually filtered out and their would be more nuanced criticism of the game, but nearly everywhere I look its the exact same stuff on ""revenge is bad"" and ludonarrative dissonance that I personally don't think that the air of controversy surrounding this game will ever go away if it's this susceptible to such criticism. 

The bigotry to me is less of a problem when it comes to discourse because it's so obviously moronic and ignorant that it's not worth the time for those inclined to discourse, but I've still seen well intentioned criticism from people claiming political/nefarious agendas and using misconstrued information to prove terrible points.

"glhrkmg","Looks like we're around the same age.  But maybe there was, maybe there is something experts completely missed, but when I see 'Autism' today and the traits of it, it still seems far far notable today.  I mean if you were born in the 2000s, the very thing you have I think would have been worse today.  I know some people who would appear to be on the spectrum. But their kids are actually full-blown or near it.  As in there is a real issue with trying to speak, that no amount of 'therapy' would help.  

I personally think the approval and rise of GMO in the food system starting in the mid-late 90s must have had some impact to make this more noticeable or something.  Or maybe the pesticides changed, since autism is largely seen as some neurological disorder.  

Maybe because kids are wayy too isolated then when we were kids.  I mean going out at 4 unsupervised and talking to other kids might force some kind of reaction to overcome or mitigate the neurological issues, whereas, kids are way more sheltered and thus hindered.  

The same connected reason why allergies have increased alot. Nobody is going to tell me peanut allergies was the national threat it is today back then.

[Plenty of studies](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-policy-and-research/_archive-2019/_pdfs/digtal_update_Webster_Vernick.pdf) have found that stronger gun laws in general [limit the illegal dissemination](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/3/184) and acquisition of firearms, while looser gun laws [supply criminals](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/2021/01000/Firearm_Homicide_Incidence,_Within_state_Firearm.6.aspx) with firearms in other states that they otherwise would've [struggled to obtain](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/19/1/26.abstract).

As [studies of specific areas](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7538&amp;context=jclc) have shown, ""transaction costs"" of illegal firearms can respond to gun laws that could make it [more difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27758829), risky and expensive for criminals to obtain guns, but surrounding areas with weak laws [counteract these effects](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(20)30317-2/fulltext#seccesectitle0005) even though [consistent regulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462834/) could help address this issue. Add onto that the fact that (Southern) states with generally loose gun laws are directly responsible for a [majority of the hundreds of thousands of stolen guns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367592) that make their way into criminal hands across the country, and I think it you'll get a clear picture of how our loose gun laws do enable criminals to get their hands on guns more easily.

"gk13li9","Sadly, my experience is that, today, a whole lot of students cheat. This is especially true for online courses. Cheating is also a fact of life at other institutions. I have taught at the university level for more than 35 years and never before seen cheating at the level that it is today. Perhaps in some cultures cheating at school is the only way to get ahead or cheating is an acceptable social behaviour. Certainly, I see cheating all around me in relationships here, and that's how capitalists seem to work, but I hadn't expected to see it grow into such a problem at universities. I love that a lot of the current group of students seem to feel that being called on it is somehow wrong, or that even having it pointed our is somehow wrong.

2. Why shouldn't I mix up other animals with humans? both are sentient and able to feel pain. it's only logical to give them basic rights like not killing or abusing them. Is that to much to ask for?

"gi8zesl","You are correct that the US has a lower immigration rate than those countries that you mentioned (Switzerland, Australia, etc.) but foreign born people make do up 15% of the total population.  Not an insignificant amount.  And given the huge total population of the USA, that makes the most total number of foreign born, by far. 

Check out the report below:

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/which-countries-have-the-most-immigrants-51048ff1f9/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20Nations,million)%20(figure%20below).

The US has a lot of racists and the US has racist politicians but the US does not have a racist immigration policy.  I'm sorry.  It does not.  It has enclaves of nationals from nearly every country in the world in its larger cities.  Think if LA.  You have Little Tokyo, Little Armenia, Thai Town, Little Bangladesh, Tehrangeles.  Those are just the ones I can think of and I've only been there once.  Those are not refugee camps.  Why do you think so many people from so many parts of the world choose to come and choose to stay?  Because they want to uproot their lives and settle amongst racists?  It just does not add up.  

Lawfulness does attract immigrants.  Some of the most educated and talented people in the world want to come to the US and do come using the immigration system as it exists today.  That's not what is happening in Saudi Arabia.  Some of the most powerful and successful people in all spheres of life are immigrants in the United States.  

No, people are not just going to start bribing doctors if we let in anyone who overstays there visa.  Not immediately anyway.  But it sets a terrible precedent right from the start of arriving in a new country that you can ignore their rules.  And you can use the system the way it works now!  That's the best part!  Sure, it can and should be reformed but every year thousand, hundreds of thousands follow the law, from all over the world!  Where's the racism!?  It's not there.  Where is your evidence that it is?

So, that is that.  Let's talk about Japan.  Not an expert but let's do a thought experiment and imagine why they might want to severely limit immigration.  

Japan has always been rather isolated, yes they have been profoundly influenced by China, but there was not much direct contact with outsiders for much of their history due to their island geography.  They have always been one of the most ethnically heterogenous countries in the world and their culture is very distinct.  

Let's say Japan suddenly switched their policies and let in significant numbers of outsiders.  Don't you think that could be profoundly disruptive to their cultural continuity and character of their country?  Don't you think that it would the beginning of a new version of Japan?  

Not saying that it would be bad.  The US has been very successful as an ethnic amalgam since before independence but we have had much much more experience.  

I'm saying I can relate to the Japanese, I can empathize with their hesitation to allow a lot of newcomers.  And frankly, I think that it is unimaginative and disrespectful to throw pejoratives like ""racist"" and ""bigot"" at them.  

What I'm saying is that immigration law and immigration policy are complicated and delicate.  We gain nothing at all by labeling the people that we disagree with and painting them as intolerant and ignorant.

It's like trying to achieve peace and harmony by bombing the other guy harder and occupying his homeland, which directly causes insurgency and escalates the total amount of violence going on.

Instead of addressing the symptoms you have to address the *causes*; fix education, teach critical thinking, change the law so it's harder to spread misinformation (don't infringe freedom of speech, but require things like equal-prominence corrections, the fairness doctrine, clear labelling and separation of factual vs. opinion programs, etc), remove or reduce the influence of money in politics (Citizens United decision, etc), sharply curtail lobbying (or just make it *really* transparent, so everyone knows who's funding who), etc.

"gi1r17l","People, society, the whole world. 

It's all broken, but no one wants to admit it. 

People are too concerned with pseudo issues to actually care about something that matters and take a stand for something that could have an impact. People are too misinformed and ignorant that most don't even know what to fight for. No one's willing to stand up for one another when they see injustice. Hardly anyone's living a fulfilling life. They're accepting, getting by, settling. The greatest crime humans actively participates in is doing nothing with their life, which I'm afraid we're nearly trained at birth to do. 

Society is a soul crushing machine that doesn't care about the people running it. So many people live in poverty with no one looking out for them, and every politician is getting as much done as one elected in highschool. Not even that, but the political world right now is a nightmare. I'm not so tribalist that I believe that half of the people in my country want such different things, but they go about so differently it's hard to tell. We've constructed these walls between us, dividing us whenever we can, it's sinister. There is no reason I should hate my fellow man the way I do when neither of us have wronged the other. But society has built echo chambers that have deafened the masses to anyone else. Polarization has never been stronger, and so I fear what is to come, if not happening already. In a society built on vanity of those who can afford it, and suffering for those who can't, I'm ashamed to be any part of it. 

The whole world is no exception to any of what I have said, simply variations. Each instance of this madness builds the collective we know as our planet, a dying tree with withered roots. Every substantial inch of ground has been seized and promptly capitalized upon, as has become routine.

Does what he say about diversity change anything about how diverse Singapore is right now? What a stupid statement.

Let's break down the characteristics you mentioned:

&gt;Small

We have nations in the tens of millions or in Vietnam almost 100 million people all managing to control the virus.

Meanwhile, some of the worst countries in cases/million or deaths/million are from nations as small or smaller than Singapore. Oh, some of those small countries are islands too. There goes your stupid theory.

&gt;ultra high iq city state with a quasi dictatorial government

Holy fugging hell can you 4chan w-supremacists screw off with your obsession with homogenous high IQ society when evidence slams you in the freaking face. Singapore was a sh-thole back water in your parents' or at least grandparents' generation. People like you would be looking at places like China, Singapore, and even Taiwan hypothesizing why ethnically Chinese people are incapable of creating a modern prosperous society. You people are so insanely stupid and ignorant that you contort in olympic levels of mental gymnastics to create stupid theories that support what your bigoted views.

It's called recency bias my dude. And you know why Hitler went with the whole Aryan race thing that white supremacists latch onto? It's because those German ""Aryans"" were so thoroughly humiliated and depressed about themselves that this made them feel better about themselves. You know what germanic people were historically? Tribal barbarians that civilized people like Romans looked down on for being violent morons. Stop with the recency bias and poor logic, go back to 4chan's echo chamber where stupidity is cheered on and repeated.

How about you check the minority populations in Singapore, tell me what their average IQ is, and compare them to the minorities in America.

Countries big and small ranging from authoritarian one party states to vibrant democracies have crushed this virus. Shut up already.

&gt;You come off as an arrogant know it all. You are wrong. Please spend some tome in magical, egalitarian Singapore and report back.

No, you're wrong. I addressed everything you said.

Stop repeating BS that are cleared contradicted by facts. The only commonality between nations that crushed the virus is the policy the governments enacted and the effectiveness of their execution.

Just look at the vast differences across borders. Mongolia shares a border with Russia. The two are literally at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of how they are doing. China borders India. Even in North America, compare Canada (which didn't handle the virus well) with America. You can find cities right across the borders from each other that have vastly different stats. And please save me the drivel about population density or anything else you pull out of your ass unless you want me shutting those down.

Both sister and BIL are awful for not seriously looking at her inability to care for their baby;  she should’ve had an IUD put in or her tubes tied or removed after realizing that she can’t properly raise her child.

I’m astounded that the BIL is happy that she’s pregnant again.

Yes, they should pay you as a nanny.  Please try to stay in your niece’s life if at all possible, though, because you shouldn’t feel guilty if something happens and they were keeping her from you.

Don’t let them make you question yourself.  After much self reflection in my mid-30’s, I had an IUD put in and chose never to have children, due to my having severe bipolar depression at times.  The next step is having my tubes removed so that I don’t even have that 2% chance of becoming pregnant.

Your sister and BIL are horrible.  The fact that they are so selfish and ignorant that they don’t care that they’re not even raising their own child, and now are bringing another child into it so soon, is just flabbergasting.  This has nothing to do with mental illness because the BIL doesn’t care that his wife isn’t taking care of their baby, and he isn’t either.

It also sounds like the BIL doesn’t care that your sister becomes violent and uses her bipolar as an excuse for it.  How will that bode for the child later on?  My mother was abusive at times when she was manic or depressed;  I sought help so that I’m not.  Your sister could get help, too, but apparently chooses not to. (I consciously chose to no longer throw things and lash out when I was in my 20’s, so it doesn’t take therapy to make changes.)

Information about it was rife and people can draw their own conclusions from what they read or hear. If you want to blindly believe what you're told without fact checking for yourself that's on you. Whether people are fed lies or truths they are fed information. Whether they believe they are informed or not is their judgement.

So I stand by what I said.

As for your opinion about my comment being dumb, imagine having your beliefs mocked openly. That's called discrimination. If we live in a society where people think it's okay to openly and blatantly discriminate against a person based on what they have voted (based on the society they wish to live in democratically) then yeah, that's far worse than a media outlet or politician spitting skewed fact.",1609416848,"do you know how petty and ignorant that is?","petty and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"how petty and ignorant","petty",NA,"how",0

"ghfy17o","You might not like the Emperor's reasoning or the timeline but that does not render them moot. 

Why didn't he leave for Molech earlier? Perhaps because he didn't know about it. We have no clue when or how he came into the knowledge that what he wanted was there. 

Why didn't he take a fleet? Because he knew he wouldn't be returning by ship. He used the ship he arrived in as the foundation for a city on the planet. 

Why didn't he get back sooner? Because he was on Molech. 

Why did he sit about for 1000 years? He didn't - he was recruiting his allies and building his armies. 

Why didn't he simply curbstomp the technobarbarians and their DAoT armies? Because he was not an all powerful God. He was a man. A unique one, sure, but still a man. 

You also seem to be labouring under the misconception that tech levels in 40k are the same as they were in 30k. The Imperium has gone backwards in many areas over the last 10'000 years. Even the Astartes have inferior vehicles and armour, hence the reverence for relics and the culture shock of Cawl's new equipment.

The Rangdan were finally defeated by the First Legion using - you guessed it - DAoT weapons the Emperor held in reserve for a threat which required them. The Dark Angels to this day have their own weaponsmiths independent of the Mechanicus because they predate the Treaty of Olympus Mons. The Custodes have never needed the Martians and have always produced their own weapons, armour and vehicles, many of which are superior to most others around. The Emperor did keep some old tech, such as the Gloriana Battleships and Bolters, which he invented/produced for the nascent Imperium. 

The Martians accepted him as the Omnissiah because he did bring them new knowledge and understanding. The Imperial Palace was and is full of DAoT tech. The Legions were the most advanced human weapons in the galaxy at the time of their creation. The Emperor didn't sit about waiting for the collapse of human civilisation. He only intervened directly once the Fall ofthe Eldar had shown him the peril mankind faced. 

The entire point of the Sigillites was to preserve knowledge of human history. The Imperium was intended to be much more advanced, both technologically and socially than it is now. The species was intended to grow and learn. That's kind of the entire point of the Heresy - the tragedy of what could have been. 

You seem to be arguing that the Emperor was both knowledgeable and competent enough to plan ahead but so incompetent and ignorant that he messed everything up by wasting time. What he could have done differently is a topic oft discussed on this sub but arguing that he should have foreseen everything in great detail and planned accordingly ignores everything we know of the character, his motivations and his actions. You argue that he could returned to Sol quicker, could have conquered Terra quicker, conquered the galaxy quicker etc but we know that he was in a rush. Malcador was forever trying to slow him down. 

In the end though my initial point stands - necessity. None of what you've argued is necessary for his plans. He had what he thought he needed. He may have been wrong, we'll never know. But that's what he thought at the time.",1609284294,"you seem to be arguing that the emperor was both knowledgeable and competent enough to plan ahead but so incompetent and ignorant that he messed everything up by wasting time.","incompetent and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"incompetent and ignorant","incompetent",NA,NA,0

I seem to recall them doing it when they did poorly or had negative feedback from the judges - i havent seen C11 in awhile, so if this is wrong please let me know. I still have no idea what Paulina was referring to as ""a socially acceptable way to be in Europe.""  Not showing emotions? Being a jittery ball of nerves like Marjorie lol? I do remember Marjorie remarking that if ""[she] cried, she got told to shut up"" and I was thinking that is really not an exclusively European thing, lol.

I like Marjorie, but Elina I found grating. She had a *very* self-righteous air about her with her opinions, such as the argument about eating meat. Typical 18 year old that thinks they know it all. As for the mom thing, I don't think it's really anyone's business but Elina and her mom. I felt bad that she was ganged up on about it. Brittany saying ""your mom takes care of you and put a roof over your head, you should love your mom"" and calling Elina ""a hateful bitch"" is disgustingly narrow minded and ignorant. That is the *bare minimum* a parent needs to do...you don't get praised for doing shit youre supposed to. Brittany seems to have a good mom, but by her age (wasn't she like 23?) she should know not every parent is a good one.

I have always found Sam intensely annoying and immature, even when I was 11/12 watching the cycle live lol her role in this argument was just typical American ""the world does not exist outside of the USA"" ignorance. You don't just lose your culture and replace it with American culture the minute you move to America 🙄 I also could not believe her whining over Elina getting the holiday spread. Most of our holidays are cultural now more than religious, sooo you can be an atheist and celebrate Christmas. I do it every year 🤷‍♀️ would she have said the same thing if a Muslim or Hindu had won the spread? 

I am legitimately blanking on what all was said between Sheena and Elina/Marjorie, so can't comment lol I did find it very cringy when someone called out Sam for mocking a Chinese accent and Sheena said it was fine/she wasn't offended. It's really not, and minorities accepting shit like that/acting like an authority on what's offensive to their ethnicity is why ignorant people think it's ok to do.

"ggw2jgu","He was raising Harry to be a weapon against Voldemort that could be sacrificed. His expectation was that Harry wouldn't be able to survive the damage that Voldemort had inflicted upon him by cursing him and taking his parents, nor would he be able to heal him because Voldemort would be actively hunting him down. At worst he was expecting Harry to become another Voldemort, a great evil that had to be put down, incapable of Love and Empathy, at Best he was hoping for another Snape, having enough emotion that he could be manipulated, but not enough to reverse the effects of the trauma he experienced. Harry far exceeds any expectation that Dumbledore had for him, and Dumbledore tells him this on multiple occasions, that his ability to not only Love, but Love Selflessly is astonishing. That it is what truly sets him apart from Voldemort and will allow him to survive. However, Dumbledore doesn't realize this until after Harry is already at Hogwarts, when he's watching him to discover the type of person that Harry has become because of his Trauma. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well—not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. **I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. **Thus far, my plan was working well.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced.* ***Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? **I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.” “I don’t—” “I cared about you too much,**” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

Not only was Dumbledore not expecting to Love Harry, he was actively trying to prevent it, but failed because of his Goodness.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have—and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined—not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy?* ***I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, **but you had proved you were exceptional**. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon…

All of this is taken from Chapter 37 of Order of the Phoenix, after Sirius Dies and Harry is returned to Hogwarts raging in his Grief. There's a lot more story and explanation going on in this scene between Harry and Dumbledore, so it kinda gets lost within the information dump. I highly encourage you to reread the chapter, and other chapters in previous books where Dumbledore and Harry are together. 

I don't believe that Dumbledore had a plan to save Harry until after the events in the Graveyard in book four where Voldemort takes Lily's sacrifice into his body, redoubling the bond between Harry and Voldemort. That's why he stalls so long to tell Harry about the prophecy, because he's slowing realizing that he's come to Care and Love Harry, and he's hating himself for what he knows must happen, that Harry must die to Voldemort.

Last Friday, friend and I were texting each other at work. We have known each other for 5 years, very close, and we joke around with each other a LOT.

She was having a bad day and she texted asking me if I could help with her workload, and sent a giphy of someone cracking a whip. I texted back with a smart-a\*\* answer ""well that depends on what it is"". She then said if I was busy, ""no worrieesssss because she's so awesome"".

We joke around and throw jabs at each other quite frequently. So I decided to throw a jab of my own by saying ""so awesome you missed this morning's meeting?"" She said she technically did not miss the ENTIRE meeting followed by a tongue sticking out emoji. 

What I said next is what she has an issue with. I texted back ""I think you've got awesome and shi\*\*y mixed up"". Turns out she didn't read that in a joking manner and she thought I was actually calling her a shi\*\*y person. She ended up texting back saying ""wowww, that wasn't very nice. I don't need this today"" And that was the last we texted on Friday.

She didn't text me for the entire weekend which I thought was odd, but maybe she was busy. Turns out I hurt her feelings when I called her shi\*\*y, and she called me ""oblivious"" and ""beyond help"" if I didn't understand that what I said crossed the line. The way I see it:

1. She should have known I was joking when I called her shi\*\*y. We've known each other for 5 years and joke around a TON.
2. Everything in the text message hinted at a light-hearted playful/joking tone, from the giphy showing a person cracking a whip (basically saying 'get to work and help me with my workload'), to her texting me ""no worrieesssss"" with like 5 S's at the end, to the tongue sticking out emoji, to even the ""wowww, that wasn't very nice"". She has said ""wowww"" in real life many, many times in a joking manner, so I read it as joking. If she had said ""Wow. That wasn't nice"" I would have understood she was being serious.  
3. Her stance is that it should have been super obvious that I crossed the line. When I tried to talk it through with her, she refused and said that she didn't feel like going back and forth...that she had ""said her piece"", and that if I was so oblivious and ignorant that I did not realize I crossed the line, that I am beyond help.
4. She also says I should have known she was having a bad day. But it wasn't obvious that the day was THAT much worse than most other days when she has vented to me.

"gczsyfc","""Agree to disagree""

""I'm blocking you!""

How many times are you going to post your Ls on here by constructing these elaborate farewell posts only to angrily post more? This is just wasting my time man. 

&gt;Tell me how you, someone non-vegan, treats animals better than me, as someone vegan? It is a fact that to animals, I am a better person than you. 

In a consistent theme throughout this conversation, I'll once again remind you that you just saying something is a fact doesn't make it so. You have to establish that the act of eating meat is immoral, which you can't do because every time you even address it you just fall into another tautological platitude like ""abuse is wrong!"" without even establishing that it's abuse. A person eating meat to survive is no different than another animal eating meat to do the same, but your only response to that was to literally say that no one eats meat to survive lol. 

&gt;Anyways, I’m not actually interested in fighting on this issue,

Yeah man that's why you came to me to bitch and can't actually leave the conversation alone. You are literally so vain that you can't have me criticize you fellating yourself about how good you are without responding. It's pathetic. You know what though, at least you haven't denigrated the Holocaust or slavery in a few comments! Progress. 


&gt; it’s just an objective fact that vegans and vegetarians lean brown and poor worldwide and in the US. 

Like again, please for the love of god don't be joking about finding that high school debate club. To refresh, you never responded to my point about the difference between correlation and causation on income and politics, and their effect on diet. Not that race literally has anything to do with this other than a red herring to make you feel better, but again these aren't even a response to my original point. That *some people* of a demographic don't face a particular barrier that others do *doesn't mean* the barrier doesn't exist. It's like saying black people don't disproportionately face issues in poll access because your black friend Jerry had no problems voting. I can't explain the most rudimentary concepts of research methodology like generalization to you if you're not willing to learn, but you refusing to concede that you're wrong for not addressing a point doesn't mean it's okay. 

&gt; The country with the highest number of vegetarians is India, with 40% vegetarian, who make on average $2k GDP per year. 

Who cares? This has nothing to do with anything. Yet again you just blogging. Like if love to hear you explain what you think this proves. Should we then compare the GDP of non-vegetarian countries like the US to India like diet is the causative factor in growing economies? 

&gt; And on average, animal consumption increases with GDP per capita. Richer people eat and kill more animals. And poorer and browner people, including in the US, are more likely to be vegan and vegetarian. Those are objective facts. As in, you have to accept them, no exceptions, unless you can produce better data. 

Even if I do accept them without sources, again 1) you're not controlling for consumption in general, and 2) what does the consumption of meat by wealthy people have to do with the barriers of some people to vegan diets? Like this is honestly fucking hilarious that can't understand these points have nothing to do with one another. Like my original point was that it's harder for people of low SES in the US to alter their eating patterns due to a variety of reasons (lack of options to shop at, lack of transportation to different markets, lack of resources for this, lack of time/energy to properly research/invest in/execute entirely new, strict diets, etc.) and your response was ""rich people eat meat"". I need you to acknowledge this is a non-sequitur. 

&gt;Saying that poor people lean liberal so that’s the causal factor rather than financials doesn’t matter. 

Lol. It very much does because it ruins the validity of your statement. It means you don't have a controlled environment for an experiment and rather than address it, you're just choosing to ignore it in favor of confirming your own belief. Shocker that you don't know what you're talking about!

&gt;If you want to stereotype vegans in the US (which seems to be your goal) 

Again, you don't even understand what I'm saying. You're talking to a figment of your imagination. My goal had to do with discussing the experience of low SES populations to food networks, so I have no idea what the hell you're talking about my goal being to stereotype vegans. Way to tattle on yourself that merely talking to other people worries you about stereotypes, though lmao.

&gt;If your point is about food deserts being a problem for poor people, fast food consumption being unhealthy and convenient and negatively effects POC and poor people’s health, you are right. 

THIS IS QUITE LITERALLY MY POINT, and you have no fucking idea what you're talking about when you say that it doesn't impact their ability to maintain a strict vegan diet. How does lack of access, time, and resources not impact what food you can eat? It's practically in the definition. 

Like how fucking hard was it to just admit this? You're so proud and ignorant that you can't admit that barriers of access exist between low SES populations and food choice, a well studied phenomenon? So incredibly difficult. For every reason that it's harder for these populations to access healthful food, the same barriers limit access to vegan options. 

&gt;You say you are far-left in your flair. Go read what Angela Davis has to say about veganism and treatment of farm animals.

Yeah, i hear that poachers love the taste of rhino horn and elephant tusks,  just like the chinese love the taste of tiger genitals and hunters love to eat their trophies.

&gt;hunting is important to control the population of certain animals.

While hunting sometimes helps to control populations, it's important to note that the reason why most of these populations became pests it's because hunters wiped out their predators.

I've been labelled as ""drug seeking"" as well, when I was legit passing out every 20-30 mins from the pain. I was told "" well you must have taken or drank something that's making you pass out.

I had a seizure from pain once. I was sooooo dehydrated because I've been vomiting for 3-4 days in a row non-stop, and apparently hella messed up electrolytes and the pressure and stress of pain can cause this. When I woke up, this ancient, white man doc that I've seen a few times asked me, ""what's with all the passing out? Why do you pass out and wake up in the ward, do you not want to wait in line or something?"" This was as I was sobbing in pain. I had lost control of my bladder during my seizure and due to the endometriosis stuff I had going on, I was bleeding pretty heavily. You can imagine the level of embarassing and desperate I was. Like the fuck man?! I'm in so much pain, and I'm bleeding and passing out... and somehow you think I'm faking this to get narcotics? 
I was given some wet wipes, a Tylenol and a gravol and told to go home. Needless to say, I was back in the hospital the next day, but this time I went to a different location. I ended up having to stay for 12 days because of how bad my condition was, but you know the day before I was written off as ""drug seeking"" and given a fucking Tylenol.

"ganlies","Man there's really nothing I can tell you to make you think critically huh? That sucks for you. I can't help but treat you like a case study, these are my observations:

You think any kind of criticism on Trumps character, no matter how valid or true, just amounts to ""ORANGE MAN BAD"". I wonder, do you find no problem with racism or the suppression of voters in a democracy? I'll say this loud and clear for you: it doesn't matter WHO it is. Be it Trump, Hillary, Bernie or someone else from any side of the political spectrum, if they are actually, truly racist or trying to threaten our democratic system, they deserve to be condemned for it. It's not people saying ""ORANGE MAN BAD"" just because. I mean, sometimes people do. But everyone here has had perfectly valid logic and arguments behind their views against him.

Besides I didn't even say whether or not I agreed with those allegations against Trump. I simply told you how he is widely regarded in an objective way. I stated cold hard facts and backed them up with literally hundreds of sources. You just don't want to hear me say it so you repeat your favorite catchphrase: ""ORANGE MAN BAD"" because it means you get to avoid thinking critically about it (which would mean admitting you're wrong, which you can't do because you're a coward lmfao)

What's hilarious is that you're literally attacking people in the same way you are deluded into thinking I am attacking Trump: ""BLUE AND RED TEAM BAD REEE"". It's the only thing you say and there is no logic behind it. But of course a primitive mind such as yours would see everyone but himself as ""tribal"". 

No one said anything about ""teams"" except you (over and over and over again...).

&gt;BAD TEAM is threatening democracy, so therefore if you're not against their threatening of democracy, you don't care whether democracy is threatened

I am completely 100 percent open to having my mind changed. Please explain how this is not true.

Everything you observe about these imaginary ""teams"" of strawmen is a complete and utter projection of your own motives. YOU only care about winning. YOU don't care one bit about what is moral. YOU are full of hate and YOU are one of the most neurotic people I've ever met. The real people that identify with the right and left are much more varied in their opinions and belief systems than you are deluded into thinking (you would not know this because you can't participate in a political discussion without claiming to be above everyone else). 

&gt; im not mocking him for valuing the existence of democracy and you know that! 

Dude... sorry but that is legitimately what it seemed like you are saying. I already explained why.

And actually, what he said was really only about democracy and nothing else. Perhaps you'd care to explain exactly HOW it's about anything other than that. Of course, you won't because you will conveniently ignore this part (and all the other parts that actually matter)! 

So there you have it. You're impossible to talk to because you will never consider another perspective other than your own. I've shot down every point (if you could call them that) you've had so far, and you have conveniently ignored it. 

You are a tragic joke. I've mostly enjoyed trying to get through to you, but after reading this last one I just feel genuinely sad for you. I have to wonder what your upbringing was like.

"g9gqpss","I'll explain it one more time in baby language,

There is a difference between conservative as in what you defined and the party, the two things aren't the same just because they are the same word. Democrats are democratic so why don't they go to the polls when deciding every single issue? 

Also your getting 4 different words confused and I'll show you how.

Your saying all democrats are progressive and all republicans are regressive/conservative

Suppose the founders gave everyone Universal health care.

A progressive republican would want to get rid of it 

A conservative democrat would want to keep it.

Therefore all republicans are progressive and all democrats are conservative.

Another example lets suppose I wanted to protect obamacare, I would be conservative despite the fact the ones that want to get rid of obama care are conservatives.

I would normally not comment, but this is all so wrong and ignorant that I simply can not let it slide without correcting a few points:

“**Destini Robinson**” is either ignorant or lying. Seeing as that they took the time to look up a Greek word, it shows they have the capacity and will to do actual research, but not the honesty of presenting facts, so I say they are lying about the Bible to push an opinion.

1. Leviticus was NOT written in Greek. It is part of the **Hebrew** Scriptures.
2, Arsenokotai is Greek, NOT hebrew, and it comes from árrhēn, ""a male"" and koítē, ""a mat, bed"", in other words a man in bed with another man; a homosexual. This includes men of all ages.
3. The actual Hebrew word used in Leviticus 18:22 is Zahar, which just means “male”. There is no reference to age. Saying it specifically means “young boys” is a dishonest outright lie.
4. Stop appropriating Jesus. He is not your Teddy bear. Jesus never spoke about gay people, true. Why would he? It was never accepted and it carried the death penalty. Why would he even bring up the topic? 
5. Jesus did however define marriage as being between a man and a woman (Matthew 19:4-6), and condemned ALL extramarital sexual activities (Matthew 5:27,28; Mark 7:20-23). Adultery and fornication includes **but is not limited to** homosexuality, beastiality, pedophilia and any other sexual activity outside of a marriage.
 
“**Sunshine-tattoo**” claims to be a Jew but does not seem to know the basics of Jewish and Greek history.

Pederastry was a socially acceptable thing in Greek culture at the earliest during the archaic period, beginning in the 8th century BC. Leviticus was written **almost a thousand years before** that period, in the Arabian desert, with absolutely NO Greek influence what so ever. I think this must be ignorance on their part rather than outright lies.

In the second case they are more on point. The people of Sodom were way to carnal, and they didn’t show hospitality to strangers or respect for the angels. But it’s also a case of illicit sex.

&gt; “the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, ... They called to Lot... ‘Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, **that we may have sex with them**.’” -Genesis 19:4,5

Instead of honoring their guests, they wanted to gang rape them. Whether that condemns homosexuality, gang rape, or just being inhospitable, or all of the above, I leave to you to ponder.

"g8mcyv3","So everyone has their own area of expertise, right? Even if you're not highly educated, you might know cars, or computers, or WW2 history, or whatever. You know a lot more about something than the average person.

And so when a movie portrays that subject, you think ""oh they're getting this all wrong, how dumb"", and when an idiot talks about the thing you're an expert in, you think ""oh, this idiot has no idea what he's talking about. I get why he thinks he does, but he doesn't even know what he doesn't know""

Now, smart people who have the ability for introspection have this thought: Oh, I see how people who don't know much about the issue I'm an expert at take a casual look at it and get a lot wrong. They don't even know enough to understand what they don't know or why they're wrong. But their ignorance makes them confident, like they know more about it than they do. But they don't. I know they don't know what they're talking about.

Now, here's the key point: a smart person will think ""oh, the way everyone else gets the thing I'm an expert on wrong, that's ALSO how I must sound to people who are experts on things I do not know very well""

The stupid person thinks whatever comes off the top of their head is right, without any thought, without any education. Oh, so thousands of scientists and engineers with expertise on the subject can't solve this tricky issue, but why don't they just try this thing I thought up off the top of my head! Wow, I'm smarter than all the scientists and engineers, cause I solved in 3 seconds what they couldn't solve in years!

Even though the idiots have the experience to know what they sound like, because they've seen other ignorant people make the exact same mistake about the idiot's area of expertise, they are too stupid or too unwilling to engage in the introspection necessary to realize that that's what they sound like to experts in a subject they know nothing about. 

The smart person realizes wait - I don't know enough about this subject to have a very informed opinion, just like I see people comment on my area of expertise all the time. I'm going to defer to the experts or at least do more research so I can understand what I'm talking about. The stupid person never has this thought. They do not engage in introspection or thinking about how they think.

Stupidity, ignorance, and lack of introspection is confident, bold, loud. They're so sure they know everything because they lack the mental tools or willingness to realize the lack of their own knowledge. They think everything in the world is obvious, simple, and easy, and has easy solutions that somehow no one with expertise has thought of.

Intelligence and knowledge are quieter, more tentative. They know they have limits to what they know, and so they don't want to loudly proclaim wrong ideas about some subject they only know a little bit about. They know knowledge is complex and nuanced, and want to try to give the whole picture while acknowledging their own limitations.

But stupid people are too stupid to understand that. So they mistake that loud confidence that stupidity and ignorance has for strength. They go along with the person who's telling them everything is simple and easy, that they know better than experts on every subject.

This is the current situation we find ourselves in. Loud, confident ignorance and stupidity wins over the minds of others who are stupid, while knowledge and expertise quietly tries to correct it and inform people. We've created a society that caters to the stupid and ignorant, that engages in a decades-long campaign against intellectuals and experts and education.

&gt;I didn’t say that sold through is direct to consumer sales. Here’s a list of three articles that prove me wrong

&gt;Sold through = Sold to consumers

-

&gt;NPD are a reliable source that track digital sales and POS Sales

"g88fr3y","&gt;  think one of the biggest problems is that people with education often ""talk down"" to people who don't. And, often times, that talking down is bred from ego or arrogance.

Oh, I could not possibly agree more. I can be a completely arrogant sob myself (though I often tend to more to people who I think honestly should know better).

But... while this is completely true, and we need to figure out how to address it, it's not a valid dismissal of education, or just the fact that 'shit's complex yo'.

Those 2 solutions have to go hand in hand, I'm 100% behind that.

Again, all this being said, this isn't new. I'm a nerd who grew up in the South, and I was considered 1 step up from being gay, and it wasn't a big step. They hated nerds down there, it was sport, and I left like many lgbt people did for a gentler atmosphere.

Those people can't be simply put under the umbrella of a colour because that is patently stupid and ignorant. That people do interchange race and culture isn't an excuse. There are people I know in America who say they are Spanish because it's easier than explaining that they only speak Spanish and Hispanic people don't all share the same culture.

"g7te4ln","Definition of DLC:

&gt;Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for an already released video game, distributed through the Internet by the game's publisher. It can either be added for no extra cost or it can be a  form of video game monetization, enabling the publisher to gain additional revenue from a title after it has been purchased, often using some type of microtransaction system.

Therefore, any DLC can be seen as microtransaction. So either all DLC in Snowrunner is microtransaction, or non is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There is also no such thing as a “mini-DLC” 

That's correct, the apache is not a ""mini-DLC"", it's just a DLC.

&gt; DLC can range from cosmetic content, such as skins, to new in-game content such as characters, levels, modes, and larger expansions that may contain a mix of such content as a continuation of the base game. 

Yes, it is literally one truck. Trucks are the main part of the game and choosing the right truck is a major point in the game. So adding more trucks, if it's one by one or as a bundle, adds to the main game by adding more options to pick from.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the Apache is 1000% a microtransaction which means the company lied to their consumers. 

You feel lied to because you interpret a DLC as a microtransaction, the company, here specially the publisher, sees it not like this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  they have every right to release extra PAID content AFTER all 4 Phases / seasons are out, but not before. 

No, they have every fucking right to do exactly this. When you bought the season pass, you bought the content of Phase 1,2,3 and 4. That is literally written in the season pass.  
When the publisher decides to release content that is not included in the season pass, you have no right to demand it beeing given to you for free when it's not in the content you paid for. Again, you did NOT pay for the Apache. If you don't like this truck, well don't buy it. If you don't like the monetisation scheme of the publisher, don't buy more games from them. They certainly won't miss you, and neither does EA miss me. I am literally a single customer they do not care the slightest about.

The same goes down at the forums of Avorion. There is a new update coming that gets the base game patched, buffed and enhanced. On top of that, there will be a DLC release for those who want to further support the game. You're not getting robbed of your money. You got and get what you paid for. And yet, here and over at Avorion as well, there are a few folks intoxicating the community and always boiling it down to that one time company XYZ is ""doing worst then EA"" (I haven't found a company worst then EA, but Bethesda you're damn close) just because people are so arrogant and ignorant that they demand everything for free after the initial purchase. Wake up, those times where you get the full game, finished with all possible content are over for about 20 years now.

Some companies use DLC to rip out existing content to monetize the game furthermore, see EA (Prothean DLC, that shit was proven to be completely in the game files), other companies use it to extend the game content. Some do bit of both. That is the way the game industry works now and it keeps the devs, publishers and their families fed and warm in a nice flat. It's called ""we need money to buy shit to survive"".

There is actually a whole lot of science about phototherapy and you can get a much cheaper LED setup to experiment with. One of the main researchers from Harvard wrote quite a bit about it and it is linked in that megathread. 

I'm going to be getting a couple of things to test, at the very least it can help circulation and blood flow and covering from setbacks I should have done it sooner for my now not so recent major event.

Also I find it funny (more like disappointing and ironic and hypocritical and ignorant) that so many people in the tinnitus communities are against anything alternative when following mainstream medical advice is what got a lot of them in this situation to begin with! Like sure buddy you have tinnitus but take all of this aspirin every day and take these antibiotics! In fact I find it horrendous and horrific that we are not warned about the effects medication can have. And people are still being prescribed these things!

You will find all types of people with various kinds of ear damage. By the way don't expect much help in the tinnitus subreddit (not this one, research, but just t) the moderators are scum for one thing. Some people let this condition make them even more of an asshole but I suspect they already were. 

I used to post on the hyperacusis forms as well but basically within a year of my first injury I was pretty much back to normal from eating a super healthy plant-based diet (raw even, fruit mostly) at the time and trying many other alternative modalities that seemed to help. it wasn't until I got further injuries from very loud sounds or medications that I slid backwards at all also leaving that lifestyle of Superior health.

not taking my own advice and trying an aspirin like medication that wasn't even supposed to get absorbed systemically much is what caused my recent event. I even told the doctor my apprehension in that I wasn't going to take it but some factors led me to try it just for a single day and that was enough. I really think he should have researched it more and told me to not try. One of my biggest mistakes I've made lately.

The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are financial tools set up to implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce regional disparities in income, wealth and opportunities. Europe's poorer regions receive most of the support, but all European regions are eligible for funding under the policy's various funds and programmes. The current Regional Policy framework is set for a period of seven years, from 2014 to 2020.

The Structural Funds are made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). Together with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up the great bulk of EU funding, and the majority of total EU spending.


Next click:


The regional policy of the European Union (EU), also referred as Cohesion Policy, is a policy with the stated aim of improving the economic well-being of regions in the European Union and also to avoid regional disparities. More than one third of the EU's budget is devoted to this policy, which aims to remove economic, social and territorial disparities across the EU, restructure declining industrial areas and diversify rural areas which have declining agriculture. In doing so, EU regional policy is geared towards making regions more competitive, fostering economic growth and creating new jobs. 


And one more:



The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is a fund allocated by the European Union. Its purpose is to transfer money from richer regions (not countries), and invest it in the infrastructure and services of underdeveloped regions.

If you think it’s sexist and dehumanizing to write about someone with a loved one who gets raped that says way more about you than the author. Why would that necessarily be sexist?

[Summary](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs): Implicit bias leads to white people being hired over black people even when their resumes are identical. Just having a black sounding name reduces your callback chances by 50%.

Dumbing it down: Being white makes it easier to get a job, regardless of qualifications.

**Sentencing Discrimination:**

* [Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Sentences.](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2413&amp;context=articles) Sonja B. Starr, M. Marit Rehavi, 2014.
* [Demographic Differences in Sentencing: An Update to the 2012 Booker Report.](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf) United States Sentencing Commission, 2017
* [Judicial Politics and Sentencing Decisions.](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cyang/files/cohen_yang_march2018.pdf?m=1525793200) Alma Cohen, Crystal S. Yang, 2018

[Summary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.06f30983faa6): Black people are sentenced longer for the same crimes as white people, accounting for nearly identical criminal backgrounds. GOP appointed judges are the worst for this, but all judges do it on average.

Dumbing it down: Born white? Do less time for the same crimes.

**Redlining and Housing Discrimination:**

* [Cartographic Editorial—Mapping the Racial/Ethnic Topography of Subprime Inequality in Urban America](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2747/0272-3638.31.4.425?journalCode=rurb20). Joe T. Darden, Elvin Wyly, 2013
* [HUD settlement for discrimination against Black and Latino families from 2000-2018.](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/EXECASSBANKCONAGRMNT.PDF)

[Summary](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america): Federally mandated discriminatory lending practices are directly responsible for the creation of poor urban black communities, the historic lack of black home ownership (with generational wealth being the most important form of transferable wealth), and easier home purchasing for white people. Some of these practices still continue to this day, despite being outlawed.

Dumbing it down: White parents owned a house? Federally mandated racism got them that loan, and you are absolutely benefiting from it.

**Law Enforcement Discrimination and Use of Force:**

* [Police are more likely to kill unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)
* [Police over-stop black Americans when compared to white Americans and subject them to searches, handcuffs, and arrests even when factors were controlled for.](https://stanford.app.box.com/v/Data-for-Change)

[Summary](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/12/cover-policing): "" There's evidence of racial disparities at many levels of law enforcement, from traffic stops to drug-related arrests to use of force. But the roots of those disparities aren't always clear. Experts point to systemic problems as well as the implicit (largely unconscious) biases mentioned in the debate. To be sure, those biases aren't unique to police. But in matters of criminal justice, implicit bias can have life-altering implications. ""

Dumbing it down: Police and law enforcement racially discriminate against black people which contributes to single parent households and other socioeconomic disadvantages.

And here is a study about CRT in academia specifically:

["" Today, CRT is utilized within different fields and draws from several disciplines, including civil rights, ethnic studies, and critical legal studies, to examine and transform the relationship among race, racism, and power.6 Some of the basic themes of CRT include the re-examination of history through the eyes and voices of People of Color and interest convergence, or the belief that racial reform only served to promote whites’ self-interest.7  It is characterized by several subdisciplines, including Latina/o Critical Race Theory (LatCrit), which employs CRT to examine the particular ways multiple forms of oppression intersect to shape the experiences of Latinas/os in the U.S.""](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&amp;context=sjsj)

"g3jybga","&gt; Everybody should receive a sentence that is appropriate for the crime they committed.

&gt; So black men get harsher sentences than white. I wonder if that might factor in somewhere.

These two things are not mutually exclusive. You do know that, right? Black men being punished more severely than white men doesn't prove black men receive harsher penalties than are appropriate for the crime they committed, so I don't really get why you would single that part of the comment out (probably because you have no rebuttal to the rest of the comment).

Also, this comment chain is actually about racial bias in *policing*. The statistics up above relate solely to stopping, detaining, and arresting individuals, not what sentences they later receive, if any. 

But in any case, the difference between the sentences of black men and white men (19%) is significantly smaller than the difference between the sentences of white men and black women (30-35%), yet you only ever hear and talk about the racial disparity.

"g3jg9cq","Yes, you are in the wrong. BUT ONLY FROM AN *ETIQUETTE* STAND POINT.

When in doubt, always use the highest title if you are unsure. It is better to give someone too much credit than not nearly enough. While, yes, they do teach, a teacher is very below a professor. Whereas, teachers are not professors. Think of it this way, a senior in high school was once in 3rd grade, but that does not make them a 3rd grader now and it would be very rude to call them such. It's the same here. Teachers are what you call someone teaching 12 graders or lower. 

Anyone at the collegiate level is one of these (in order from least to highest academic rank):
Graduate Student aide, Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor.  As you can see, Professor is the highest academic ranking, whereas teacher is not even on here. Teacher is basically below Graduate Student Aide. Teachers only need a 4 year degree, and since Graduate Student Aide requires you to be in graduate school, they are already at a higher academic rank than a teacher. 

So, while it's okay to accidentally call a teacher a professor, etiquette says calling a professor a teacher is extremely belittling, rude, and ignorant.

That said, many actual professors will request you just call them by their 1st name because they're not pretentious. Your best bet in the future is just to ask them what you should call them, or incorrectly call them professor accidentally even if they're not, or refer to them how they address themselves in writing.",1598923549,"so, while it's okay to accidentally call a teacher a professor, etiquette says calling a professor a teacher is extremely belittling, rude, and ignorant.","rude, and ignorant","ignorant","and",TRUE,"rude , and ignorant","rude",NA,NA,0

"g35gywe","Multiracial fan here: I’ve never dealt with racism directed at me personally. But I started watching hockey in 2014 and distinctly remember thinking, “wow, nobody who plays this sport is like me or my family.” It felt very weird to be a Latina who watched hockey. And with the way that players and the league as a whole acted, it always felt like I was watching and enjoying a sport that was very white and very racist, even if unintentionally.

But I feel like that’s starting to change. Auston Matthews has a lot in common with my family background, so seeing him succeed has been a big deal. There seems, to me at least, to be more diverse players and more space for them to talk about their experiences. Anecdotally I’ve seen more and more fans of color in my city. So overall I’d say my experience with hockey has been one of (slow, but steady) progress in the right direction, and I’m really proud of the players themselves for being a big part of that driving force.

Edit: tbh hockey fan spaces can be a lot worse for me than hockey leagues and games.

None of that would have gotten in the way of his supposed goal of fixing the family financially, but his real goal wasn't so reasonable, his real goal is to make everyone act the way he thinks they should, and that just isn't reasonable.


""Practical head of eccentric and irrational family""


Ronica is not eccentric or irrational, Kyle only sees her that way because he's a sexist piece of trash. He makes no effort to understand why the traders do certain things so he labels them as irrational, he is willfully ignorant (plenty of people try to explain things to him, such as the liveship, but he chooses to ignore them).


""Althea and wintrow were just spoiled teens in the beginning"".


I absolutely cannot agree with this, Althea sure, but wintrow was not spoiled, wintrow was 100% in the right in all of his interactions with his father. Wintrows father is the spoiled one here who expects to get whatever he wants and has a tantrum when he doesn't. Wintrow was forced to give up his entire life to satisfy his parents will for him to be a priest, that's right parents, Kyle had a say in it too, but he decided that giving away his son wasn't worth the effort of arguing with his wife, Kyle is an adult and this was his own choice and yet he takes zero responsibility for it. Then he expects wintrow to give up his entire life AGAIN, but this time wintrow has already made a commitment/vow/promise whatever to Sa, wintrows life isn't his to live for himself anymore, Kyle again makes no effort to understand this and can't understand why wintrow isn't grateful when he's being offered a ship...except the tiniest effort to understand from Kyle would make it obvious that no ammount of property or wealth has value to someone who is trying to live for Sa and not for themselves. He then hits wintrow so hard that he knocks him out (he could have killed him!) When wintrow is simply explaining things calmly to him.

"g1lb5b4","&gt;How are they not?

You made the claim not me. It's not on me to disprove your nonsense. Put up or shut up. Preferably the latter.

&gt;We are talking about the success of our species, not our success at environmental preservation.

&gt;All the responses so far have missed this and are conflating the two.

No the two are intrinsically linked, a successful species is one that survives and thrives. A species that lasts a long time geologically is a successful one. A species that explodes onto the scene very rapidly but then dies off just as quickly if not quicker is not a successful one. Think of it like a company. A company that lasts for 100 years is a successful one, a company that makes a big splash but sputters out and folds is not a successful one.

&gt;We are in a thread about AGW specifically, again, you are conflating the health of the environment with that of our species.

The two are intrinsically linked. We are not two separate systems. What happens to one will effect the other.

&gt;We need housing and food, that's cities and farms.

That's just restating your premise.

&gt;Please, separate your ideals about how we should be treating the earth, that I agree with, from our obvious success as a species.

Dismissed. Tripe. You have done nothing but baselessly assert we are successful and also assert that the success of a species is somehow separate from it's capacity to maintain its own environment which it needs, in order to survive.

&gt;We don't need the forests, either, they don't feed us, or clothe us, or house us. Farmed woodland for construction, yes, wild woods, surplus to our survival.

Yes we fucking do. They provide climate regulation, help generate rainfall, regulate local temperatures, are home to the animals we use to survive, are important weather buffers and provide timber for firewood and construction. You are so poorly informed it hurts. Stop talking. You should be embarrassed. Timber farms are the worst, the damage the local environment and don't provide the necessary stability required. natural woodland is more beneficial to human kind than timber plantations.

&gt;Slash and burn agriculture was part of the path to where we are now.

And it's destroyed countless civilizations, it causes desertification and drought. It's caused long term harm for short term gain for many, it's never given long term success.

&gt;My friend, every negative environmental impact we've done to the earth has been a boon for us as a species.

Oh stop preaching. It's wiped out and set us back centuries. Not been a boon. Think of how much more we could accomplish if we didn't have to deal with climate change. Think of how much time and energy we'll have to waste fixing our lazy, ignorant and wasteful practices for decades to recover what we can so we don't cause catastrophic collapse of civilization.

&gt;From the perspective of the earth, not us as a species.

No. As a fucking species.

As a species. The plow has caused the collapse of so many breadbaskets you you'd run out of fingers counting. Chemical fertilizers are poisoning the rivers and seas killing vital fishing grounds; speaking of fishing grounds gill-nets and trawler fishing has caused the collapse of innumerable fish stocks world over. Reckless and poorly thought out grazing has destroyed kilometres of fertile grasslands. The removal of mangrove forests to clear shipping lanes along coasts has caused untold amounts of unnecessary flooding damage to coastal regions. 

You're the dunning Kruger effect to a tee. So utterly vapid and stupid and ignorant that you think you're Albert fucking Einstein.

But that should be a sample to you of what I’m talking about. Your instinctual refusal to believe something because it’s not written out on paper. Like just from a non-racial standpoint, you don’t see how wild and ignorant that mentality is?

If someone fired you and told you it was because of your hair color, but then officially wrote down or told whoever you informed about this that it was because of something else, did it just...*not* happen lmao? Is it just *not* the case? That’s not the way things work, especially with humans, and especially with humans that have half a brain. 

You think 70% of the people who voted for Trump *actually* told people they voted for Trump? Hell no, the social repercussions would be devastating for almost anyone. But at the end of the day, *they did*, which is why moderate america was completely and totally blindsided.

But I mean, back to race. So, in terms of being modern, we can both agree there’s an opioid epidemic right? It’s overwhelming white, sparing African-American and Latino communities. Why? Because doctors unconsciously prescribe narcotics more cautiously to their non-white patients. 

That’s one that even *helps* minorities in a round-about way, but it’s a clear example of a very real racial bias that has nothing to do with laws or anything official. Doctors just **feel** like a minority patient is more likely to abuse it, so they subconsciously (or consciously) act on that.

You really gotta not be so close minded man.

"g0rhtks","police who unjustifiably kill innocent people should automatically be sentenced to death

My reasoning is that police are trusted to protect the citizens  from crime as well as uphold the law. When police kill someone because they (the police) are too jumpy and scared because they think the suspect poses a threat, they end up eroding away the trust that the community has in them. If those police are still allowed to live free lives and most likely still work in law enforcement, they will surely kill again (which is weird, because most humans feel remorse for taking another humans life) 

Now I'd like to emphasize that I support police most of the time, because most police officers are sane, mentally stable people who mean well for their community (though I find it odd that police officers rarely think negatively about fellow officers who get away with murder and misconduct, meanwhile school teachers despise fellow teachers charged with pedophilia and child abuse)

I also recognize that most police officers will never fire their weapons in their careers (apart from training), so hating on police offers just for their career choice is beyond silly and ignorant. That being said, I still believe cops have too many priveleges just because of their job title, they on average receive less punishment for misconduct/murder, therefore they are held to lower standards. I believe in order to balance out the scales of justice, upholders of the law (police) should  AUTOMATICALLY be sentenced to death when they kill someone, and there is massive social outrage  (not if the jury determines, as jurys are often biased)

Example: Derek Chauvin not only murdered a man who was having a panic attack, but ALSO SPARKED MASS OUTRAGE ACROSS THE WORLD RESULTING IN MILLIONS (IF NOT BILLIONS) OF DOLLARS WORTH IN DAMAGE.

(4) People survive gun shots to the head all the time. Ive seen it happen. Look up Phineas Gage if you dont believe it.

(6) the narrative isn't about Ellies relationship to those other NPCs. Its about Ellie and Abby. The fact that she kills all the NPCs just makes the point of the story even stronger - the cycle of revenge only begets more violence.

“You don’t understand what I’m going through Naruto! You don’t understand the real pain I’ve been through!” She screamed, shoving him roughly against the tree. 

He winced at the weak attack, only go quiet for a brief moment. Not understand her pain? It almost made him laugh. The way she went on and on about how much pain she suffered, and how no one seemed to understand her. 

And all of this because Ino had pissed her off.

“Maybe if you took the time to understand MY pain it’d be easier for me to get yours!” He screamed back, fists tightening at his side. 

“You both need to shut up! Everyone will be on us in seconds if you keep screaming!” Sasuke half shouted, half whispered at the two.

The truth behind his words made Naruto shake his head and start to walk off. “Whatever, lets just hurry up and try to get through this.” 

It was silent for a moment, until he heard a loud scoff come from behind him. 

“Hold it! What the hell do you mean if I understood YOUR pain then you could get mine!? Do you know how self righteous and ignorant that sounds!?” 

His fists tightened further, “Forget I said anything.” 

“No!” She walked closer to him, “Please let me know what this oh so terrible pain you have experienced is!” 

“Sakura...” 

“That’s enough Sakura.” Sasuke said, placing a hand on her shoulder, “We don’t have time for this.” 

“No! “ she shrugged him off, “I want to hear what the brat has to say! Come on, lemme hear it! Explain to me this pain.” 

For a second, he almost calmed down. Maybe it was the realization that she probably truly didn’t understand him. Or the fact that Sasuke seemed to be at least a little on his side here. But as the sting of tears welled up in his eyes, he couldn’t hold back any more. 

He turned around, her face looking at him in disgust, suddenly flinched at the sight of his tears. Sasuke’s face softened ever so slightly.

“Shut. Up.” Naruto whispered, tear filled eyes staring directly in Sakura’s, “You want me to tell you about my pain? You want me to explain to you how since day one I’ve had no family? How the entire village treats me like I’m some sort of monster? How I don’t even understand WHY I’m not allowed in certain stores?! Is that what you want me to say?” 

They froze in their tracks. Sakura’s face looked filled with half pity and half guilt, while Sasuke’s showed signs of empathy. 

“What about how all the kids at school were told by their parents not to hang around me? I’ve overheard the conversations! Is that good enough!?”

“N-Naruto I-“

“Just shut up.” He weakly ordered, turning around and wiping furiously at his eyes. “Just...stop.” 

The entire group had fallen silent, a small breeze ruffled the trees around them. Though it only took a second before Naruto’s voice had regained it power.

The whole point of DC's success, like Roy Nelson, Andy Ruiz, Gastelum, hell Fedor, and many other 'heavy'/'fat' bois, is his low center of gravity, when heavy muscular fighters like Anthony Joshua or N'Gannou throw power shots it takes a lot more energy for them not only to throw but to reset (get back in their neutral stance after a big overhand for example) than people like DC. Notice their styles: short fast punches. They throw with speed similar to weight classes below, while packing power. Do you see how Gastelum, Fedor, DC, Ruiz, they have KO power as well as speed superior to their opponents 90% of the time.

Being homosexual isn't normal per se (in the sense that it is not nearly as common as being straight; a statistical abnormality), but it is a natural occurrence. In fact, there is no species in which homosexuality has NOT been observed to occur naturally (excluding species that do not have sex at all).

It is also not a mental illness. LGBT people are more likely to struggle with their mental health due to the stigma and discrimination that comes with being LGBT, particularly during youth. Being LGBT in and of itself is not the cause of other mental ailments. With a healthy lifestyle and supportive environment, LGBT people have been show to be just as healthy as non-LGBT people, both physically and mentally. This has been scientifically confirmed. (If you're interested, I will try to find the study relating to this claim).

Also, humans have evolved into very complex and aware creatures over the course of our existence. To say ""a normal [human] brain is designed and built around reproduction"" is incredibly reductionist and ignorant. That would imply that people who have no intention of having children are mentally ill, even though they are obviously entirely capable of living a healthy, happy life.

Growing older I moved to the general idea that illegal immigration was fucked, not just being Mexican. I love anyone that wants to be american and puts the effort in to become a citizen. Im not about getting an opportunity here, blatantly ignoring the laws, and not contributing to society, just stealing from it. Then the older I got, and more of the world was seen first hand (war torn, or 3rd world countries).. I realized there is a lot more to it than just immigration laws.

For instance, a very good friend of mine is Iraqi. He is a computer nerd and when the 2nd Desert Storm was happening, the extremists in the area would find US hired tech contractors and kill them or their family, for helping the infidels who were ""invading"" (btw I mean nothing by putting that in quotes other than the way it was explained to me by my friend). His sister, mother, father were all beheaded by these men and he wasnt the only one to go through this. It became an issue with the government putting these natives in danger in their own country with shit going on they didnt sign up to be apart of. After his family was killed, he denounced the Muslim religion and moved to america because they usually set up some sort of grant for these occasions.

sourceless claims. You're trying to attack me saying I have no way to back what I say, then go on to make claims you can't back. I can back mine.  George Floyd was dealing drugs and resisted arrest. Rayshard Brooks was drunk, took a cops taser and tried to use it on as he ran away resisting arrest. Hakim Littleton in Detroit just died after firing 4 shots at police unprovoked because his buddy was arrested for a crime. Michael Brown resisted arrest and tried to take a cop's gun from him resulting in his death. Breonna Taylor was trying to use counterfeit money just like George Floyd.  Atatiana Jefferson was killed when her boyfriend fired on cops performing a warranted search regarding drugs, Aura Rosser attacked her boyfriend who called police and was shot after being tased and still refused to drop the knife she had been threatening her boyfriend with. 

None of these people needed to die, but it also doesn't mean they were innocent people just minding their own business. I'm sure there's even other situations that lethal force was used where the person didn't do anything to deserve it. 

The point is here, is something happens that leads to interaction with police. &lt;---Common demonominator.  It happens to whites, Hispanics, Asians and so on and so forth. Still the only common denominator is police. You can't blame race when it happens by black cops and Asian cops and Hispanic cops to other races too and especially when it primarily happens to whites by whites.  We're both being killed by white cops, only we're being killed more, yet somehow to you and your woke pals it's an indicator of systemic racism becuase your tv or a subreddit says so.

If you want to solve the problem then you have to address the actual problem and it's how policing is being done.  Maybe race places a role in a few cases here and there, but that's far from systemic.  We just watched a city burn after multiple men let another man die, including an Asian man and the main man everybody wants to jail was married to an Asian woman.  He also knew George. Common sense dictates at this point with that knowledge, the odds of race playing a factor are pretty fucking low and dropping the more we learn about the details. 

Crime, then sometimes resistance and always cops....

There seems to be a pattern there does it not? But what do I know.  Mybe you can trust the word of the Bureau of Justice Statistics instead. https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ard0309st.pdf Yeah. White Males lead in arrest related deaths. Not blacks.  You can argue blacks are a smaller portion of the population but then you won't be able explain why they're comitting the largest percentage of violent crimes either. I've seen this discussion a million times. 

People refuse to be honest and discuss this topic using factual information and in the correct context. You use facts and you're  racist, and you don't care because you're not ""woke"".  People want to play dangerous games with opinions and narratives and that's how people get killed. This whole bullshit woke game is tearing apart the fabric of this society.

People who struggle with their mental health more often than not become more isolated, they don’t receive a lot of support for opening up. You also seem to think it is easy for people to get help. Thanks to people like you, many people don’t even consider getting help for fear of being viewed as an attention-seeker.

Your “attention-seekers” attitude is very harmful and you fail to see it because you’re ignorant and can’t understand how you’re stigmatising. I’m so surprised as someone who has struggled with it you are so ignorant. Were you diagnosed?? Because otherwise “people who aren’t diagnosed are lying” so you must have been attention-seeking(?).

Calling someone struggling an attention seeker is extremely offensive and will make them feel hopeless and like they’ll never be understood. “If you wanna sit on this broken arm forever and get people to sign it and talk to you I’m gonna think it’s fake” - you CLEARLY have zero clue about how to support a person with depression!!!

Did the US, Canadian, British, and Soviet governments seek to purposefully eradicate an entire group of people just because they were “undesirables”? We didn’t have clean hands but let’s not act like the Allies were literal Nazis. 

&gt; the US literally put Japanese citizens in the US into concentration camps? The same kinds of concentration camps the Germans had? 

The US putting American citizens into internment camps was wrong and we should never have done that but to compare internment camps to **Nazi** death camps is so insulting and ignorant that I can’t believe someone actually wrote this. Last I checked, the US Government didn’t have an official state-sanctioned policy of shoving Americans of Japanese heritage into ovens and gas chambers. 

&gt; holding and torturing Latin American civilians? 

Those camps at the border could obviously be better but let’s not act like they’re intentionally malicious. Where are you suppose to put a massive number of people when they’re trying to cross the border and you also need to check to see who they are and if they’re actually legit people and not trying to smuggle drugs or humans across the border? 

&gt; if you were a cop and shot a person, no matter what they’re doing, you committed murder.

So what are the police now suppose to do? Stand and let themselves get killed? 

&gt; all are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and that everyone has a right to a fair trial.

Kind of hard to do that when someone is trying to kill you right then and there. 

&gt; Cops shooting people takes away their innocent until proven guilty, and denies them the right to a fair trial.

This is operating on the premise that everyone is a good, altruistic, noble human who wants to observe and respect the law. Newsflash; not everyone likes following the law and some of those people would willingly kill another person who’s trying to enforce that law. 

&gt; you’re *killing a human being*. so yeah. Murder. 

No. Murder requires specific, premeditated intent and purpose. You people need to stop carelessly throwing around such a strong word that has a specific definition and connotation. 

&gt; It still happens. 

So just how common of an occurrence is it though? If me and my friend decided to grab guns and have an old-fashion duel with one another, is dueling now legal and common?

That florida town hall made me very sad, except for the woman who said she doesn’t wear underwear and tried to use that to argue we shouldn’t wear masks 
That made be laugh.  I think that guy you’re referring to was also wrong about the sizes of things yes.

In reality, The particle size is only important if every particle passes through the mask filter.
With proper PPE usage by medical personal, and an N95, you would have all of the air pass through the mask, many masks do not do this.

The reality of the surgical masks is that the filtration effect only lasts as long as the material is stable, as it breaks down while using it as it becomes wetter, making it less effective, hence why medical personal have to change them often. This decrease in efficiency is not high enough to not wear them, as the public should be limiting their contact with others at all time anyway 

I can’t help but feel that in the USA, mask wearing is being promoted as a stop gap measure because they’re no longer able to lock down properly, and this is the last thing they can do in order to try to limit the spread.

If you want to reach ordinary people, you need to engage more with MTD, theologically liberal Christianity, ""spiritual but not religious"" thinking, and so on. You need to tackle some pretty mushy ideas. Even a large percentage of people who list ""none"" as their religion are closer to these than atheism.

 a brief review of the numbers 

**What numbers?**

would make it abundantly clear people do not have access to the american dream 

**The american dream isnt the guarantee of success, its the opportunity of success. There are countless success stories you hear about from people that worked hard AND smart. sometimes people dont make it after trying their hardest because its not in the cards. no one is guaranteed success because some people will work harder, smarter, longer, craftier, etc.. to reach the top. Others have FA hustle to them.**

and this is contrary to everything this nation was founded on 

**'the pursuit of happiness' not the guarantee of happiness. A man who busts his ass putting in 80 hours a week at the office, foregoing family, children, etc... to reach the top shouldnt lose out on a job because some woman who puts in 1/3rd of his effort cries 'misogyny!'**

and saying this doesn't make me ""left"" or ""right"" as if these distinctions even have value,

**Each entity exists as something in particular and has characteristics that are a part of what it is.

Only the left have a monopoly on emotions' you may not be 'leftie' but your perspective is.**

We should genuinely work at making an industry that they can thrive in. Wisdom is different to intelligence. You can have an IQ that makes you useless for problem solving but you can have high conscientiousness making you suited to other stuff.**   

to not just disregard those without opportunity in an era of such technological progress and ability

**EVERYONE has opportunity. If they want it or they want their children to have it- they can get educated. its as simple as reading at a library. It'll take discipline and it may be harder for some, but everyone has a choice.**

, the alternative to this is quelling every riot with force, which will essentially escalate into civil war because neither side is going to back down despite their goals being the same

**their goals arent the same. BLM is an openly marxist organisation that seeks to tear down the western world. the statues are a clear example of this. the mindless destruction is another clear example of this (and yes it was them- they didnt try to distance themselves from the destruction)**

"fvmjmyt","&gt; I have a healthy sex life 

You might, but how you view sex is unnuanced, unhealthy and ignorant.

&gt; Yes, you can dirty talk in a loving way,

Thats completely up to the two adults partaking in it. It doesnt have to be loving or caring, what that is or means is subjective, and what is caring and loving to you, might be completely different for other people. 

&gt; If being prude means that I'm not being degraded or in pain that sure, I can be a prude.

It doesnt make you a prude, it makes you a prude to only be able to view it in a context of abuse. It makes you ignorant and frankly childish aswell as vanilla and a prude. 

Not to find something attractive or sexually interesting is subjective and up to you, putting so much emotionally context that you obviously have no clue about, makes you a prude.

&gt; Just because I don't want to be hurt or in pain it doesn't make me selfish.

It does, because youre so childish and ignorant that you have already concluded it will bring you pain and hurt, and you have already concluded that your SO will willingly prioratize his own satisfying on the premise it will be on satisfying yours. Thats utter BS. 
It could just as much be about enjoying something TOGETHER with the person he loves, its about exploring each other in a healthy, respectful way, its about being mature and grown up and understanding that roleplay and fiction doesnt have to be personal. 

It can have hundreds of thousands of examples not just about deepthroating and anal, but doing these things in an optimal setting is JUST as much about your pleasure as it is his. If you dont enjoy these things, then thats completely fine, but the way you conclude these things to be about ABUSE, is such a toxic way to look at sex. PERIOD. 

&gt; I don't hurt my man, why would he hurt me? If he wanted to hurt me, that would be selfish.

How sad it is that you think its about hurting you, and not about pleasuring you, and pleasing you, as well as him self. How selfish and ignorant of you, that this has to be a one man thing. I dont know if its religion or culture that has made you view these things like this. But for most people sex is a two+ part act, and for most people its about pleasing EACH other. 

Anal, oral, smacking, spanking, biting, calling each other names, choking etc. etc. etc. can be an incredibly sexy and arousing thing to do between two consenting adults who are in love and comfertable with each other, its about finding EACH OTHER and PLEASING each other. If you do these things as a reasonable and sensible person, it wont hurt at all, it will be 100% about pleasure and enjoymant. 

And i want to add, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with people who actually want a bit of pain involved with sex. 

Our sensations and emotions are closely connected, and again - for mature level headed adults, this is a none issue, and the ironic part is that a bit of pain is something 95% of people enjoy during sex, without knowing you, im sure you enjoy a bit of it as well. Because we just kinda all do. 

A little squeesh, a little spank on the ass cheek, a little bite in the ear, feeling the pressure, feeling the heat of another person, youre SO on accident biting you a bit, or maybe scrathing your back from pleasure with her nails, alone the pain isnt very nice, but part of the act, the feeling of intense warmth and pleasure and pure enjoyment sprinkled with just a tinnyyy bit of heat can make all the difference, and its something ive experienced basically every person living on the planet enjoying to different degrees. 

Some straight up enjoy being choked out, some enjoy a gentle spank or two doing sex. Its just the fact that you are unable to view these things in nuances. 

&gt; I don't even know how firm hand on my tight would look like.

The feeling of your man holding you tight in his arms, his hands carrasing your back, his hands firmly on your hips, its all part of the game and the levels involved just varries. 
Im sure you are also turned on my feeling an active, strong, partner - a little spank, or a little bite is just the further development of this. 

&gt; Sex doesn't have to be rough or uncomfortable to be good

This is a sentence said by a person who have no idea what its about. No one enjoys uncomfortable sex, they do the things you BELIEVE are uncomfortable for the exact opposite reason, because they find them comfortable and pleasureable to do.

"ftoahcn","A month or so after this Tweet, Vince did say Titanfall plans were being pushed out to make more time for Apex. So the whole TF plans they had were cancelled and we never really heard of it again.

I feel like people in this sub aren't thinking logically, they just see Apex as not Titanfall, which means it's a waste or something, but Respawn could've gone a very different route and made an entirely different game, not related to TF, making any chance of the series continuing next to none. But they stuck with the TF universe and decided to expand upon it and to me that just means as long as Apex is in development, then there's hope for Titanfall.

People also seem to forget that TF didn't do well from a business standpoint, it didn't sell well initially, never really made some kind of comeback like other games have and the one time the game went free and had like 100k players online, almost all those players left in a few months, which just goes to show that the game being unsuccessful isn't just to do with some unlucky release date, which everyone uses as the one and only reason that the game failed.

People are so delusional and ignorant that they can't see past this game's flaws and just the fact that this type of game isn't really meant for everyone, meaning it may never have that insane playerbase like Apex, that everyone wants.

 There are multiple examples of games like this, COD: Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare, Black OPS 3, Lawbreakers, etc, where people just don't like the game because it has advanced movement. People look at Titanfall and see Advanced Movement and Mechs and they think ""Nah not for me"", which is totally understandable.

Respawn went ahead and took Titanfall stripped away almost everything that made it Titanfall, Mechs (Titans) and Advanced Movement, made Apex and it became one of the most popular games in the world, with millions of players and see huge success for Respawn and EA.

Games like Titanfall appeal to a very niche playerbase, which means not that much success or money, but with Apex gradually introducing people to Titanfall, maybe one day Respawn can make a Titanfall game that can somehow bridge the gap between that niche playerbase and a more causal playerbase that is used to more simple mechanics.",1591861433,"people are so delusional and ignorant that they can't see past this game's flaws and just the fact that this type of game isn't really meant for everyone, meaning it may never have that insane playerbase like apex, that everyone wants.","delusional and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so delusional and ignorant","delusional",NA,"so",0

Even though Trump did a piss poor job in prep through Feb. and mid March you’ll find that De Blasio and AOC were telling people to go out to restaurants IN MARCH. And then you have Cuomo who sent patients back into nursing homes while infected, and stock piled unneeded ventilators and lied about it. You’ll also find the hardest hit areas are Democratic cities and states. Florida handled this quite well. 

Trump only has so much power to coordinate resources and supplies. We have enough ventilators, testing supplies, but the problem is state governments doing a piss poor job of coordinating efforts.

So it had to be wrong, which you fucks also validated by upvoting piss poor studies that proved nothing.

Then you blame the high unemployment rate when Democrats were the ones pushing lockdowns. Trump also wanted to open up soon, even if that would have been a stupid decision Democrats were still against it, so I don’t know how you can keep Trump from decreasing unemployment while also blaming him for it.

"ftlgkay","His original apology was trash, he hasn't displayed any personal growth or shown that he has learnt anything at all, and his apology on the reunion was even worse than the first one.

Additionally, he hasn't specifically acknowledged his homophobic and anti-Asian racist comments, or apologised for these. Everything's been very deliberately kept so vague and swept under the rug.

He said on the reunion: ""I'm an adult now \[deliberately misleading; he was an adult at the time\] and I cringe even thinking that I said those things ... We live in a generation now, where saying some things, even if you are of that culture, is just frowned upon.""

a) He was 19. He was an adult. I don't know about you, but I can't imagine having said things this hateful and ignorant that that age.

b) ""even if you are of that culture"" is problematic in more than one way. One, it \*deliberately\* glosses over his homophobic and anti-Asian racist tweets. Two, it's clear from one of his tweets (the third one in the list below), that at that time he \*didn't\* consider himself ""of that culture."" It's again \*deliberately\* misleading to say that ""saying some things, even if you are of that culture, is frowned upon"" when his words were that it ""upset"" him that the N word is ""not allowed to be said unless you are black"" because it was his favourite word.

c) ""We live in a generation now"" - not that much has changed between 2011/2 and now. It wasn't ok then, and this is just another blatant attempt to make people think what he said wasn't that bad.

""Something about Asians that just makes me want to punch them in the suck hole""

""Why when Mexicans laugh on the cyber web, they go ""jajajajaja"". Im gunna start doing that..""

""It upsets me that the word n---a is not allowed to be said unless you are black because quite honestly it's my favorite word. N--GGGAAAAAA""

""Theres this girl I see everyday@school,she looks just like the girl from the movie precious&amp;I'm not just saying this Cuz she's big and black""

They are saying that it was incredibly tone deaf and if he is still parroting that ""disrespecting the military and flag"" bullshit in 2020 then he has actively avoided finding out the real reasons behind the kneeling. It never had anything to do with the military or the flag itself, and the only people saying that were using it as a reason to oppose Kaepernick without even attempting to look in to why he was doing this. 

&gt; because he thinks people should respect the flag and simply disagrees with those that do

Kneeling for the anthem is not disrespecting the flag, and many veterans have even said as much to Kaepernick and others. Why does Drew Brees get to believe that his opinion on the flag is more legitimate than actual vets? Just because it's ""only his opinion"" doesn't mean we don't get to tell him how dumb and ignorant that opinion is.

He's not an advocate for the cause if he still thinks the cause had anything at all to do with ""disrespecting the flag and troops."" 

That's literally a right-wing talking point that has zero basis in reality.

And saying ""I will ***never*** agree with someone disrespecting the flag"" kind sounds like he doesn't agree with their message either, simply because of the way they choose to convey it.

"fscvca3","Things have definitely been coming to a head in the last decade. The pressure's been put on and attitudes and ideas that have always been around, sometimes more dormant at times, seem like they've just come out of the woodwork and become more pronounced and extreme. 

I've gone my entire life not knowing or even caring about the social and political views of many family members. It just wasn't even in my scope of awareness or focus at family functions. They were always just my uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. I didn't know what they thought aside from what kind of leisure activities, foods, drinks, music, movies, etc they liked. 

We're spread out north and south in the US and so there's a lot of diversity in our experiences and ideas. My mom's from the south and her side of the family leans conservative. My dad's from New England and his side leans liberal. We were all just family, though, and we got together and there was never much tension. Now, ever since Obama's second term and especially since Trump took office, the dynamics have just shifted for A LOT of families, mine for sure. Even if we can avoid political discussion (and have even made it a rule at times for family gatherings), there's just this overbearing tension in the air. 

We all know each other's views (though we arguably don't actually understand each other as much as we'd like to think) and you can see how uncomfortable everyone is. We've always had differing political views but it never seemed to be a big deal until more recently. The conservatives in my family seem more brazen, unapologetic, and ignorant that ever and the liberals seem more defensive, sensitive, and quick to judge than ever. I lean left but have a lot of nuance in my views (some are straight up liberal, some are straight up conservative, so it's hard to average them, but I live in a liberal area and tend to have a more liberal mindset overall, especially when it comes to social issues), which actually makes things really hard for me because I can agree with many different people on both sides about different things, but, that means I'm often judged harshly by both sides. At least I can sort of relate to everyone on some level and be invited into each conversation, even if sometimes I'd rather not be. 

I've recently heard some family say things that I simply can't easily forgive and certainly won't forget. Things I wish I'd never heard. Family used to feel like something I could turn to to escape all that noise. Now it's a big generator of it.

"frziplk","I like how everyone assumes that there ARE alternatives. I live in the middle of nowhere. There is no instacart, no curbside pick ups, no uber eats, no public transportation (no uber, no Lyft, no cabs or busses etc.). We don't even get pizza delivery. If we go to the larger town half an hour away they do have curb side pick up, at one grocery store, if you are willing to wait two weeks. You can get same day service at Home Depot usually though. Not much food there. 

The local grocery store does not shop for you. They are a tiny mom &amp; pop and don't have the employees to shop for the sick/elderly. If they did they would have to charge to cover the service. The big stores refused to help her by picking items for her before she moved in with me. When she was recovering from open heart surgery and had an oxygen tank. Most elderly on SS can't afford that extra money when they are already choosing between food and medicine. Especially since the price of food has jumped so much in the last few months. 

If my mom didn't live with us then there would be no one to help her shop. She is a geriatric with COPD, asthma, and on oxygen. I got masks for our family long ago. Everything from surgical to N95 masks. I had her put on a surgical mask to see how she fared. Not well. Within 2 minutes her O2 started dropping, her breathing was severely labored and she had to remove it and do a breathing treatment. 

Who helps these people? If she didn't live with me or if she was one of those with no family how would she get food? There are no services that cover shopping for them. There are no services out here that they can even PAY for since they don't operate in our area. Do we just let these people starve because they can't wear a mask? The ones that dont have family to help?

"frmn4h0","Parcival painfully walked backward to Aiden. He was no longer a manbeast when he knelt down next to the ronin. *Let’s hope Ryoichi’s potion is somewhere.*

“I was there, Bleeding Heart. I was there with John’s crew. I was there when you freed us, inspired us into actions. Now, we’re there, and I see you. You’re out of control. You fool. You’ve doomed your people, and us.” *I know you can hear me.* “How is anyone is going to ever trust you now after this? How is anyone is going to trust us? What you have built, what we have built, what people before us have built, all gone. Because you just prove The Government right, that those who oppose them are all murderous criminals who seek but chaos and destruction. Mad dogs who lash at unarmed civilians. All of your supposed callings which will turn aside your impending annihilation. Because you know this is the end. No one will rally to your causes except murderers and monsters. The oppressed and ignorant that you are supposed to liberate will flock into their arms, trading what little freedom they had for protection.  Nothing will save you now. Nothing besides your happy few. The ones that followed you without questions, like slaves.” A heat of anger coming off Parcival beat at nearby Revolutionaries. “Well, be happy then, until there are fewer and fewer of you; growing weaker and weaker and all the more bitter. And you know damn well what will happen then, *Captain* Vidas. Desperate young men with the eyes of hundred years old.” 

Luckily, Aiden’s dose of the healing potion was still intact. His condition was to severe to move without a trained medic. Hang in there, Aiden. I know it’s hurt but I’ll have to risk it now. Parcival decided to uncork it and poured it down the ronin’s throat instantly all while they were still on the enemy’s ship. It seemed he and Aiden left quite an impression as Kin and Bronx were staring at the young ronin who defeated and *patched* their wounds without trying anymore to hinder Parcival.

The prince’s disgusted gaze shifted from twitching Aiden as Ryoichi’s concoction was doing its magic to Vidas, then the Paragon as the altitude was noticeably getting lower and lower by the sustained damage and the lack of a pilot. Parcival looked at Bleeding Heart one more time. 

“You'll wish to meet your end honorably in battle, not in sick beds of misery, where attrition, entropy, and the dreams that will never come will send you. We both know the Government wouldn’t bother to grant your final wish if they get to see the Revolutionary is meeting a slow, agonizing death you have sentenced them too. You’ll remember today because no one will ever forget the consequences of your action today. Then, you'll remember us. You'll remember that we pitied you. And you'll understand that I was right.”

*Sorry.* Aiden might be in terrible pain but Parcival shoved a Nullifier pill into his mouth before tossing the ronin over his shoulder without warning. With a flick of his foot, Fatalis was in his hand again.

“They hurt Commander! Don’t let them escape!” Unfortunately for anyone how shouted that, Parcival was already on his heels. The purr of Iconoclast’s weapons got louder and louder as the prince leaped off the gunwale to the Paragon, shielding the injured ronin from impact with his own body. 

Bad idea. He tried to get up but his legs gave up, and Vidas had left a parting gift in the form of bloodloss.  

Parcival quickly downed his own dose of potion to numb the pain. It tasted...odd, and he was warned before that it wasn’t quite ‘refreshing’. In fact, the potion will exhaust the drinker at the cost of the healing. That was why he decided to give Aiden an extra trick with Nullifier.

“Come on...” The prince muttered, dragging his body toward the helm. No way he’d let the Paragon crash on her actual flight battle. True, it was one-sided against the Iconoclast but his shipwright pride and the necessity prevented him from backing down. *One of these days...One of these days…*

Parcival looked up the flying behemoth as his strength and empowering rage forsook him.

*Looks like it’s your turn again, Aiden….*

He said “being always put as a second option.” I was stunned since he was my priority. I never fucked around with him.

Lol, if you think Sindhis are not the most ignorant in comparison to other provinces then you are deluded. 
People of KPK might not be the brightest but atleast they know if they are being exploited hence why KPK has seen the most change of power. 

People of Punjab are ignorant but not as much as Sindh. Punjab atleast realized PMLN is better than PPP and switched sides. PMLN is still strong in Punjab but it's losing its hold gradually.
Now comes Sindh. 

I never really understood what jiyee bhutto really meant until recently. I'm not much into politics maybe that's why. There's a reason why PPP wants to plaster pictures of Benazir, ZAB and  Bilawa everywhere. There was a media outrage that Governer Sindh was telling people that it was Imran Khan who was giving money via Ehsaas Program during a money distribution ceremony, then they showed a clip in which Governor sindh while giving money to a women asked her, who do you think is giving you this money? The women replied ""Benazir""...

If I hadn't seen this clip I'd say that telling people IK is giving them money is a petty and shameful move. 
But not when it comes to Sindh. People in Central Sindh still think Bhutto is alive. They have been deprived of basic social, economic and educational progress. Why were they deprived? Because it's ignorant people who make better slaves who you can treat like sheeps and herd them as you like. Since they live on scraps, total obedience is what keeps them alive. The whole wadera culture is based on this principle. We all know this where this culture is quite dominant. Imagine being so weak and ignorant that you think of mortals as immortals/Gods.
There's a reason why PPP wants Benzir photos on BISP cards, outside Ehsaas program centers, on relief packages and why PPP doesn't want Sindh to progress. Only if PMLN had followed PPP to the letter, Nawas Shariff would still be PM. Now you know or maybe you already knew but thought otherwise because you were fortunate enough that you can think for yourself unlike the people of central Sindh.

PPP has its roots so deep that good luck getting rid of them. I know very little and I hope, I am wrong.

"fps7uiy","In recent years there has been some push back against what Obama's administration did against sexual issues in education. Some of that pushback is justified. Some colleges drastically overreacted on the issue and created virtual court systems that gave so much credit and protection to the accuser it was extremely difficult if not impossible to prove innocence even if you were in fact innocent.  Essentially they took the ""believe all women"" idea, something rooted in good intentions, turned it up to eleven, and as a result, bad things unsurprisingly started to happen.  

I think in part the DoE is trying to moderate the regulations to strike a balance between protections for the accused that are essential to the American idea of justice, and effectively prosecuting sexual harassment and assault claims.

"fpcpi5n","Prologue

Let's start right off the bat by addressing the elephant in the room. You saw the title and most likely

the first thought that came to your mind was ""Is this a joke? Or is this person seriously delusional

enough that they actually think they can end the world?""

Writing this book was far from the first time that I've threatened to end the world and you're far from

the first person to give me that kind of attitude. Well, it's understandable I suppose; it's not every day

that you encounter the ruler of the planet.

You wanna know my response to your thoughts?

Consider this, who's the one who wrote the book and who's the one who's attempting to trivially

dismiss its significance before they even read the first page of it?

You're most likely a ""normal"" person who lives a ""normal"" life. Either that, or you're a psychopath

criminal that might be a serial killer or part of a gang. Whoever you are, I already know from your

highly reactive and dismissive thought process that you're not an individual with refined pure

bidirectional apprehension as your core value. I already know that there's a considerable chance

your core value isn't even a bidirectional apprehension variant. I know you're probably just like most

other people.

As a result, I already know you're most likely considerably delusional and driven by active ego.

Perhaps not so much so that it's to the detriment of your capability to generally function sufficiently

within society (although it might be), but then again, that's how most people are. Naturally, my

greatness triggers a combination of your active ego and your delusions. The end result is you see a

god as a nutcase.

I already know it's highly unlikely you're a member of the Shadow Confederation, or if you are, you're

not a high ranking member and certainly not a Permanent Chief like me. I know you're probably so

delusional and ignorant that you entirely deny or trivially dismiss the existence of the Shadow

Confederation and its significance in this world, precisely as the vast majority of its members desire.

I know you're probably considerably sheltered from the true depths of hell that this planet has to

offer. You're probably either extremely pathetic and weak-willed, a considerably arrogant and

pretentious individual that simply suppresses fully expressing themselves honestly in society

because you recognize Miat's socially acceptable and that being a massive douchebag tends not to

be received all that nicely by most people, or a conditional combination of both, simply restraining

yourself from showing your true colors depending on the situation.

This describes most people in today's society.

1. Actually, no, they don't. I'm assuming you have little to no experience in business or marketing because this is a very basic concept. The MAJORITY of consumers do not make in-depth research prior to making a purchase. This holds true for most industries. Anyone who thinks that most consumers read blogs or even go on Reddit prior to making a purchase decision is an idiot. Additionally, to touch on your other point, Exway has one of the cleanest websites in the ESK8 industry, so you're own comment bit you in the ass there.

2. There isn't? They're world's ahead of most other ESK8 companies. Name one other ESK8 company that designs the majority of their components and manufactures them almost entirely in-house. I'll wait.

The ""scariest"" thing I've ever seen was when a car was speeding past a bunch of people in parked cars and someone in one of the cars yelled for him to slow down (a reasonable request). The guy in the car must have had something wrong with him because he threw the car in reverse to go and start screaming at the person who scolded him.

He stood in the middle of the street yelling and everyone just remained in their cars (no one drew guns) and someone must have called the police because several officers came and calmly talked to the guy (again, no guns were drawn) until they were able to resolve the issue peacefully and everyone went on their way.

If that happened sure they would probably not feel comfortable, not that it matters. Most protests have specific zoning and licenses and they can prohibit carrying certain weapons and items.

You can't just go to any protest and have whatever weapon you want.

"fp009d5","It honestly depends on the doctor and how you look overall. Some recommendations for subliclinical hypothyroidism include rechecking until you are frankly hypothyroid, meaning your TSH is above 20 and T4 is below normal. These recommendations are meant to prevent treating people with thyroid hormone who don't actually have a thyroid disorder, which is completely possible when the only evidence is a mildly elevated TSH. There are several other causes of hypothyroid symptoms and unfortunately that creates the potential for physicians to prescribe T4 replacement when the patient doesnt have a thyroid disorder. That would put people at risk of side effects related to hyperthyroidism which can be very severe, including osteoporosis, cardiac arrythmia, and even dementia. That's why most recommendations are more conservative than most patients would like, I promise it isn't that any one physician is just stupid and ignorant.

That said, there's also evidence that leaving people, especially younger people, at an elevated TSH puts them at risk of cardiovascular events (a heart attack) later in life. That evidence is leading some physicians to buck the standard recommendations of waiting for overt hypothyroidism. Thus, different providers are gonna make different decisions on exactly when to treat, and if you feel like your current doctor isn't addressing the problems you sought them out for you should definitely consider a second opinion.

TL-DR: there's a lot of conflicting considerations that your doctor is making, and if the end result isnt what you need feel free to seek a second opinion.",1588200065,"that's why most recommendations are more conservative than most patients would like, i promise it isn't that any one physician is just stupid and ignorant.","stupid and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"just stupid and ignorant","stupid",NA,"just",0

"fop0tjr","I was born in 1951. When I was 9 or 10, my grandma and I rode a Greyhound bus from Owosso to Flint to see the circus. It was my first ride on a commercial bus and first circus.

I rode a school bus to school everyday and normally would ride in the back. So, when I got on the Greyhound, I headed towards the back of the bus as usual. 

Now keep in mind I was 100% clueless about race or racism.

That bus driver came on the bus, seen me about 3 seats from the back and walked back, told me I could not sit there, and made me move just forward of center. Whatever, sounds stupid as hell to me but ok...

We get into Flint and off the bus and I needed the rest room and headed into the first one I seen. As it happened, it had a sign that read colored. The nicest black gentleman in his finest suit, says to me the following words, ""young master, that bathroom is unfit for you, yours is over there"" and he pointed to another restroom. I remember wondering why there would be an unfit public restroom anywhere.

Today as I remember these events, I still wonder why any of that was ever a thing. It is just plain ignorance and stupidity.

Owosso is about 90 miles from Detroit. I remember the 68 riots and how the people of Owosso reacted. They loaded up on ammunition and formed neighborhood patrols. I remember the older people worrying about how the black gangs of Detroit might descend on Owosso as if anyone from anywhere else could possibly care about a little piss ant town like Owosso. I also remember driving to Detroit about a year later and seeing just how many businesses had been burned to the ground.

"fnjg4v8","Listen, you're right about one thing. You DON'T know my mother's behavior, and you also don't know my past.  For example: you don't know that she got arrested for child abuse when I was 9, you don't know she locked my brother outside mid January in Wisconsin, you don't know she tried to hit my other brother with a hammer, and you don't know that she is an alcoholic that has had every opportunity to change and get help, yet refuses too.  How absolutely mindless it is to say that manipulation is not abuse, it's called psychological abuse and it can permanently damage people.  Yes, it probably wouldn't be recognized by a court, but that is a problem with the court system and does not illegitimalize the seriousness of the tactics.  However, I was also physically abused for 5 years.  It's very immature of you to assume me to be toxic, self-centered, trashy, vindictive, undereducated, and blameless off of a single text message.  I do not have a ""narcissistic sense of victimhood"".  I simply shared my experience and trauma in order to gain the support I do not have in my real life.  My mother may seem like she wants a relationship, but she makes absolutely no efforts to spend time with me, and then proceeds to blame me for our lack of contact.  She has not paid child support for me or my siblings for YEARS and still claims me as a dependent on her tax reform, which is illegal.  She is so much more than a flawed human. She is an afront to humanity. She is a manipulative, alcoholic, abusive, self-absorbed, victimizing, denial filled woman. And u have every right to tell her off on the things she has done to me and my family. For you to judge and my situation so harshly from a screenshot of two text messages is extremely immature and ignorant.

"fm7sbok","I had a very similar experience with an EMDR ""therapist"". She would say how little effort I do (except the fact I am heavily researching what the hell is going on with me for 10+ years because no doctor was even able to tell me it's anxiety at least, hello?), also how she treated people who had it so much worse than me like soldiers etc. This was one of the times I let my rage fill me and told her she knew nothing about cPTSD obviously because no matter the reason, the symptoms can be more severe for people with objectively less dangerous traumas and that childhood traumas are much harder to treat because our brain was still developing in contrast to adult brain in soldiers etc. She told me that I read too much and that I should think for myself. Ok, so let's discover America again, forget Columbus etc? Discard all what people before me found out and just keep guessing on my own? She was obviously just insecure that I knew more about (c)PTSD than her (she also ran a kindegarden and some other things, this type of ""jack of all trades"" who probably does nothing well, except for boasting). I usually repress my anger but this was so unprofessional and ignorant that I just left. She at least had the decency not to charge me any more money for this. I then proceeded to cry while phoning my mum (I also didn't normally cry back then).

The worst experience EVER. Consider reporting your therapist or they could do more damage. I only withstood this because I already read books by Van dek Kolk and Pete Walker so I was more confident that I am not at fault, it's my trauma... Otherwise I would have blamed myself, hated myself... They even warned against such therapists! I saw some red flags even on my first two sessions with her but I was desperate to find a cure so I gave it a go anyway. BTW only MDMA-therapy finally set me on the path to healing but that would be for a long discussion, although I recommend anybody with (c)PTSD who didn't have luck with any other therapies to research this (not popping an ecstasy pill with no knowledge whatsoever though, that could be even retraumatizing, you need to know what you're going into - as far as words can describe it). 

&amp;#x200B;

The good thing is that you know she is at fault, not you! Sadly, many people wouldn't see through it and even I after the research on cPTSD was still partially suspicious about myself - what if I truly am not trying hard enough? The truth was, I was just nervous about her, I couldn't relax so the EMDR wasn't working. I am from Czechia where mental health sector is a joke... Even psychiatrists don't know what PTSD is. I had to discover it all by myself, by reading English resources. I now study in the UK where I have a great EMDR therapist at the uni. So much difference and EMDR actually is working now! I got a bit stuck but the difference was a day and night. And I can confide in her, no judgemental comments, she actually validates my feelings, I sometimes can hardly believe it... I was thinking I was just being too sensitive about some issues etc. but she says she would feel the same way. Please stay strong, there is hope! There are good therapists around, although the sad truth is that some countries are so backwards...

You are really dumb and ignorant. So dumb and ignorant that it is laughable and embarrasing. 

S5-S6 are masterpieces. Dorne was bad because it was rushed and was not a part of the original plan for S5. It was poor decision making. Dorne had literally no effect on the rest of the plot, so you talking about it being impossible to make a ""comeback"" from that is absurd. Arya's plot in S5 was great. Not the writers fault that a part of their audience is braindead. Arya's plot in Braavos in S5E2-S6E6 was better than anything in S8. The good scenes in S5-S6 are good with and without context. 

Hilarious how you call smart people dumb, even though you have room temperature IQ. 

1. By your logic, everyone is bad at writing. D&amp;D literally did the impossible. GRRM and ASOIAF fans thought that ASOIAF could never be adapted for TV, and D&amp;D proved everyone wrong. ""Bad at their jobs"". Is there no bottom to your ignorance and stupidity?

2. GRRM himself even said that he was in D&amp;D's shoes, he would never have been capable of doing as good a job as they did. He was extremely surprised that they could do 10 episodes each season, meanwhile GRRM would have only been capable of writing about 3 episodes each season. 

3. D&amp;D did amazingly well without GRRM. They literally wrote 2 FULL episodes worth of content for S1, because HBO demanded it, within 1-2 WEEKS! Do you realize how little time that is? For example, even though GRRM was following D&amp;D's outlines, he was still struggling to write a script within 1-2 MONTHS, and still needed D&amp;D's help. The scenes that D&amp;D wrote for S1 turned out to be among the best scenes in that season and in the show. More proof that you are clueless about writing. 

4. Everything after S1 is literally considered to be ""fan-fiction"" by book purists. D&amp;D started writing their own plots in S2, and the dialogue after S1 was almost only theirs. Actually, OVER 50% of the scenes in S1 are NOT from the books and written by D&amp;D, and the plot is 80% the same. S4 is basically as different from the books as S5, but all these facts are bad because they don't fit your embarrasingly inconsistent and inaccurate fake narrative, right? Am I getting this right?

Nevermind that they're so selfish and ignorant that these cool bros are willing to jeopardize others through passing it directly to vulnerable seniors and immunocompromised friends and family - they're also indirectly taxing hospitals and a healthcare system without any capacity to handle the overload of Corona patients alongside the care of normal patients with other serious illnesses.

"fk817gk","We're going to have to define our terms then. When I hear 'special,' I think:  distinguished by some unusual quality, per  [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/special](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/special). 

Now, it's not far of a leap to say that man's 'unusual quality' is most special because it is shared by no other animal at all. Other animals can fly besides birds, or have been known to fly but are now extinct. Same with most any other quality in animals. Except high level consciousness.

&gt; We often subestimate other species because of our fucking big ego. 

That doesn't change the fact that what we take for a given in humans 'language' seems impossible to reproduce at the basic human level in animals. And there are known differences in the brains of humans vis a vis other animals, producing a biological explanation and evidence for an impossible to surmount difference (not conclusive, but this is evidence).

&gt; The point is we were not the only ""human"" species. 

I don't know what you mean. *Homo sapiens or Homo sapiens sapiens* is the only 'human' species because it is what we mean when we say 'human.' Other pre-human but more related to human than any other animals occupy the genus *homo*. 

Either way, if you want to class them all as 'human' then it doesn't really do anything to the argument that 'humans' of all types are 'special.' Dead or alive.

&gt; If a vital part of a computer fails, the whole system falls apart. But if all humanity dies today, the universe keep on going. 

What's interesting about that is that you have no way of knowing if that statement is true, because all knowledge that we know exists in the universe would also be gone as well (unless you're an epistemological nihilist but you wouldn't be here stating 'known' facts if you were! ha).  

So in the sense you quite literally mean, the universe would not 'keep on going.' There would be nothing known about the universe's state once we die. So you can't really make that argument.

&gt; Now you are the one using argument from ignorance. 

Not really. The long form is, that it so hard to detect any other beings with consciousness despite humanity having a fairly large reach (no not galactic or truly cosmic scales) and the universe having existed for such a long time is good enough reason to suggest that consciousness is rare and special in the universe in comparison to all the non-conscious 'stuff.'

&gt; ""the ends justify the means"" 

That is a statement found in zero philosophy and is generally a very poor paraphrase of a passage from *The Prince* chapter 18. What Machiavelli meant, however, was that a ruler's subjects are so daft, superficial, and ignorant, that so long as they profit, they will attribute good motives and intents to the ruler's deeds which garnered them such a profit.

&gt; By this philosophy, there is no justification to the process without a good consequence, but without imortality all consequences are the same (death). 

I have never ever read or heard any consequentialist thinking along these lines. Consequentialism simply holds that the primary basis for moral judgments regarding conduct (a localized phenomenon) rest with the consequences of that conduct, rather than the intentions behind the conduct. 

That one will eventually die does not mean that there are no consequences that flow from one's conduct that are distinguishable from death. That's like saying a wrecking ball can't do any damage at all because one day the wrecking ball will be destroyed. Or that particles don't actually bounce off one another because one day all particles will cease to exist. I can only read it as a non-sequitur as stated.

&gt; Reading Ecclesiastes I got the impression he was a theist nihilist: ""Nothing matters, except God"". If he was an atheist the book would end with ""nothing matters"". 

Theist nihilist is an oxymoron. However, the author does believe that *sans* God, nihilism is true.

No shit.  ""Straight"" is the expected sexuality.  Do you *really* not understand how society treats gay people differently from straight people?

Are you serious right now?  ""Just let them disown you"" - yeah, so easy.  Some people want to keep a relationship with their parents even if they know they won't accept them for being gay.  Cutting off your parents, having your parents *disown* you is *really hard* and painful.

&gt; No one is denying they are human. Some people deny that they are the sex they claim to be.

This just makes me want to walk away from this conversation immediately. This is such backwards thinking here. Why does it matter to you what gender a person wants to be?

Why are you so spiteful and ignorant that this is the way you decide to talk to someone?

Pronouns don't only apply to transgender people, by the way. Lots of people (even straight dudes, I know... right!?) use pronouns these days, as do people that identify as non-binary.

&gt; Someone hurting your feelings is not denying your humanity.

This isn't about hurting your feelings. You need to wrestle with that one for a bit and try to understand the underlying problem with *intentionally* misgendering someone. Just because you can't wrap your mind around this doesn't somehow make it less demeaning or harmful.

"fibp4f1","&gt; Now, if people who are upset with the current iteration of the game did the same, and provided constructive feedback rather than raging on reddit and the forums about how much the devs suck for not giving them what they wanted, well we might see some things that move to a middle ground, but sadly that is not what is currently happening.

Accusing the people who hate the changes that they couldn't or haven't provided constructive feedback is absurd and a cheap attempt to shift blame to the very people who were the most excited and previously also most supportive of the game and thinking that at this point, less than 4 months before actual release anything is going to change is naive and ignorant. That ship has sailed my boy.

There have been very lengthy posts by a multitude of people detailing as to why the changes were bad and what changes could be implemented to find a middle ground. There have been lengthy youtube videos detailing as to why the changes are bad. More than plenty of constructive feedback has been provided on all available channels.

Also people are not only mad because of the changes but because they got literally mislead into believing that they'd get a certain type of game. The devs themselves said that they made the decision for the swithc sometime after the alpha. They didn't bother to tell that decision to the very people, who had been supporting them for years, for the better part of 9months and then just full on suckerpunched them to the gut with that first devblog bullshit thing less than 6months before release. That is highly dishonest, disrespectful and even if you're the biggest carebeartard of all this should make you take note of how little AGS thinks of their supporters and customers.

So yeah the reason as to why PVPers are mad is not as simple as ""they didn't get to gank lowbies so they mad hahaha"", it's the combination of being lied to, disrespected, their support being exploited by AGS and then getting dropped just like that without as much as a warning even though AGS could've told them way earlier about their intentions. So in other words - People are mad because they get treated like shit and it's highly understandable that they return the favor. If AGS had been honest and like a month after Alpha been like ""yeah shits not working and we cant figure out an intelligend way to make it way so we go PVE now"" or even been working together with the community to get the initial concept to work I guarantee you there wouldn't hvae been anything close to the level of anger and now cynicism like you see now.",1582326852,"accusing the people who hate the changes that they couldn't or haven't provided constructive feedback is absurd and a cheap attempt to shift blame to the very people who were the most excited and previously also most supportive of the game and thinking that at this point, less than 4 months before actual release anything is going to change is naive and ignorant.","naive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"naive and ignorant","naive",NA,NA,0

This sub exists because we care about the welfare of both humans AND our beloved pets.  It exists to challenge the misguided narrative that's being pushed about the breed.  If people go on ignoring the inherent danger Pitts pose it will just keep leading to more tragedy.

I use this example a lot, but I'm gonna use it again.

"fgu7ncq","&gt;So how much is fair and equitable price of power?

A market price? People who can produce or comsume power with lower emissions footprints would be at an advantage, incentivizing a shift in that direction. The market works out the actual price. I'm not talking about taxing or regulating, just putting in a mechanism that encourages lower emissions.

&gt;What will you get for that?  So you choose to pay nothing extra for greenpower now, but you say you are willing to, you just don't.  Got it.

I've put solar on, I pay the extra couple of bucks for green when I can on a bill or plane ticket. How does a single consumer shift the mode of energy production and consumption meaningfully towards lower emissions? I have a fairly limited scope of influence as one person. As a country, we could do something.

&gt;She lied mate.  LNP have lied plenty too.  A lie is a lie mate, doesn't matter who does it or who reports it.

Did she ever say there will be **no price on carbon**? Before the election she actually said that there would be. She seems to have fairly consistently pushed for a price. The government just stumbled in its communication and adopted the opposition's moniker for their policy over time, which was disastrous.

Like I said, I would have supported any carbon pricing strategy. Call it whatever you want, I believe in the policy, move towards lower emissions.

&gt;On August 20, the day before the election, [Gillard said](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983):

&gt;&gt;I don’t rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism. I rule out a carbon tax.

&gt;When she announced the market-based carbon pricing scheme on February 24, 2011, the government’s [press release](http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/climate-change-framework-announced%5D) said:

&gt;&gt;The two-year plan for a carbon price mechanism will start with a fixed price period for three to five years before transitioning to an emissions trading scheme.

&gt;Only later did Gillard and the government begin referring to the pricing scheme as a “tax”.
It should be said that Gillard was probably quite consistent about wanting to implement some kind of carbon price, though it seems that she did not successfully enough ensure that her distinction between a “tax” and a market-based “price” on carbon was communicated to journalists.

&gt;The issue with Gillard’s statements was always one about political acumen rather than honesty. In hindsight, if she was always intending to price carbon – and it seems clear that she was – there was no need to utter those fateful six words in the first place. Once the government itself began to use the term “tax”, its fate was sealed.

I'm well aware of where the other road leads. I know how far business will go towards reducing emissions when there is no financial incentive.

"fgu6d8n","I wouldn't say apathy. In general, Elvish culture tends to be fairly Buddhist in its real-world roots: enlightenment, a cosmic connection between all elves, pursuit of a rapturous afterlife as a result of reaching said enlightenment, a detachment from material pursuits, an emphasis on bonding with nature and your surroundings, etc. Except in D&amp;D there's objective proof that this afterlife exists and all young elves get to experience it (maybe that's forgotten realms only though?).

So elves only do anything if they find a deeper meaning in it. They cook in a zen-like pursuit of the perfect flavor. Or to better bond with their fellows. Or because they find a simple, empty pleasure in the act. Whatever the reason, it's both deeply personal and a layer beyond simple pragmatism.

So yeah, a human might learn Fireball by age 25 while an elf takes 200. It's because the elf wanted to learn the nature of the magic, to become that element of destruction, to reflect on how the Weave bends with the spell, and how they themselves are transformed by the casting. It's a spiritual experience. The human just learns the tried-and-true method of getting it to happen and moves on. The elf would argue that the human is being reckless and ignorant, that they toy at magic and put their very souls at risk with their hasty pursuit of power. The human doesn't care - humans are all about results-oriented philosophies. But it's everything to the elf, if they ever want to see paradise again.",1581113961,"the elf would argue that the human is being reckless and ignorant, that they toy at magic and put their very souls at risk with their hasty pursuit of power.","reckless and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"reckless and ignorant","reckless",NA,NA,0

"fgt0if9","So. Elizabeth Warren is proposing legislation to punish companies from knowingly distributing information they know to be false. This is literally libel. Laws against this are already on they books. Assuming someone or an organization were to be charged with violating this law, there would be a trial where the prosecution would be forced to prove the person or company knew for a fact that they were spreading lies, which is nearly impossible to prove. For example, I don't know for a fact that you don't have sex with minors, so if I say that you are a pedophile, I don't know that to be false. Therefore no libel.

The second source shows that a pretty decent majority of students think speech should not be limited in any way for any reason. 58% to 41%. This question does not allow for any nuance at all so the students voted 17 points in favor of someone going into a hospital with some dry ice, yelling, ""Nerve gas!"", then getting no punishment. Just because the National Review doesn't understand how statistics work doesn't mean you have to remain ignorant.

So where is someone saying US free speech should be any further curtailed than it has been at any point in history.

It goes on to show that 71% of the male student kept their opinion to themselves to avoid being socially ridiculed. Boo hoo. Everyone does this every day. Either have the courage of your convictions to accept the ridicule, or maybe your opinion position isnt as strong as you want to believe it is.

"ffmv3od","From the more grim section:

&gt; I traveled to Standing Rock in November of 2016 with my friend, hauling over 5000 dollars worth of winter tents, clothing, food, and gear. My full time job allowed me to stay barely a week, and my ego, mixed with a hefty dose of white savior mentality, convinced me that my training as an EMT, and my lifetime of experience with direct action and social justice, would make me useful. Fast forward 5 days, and I was crying in the driver’s seat of my car, while my amazing friend listened quietly as I grieved for something I didn’t know I had ever lost.

Last time I went camping for a week, I drove from South Florida to Yellowstone with about 1600$ and stopped in New Orleans for a pretty dope hotel room on the way back. Not to pat myself on the back, but all I could think while reading the above is how lost and ignorant that person is.

&gt; White people do have culture. Our culture is that of colonization. Of genocide. Of taking. Of envy and of fear. The majority of white people can name no more than two generations back in their families. The majority of white people barely know where their grandparents were from, much less who their ancestors were. The majority of white people have no traditions, and the ones we have, are rooted in consumption and the superficial application of organized religion, both of which are steeped in histories of violence.

I can almost, almost, understand this from the perspective of lower income white America. It's actually pretty spot on (from my having grown up in lower class white America ... and when you grow up with something and some people, you do tend to stay there and with the crowd at least through childhood imo) but because she is white and because (I am going to assume) doesn't know very many poor black Americans, or Guatemalans, Haitians, Mexicans, what have you, she doesn't realize the same is basically true for them as well. Culture is for the well off when you throw out religion (which she does).

"ffiu0xr","I'm not sure this is why conservative Christians are against abortion being legal. I think part of it does go back to the passages about people being known/planned by God before they were born. If it was just about killing a human most people would have an issue with it whether or not theyre religious because most forms of morality state that killing is wrong. If it was about God punishing you as opposed to the state, conservative Christians would be more strict about other biblical regulations that are often ignored.

I think this passage about God planning you can be understood in a variety of ways. Some see it as God has an intention for all pregnancies to come to birth because he has a plan for each fetus. I'm Christian, but I see it that God has a plan for each person before they were even created. That doesnt mean he plans for each fetus to be born and an abortion foils this plan. If this were the case, miscarriages would be sins too. Even the most conservative Christians wouldn't say it's a sin because it's not something they could control. In fact many would say it was 'part of God's plan', however hurtful and ignorant that phrase is. So while I think these passages may have inspired people to be against abortion being legal, there isn't actually any biblical basis for this opinion imo.

I think a big part of this view is actually about control. Jesus himself vied for a separation of church and state. About tax-giving, Mark 12:17: 'Then Jesus said to them, 'Give back to Cesar what is Cesar's, and to God what is God's.' Or Romans 13:1: 'Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.' And the issue here isn't that conservative Christians are against abortion, because theyre free to never abort, the issue is they're against abortion being legal for others to do. Christianity was not only dominant but part of the government since Roman times and it has only been relatively recently that there has been a separation of church and state it's becoming rapidly less dominant. I think the fact that control is being 'taken away' from Christians in determining the state's moral law when they had this control for so long is a big factor as to why this is such an issue.

It all started when the Department of National Resources was first formed by a new District-wide Congress under Obama’s presidency, with George Daniel Wayne being put in charge of running the newly-established Department of National Resources/DNR. However, Secretary Wayne’s mismanagement of the DNR and his overall incompetence caused a great eyesore to the Obama administration. This culminated into Wayne being fired by Obama, arrested, and executed via firing squad when Wayne tried to make a secret deal with the various war tribes involving the partitioning of local resources, which amounted to him confessing that local war tribes and bandits have been paying him off in exchange for giving them much-needed resources like fuel and metal. Luckily for the Obama administration, Diane Shoeman was able to redirect and steer the DNR away from complete and utter catastrophe and with her competence and leadership, Secretary Shoeman was able to create an extremely efficient and effective DNR that served the people of DC as well as bring back trust and credibility to the Department of National Resources. However, calling someone or something a Wayne became really common during those times.",1579902090,"it’s used to describe someone doing something really stupid and ignorant that it causes them great embarrassment and just makes you go “oof yikes bro”.","stupid and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"really stupid and ignorant","stupid",NA,"really",0

As a non-believer, I see a difference between comments that address specific theological errors in fundamentalism, and those who comment in more general terms like “REAL Christians don’t hate”.

I really, really enjoy comments that get into theological scholarship. Like I said, I’m a non-believer. Having someone on this sub point out that fundies are more attached to Paul than to the actual gospels, and that arguably makes them more Pauline than Christian, is a useful perspective. It also helps when someone with a grounding in theology or biblical scholarship can explain the historical context of a particular quote from scripture, or point out the differences between the KJV and an accurate translation of the text.

Even if they didn’t mean to, or didn’t want to, it doesn’t undo the mass death and suffering caused by their choices.

_“Louis XVI’s policy of not raising taxes and taking out international loans, including to fund the American Revolution, increased France’s debt, setting in motion the French Revolution. By the mid-1780s the country was near bankruptcy, which forced the king to support radical fiscal reforms not favorable with the nobles or the people.
When the pressure mounted, Louis XVI reverted to his earlier teaching of being austere and uncommunicative, posing no solution to the problem and not responding to others who offered help. By 1789, the situation was deteriorating rapidly.”_

He (and his govt) made awful decisions that resulted in a worsening of life for his people, and between that and the fact that he and his wife were the figureheads of lavish and luxurious life, makes it an obvious choice as to why they were targeted and killed - I do feel their treatment was too harsh, but I can’t fault the people either.",1579466746,"here’s the thing - even if they were oblivious and ignorant that doesn’t undo the harm they did to the people.","oblivious and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"oblivious and ignorant","oblivious",NA,NA,0

EVERYONE brings up their children in their own lifestyle/belief system. It’s hateful to single out vegan parents for what literally every parent on the planet does. 

Meat-eater parents DO NOT give their children a choice to *not* be meat eaters. They don’t give them the information to make informed consent (in fact, they universally lie to their children). They don sit them down as preschoolers and say “we eat meat in this family, but it’s ok if you don’t want to”, like vegan parents are unfairly expected to do. Meat eaters are often extremely hostile when their children try to go vegetarian or vegan. Whereas vegan parents spend their time telling their children it’s their choice and to respect other people. 

ALL parents choose the lifestyle of their children until they are old enough to develop their own choices. This isn’t “forcing”. This is natural and an innate part of parenting. It’s disgusting and ignorant that you act like vegan families existing is a problem when they are doing the same thing that every other family in the world does.

"fdox3dd","&gt;Trump, who once said that U.S. spy agencies should “go back to school,” is now highlighting the intelligence services’work that led to the fatal air strike against Iran’s most powerful general. “There’s some dripping irony, but nobody thinks all of a sudden he loves us,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a recently retired 26-year CIA veteran who held assignments in the Mideast, Europe and Eurasia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following his order to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and the dangerous aftermath of Iran launching missiles at U.S. military installations, Trump said he would like to see more NATO troops in the Middle East because the problems there are international in scope.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Trump has nothing in the bank with the Europeans. There’s no goodwill. There’s no sense of trust — no sense that they can rely on him**,” said Derek Chollet, senior adviser for [security](https://search.myway.com/search/GGmain.jhtml?p2=%5EBYD%5Exdm257%5ETTAB03%5Eus&amp;ptb=142B9C69-C0E7-4B36-9E55-BC0FD7AF2FEA&amp;n=78595e11&amp;cn=US&amp;ln=en&amp;si=AID4-GS-MEar-US&amp;tpr=hpsb&amp;trs=wtt&amp;brwsid=cce04971-1140-4c19-a985-3d1e2d07cef5&amp;searchfor=derek+chollet&amp;st=tab#) and defense policy at The German Marshall Fund of the United States. “They are not going to be looking to do Donald Trump a favor.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Chollet, who likened the U.S. fatal strike on Soleimani to taking a **“baseball bat to the hornet’s nest,”** also said Trump has not been specific — at least not publicly — about what he wants Europe to do. Help him negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran? Sanction or punish Iran? Provide troops in the Middle East so he can pull U.S. forces out?  
&gt;  
&gt;“He seems to have forgotten the European anger over his decision to cancel the Iran nuclear agreement,” Carpenter said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“’A very important element of why Iran signed the Iran deal in 2015 was because they concluded that the U.S. was not going to attack them. Bush didn’t. Obama didn’t. They thought they didn’t need a nuclear weapon to deter the U.S.,” said Pollack, who is now at the American Enterprise Institute.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think this has suddenly changed Tehran’s calculus — that **Trump is so aggressive and unpredictable and ignorant — that they will look at this and say ‘You know what? We need a nuclear weapon.’”**

Intelligence agencies are deep state losers until you need them to prop up your own erratic actions. Check.

European allies are NATO losers until you need them to help restore order in a region you've destabilized further. Check.

Iran nuclear deal is a loser until your ""aggressive, unpredictable and ignorant"" behavior drives them to develop weapons to protect against YOU. Check.

"fdmomyj","Obligatory transmed.

In order:

Tucutes: I have no problem with them existing as a separate movement; in fact, I am an endorsee of the movement by some (such as Buck Angel) allowing them to use the word ""transgender"" if we can use the word ""transsexual"" to advocate for ourselves.  Unfortunately, we're not apparently allowed to even identify *ourselves* out of the movement, as anyone who uses the word ""transsexual"" gets called truscum (if trans) or a T-RF/some other insult (if not trans) because the word is supposedly a 'slur.'  Honestly, I would have zero issue with them *with regards to trans people* if they didn't abuse our medical label for their own ends, then outright attempt to demedicalize our disorder.

With regards to *women*, I have significantly more issues, since they're the movement pushing for ""uterus havers,"" etc. out of deference to trans men, despite actual trans men largely wanting nothing to do with these terms due to dysphoria.  But when you don't have dysphoria...etc.  Also, obviously this includes issues where their belief system directly encroaches on women's rights like athletics (""if anyone can identify into any gender, why can't anyone identifying as a woman be in women's athletics"" and ""there's no real difference between male and female bodies""), safe spaces (""anyone who identifies as a woman should be able to use women's spaces""), issues related to legal sex (""your legal ID should reflect your identified gender""), etc.

So overall I'm heavily opposed to tucutes, but I wouldn't really care if their entire social movement was just a social movement, without legal implications for transsexuals and \[especially\] women.

&amp;#x200B;

GC: Depends on the GC user, honestly.  I get along great with GC women who believe hardline ""no males in female spaces"" if they don't do horrendous stuff.  Unfortunately, I find most hardline GC women do at least *one* objectively terrible thing.  I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that you'll probably find at least a quarter of common GC subredditers saying untrue things about neovaginas (and neophalli, though far rarer) if you search through their post history.  Some statements of which are so ridiculous and ignorant that they're literally on the level of a man asking why ""women can't hold their periods in.""  That doesn't mean they're doing it maliciously,  of course, but it's still annoyingly common.  And most \[although not all\] are completely unwilling to change their unfounded beliefs about post-operative genitalia, even when confronted with (whether scientific or anecdotal) evidence that it's completely untrue, meaning I rarely even bother to challenge anymore, because there's no point if people are going to say bigoted statements about your body whether or not they're false.

Another major issue is the infantilization of or outright aggression toward any biologically female individual who doesn't agree with the GC belief system.  This includes both natal women (""handmaidens,"" ""HOPs,"" or ""deluded,"" or ""we just need to plant the seed"" for libfems, forcible language policing of *any* woman \[even GC women\] who uses preferred pronouns, etc.) and trans men (""they're all such misguided girls"" \[even if adults\], ""I don't care if you betray our sex,"" etc).

Then there's the rampant usage of slurs, from ""T-M/T-F/trans-identified"" on the main subreddit to far, far worse on popular YouTube channels of young GC women (""tr--n,"" ""tr-nny,"" etc).  Not to mention the Blanchardianism which has infected the GC subreddit/YouTubers so intensely that it's hard to argue it's not a *majority* belief system among the demographic, despite it being an outright endorsement of AGP male oppression of trans women.  Sometimes, it will even be outright calling all trans women ""fetishists,"" etc.  I am very careful, whenever I say this, to make it clear that this doesn't apply to people who separate us and warn about AGP men taking advantage of our legal exemptions.  However, I firmly believe most hardline GC women actually think fetishistic men are trans women from how they talk in GC.

So yeah, if a woman cares about radfem issues, supports women above all else, etc. and that means she opposes all trans exemptions, that's great and we get along.  In fact, I think virtually every major GC public figure (Dr. Holly Lawford-Smith, Dr. Kathleen Stock, Dr. Sophie Allen, Julia Hartley-Brewer, etc.) I would get along with, regardless of how GC their actual policies would go.  But *so many* GC women *online* specifically indulge in one of the above behaviours that it's hard to really engage with many of them.

&amp;#x200B;

As for beliefs, I don't really share any beliefs with tucutes other than a desire to see gender dismantled; however, they obviously engage in activities that *enforce* gender, so...their words don't match their actions.  I share a ton of beliefs with GC, but I don't call myself GC because I believe that exemptions for trans women can be done in a manner conducive to women's safety, and, just to be entirely frank, I couldn't stomach having a label be shared by a large portion of the GC subreddit userbase, even if I agreed with them 100%.  The general behaviour of that subreddit is just distasteful.  It'd be the same for the tucute belief system, for what it's worth, based on their behaviours on Twitter/Tumblr//traa/etc.; I just don't agree with them on almost anything so it doesn't matter.",1578558261,"some statements of which are so ridiculous and ignorant that they're literally on the level of a man asking why ""women can't hold their periods in.""","ridiculous and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"so ridiculous and ignorant","ridiculous",NA,"so",0

Same Sanjiv Bhatt that is in jail for a murder case?

The idea that the people taking an armed stand against government is “stupid” “because you’ll die” is so ahistorical and ignorant that I hesitate to respond with effort, but I’ll try. I suppose the revolutionary war never should have happened by your logic. Or the French Revolution. Try to tell that to the viet cong as well. Tell all those HK protesters to stop their movement because ppl have died. We’re not speaking on individual terms. Individuals may die but true liberty won’t if it is fought for and won.


*“The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” - Thomas Jefferson*


Also, the idea that it is futile is also a lazy argument often brought up by people ignorant of warfare and insurgency: “The government has nukes” 


These arguments hardly consider the multi variable issues and realities. Governments can’t simply “nuke” their own territories as it would lead to international uproar, and leave itself without land or people to govern in the first place. Government forces will inevitably be split with factions, pro government and pro people faction. It would essentially be civil war with equal heavy equipment and jets ect on both sides. Insurgency tactics of civilians has proven brutality effective. Combine that with a population of 300 highly educated chemist engineers ect, and you have IEDs that would make the ones in Iraq blush. No matter which way you slice it, humans control territory not jets. If a government force wants to control and govern a territory there is no way other than boots and governmental institutions into said territory. But at the end of the day, the price of blood is far too high with a heavily armed populace for any sane government to ever institute majorly unpopular stances which could cause such a hideous war.

"fbz8zn9","&gt;1) Except that the Spring and Autumn Annals explicitly argue otherwise. 

Prove it. The Annals is readily available on google. If you are saying the Annals agree with you, show it. 

&gt;I have literally seen no sources other than your assertions that claim that Qi was a legalist state. 

Heh.

Are you saying you don't know Guan Chong is a legalist? 

So, if you actually read about Legalism, then you would know Han Fei said '今境内之民皆言治，藏商、管之法者家有之' 
”In today's border people all said to govern by rule, there are men that hold on to the writings of Shang and Guan's school of legalism.""

Guan is Guan Chong. 

Let's see, he said 
法者，所以兴功惧暴也；Law, it's purpose is to support the promotion of meritocracy (paraphrase, it's difficult to translate) and prevent violence (tyranny) 

律者，所以定分止争也；Statue, it's purpose is to stop argument (in the sense that once you said a is a, there will be no argument that a is b)


令者，所以令人知事也。Decrees, so that people know matters. 

That sounds like the definition of Legalism. 

Let's to focus further, 定分止争 is used by Shang Yang.

He wrote 一兔走，百人逐之，非以兔可分以为百也，由名分之未定也。夫卖兔者满市，而盗不敢取，由名分已定也
When there is a rabbit that ran, hundreds chase after it, it is not that a rabbit can be divided by hundreds, but rather there are no determination on who owns the rabbit. There are people who sells rabbits in the market, but you don't take these rabbits because that would be stealing, because it is already settled. 

Again, Guan Chong is very much a legalist. 

&gt;The sources I read stated that Qi was a state that was 'stern and rigid, yet it was rife with disorder.' 

Yah, and? You said who else was a legalist state. Qi was. Was it a successful legalist state like Qin? Probably not. 

&gt;Standard boilerplate 'last bad emperor' rhetoric applied in the imperial era to the rivals of whichever dynasty built the centralized state, but that's fitting given Qi was Qin's arch-enemy.

I don't know who taught you Chinese history. But Chu was Qin's arch-enemy. 

&gt;2) The Han lasted 400, the Tang 300, the Ming around 400, the Qing around 350. Each of the great imperial dynasties lasted longer than the Western Zhou, and the bulk of the dynasty's history is the nominal power to no power at all of the Eastern Zhou.

None of that MATTERED in terms of NOMINAL LEGITIMACY. And btw, are you suggesting W. Zhou had only nominal power? 

&gt;3) Mohism literally wanted a meritocracy, **which Legalism fundamentally rejected**.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAa

I'm not a Trump fan, I'm an Independent, but even I could not handle the blatant hypocrisy and leftist rhetoric.

Howard brought up how comedy has changed due to today's sensitivities and naturally Sarah implied it was because of people like Trump and his supporters and not the leftists who actually created the career and business destroying cancel culture. 

Ok, that's no big deal, I expected them to say stuff like that, after all, no one expects shock jocks or comedians to be smart. 

So they go on and Sarah said that it's horrible what happened to Louie C.K. considering what ""the asshole in the WH did."" 

(side note: Trump has only ever been guilty of locker room talk, not a single woman accused him of ""grabbing their pussy,"" and other than that we now know that the Clinton campaign and Soros paid women to accuse Trump of sexual assault during the 2016 election.)

That aside, and getting back on track, it's ridiculous and ignorant that a conversation and situation of Louie C.K. that has nothing to do with Trump suddenly somehow makes Trump responsible for Louie's sexual assault and the left-wing cancel culture movement. 

Keep in mind that during this tirade they were talking about how clean their assholes were and their regime used to clean them.

Then as if Bashing Trump for Louie C.K.'s rape of a woman and praising Louie as if he's an incredible human being who's life is ruined while Trump dares to thrive, Sarah brings up how Louie C.K. used to ask her to let him masturbate in front of her. Which she let him do it a few times.

That's right, these two idiots were talking about how clean their assholes were, mad that Trump's fake accusers did not ruin his career, defended the rapist Louie C.K. while Sarah tells of his masturbating in front of her while he was her boss and Howard was treating her as if it was perfectly rational.

"fb3sgw2","Well according to your logic you cannot bring up any other game because I didn't mention them. You see how foolish and ignorant that sounds? I didn't shoot down your preferences because ""I didn't mention them."" That was a piss poor rebuttal and you know it. 

And secondly to follow up, Activision isn't making CoD games specifically for you so why does it even matter what *you* wanted. If you bought it they got their money. If you didn't then whatever they got microtransactions that can make up for the small $60 you didn't give them. Just because one dude on reddit said ""I wanted a more *arcade* CoD"" doesn't mean they're gonna halt production on this for **Call of Duty Modern Warfare specifically made for reddit user SSJ4Vyhl.**

I do know this. Siege has changed immensely, yet started off as a ""this is a tactical realism game."" Players demand realism all the time, but then when they get realism they complain. So developers have to dial back and ""fix"" these ""issues"" that players demanded while simultaneously having the same gamers breath down their neck about ""why aren't you personally responding to my reddit post about a bug I found???"" 

Players here have this weird idea that bug fixes, graphics, etc can all be easily changed with a click of one button. The devs are people too and their hard at work fixing stuff that players didn't complain about in the beta but are now. Lmao players were sending death threats to the devs and you expect them to put on a happy face and reply to reddit posts all day while fixing bugs too? *Nothing satisfies you people.*

Her involvement in Healthcare in the 90's is the reason Republicans were able to secure a majority in Congress for the first time in seemingly ages.

Finally, you falling back on the (disproven) idea that everyone who doesnt agree with you must be ignorant and uneducated just shows that it is *you* who is the fool. I did my due diligence of research on Hillary and on Trump in 2016 before casting my vote. Hell, by pure happenstance, I actually had to go through and analyze Trunps entire life as part of a project in highschool just a few years before that back in 2010, so I alreqdy had enough information on the man to laugh at claims like he was a ""failed"" buisnessman. Some of his ventures didnt work out. Yet his businesses are so damn good that when new ventures like ""Trump Steaks"" dont work, he doesnt go broke, he just dumps it after awhile. His networth, factoring in inflation and the changing in buying power of the USD, has grown almost nonstop since he first took over the Trump business. As of 2016, his very first day as a businessman was the least amount of money he has ever been worth. I.e., hes always made more money than any losses or investment could be worth. That is the basic definition of a *successful* businessman, but leave it to the person who is probably drowning in debt and who has never owned or operated a business to have no idea what that would be. As for Hillary, she was as irrelevant as anyone else in the world until she married a man and took the name Clinton, and has rode that name as far as it could take her, which is currently running around the world with a knock-off resolute desk pretending to be POTUS.

You're ""educated"" selfs had Hillary at 95%, and even at 100% in some opinions, on the day of the 2016 election. Obama mocked Trump multiple times about how he would never be POTUS. The entire journalistic class said he will never be POTUS. University professors, professional poll takers, data analysts, former members of White House administration, former higher-ups in the ""deep state"", EVERYONE said with a laugh and woth the utmost confidence ""Donald Trump has no chance to be the POTUS"". He won the 2016 election. Then those SAME EXACT PEOPLE started pushing the biggest conspiracy in the world, that he only won because he was a stooge for Putin and Russia ""hacked"" the election in his favor. 3 years of nonstop investigation and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, and nothing was proved. The AG even put out the full summary of evidence unredacted, only for you people to then pish that now the AG (previously noted as objective and not a partisan) was also just a stooge and a liar and obviously twisting facts in Trumps favor, so lets get Robert himself to testify...only for him to in fact state that the summary was factually accurate and even included his own opinions in it even though they didnt have to be included. Now your party has moved to ""UkraineGate"" nonsense so hard, and yet know they will fail so badly, that party leaders are openly saying they will not respect the results of the 2020 election if Trump is still in office. Even though at the outset, they kept noting that impeachment should be bipartisan, all they have is the only impeachment in HISTORY where not only did not a single opposing or neutral party member *not* vote in favor to push it forward, but where in addition members of their *own* party voted *against* it. Its all a mess because you *idiots* keep trying to make something out of nothing because you are failures and cannot accept that you are not in power.

"fa8fvpt","&gt;This is a link between government censorship and tyranny, not content warnings and tyranny. A content warning leaves the content untouched. It's just a warning. There's no link to authoritarianism

It might be anecdotal but I do think there is a link between the psychology of someone who wants trigger warnings and authoritarianism. I have a cousin who wants to outlaw prostitution, drugs, and all porn, who is in favor of trigger warnings. She also freaks out about the possibility of men ever objectifying her by looking at her, (but ironically she's ugly and has no fashion sense, and is prudish, so she doesn't have to worry about getting attention. I guess therefore she thinks no one else should, if the lady isn't protesting too much.) She's Catholic and was homeschooled her entire life, and I think that she's going to make herself miserable by living with these attitudes. It traps people in a box with a lot of rules.

&gt;I've said over, and over, and over, that I'm not in favor of a contextless ban. Seriously, re-read my earlier comments if you have to. You're strawmanning here.

&gt;And yet you continue to use it despite a trans woman specifically telling you that it makes her uncomfortable. I mean, really, why was it necessary to say it in that sentence? You would be just as well served by a phrase by ""transphobic slurs"" or ""the t-word"" or ""t*******"" or whatever.

And yet you're contradicting yourself in these two parts by ignoring the context right here. I have never doubted the word offends people in regular use like if we just used it to talk about trans, or called people it on the street, and agree that it's used as a slur at present. I still think saying, ""You can't use that word right now unless you get a medical appointment or transition, and yet I can,"" is wrongheaded. 

And if we are going to talk about the context of the n-word....you're talking about slavery on the basis of race. The degree of magnitude between the trans and black Americans is much worse, and it's odd to pretend they're actually equally loaded terms. I think ""tranny"" ( or ""t-word"") is more like the slur of calling a Japanese person ""Jap,"" than of saying someone is always a subhuman and was only fit to do physical labor until death under indentured servitude. Slavery was never something trans had to endure by law. 

I have never heard anyone euphemistically say, ""the J-word"" when talking about ethnic slurs, which makes more sense because Japanese were never enslaved, or ""the I word"" for I dians/native americans, because we give blacks an exception due to history. I would guess there are similar exception-based euphemisms for certain Jewish slurs in Germany because of the holocaust. But no one had to fight a war to free trans from anything, or to prevent a genocide. I don't see any way to bridge the gap and say the argument is equally strong fo euphemism the ""n word"" and ""t word.""

&gt;so many people are still so incredibly hateful and ignorant that your casual transphobia

Name something transphobic I have said? And no, talking about the word ""tranny"" without using a euphemism when discussing linguistics doesn't suffice. (Unless you can somehow demonstrate the discrimination trans face has been on par with the use ofanother word in relation to slavery and a century of Jim Crow.) I wouldn't be opposed to marrying someone trans under the right circumstances, although it's not my biggest preference and I'd fear having to foot the medical costs.

According to dictionary.com tranny was first recorded in 1975–80; by shortening and alteration.

# Important Stuff

&gt; In group-out group dynamics. You could say certain things only if you were a member of the Communist party.

This is a link between government censorship and tyranny, not content warnings and tyranny. A content warning leaves the content untouched. It's just a warning. There's no link to authoritarianism.

That said, content warning, because transphobic slurs. Again.

&gt; I also don't think there should be a universal ban on any word regardless of context.

I've said over, and over, and over, that I'm not in favor of a contextless ban. Seriously, re-read my earlier comments if you have to. You're strawmanning here.

What I *am* in favor of is social conventions that look down on non-trans people using transphobic slurs. That doesn't mean you shouldn't quote queer period pieces accurately. That doesn't mean you shouldn't very occasionally use the word while discussing it. It means that your use should be infrequent, properly contextualized, and avoided whenever possible. Because, again, removing symbols of hate from public discourse is one of many steps on the road to equality.

I really think you should ask yourself why you have no problem understanding and following such a rule when it comes to the n-word, but not with tranny. There's a reason. What is it?

&gt; rather, people will someday be confident enough and trusting enough to not let the little things bother them.

And someday it *might be* a little thing. But it isn't now.

Let me explain. You and I are protected from each other by the internet, so you using tranny doesn't affect me all that much. It's insulting, sure, but at the end of the day I can sign off and forget about you.

IRL, or in a personally identifiable online space, it's a different story. Like I said earlier, the use of tranny is twofold: as an insult, and as a threat of violence. Hearing a cis person use that slur is fucking terrifying, because I have to face the very real possibility that the person saying it genuinely wants to kill me--as well as the certainty that they would stand by if someone else did.

Standing by is the bigger problem, as a matter of fact. Using slurs like that accommodates hate. Makes it feel more comfortable. As I'm certain you know all too well (having read some of your comments on r/atheism), it worms its way into our lives in the name of discussion or jokes or statements that sound mild to the privileged and frighten others, exposing rifts in understanding. The sooner we can push symbols of hate out of public discourse, the better.

And yet you continue to use it despite a trans woman specifically telling you that it makes her uncomfortable. I mean, really, why was it necessary to say it in that sentence? You would be just as well served by a phrase by ""transphobic slurs"" or ""the t-word"" or ""t*******"" or whatever.

&gt; I really think you should recognize a need for a more flexible and greyer world that doesn't exist in binaries.

"f9hqrq2","&gt; I didn't say it wasn't an analogy. I said it wasn't a good analogy. Please read what I write before responding.

And I didn't say you said it wasn't an analogy. The point is that the uprighted tree analogy is not an attempt to say ""ME is like a tree that has fallen and then uprighted itself"", rather, the *feeling* of experiencing ME is like the feeling you would experience at seeing a tree that had been fallen, having uprighted itself.

&gt; The MEs described are only jarring to people who are unable to conceive of the fact that memory is faulty.

I experience ME (and beyond) and I am well aware of the faultiness of my memory. If I didn't keep my keys in my pants-pocket at all times, I would never make it to work on time. In fact, I haven't seen a single individual on this sub who experiences ME and denies that it is possible that they have faulty memory. It's just that ME is a million times beyond the limit where ""faulty memory"" stops being a reasonable explanation. I will reiterate what I said in the previous post: Either my memory has been edited (e.g. *Dark City*) or the world has been changed (or both). It is conceivable that the conditions of my environment have been constructed in such a way as to create the *illusion* that my memory has been edited or that the world has been changed (or both) when neither of these are the case. What is not possible is that the inconsistency that I can directly perceive between my well-formed, long-running, non-emotive memories and the present observed state of the world has come about by undirected evolution of the universe according to the physical laws as we understand them. For anyone who experiences ME, that possibility can be ruled out with practically 100% certainty, In my case, I can rule it out with certainty (that is, not a rounding error).

&gt; I can understand why it would be jarring if you are so narcissistic and ignorant that you think your memory is faultless and that the world is changing around you.

All I can say is ""buckle up, Dorothy""... when Kansas goes bye-bye, you're going to be in a world of hurt. I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy. It is narcissistic and arrogant to think that your understanding of the nature of memory and physical law is perfect and beyond the possibility of revision. I'm not telling you my opinion, I'm simply relaying to you what I experience, take it or leave it.

&gt; I totally get that... but unfortunately, that's a personal failing of TruBelievers, and thus the comparison to a fallen tree is a piss poor analogy.

In your opinion.
 
&gt; You can put it as simply as you want, but the likelihood is that you are just plain wrong. The fact that you can't entertain the idea that your memory is faulty

But my memory *is* faulty. I forget things all the time. That's just it... I have so much experience with faulty memory that I well understand the distinction between ordinary memory failures and *inconsistency* between memories and the present state of the world. Memory is not perfectly reliable (sometimes, it's very unreliable) but it's not completely unreliable, either.

&gt; as the most likely explanation is proof that you are not equipped mentally to make any sort of rational statement as to what an ME is.

Well, I understand from your posts that you do not experience inconsistencies in your memories and the present state of the world. I hope you never do. It's awful beyond words. But you are also cocksure that everyone else's experience of the world must be just like yours. In this, you are certainly mistaken. I'll put it as simply as possible: *I am not from this place*. I came from some other place that, superficially, looks a lot like this place. In reality, however, it is a completely different world, it's not even close, it's night and day different.

Ok no joking or snark; don’t say stuff like this in real life. If you are having a conversation with the type of person who enjoys talking about philosophy and political theories and you say this, they will assume you are stupid and/or a jerk.

I don’t doubt that there’s lots of people you meet who have not read her. There’s lots of reasons for that. First, if not for things like the Koch Brothers network and Alan Greenspan being part of her entourage for a while, she would be considered a relatively minor thinker. Second, both in her fiction and nonfiction, she is an almost unbelievably terrible writer and so most of what she writes is very inaccessible. A normal person does not want to waste their time reading through her terrible dialogue and endless monologues. Third, Most people don’t as part of their personal lives or their majors in college study philosophy or political theory. If they are going to cover this material they’re going to cover the major thinkers. You’re going to read Adam Smith, Marx, Hume, Kant, Rousseau and more.

Given the amount of subject matter to cover, who has time to include someone whose great insight is that reality exists outside of consciousness and that man’s highest purpose is the pursuit of their own personal happiness.

&gt; Nobody can demonstrate an understanding of her here. And it’s not hard lol. One Objectivist to another, one or two sentences. That’s all it takes. Convince me you understand Objectivism. If it’s so childish and ignorant, that means you understood it. So show me that.

It’s probably more that nobody feels like giving you a book report about a minor thinker who is generally a source of embarrassment for anybody over 25 years old.

Romans 9 is a good example. First he goes to write about a group of Israelite people, being related by the flesh.  Confirming their racial connection and the promises given to them. He says he wishes he was cut off for his fellow kinsmen.

It makes you wonder, why is i writing the Romans about Israel? Well, he makes it clear through specific references to prophecy. In Romans 9:20 he quotes Isaiah 29:16 with Isaiah 29 talking about Israel that is asleep, cut off for their iniquity, blind, and ignorant. That they would come to see, hear, and learn, and rejoice for the Holy One of Israel.

He then goes on to quote Jeremiah 18:6 in Romans 9:21 with Jeremiah 18 being about the redemption of the house of Israel, so the northern half as it makes a distinction from as it gives instructions to both Israel and Judah.

He then goes on in Romans 9:24 says that Jesus call people people, not just from the Judeans, but ffrom the nations. The word 'Gentile' is not an individual, the Greek word is ἔθνος [ethnos] which is properly translated nations, or nations in this case it's plural here.

...and then he quotes Hosea 2:23 in Romans 9:25.  

**""As also He says in Hosea, I will call those Not My people, My people! And those not beloved, Beloved!"" *

and Hosea 1:9 in Romans 9:26, 

*""And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there they will be called, ""Sons of the Living God.""*

The entirety of Hosea 1 and 2 is prophecy against the northern House of Israel which was divorced for their iniquity, cut off, made strangers to the covenant, and their redemption.

Followed with paraphrasing Isa 10:20-23 which is another prophecy of the northern House of Israel being numerous, and redeemed by the Holy One of Israel after their captivity with Assyria.

Romans 9 ends with a quotation of Isaiah 28:16, which is another messiah prophecy, and Isaiah 28 is again about the northern House of Israel, with Isaiah 281:1 starting with the ""drunkards of Ephraim"", Ephraim often representing all of the northern House of Israel in prophecy.

Romans 9 is about the divorced House of Israel and their redemption through Jesus.

"f84r2av","Okay so you respond to my rant about patronising comments from people older than me by another load of patronising comments. 

Let me ask you a question: do you really think I'm so stupid and ignorant that I don't know that the internet changed the way we do things? This is exactly what I'm talking about, you assume I have no general knowledge of what things were like before. I'm not 7, I know at least to some extent what life was like before I was born. 

I never said the internet didn't change things. That's really not my point. My point is that it doesn't mean I didn't play outside, it doesn't mean I didn't have a proper childhood or an enjoyable childhood and it doesn't mean someone who grew up without the internet is in any way superior. People act like them not having the internet as a child is equivalent to them going through some sort of hardship that I didn't go through. You didn't suffer from not having the internet if none of your friends did either. You didn't suffer from having a slow internet connection if that's what all internet connections were like. 

And just to add, it's the ignorance about what technology I actually did have a child annoys me as well. I'm 17 so no I did not have a smartphone in my pocket from as soon as I learnt to walk. I only really started using one from the age of 13. I had VHS tapes when I was little. I didn't use the internet at all really when I was a child except for club penguin and school work. I've had millenials assume I don't know how to use CDs and DVD players before when movie streaming has only become popular in maybe the last 5 or so years. I still use DVDs and CDs occasionally now.

&gt; Yes they did. They actually compared the genetic disease risk to the European group at the highest risk of rare genetic disorders. And the 81 caste groups I mentioned were higher than the highest group in Europe. Here is a table from that study: https://ibb.co/qd01RVH . So yes, much more severe than European societies.

as per the pic only one of those groups was higher above finns and ashkenazi jews,other groups werent as well indicated.


&gt; Regardless of what the details of this study are, your original statement about the caste system promoting genetic diversity simply isn't true. It actually did the opposite and created greater health risks. If you have any genetic studies showing that the caste system promotes genetic variance, I would love to read them.

I'm basing my views on the greater rules for controlling inbreeding than which are found in most societies.

the prohibition of marriage between two families for seven generations and also the complete prohibition on marriage with anyone of the same gotra even within caste should automatically lead to greater variance than observable among other populations with similar density.

&gt; It is interesting that all the examples you mentioned are kings or people with power. Still doesn't support your argument that the caste system promotes inclusiveness. Kings and people with great power could always do what they wanted. In the villages, however, it was a different story for the common peasant.

Very well,here are a few scriptural examples  to the contrary,

The 
only person apart from arjun to see the vishwaroop of Sri Krishna was Sanjaya,the charioteer.

Before the bhagavad geeta in the mahabharat comes the vyadha geeta wherein a butcher acts as guru to a brahman yogi and shares the secrets of enlightenment.

Historically too,The orthodox brahmin Chanakya chose a shudra boy chandragupta as his pupil and elevated him to kingship,dethroning a brahmin dynasty in the process.

All skilled workers like artisans ,carpenters,hunters etc were shudras who obviously did business ,ie. traded in their wares and skill and the caste system allowed them to train early in their professions and create unrivalled masterpieces like the monolithic kailasa temple.

obviously they were well respected for their skill.

 &gt;If we see stories such as this: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43605550 in present-day India, it is laughable to suggest that the caste system promoted inclusivity for all who wanted to exercise their preferences in the past.

Comparing the past with the present is ridiculous when all our educational institutions and scholars were destroyed first by Muslims and then the remaining were subverted by Christians.

BTW the vast majority of dalit violence is from muslims like the man recently burned alive for celebrating India's victory in a cricket match or this months very case of a 13 year old Dalit girl gangraped by muslims because she was a kaffir,or even the attack on dalits singing bhajans in a temple.



&gt; Not sure what the point you are trying to make is here. You don't need a caste system to efficiently manage labour. I would say that nepotism arising from caste system in fact promotes inefficient management of labour, if anything since s people are put into positions simply because of who their father was, not because of their aptitude or talent.

I disagree,a brahmin who drank liquor or gambled/womanized would be forsaken no matter who his father was,so also a shudra who was unskilled in his work couldnt depend on his father's fame to sustain him.
 
 
&gt; The world is overpopulated as it is. The rest of the world should decrease their birth rates as well.

Not at the cost of cultural extinction.

Though i do encourage you to prefer adoption over biological children if you're so inclined.

&gt;Another major reason why there are low birth rates in the west is because women also have the freedom to pursue careers. Is this a bad thing? 

women are also the primary consumers of anti depression medication in the west,is this a bad thing?

trends in female happiness in the west have also shown consistent decline since the 1970's,male happiness is intact.

Divorce rates too have exploded with a marriage in the west now having 60% chance of failure for first marriage.

&gt;Birth rates in some South India are below replacement level as well, which is a good thing. I think the rest of India needs to follow.

South Indian states are also being abrahamized as a result,since population control is Haram in islam.

Kerala alone sees Hindus becoming a minority in a district every 5 years.
 
&gt; Migrants are a different issue entirely and not relevant to this discussion. Population decline is a good thing, especially for India.

Discussing social structures inevitably involves discussion of factors affecting their existence.
 

 
&gt; If you are part of the modern world, which I am guessing you are since you use your phone/computer, you are also contributing to these problems because you use electricity.

Except per capita carbon emissions of an Indian are less than one tenth of a westerner.

 &gt;The solution to these isn't to implement the Varna system across the world and go backwards. The only solution is to move forward through education and awareness.

Do you mean  the Hindu education that nature was sacred was backwards and ignorant? that pollution of water sources was an exile worthy crime and sin punished by Hell.

that trees were to be cut only as per needs and not for profit.
 

&gt; America is #19 on the World's Happiness Report by the United Nations (my country Canada is # 9), while India is #140 and Uganda is #136. America and Canada must be doing something right. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report

from your link:



Others point out that the ranking results are counterintuitive when it come to some dimensions, for ""instance if rate of suicide is used as a metric for measuring unhappiness, (the opposite of happiness), then some of the countries which are ranked among the top 20 happiest countries in the world will also feature among the top 20 with the highest suicide rates in the world.""

besides the rankings come out vastly different for the two other agencies making that very list.

I suppose happiness comes easy to those who need to take happy pills to function without killing themselves.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929.php

Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people aged 10-34 years.
 



&gt; I have no idea what any of this means. But if a Brahmin can do the work of a Shudra and a Shudra can do the work of a Brahmin in modern times, then the necessity of having a caste system has clearly faded away. I think this the answer that I was looking for. Thank you.

If you had listened to it, you would know that is not true. He specifically explained what the difference was between previous whistleblowers and him.

"f5850je","I actually do believe Nagai (when sticking to canon) is arguably the best director out of the bunch, largely because he's been able to dedicate as many episodes as he wants to them. In particular, I *do* think Level Upper's anime adaptation was arguably stronger than the source material: yes, it became more about Saten than Academy City as a whole, but that gave it more emotional impact (even if it detracts from the scale); Saten being somewhat resentful towards those with Levels and initially cynical about meeting Misaka was also a *fantastic* change, as it was a very subtle way to show what her mindset was like at the time. It also leads heavily into her decision to use Level Upper in the first place, which feels a little flat when compared to the manga.

That said, I do dislike that, during the ""finale"" of that Arc that Misaka doesn't get any flashes or images of any other students, nor do they follow-up on them. I'm genuinely curious as to why that was cut, as it would have been barely half an episode, if that. Especially since, well...

...the biggest flaw with Nagai is his choice of filler. Now granted, both Poltergeist and Silent Party are arguably ""required"" in order to resolve the character arcs of Kiyama and Shinobu (which are otherwise left hanging, aside from oblique references later on). That doesn't meant they're *good*, but it does mean that hating on them for existing is a little silly. I'd rather reserve that hate for 2/3 of Railgun 1 and it's utterly absurd filler, as well as the fact that Kongou was effectively ruined in her adaptation (in large part because of how frequently she was used).

I still don't get the hate for the clover-episode, though. &gt;\_&gt;; I mean, I *sort of* get it, but honestly, providing a sense of extreme cognitive dissonance: it plays Misaka's despair and moronic (and it was, as much as I love her) one-girl struggle against the backdrop of ""everything else in the world is completely normal"". It is a *fantastic* touch.

"f4ohp76","Oh yes, that was a shocking moment for me. I couldn't believe it when she said that.

Bill Clinton was my president while I was growing up and I remember the Republican outrage against universal health care proposals Hillary especially wanted to pass. Hillary was the original medicare for all proponent. When universal health care wasn't going to pass as a bill, Hillary and Bill worked with some Republican lawmakers to formulate the children's health care insurance plan. It was attractive to the Republicans at that time because it concerned *kids health* and they still had a soft spot for that. Passing CHIP was a great thing to do and indeed Sanders voted against it because he felt at the 11th hour that it didn't go far enough. So basically doing some good wasn't good to him because it wasn't perfect. As AOC said yesterday....as a kid she depended on CHIP. That thing that *Hillary* helped get passed and that Sanders voted against. All the accolades she was trying to associate with Sanders were actually unjust. In reality they are accolades for Hillary's passion for universal healthcare turning into pragmatism when there was no way a Republican Senate would pass it. Instead of throwing up her arms, she went and got something done. Like Obama has said, ""better IS good"". Sometimes baby steps are what's needed for a better world. 

Hillary is the president that we all need, but sadly don't deserve.

"f49moeq","""Overall, parental OT increased across the study period and there were no differences between maternal and paternal OT at each time point.""

What are you talking about? This is not at all the same as Oxytocin, which is a hormone that the mother's body automatically releases that really have nothing with the unconsciously whereas a boundary between a father a child is done consciously; which means it is a choice where the mother doesn't. Oxytocin is not found in Men at all when it comes to Biological factors. The males don't automatically have it, the males look for it, whereas the female's body automatically releases it. 

""You're not special, you're just a chauvinist.""
 Chauvinist or not, I, at least, acknowledge myself on stuff.

""Unless a woman decides she doesn't want it, right? Because fuck equality, her choice, his responsibility, yeah?""
 
Oh, maybe because...I don't know? The biological factors of the complete seed growing inside the body of the woman? It's all her choice if she chooses to abort it because it is in her body, but, if she chooses to keep it, she didn't put there alone. Did she? Just like she didn't force you to try your penis inside of her vagina, so, you see, one way or the other, it's all about choices. You don't want to pay child support? Leave women alone. 

""You're applying the same definition as Koss, you just don't have the intelligence to recognize it.""

 And you don't have the reading comprehension level to tell things apart. Here, again, read calmly and take your time, and, even if you spend hours in reading it, keep in mind there'll be a time when your dyslexic brain will get it: ""counterclaim for ya: One in five women and one in 71 men will be raped at some point in their lives (a) y 46.4% lesbians, 74.9% bisexual women and 43.3% heterosexual women reported sexual violence other than rape during their lifetimes, while 40.2% gay men, 47.4% bisexual men and 20.8% heterosexual men reported sexual violence other than rape during their lifetimes. 91% of the victims of rape and sexual assault are female, and 9% are male. And these are very recent results from the modern world, and, now, you are asking yourself, ""If the results are like this in the modern world, a world that recognize women as human beings, then what could things have been in older ages? "" I'm not stupid, and so I know what I said, but, as any incompetent and brainless conversationalist, you took that only one prhase that benefited you and came up with an answer. I didn't say rape on males were rare, the statistics and proofs said them. I'm not pretending anything, just like I'm not pretending rape on men couldn't occur, but, let's not pretend that rape on men occurred even nearly as the same rate. Acknowledge what needs to be acknowledged and stop running away from the truth in order to feed your immeasurable self-denying. That's illogical.
       Vs 
""it is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.""
 
And, even if you don't get it, keep on reading over and over.

""Because Ni is following a script wherein men bad and women victim and never think for yourself! 
 No, just the fact that you show no sign of intelligence. 

""Lol, women arranged marriages, deal with it.""

""Arranged marriages were very common throughout the world until the 18th century. Typically, marriages were arranged by parents, grandparents or other relatives. First, the father or mother would see the man they wanted for the child, and would decide together if they wanted him, however, the final decision would go to the father. If the father disagreed, the mother would not be able to allow the marriage, and, even if the mother disagreed, if the father wanted it, the marriage would still be able to happen.""
Read that again! C A R E F U L L Y.

""Conscription isn't a right, princess.""

I know what I said. I didn't say that about SS, but the right for women to get into army; which is basically what you have to gain first before trying to get yourself into SS. And Women fought for it, now, because of Biological factors, it's a lost case when women want to be in SS, and that's totally logical, and I'm pretty sure women have more to fight against as women rights than a stupid law invented BY MALES FOR MALES in order to kill each other more comfortably. When you're fighting for causes, you don't fight for the bad ones. Do you? When the males were making this law, they did not demand women's permission, so why would women have get into it? You do the bed you sleep in alone. 

""What an adorable framing, but men only gained an equal voting right to women in 1975, before they lost it in 1980, and I still don't see you fighting for equality in either direction.""

We all know the real problem is that the ""board"" of directors and owner of our club have absolutely no clue what premier league football is in 2019, and what is required to be successful in it. If they did they wouldn't of hired Bruce in the first place, but they're lazy, arrogant, and ignorant. 

That said, the utter incompetence and disinterest of the clubs off-field management doesn't completely excuse the the on-field performance. Whilst I'm not going to get on the back of players too much, as being directed by the statistically and objectively worst head coach in the league must be a miserable experience, as a team their lack of effort yesterday was embarrassing. 

Lets put things into perspective with our head coach. Steve Bruce was a pretty below average manger in his absolute prime, and he is way way way past that stage of his career now. He's been left behind by the sport and every single one of the players know this, so how on earth anyone could expect him to motivate them into anything other than a mediocre performance where we scrape result here and there?

The players don't have a clue what the game plan is beyond the first 15 minutes of a game, or the first time something goes wrong (whichever comes first). That is unarguably Bruce's role as the head coach, the buck absolutely stops with him. Everyone going around and saying, ""don't blame Bruce, blame Ashley"" need to pull their fucking head out their arse.

&gt;That person doesn't need a theological discussion, they need a psychologist.

To quote your own words, ""Who are you to dictate the discourse?"" How do I know this standard isn't gatekeeping? 

&gt; I have no formal education, theologically speaking. I am armed only with what I've read and discussed on the internet. 

As I said, it's not needed for faith, but it is for doctrine. And you have many resources other than the internet, namely a clergy.

&gt;I've come in here to ask a question.  

But I don't think that's being honest considering your first initial comment was, ""Ours is a religion of faith. People can have ideas and beliefs that aren't supported by facts and figures. These people want to discuss things. Also, you're gatekeeping and that's generally frowned upon."" No interrogative statements. 

&gt; From your perspective, I meet the criteria perfectly. I am an example. And indeed, you came on pretty strong to let me know it. 

I apologize, that was not my intent. You just at that moment presented exactly what OP posted this thread about. It's common practice to give Scripture in context so you can see its relevance to make sure it's not cherry picked. A very common amateur mistake when debating Scripture is to point to the non-relevant Scripture and misrepresent the argument. The only time you would do that is if the Scripture really is presented in conflict to the argument. Like when Mormons say that the Pauline epistles are about earning salvation through works, notice they never give the verses they cite in context because you would literally have to disregard everything else that Paul has ever said to believe that to be true.

&gt; I also see a distinction between crazy and ignorant that I think you may see differently. 

No, it's probably the same as you, but I'm asking what makes crazy ""crazy"" and why is it less valid than anything else? What standard are you using to say their view is invalid? Keep in mind as soon as you set a standard, you're gatekeeping.

&gt; while I agree there is a level of ignorance above which you shouldn't engage, I think it's far, far higher than you currently have it set and I think it must include a degree of arguing-in-bad-faith or speaking-without-listening or something like that. 

When arguing about faith or what the word says, I agree, but when making an argument against Sola Scriptura, or the Trinity, etc., that needs a degree of understanding higher than common grasp. What you get, most of the time (and I feel OP's pain on this one throughout this sub), is people tossing out vital and major points of Christianity for no better reason than they don't like them. And if you tell them, ""that's not Christianity, no matter who much you may think that,"" now you're gatekeeping.",1569785321,"like when mormons say that the pauline epistles are about earning salvation through works, notice they never give the verses they cite in context because you would literally have to disregard everything else that paul has ever said to believe that to be true.  &gt; i also see a distinction between crazy and ignorant that i think you may see differently.","crazy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"crazy and ignorant","crazy",NA,NA,0
"f1vse9g","&gt; I'm sincerely asking.

Then I'll sincerely answer.

&gt; If a person doesn't know what they're talking about, how can you entertain anything they say?

With any broad statement, it can be interpreted a number of ways. Let me give two differing examples to illustrate my take on it.

First example, the post you linked. I'll admit, by about 1/3 of the way, I started skimming and switched back to reading carefully for the ending. The entire post epitomizes the phrase ""tilting at windmills"".

Starting at an extreme, if a person can no longer coherently communicate their ideas, you literally can't take them seriously. In a post like that one, I can get a very vague idea of what his points are, but I'm projecting a LOT of my assumptions about him to do so, which makes taking him seriously to be either dangerous or pointless, depending on the situation.

That person doesn't need a theological discussion, they need a psychologist.

That brings me to the second example, me. First, let's refresh what OP's claim was:

&gt; Gotta love how people, unlearned, armed with only what they read on the internet, like to come in here and ask a question, but then argue with people who know more than they do.

I have no formal education, theologically speaking. I am armed only with what I've read and discussed on the internet. I've come in here to ask a question. Now I'm arguing (in the good spirited sense) with people (you) that know more than I do (by your own claim, on this specific topic).

From your perspective, I meet the criteria perfectly. I am an example. And indeed, you came on pretty strong to let me know it. 

Yet, I like to think that I'm reasonably polite, willing to listen and learn, willing to argue in good faith, and I definitely like to think that I'm more coherent than the post you linked. On my good days, I even like to think I have something to say that's worth hearing.

So to bring this back to your question, while I agree there is a level of ignorance above which you shouldn't engage, I think it's far, far higher than you currently have it set and I think it must include a degree of arguing-in-bad-faith or speaking-without-listening or something like that.

Perhaps they meant his constant cheating in his business practices, such as scamming over 6000 students out of tuition money with worthless classes at a quickly defunct university or, in the words of the NY Attorney General, the “persistently illegal conduct” perpetrated by his charitable foundation, such as self-dealing and illegal campaign contributions. The 2017 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting was actually won by David Fahrenthold for his initial investigatory work into the illegal practices of the Trump Foundation, because he was not in fact, as you put it, “making shit up.” There is an *excessive* amount of evidence and proof, and if you’re interested in educating yourself on even more of it you can read the documents pertaining to the ongoing state investigation.

Of course by using the word “cheating” in regards to Trump, the person you responded to might also have been simply referring to his extramarital affair with Stormy Daniels, which you might remember from his long time personal attorney now being in prison due to the related campaign finance violations made “in coordination with and at the direction of,” you guessed it, Donald J. Trump. 

“Treasonous” could be referring to multiple things, perhaps the conclusion of the Mueller report that enough evidence exists to indict Trump on obstruction of justice were he not a sitting president, along with its finding that there is reasonable suspicion of the Trump campaign having colluded with Russia which is likely not provable beyond a reasonable doubt because of the obstruction of justice committed by Trump firmly established in the report. The false attempts to spin the report as an exoneration of Trump were concretely denied by Robert Mueller in his letters to William Barr. [Here’s a lawyer’s explanation of what you need to know in order to understand the findings of the Mueller report](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f71Rasj_0JY); with that in mind you should give it a read. There is plenty of your desired evidence and proof  within.

Now, their reference to treason might also be in relation to Trump’s [repeated violations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/trump-facing-emoluments-lawsuits-heres/story%3Fid%3D65217053) of the [emoluments clause](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-and-foreign-emoluments-clause/) of the [US constitution](https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/old-uploads/originals/documents/Trump%20and%20the%20Emoluments%20Clause.pdf), perhaps it’s referring to the Veselnitskaya meeting, perhaps it’s referring to the outing of secure intelligence to the Russians that resulted in the extraction of one of the CIA’s top informants in Russia, perhaps it’s referring to him personally ordering his staff to freeze almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before he pressured the Ukraine president eight times in the span of one call to investigate his political opponent...there’s so many possibilities it’s impossible to say what they were referring to specifically.

"f0s22to","&gt; Rofl. Freeloading. Are you serious? It's a free game. What sort of weird elitist culture are you trying to build? Dismissing people who are smart enough to not spend money on a free game doesn't make you on a better tier, it makes you dumb with a possible addiction issue.

Again, you are not likely a mental health professional so stop dispensing mental health assessments.

It's a free game that still costs money to make and maintain. Some of us occasionally purchase items in game to support the developer/game. Some do so more than occasionally.

You seem to think you are very smart for getting to play the game for free, and are implying that people who buy anything are not smart. Intelligent people realize that just because the cost of entry is nil, doesn't mean that you shouldn't ever consider lending some financial support to something you love.

&gt; Stop acting like an entitled brat with your hand out looking for a compensation because you don't understand words.

I'm gonna wager that I'm older than you, as for entitled...all of your language and the way you talk to people online spells out entitled. I'd guess you often think you are the smartest person in the room. Maybe you are, but you are also tactless and narrow minded.

&gt; Again, look at the doofus dismissing discussion and putting himself above others who are wise enough to diversify hobbies and spend money more wisely.

More wisely? I drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $20-40 a year into the game. I do so because I like the game and I consider it a worthwhile expenditure to use the coins to expand inventory or buy boxes on occasion. Other folks might be less scrupulous, but that's on them.

My argument has always come from the perspective that these events are targeted at coaxing players into spending money on incubators and raid passes in the hopes of getting these things. I find it an ethical lapse when those events have unannounced/unplanned changes midway through the event period. That's not entitled...that's a paying customer airing a grievance with a vendor who has changed the terms of deal on the fly.

&gt; ""You don't get a say because you don't spend money on this free game"" isn't an argument.

It is when you brag about not spending a dime, and then try to smear people who have bought things. You are taking the superior position of being proud of your lack of support for a game you clearly are pretty invested in, hence these lengthy posts in a sub devoted to it. You care about the game enough to follow threads on Reddit, to argue with people on the sub...but not enough to contribute financially to the game...which makes you a hypocrite.

You are not engaging the issue from a position of good faith. you are attacking the character of people who may have put money into the game specifically because of these events, and are implying they are stupid or irresponsible.

I stand by pointing out that as an unpaying player, you have no skin in this, so you shouldn't feel so strongly that others are incorrect for feeling cheated. You are unaffected, so it's easy for you to dismiss the situation and attempt to smear those who are affected.

&gt; I derive a lot of fun playing the game, too. I play daily. I end up hatching two, maybe three eggs a day with just the free incubator. That number goes up when I spend coins. It takes three days to get enough for a second incubator, four for a super incubator. I do daily quests, and get my weekly research reward consistently. I participate in raids on a fairly regular basis. I have a stock of premium raid passes that I have yet to burn through (I seem to get a lot just from buying the bundles).

So you are a firmly enfranchised player who looks down their nose at people who fund the continuance of something you are investing a tremendous amount of time into?

Do you not realize how callous and ignorant that position is?

&gt; I put plenty of effort into the free game. I'm helping Niantic through keeping the player base alive and interacting with players, which is a second form of currency in free games. Trying to gatekeep my opinion just shows how dumb you and your lot really are.

This is laughable. You are keeping the game alive by showing up? Get real. You really do think very highly of yourself and very little of others.

&gt; Again, this is not a mentally healthy approach to a hobby. You can stomp your feet in anger as much as you want, but in the end you're wrong on all accounts. You literally have no idea what you're talking about. Enjoy throwing real money at a free game so you can get everything just slightly faster than I do, though. Seems like a solid long-term plan for your life 🙄

Again, you are not a mental health professional. It is irresponsible to dispense mental health assessments when you are not qualified to make them.

As for not knowing what I'm talking about? I've played a fair amount of mobile games, and I always contribute occasionally financially because that is the thing that responsible adults do when they are given free access to something that enriches their life in some way. There are lots of organizations that offer free services or facilities and it's completely acceptable to take advantage of them, but if you have the means you should consider contributing to those orgs occasionally. Showing up to just take and take and take and sneer at those who contribute and facilitate the whole program you are spending so much time enjoying is a detestable position.

"ez9jx18","Prepare for some cringe guys, and not to be too “serious” in a sub like this, but the philosophy in the Camus quote is still a *huge* risk and is still irrational.

Firstly “living like there is a god” is extremely vague and doesn’t even explain which god specifically. There are millions of possible “gods” that you would have to consider when “living like,”  all with their own requirements. The chances that you are picking the wrong god is extremely high, you may very well be serving the wrong god only to find out that you fucked up big time when facing judgment under the shadow of Cthulhu in the afterlife. You’re basically throwing a dart blindfolded at a dart board filled with the names of thousands of gods, worshiping the one it lands on, and hoping that it works out. 

This doesn’t even consider that any decent and just god probably wouldn’t give a single fuck about who you worshipped and why. You’re not gonna fool any omnipotent god by thinking you’re being clever just by worshipping the one your parents told you to and the society around you pressured you into, especially if it’s because of selfish reasons and you’re scared of being tormented for eternity for not doing it. I don’t think and omnipotent and omnipowerful being would be so insecure and ignorant that they would torment you for eternity because you didn’t spend your every moment alive worshiping it and doing exactly as it said. What it “said” being the words written by men thousands of years and hundreds of languages ago. 

In my mind any decent god would judge you by your intent, and by your inner compass of morality. A moral compass that you put rigorous effort into developing by using your own ability to  reason. An ability given to you by that god to interpret a reality created by that god. Any omnipotent god would know what you *really* were at your heart and would judge accordingly, with empathy and understanding of your own unique situation and *every single* variable that went into producing your character and identity as a human and moral agent. A far more empathetic and accurate judgment than what any human could even consider. 

Like I said, I don’t want to be too serious, but if someone on here is struggling with their faith, lack of faith, or moral identity, or some kind of existential crisis, just because you don’t “live like *whatever*” doesn’t mean that you are bad, wrong, or even possibly wrong.

It was about voter intelligence testing.  He thought he had come up with the idea himself, but there’s actually a long history there - voter “intelligence” testing  was used in the south the American south during the Jim Crow period to systematically prevent black people from voting – the various state governments just made sure that the questions were cultural-knowledge -type questions that white people would be far more likely to answer correctly.

I patiently explained that this was a compelling illustration of why voter intelligence testing is not a good idea - it gives the ruling party a lot of power to shape the test so as to selectively suppress certain votes.

He continued to insist that it was a good idea, until eventually, I became personally convinced that he was so stupid and ignorant that if a truly objective voter intelligence test was even possible, he would fail it.

I broke up with him a few days later, after a very long relationship.  That discussion was the final straw.

Two additional points:

Punching walls is not a healthy communication method.  You should really work on that, both for the sake of your hands (I can’t imagine that that kind of trauma is good for them, in the long term), and your future relationships.

Also – the head of state of Myanmar (Burma) is not a dictator; she (not he, btw) was elected, and enjoys wide popular support in the country, from what I understand.

Because not everyone is a vitriolic, child free individual like the majority of reddit. And a lot of us live in reality or are at the very least, aware of it.

Nah that is a *really* lazy strawman so let me explain how selfish and ignorant that assumption of what i said (because you clearly skimmed it once) is. 

First, this ""purchased this with money"" argument is scrapping the bottom of the barrel if I were to be that generous. *Yes* money can be used to buy goods and services but *like everything* there are rules associated with it and you can't do whatever the fuck you want just because you slapped 40 dollars on the table.

What about *other people who spent money on the game* who find that they *have fun* by winning and how at the end of the day **OVERWATCH IS A TEAM BASED GAME** so that being blatantly pointed out, suggests that to play you have an obligation to not treat it as a single player game *especially* when that is literally a reportable offense.

"ex9q1qb","&gt;But now that latino is in, theyre very happy simply calling themselves latino.

omg why can't US americans might there own fucking gringo business and leave the rest of the world alone. You guys are not ""woke"" you guys are just loud and ignorant. That sentence along is a dead giveaway that you don't know what you are taking about. Latino is only in IN the US **NOW** but Spanish artists have been pandering to Latin Americans since the 60s. **THE SIXTIES!** This is nothing new, this is nothing special, this is not about you, they are not trying to take advantage of any wave bc this is not about the US this is about Latin America, take your head out of your own ass for once only for once, they are not trying to enter the US market they are trying to enter the Latin American one.

&gt;For agessss spaniards found it insulting if they got called latinos. 

Lmao that's not the case at all, Latino was created by french people as a term to refer to anyone who spoke a Latin based language, it's literally a European term invented by Europeans to refer to other European countries (Spain, France, Italy, Romania, Portugal) these countries were literally the first latinos what you just said 

&gt;Making sure it was known they were European

Clearly shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Spaniards have all the right in the world to call themselves Latinos the term was invented FOR THEM. Now, what they CANNOT do is call themselves latinoamericans but I have never ever ever seem them do that, I bet my fucking ass that there weren't offended bc someone called them Latino they were insulted bc someone called them latinoamericanos and you can't tell the difference between the two terms, and I would also be offended if I were them, it's pretty insulting to put someone's country in a completely different continent, if you insinuated Venezuela was in Europe my Venezuelan as will also feel insulted it's rude as hell to put someone's country in the wrong continent it showcases that you think their country and feelings are completely irrelevant.

Latinoamerica was not called latinoamerica untill the French gave it that name in 1800s as a way of trying to justify their (failed) invasion of Mexico. Latin America is literally called that bc it's the land of the American continent that spoke Latin based languages at the time. It's a term the Europeans gave us bc the Europeans INVENTED it. It's THEIR term.

Now that definition of the term: Latino as someone who speaks a Latin based language is on the decline bc that definition would include half of Africa, Latin America, the French speaking part of Canada, Spain, Portugal, Romania, France and Italy and there is not much of a cultural connection between all of those parts of the world. But you can still see people from these European countries call themselves that, you would never see them calling themselves latinamericans bc they are not that but Latino? Yeah, you can see them do that, it's not their fault the US decided to short latinoamerican as Latino and created this whole confusion. The only moments I use Latino instead of Latinoamericano it's when you can clearly see from the context that I'm referring to the shorter version of Latinoamericano, precisely bc Latino and Latinoamericano are not the same thing.

I have never seen a European person call themselves latinoamerican or pretend to be one but I have seem them call themselves latino plenty of times, (specially French and Romanian people) they are not saying they are Latinoamericanos, they are just trying to tell you what type of language they speak. It's not their fault that you are illiterate.

"ew6g8bl","Wow. This person is spouting such ignorant bullshit. White people are the LEAST identitarian in the entire world. 15% of white americans identify with and care about their race. Every other group is above 50% with blacks being at nearly 80% for identifying with and caring about their race. Black americans are 3 times more likely to commit a hate crime and the largest race supremacist group in the US is a black supremacy group despite being a small fraction of the population. The fact that this scumbag goes on tv and says that ""white folk"" need to change and learn so that history doesn't repeat itself is absolutely disgusting.

These people are lying and spewing hate straight to our faces and hoping we don't know any better so they can get a political win and put their side in power. So sickening. They want us to confront a history we weren't even a part of and admit things we didn't even do or that weren't even done by our ancestors or country. 

I saw a huge thread on twitter of people calling out white people for going on mass shooting sprees and made a joke about king of the hill where bobby was disturbed that white people might be evil for what was done to the indians. All the far left people were cheering it on saying how evil whites are and were in their past. It's disturbing. Not only is it factually incorrect since blacks commit about 75% of mass shootings, but if you knew actual history you would know how stupid and ignorant that is. Whites weren't blindly hateful of the indians. They took whole tribes into their civilization and considered them part of the country. The first Indian war was considered a civil war, not a war against the indians. And it was started by the native americans who just started murdering people and burning down their houses. 

The english didn't even muster much of a defense, the indians just killed hundreds of innocent people and burned 1200 houses over a course of a year until they lost the war because they were so bloodthirsty they forgot they needed to keep growing food to support a war and they started starving to death so they surrendered. The settlers were mostly just trying to defend themselves and almost every movement of troops was mercilessly ambushed. The indians would cut people's heads off and put them on spikes. Most deaths on the indian side were from one battle where the english went to negotiate with a tribe that betrayed them and when the english leader stepped through the gate to negotiate he was shot dead, his officers were shot dead, and a battle ensued where the english were so fed up with all their shit they burned the city down and the indians had fortified it in such a way anticipating their ambush on the english that no one could really escape and women and children died in the fires for it. And yes, I said betrayed...because another little known fact is that the first war wasn't just whites against indians, multiple indian tribes sided with the english and fought alongside them as fellow countrymen.

You aren't making things better with this stupid hateful narrative against white people. It isn't accurate and it isn't fair. Most people on all ""sides"" and groups just want to keep their heads down and get along. Blacks people aren't evil, whites aren't evil, no race is.

Alright, so I'm 17m, I'm from sweden and me and my family live in Norway atm. But we always go back to sweden in the summer to meet up with friends and such. I always live at friends houses and they usually live at my father's sister's house. But this year his sister is having a baby and they cant stay there since there's already alot of other family staying there. So they got the idea to borrow a camping trailer. Although they borrowed it from one of my friends parents. The thing is that we have quite alot of money. We own 3 houses and 2 cars. So I just dont understand why they would have to borrow my friends camping trailer. The answer I got was that they'll save money by doing that instead of getting an hotel or air bnb. How fucking cheap is it allowed to be? I dont think it's ok for them to borrow my friends parents trailer without even asking me what I thought of it. I find it disrespectful and ignorant that they didn't ask me first. So when they told me I got really angry and tried to understand why they'd so that. But they didn't give a good answer so I started cussing and  I'm sleeping at a friends house tonight since I cant stand them for being so obnoxious. 
Now, they just called me and said they'll take away my monthly allowance for being such an ""bad kid"". AITA? Or was my reaction understandable and acceptable?.

"evsuu1o","I think the Bible is the story of creation and Christ as written by men. The morals and context of the time poison it.

The Bible is a set of stories handed down throughout time to describe the world as it is known, and establish the earliest law and morals. Many were imperfect, if not outright terrible. 

Others are the tenets of modern, secular, western morality.

When I read about slavery in the Bible, I also think of Paul calling government a part of God - my belief is that this was written to ensure he was not viewed as a threat to Rome as he traveled around the Aegean Sea. 

I was agnostic for a long time, but the words of Christ, which opposed human nature, brought me around. People talk about being forgiven, but teaching me to forgive others has literally saved my soul. 

Jesus was a liberal, but not a politico. He let Caesar have his own money, but He never told his apostles to push for Caesar to feed the poor. He was not a lobbyist.

Blindly reading the Bible is dangerous and ignorant. That being said, I believe the same of ignoring it. It is the oldest record of mankind, including government and morality, that we can possibly find.

Despite the terrible evils done in the name of religion, I don’t believe you or I would have ever seen this Earth if it had not been around to temper the worst instincts of humanity.

"evrkjg5","You are talking about different jobs then I am talking about. There is blue collar and white collar and whatever you are mentioning. You still refuse to actually listen and you more or less cherry pick the argument. I am anti-capitalist. I am not trying to argue for another reform of capitalism. I am a communist. But i am arguing the socialism aspect. 

You can ask a large amount of people if they should be paid more and use a scientific method of doing so to actually get an answer. Saying that i cant find someone who is being paid less then they should is clearly stupid because even you know that you can. 

A large amount of people want to raise the minimum wage that they have been working under for a long time and they know their labor is worth more. The longer you work at a job the more you realize what your labor is worth. So saying you can find someone else to do it for less may be true, but its a never ending system  of taking advantage of the worker, because the others are less experienced and educated. 

It has to be set by the government because they would drive down the wages as much as they can. No wonder why people outsource to impoverished countries because those people are less educated and experienced. 

If he said, “I need $75/hr to do this job” what would happen? Some jobs can be a negotiation of salary, but thats not all jobs. But we will have different definitions of jobs.

You dont understand so you are afraid to understand, and so you refuse to try. Its like calling Venezuela “socialist”. You are afraid to be wrong, so you do no research your own that might contest your opinion.

"evrdn9z","ALL insurance companies are for profit companies.  Their sole business model is to make money from everyone.  Insurance is pretty much a scam that prays on peace of mind.

&gt;I don't think Sharath owes me an apology for his grandfather's sexual violence. . . I never hoped for an acknowledgment statement from him. I worried that it would do more harm than good, by either maintaining the problematic hierarchical power structure or by creating a false sense of resolution. It is sad and ignorant that teachers were looking for him to say something which would make it safe for them to discuss things openly, or miraculously resolve the issue.

This is precisely the dynamic that is being created in Shambhala, where those that remain teaching, practicing, serving, paying, and attending retreats somehow think that the fact of acknowledgment from people in power is tantamount to *doing the work*. 

Karen Rain writes—again, switch out the names and you have Shambhala—about the subsequent internal work in her former community: 

&gt;The narrative around Pattabhi Jois's sexual violence has been controlled by the enablers, the people who profited by ignoring and denying his actions. Even now when teachers are talking about it more openly, the conversation has remained internal.

Not A SINGLE Shambhala event has occurred, to my knowledge, that centers the voice of a victim of its abuses. I would love to be corrected in this regard. It's shocking. I hope people who still feel like they need to remain involved can start to put out feelers to leave, because this rotten environment is in a state of collapse.

"etzgbvm","I think it should all be considered in the context. In general, killing the animal that has not done any harm to you would violate the NAP, although farming animals and slaughtering them for food is a bit of a grey area. And obviously, since animals cannot understand some of our laws, we should factor it in our behavior. For example, a stray dog trespassing on your property should not be shot, even after the ""Get off my lawn!"" warning, unless you have very good reasons to assume that your life is threatened. You also should not be able to fight a goose that snatched a burger out of your hands in order to get the burger back, since the goose's behavior, obviously, was not conscious.

""Aggression"" is a concept that implies the existence of intent. Someone taking your money without your consent, or punching you in the face without your consent, is employing aggression against you - because they do that consciously. But the animal that does some minor damage without being aware of it is not aggressive, it is just clumsy and ignorant. That animal does not violate the NAP, and hence you cannot kill it in self-defence.

To summarise, this is not a question that can be answered easily. I think it is a question outside of the political domain, and should be resolved based on the dominating animal rights culture in the society.",1563331411,"but the animal that does some minor damage without being aware of it is not aggressive, it is just clumsy and ignorant.","clumsy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"just clumsy and ignorant","clumsy",NA,"just",0

"etxo1tz","The first Woodstock was pretty cool from solely a musical perspective. Hendrix, CCR, and others are still bands I listen to today. But I have always hated the cultural aspect of Woodstock. Peace, love, overcoming patriarchy, drug abuse ... blah, blah, blah. That’s hippy bullshit, and I hate hippies. The only thing more useless than a hippy is someone so brain dead and ignorant that they try to replicate the hippy mindset and lifestyle today. 

Then there was the second Woodstock (1994). Musically, this second Woodstock was 100x better than the first. There were Jackyll and Collective Soul (both from the Atl area whom I heard play live before they were famous), Metallica, Primus, King’s X, etc ... Culturally, the MSM and the faggots who wanted to recreate hippy daze hated this concert because of all the rape and violence. Frankly, if you get a half million kids together with little or no supervision, feed them booze and drugs, and play loud music, then there is probably going to be a certain amount of raping and fighting going on. In fact, I suspect that there was some raping and fighting going on at the first Woodstock but Scorsese did not film any of it because he was too stoned and it did not jibe with the hippy theme. Either that or he cut up the film and kept those scenes for his personal jack-stash. 

Now there is this thing about having a 50th Anniversary Woodstock concert. Now, as anyone who knows me knows, I am all for making an honest buck. I personally wish I could frolic naked in an oily orgy of free market capitalism 24/7. My jizz is red, white, and blue, for fuck’s sake. But, and here is the problem (and it is a BIG problem): the musical acts selected for Woodstock 50 are absolutely horrible. There’s shit acts like Miley Cyrus, Beyoncé, and a bunch of rapper trash. In fact, there may not be more than a couple people in the entire announced lineup who can even play a musical instrument appearing onstage at this slime fest. The ONLY talented musician and songwriter on the lineup is John Fogarty, and he could drop dead at any moment. 

I am generally a happy man. Not too many things get me down. That’s because I don’t let many people get close to me. My family, that’s one thing and will always be top priority. But after them, I come first. This has resulted in my having a pretty carefree life. When my son goes to college I will begin my second single life. I am already scoping out assisted living homes where I can get it on with some of that geriatric free sex shit! 

But, there are some things that just irk the living shit out of me, such as rap and techno pop junk masquerading as music. I also hate pretentious people and pretentious zeitgeist (the term “zeitgeist” itself is idiotically pretentious). Those hippy fucks from the 1960s believed, apparently, that all they needed was to find and tap into a cosmic stream of positive energy and then they would be swept away to peace and harmony as they daydreamed why stoned. In reality, that false concept did not save them from the violent jungles of Vietnam. It also did not save them from growing up to be hypocritical fuck-ups. As Hunter Thompson said, there is nobody tending the light at the end of the tunnel. 

The hippy days were an existential falsity. That bugs me and creates a bias in my mind that causes me to look down on those people who bought into the fraud hook, line, and sinker. That is one issue. But attempting to reproduce what was already a failed and foolish attempt at something is even more asinine. But, I can accept this if only for the music. This is what allowed me to somewhat enjoy WS2. But even the music has died now. If not for MP3, CD, and yes, cassettes, I would only rarely be able to enjoy music today. Therefore, I have nothing but disdain for the attempt at staging this 50th anniversary concert. It does not need to occur. I can think of no good reason for it to occur. There is no possible way it can effect betterment on the human race. It is not even going to make any money, for fuck’s sake.",1563303553,"the only thing more useless than a hippy is someone so brain dead and ignorant that they try to replicate the hippy mindset and lifestyle today.","dead and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"dead and ignorant","dead",NA,NA,0

Both of my parents smoke. Around sort of 7 a day, give or take. My father is 56 and has diabetes, but regularly does exercise like chopping wood, walking, gardening etc. My mother does gardening 3 times a week but she is overweight and also diabetic. Both of them are not in great health, and they smoke, which really pisses me off. I understand that it's hard to stop smoking but I don't want to lose my parents in 5 years because they don't fucking take care of themselves. I am only 16 so I need them for a long time still and it would crush me if they got in any kind of medical trouble. We just arrived on holiday yesterday and lo and behold, they are still smoking like a pipe. We went out into the town and they had to sit down to drink tea and smoke a fag. Bear in mind, whenever we drive anywhere, we stop every hour or so for them to spend 15 minutes smoking. This happens everywhere, we waste so much time because they smoke.

I had a go at both of them because they have recently had grandkids from my siblings and the fact they continue to act like that is horrible. I called them both disgusting and ignorant that they willingly spend god knows how much each week on tobacco, and how they smoke so much. My mum, when she gets a lung infection or a cold always has it so so bad. Now, I love my parents dearly, and they are the most helpful and supportive people I think I'll ever meet, but this has really pushed me over the edge. I haven't spoken to them since that argument and I can tell they're pissed off at me. Reddit, AITA?

"eteuajs","&gt; Capitalism doesn't dictate things. Its not a dictator.

That's a bad faith attempt to invoke the negative feelings around the word ""dictator"" in a context (socialism/communism) where people are already sensitive to the concept, and it has _nothing_ to do with my point.

Capitalism _dictates_ that things have value beyond resale value because _that is what the system is_. It's a system that says, ""The price of a good is the cost of producing it plus profit for the owner of the business producing it."" It ""dictates"" this in the sense that mathematics ""dictates"" that the angles of a triangle sum to 180°.

&gt; That's the point of competition and auto-regulation. It incentivizes progress and trade.

I know. Other things also incentivise progress. Like curiosity, or the desire to grant a better life to others.

&gt; That's called life. In any system you need money or you die, because money is a place holder for needs like food and shelter, and you need food and shelter or you die. That's just the facts.

Ah, but placeholders matter. Money isn't value, it's a _proxy for_ value. It's a placeholder, like you say, that we use to easily quantify something that's often much more difficult. But it is not the same thing.

You know what happens when you optimise for a proxy instead of the actual underlying thing you want? Overfitting. A great example of this that's a bit more intuitive is body weight as a proxy for health. Lots of people treat weight (which is easy to quantify) as a proxy for how healthy you are (which is not): we call low-calorie foods like salad ""healthy"" when what we actually mean is ""unlikely to increase your body mass"", and vice versa. But you can be the perfect size and still be super ill. In fact, you can be the perfect size and be _less healthy_ than someone who is bigger. So optimising for body weight is actually _unlikely_ to also optimise for health. In the same way, money is used as a proxy for value, but we end up over-optimising for money, and value gets de-emphasised.

In any system, we need food and shelter or we die. But there are ways to ensure everyone gets these things without having to use money. A simple example: a law dictates everyone has a right to a bedroom of their own, sized 6 by 9 feet. Now you don't need to use money to determine who gets what; you can go directly to allocating the resource.

&gt; Joke? That's economics.

Do you not see the abject horror of this?!

&gt; Bands don't put food on the table

_That's my point._ People do it _despite it not bringing in any money_, refuting your point that people wouldn't ""participate"" in an economy just because there's no profit to be had.

&gt; and people don't just give away their food.

My mom has given away probably thousands of lemons from her lemon tree by now. She gives them to anyone who asks.

&gt; Its the reason why everyone is here. Not communism.

Kind of like how its the fat, dumb Americans that support trickle down economics when they're the ones that are being gouged and taken advantage by it.

You mean because of supply and demand. Capitalism doesn't dictate things. Its not a dictator. 

&gt; But I didn't say it wouldn't have value. I said there wouldn't be a profit margin

There is no economy where there wouldn't be a profit margin. People wouldn't sell platinum if there was and you wouldn't have access to platinum, or any other form of technological development if that was the case. That's the point of competition and auto-regulation. It incentivizes progress. 

&gt; Under capitalism, we need money or we die

That's called life. In any system you need money or you die, because money is a place holder for needs like food and shelter, and you need food and shelter or you die. That's just the facts. 

Name one system where this isn't true. Communism doesn't solve this. 

&gt; so naturally people are going to race to the bottom

No, markets find equilibrium.

&gt; It's like that joke where two guys are standing next to the road, one with a sign that says ""will work for food"", and the other with a sign that says ""will work for less food"".

"eteoxm0","There’s a lot wrong with this take, which is indicative of what’s wrong with a lot of takes I’ve seen about this story. Tom King never makes Wally out to be a “fucked up piece of shit”, we are the ones who think he’s a fucked up piece of shit (and by “we” I mean y’all). The book paints it all as a freak accident. Whenever any of us read about someone suffering from PTSD who has an episode and hurts people, we think they are “fucked up pieces of shit” and that’s the whole problem. They are people in pain and in need of care. Not derision or vilification. Wally is not treated as a villain in the context of the story. Does he get punished for what he did? Yes. Is he remorseful for what he did? Yeah. Will he stay in prison forever? Obviously not.   

Now, when I talk about people with PTSD or any other serious mental illness I’m not talking about all the mass shooters killing elementary school children, I’m talking about troops coming home from war and doing a murder suicide on a gun range (which is how Navy SEAL Chris Kyle was killed). PTSD is something we as a society don’t even know how to talk about, much less treat and the entire reaction from well meaning critics of this run show just how far we have to go. Again: the story, the writing, Tom King never made Wally into a “fucking piece of shit.” You said that, not King. And that reaction is indicative of the problem. 

Maybe super hero comics are the wrong place to have this discussion. Super hero stories are always painted in big, broad colors, both literally and figuratively. This is a very delicate subject, so maybe that’s why it doesn’t work. But I think it actually works quite well because death means nothing in super hero books. Well, it does mean *something*, just not the same as actual death as we know it on this side of the panels because there’s no permanence to it.  All of these characters will come back and the intriguing part  is seeing how they come back and what happens to all the other characters and the world at large in the interim (i.e. Death of Superman, Batman, Captain America, Bruce Banner, and so on).  And that’s not just me looking for a bright spot that wasn’t intended. Poison Ivy literally dies and comes back *within the run*, immediately blunting the impact. This in the text itself. I forget which character, but in one of the nine panel format therapy session moments one of the heroes is literally talking about this exact thing. About dying, coming back, then dying again, then coming right back and how he’ll probably die again. This run is playing on what death even means in super hero comics.

This is a hard subject to deal with outside of fantasy because in a more grounded story, when a character with PTSD snaps and kills people, no one comes back. People don’t get magically resurrected, so the initial “snap” as it were comes off as a monstrous act and stays that way. No redemption for the character with mental illness who just lost control. They did what they did and we, as the reader, write them off as the “bad guy.” And you’re right, that is a toxic standpoint that popular media is lousy with. But in this case, Wally West himself is a testament to the impermanence of death in super hero comics. That’s probably *why* he’s the character at the center of it. What you say as “heinous and terrible things” are blips on a radar in this universe. Again, Poison Ivy was literally standing right there at the end! None of these characters will stay dead and none of the characters that died are all that important in the grand scheme of things anyway.  (I’ll give you the whole “leaking therapy tapes to the word”, though. That’s pretty fucked up and the story does nothing with it.)

The metaphor of super heroes is that everything is bombastic and turned to eleven, so the stakes have to be life and death. If you did this *exact same story* but took out all the super hero nonsense–no time travel, no explosions, no *death*–you would have someone dealing with intense PTSD snapping, hurting (but not killing) a bunch of people, threatening to hurt themselves over the grief, and then at the last minute choosing to live with it and make amends instead, even though it is probably impossible to make amends for what they did. The end. That’s literally the story of Heroes In Crisis. And it’s a story I personally have seen *a lot* in my own life with people I’ve known. This is a subject matter that never really has a happy or clean ending. But you saying Wally was always a “fucked up piece of shit that did a lot of terrible and heinous things” is literally the whole reason these kind of stories need to be told. 

And I never got the impression that Sanctuary really *was* working for everyone else.  I mean... literally none of the heroes find any peace or healing through what Sanctuary was offering. I took it as an example of what happens when you have bad therapy, which is 100% a thing. Not all therapists or therapeutic approaches are good for you and sometimes you have to pack up and find someone else. I’ve seen that quite a lot and that ultimately seems like the take away for Batman in this; that Sanctuary needs improvement. I don’t know if that really commentary on therapy overall or if it’s a commentary on what we, as a society, try and do *instead* of real therapy. Like self-help gurus, religion, etc. 

Again, maybe super hero comics aren’t the best place to tell it, this certainly was a far from perfect run and that fumbled a lot of stuff. But the reactions I’ve seen from this book come of as so much more toxic and ignorant that the book itself. Like, every horror movie about a crazy person who’s the real killer is so much worse than what this book even fails to do. I really don’t understand the vitriol.",1562740482,"but the reactions i’ve seen from this book come of as so much more toxic and ignorant that the book itself.","toxic and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"more toxic and ignorant","toxic",NA,"more",0
"etekhzb","First of all, insulting my supposed ""bad grammar"" is just a cheap ""Ad Hoc"" tactic, and is yet again another logically-dishonest tactic of debate, thus I won't point out your own horrendous grammar. Furthermore, you're attempts to ""rile me up"" as the colloquialism goes is another intellectually-dishonest tactic referred to as an ""Incitement to Anger"" which basically means, since you need a thesis so clearly stated in order for you to grasp it, that you don't have a defense and hope to anger or upset me so that I'll slip up and commit one of the same logically-dishonest blunders that you have committed.

Furthermore, is *hardly* call this a debate seeing as you've yet to counter a single one of my points or statements with any sort of opinion of your own other than attempting to insult me which means you assume I care about how you feel about me. Now, one would claim this is because you are ""projecting"" your own emotions upon me, and while I'm not one for speculation I'd instead posit that you simply see yourself as a figure of higher standards in this ""debate"" that I'm attempting to engage in. 

If you'd like me to dumb down that last bit for you, I'm saying you're temperamental and probably arrogant too if I had to guess. As much as I'd *love* to figure out why exactly that is, I'd much prefer not detract from this seemingly one-sided discussion. 

Might I also question your own ability to actually form an opinion on the matter? Being under the influence seems to already call into question your reasoning skills and would impair your rationality, wouldn't want to ""kick you while you're down"", just not gentleman like.

The Latin terms aren't there to impress you, that implies I seek your admiration which yet *again* alludes back to an arrogant predisposition, but they're being used to inform you that you're so called ""tactics"" aren't smart, clever, nor logically valid. I also hoped that by giving you the actual names you'd be able to google it more easily, but perhaps even that proves a challenge.

Not to mention this boyfriend thing, it truly just seems like a sad attempt to execute a simply titled ""Distraction"" tactic, and points at that perhaps the problem lies with your own temperamental self? Furthermore, I'll put this bluntly- I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. Not so I care about your opinion. So please, don't detract from this debate with some meddlesome details of your *""oh so tragic""* past. Debate is a sport, and your personal affections are the equivalent of a cheap advertisement to me, so I simply don't care for it.

Finally, no, depression and anxiety aren't the same thing, nor are they coeval (which, yes, I know what that word means, I'm not ignorant to its origin either). Depression and anxiety are actually completely separate issues, both psychologically and neurologically (which, for your own sake, are also not the same thing). You also either used coeval incorrectly or simply don't know what you're talking about (either one or both might be true). For your reference, coeval means that two things are of the same age, duration, or antiquity. Depression and anxiety are not always empirically the same duration, as I said earlier they are completely different things and if you believe that they are then you truly, truly are so misguided and ignorant that you shouldn't be formulating an opinion on something you simply don't understand.

Oh, and it's not ""beating people up on Reddit"" when you're simply having a debate with them- if you can't even take criticism or the experience of being disagreed with then maybe it's you who had the problem which needed sorting out with your ""schizo ex"" (I'm not even going to address how rude and offensive that slur is).

"esfze3x","I'll answer your first point first. Say you're playing against AQ, and you kill all the drones that either Consumygal and Swarmygal spawn from AQs passive. By now you have 3 charges on AQ and you use them then drop your Glustyworp. Tadaaaa, you are now the proud owner of a 9 point Glusty, which is definitely not what you want, but has been known to happen, unfortunately for me. I simply mentioned a 9 power Glustyworp but it could easily be a 9 power Brewess after devouring a Harpy Egg or a Foglet. The point wasn't about the cards, it was about the power level of the cards. To swoop in and potentially steal a 9 point power card from your opponent is huge, as after beta cards are regularly held at around 3-4 power.  As i mentioned before, Tall removal simply takes a tall unit out of the game and into the graveyard, while Seize actually TAKES that big unit and gives it to you. How is that not a massive swing?

Not to mention the horrible places many black folk are stuck in because of America's past segregation of them live in that have lead poisoning and unlivable conditions. That they can't leave mind you. Because half their money is often spent into keeping what horrible house they live in so they wouldn't be homeless.

I agree. Just because people agree with me doesn't make me correct. What makes me correct is refusing to believe that human right violations are a fucking valid opinion. You don't gotta agree with me. No one fucking does. But if I see a violation on people of color caused by right wingers creating horrible laws specifically to oppress black folk like creating a law on weed that white people funnily enough aren't imprisoned for. That's when I don't care what anyone says. That is a human right violation and clear racism that is still vehamntly applied by the right.

Shoe doesn’t hate feminism as a whole, just the third wave retarded feminism that is against “manspreading”, “mansplaining”, and all that other bullshit that exists just to put down men for just having a penis. The “wage gap” does not exist and can be debunked by anyone that knows the basics of economics. The same applies to the “pink tax”.

He mostly entertains and debunks conspiracy theories now but back when he delved into the left-wing subjects he applied skepticism to their ideological beliefs such as “only men can be sexist”, “only white people can be racist” , and shit like that. He is still left leaning, just look at his video about the Alabama abortion bill, that criticizes people on the left because he belongs to that side and hates seeing it act so stupid.

Your MIL is a very dangerous and stupid woman.

"ereddiv","&gt; tons of people are, its the focus of the debate in several countries, including sweden. no one says ""2%"" of course because then people could see how fucking dumb it is to care so much about so little when theres far greater concerns, but peoples flying habits have become a central part of the debate.

So what? Deal with the problem and move on to the next. The real problem is people like you who are just arguing against doing something without alternative. Instead of attacking people who area actually doing something, promote your alternative. For example, I will support a general carbon tax. 

But even then still, if a carbon tax is applied, then people who *already changed* their lifestyle will not be discomforted, and people who didn't, will go to them for examples how to live their lives with less carbon. So you're basically shitting on people for taking the left turn while you want to take the right turn, knowing that both roads lead to the same place.

&gt;Ah, yes. Lets start dealing with the irrelevant things so when the world comes crashing down at least we can say we made people fly less. That makes so much sense! When things are going to shit, lets make a list of what is the biggest cause of concern and when we have finished that list we start from the bottom, leaving the real issues to last.
Great idea mr redditor! Genius move! Totally not doing the bidding of big corporations here by being distracted by pointless issues and leaving the real issues (them) to the very end.

Airlines are giant corporations too. You act like you're a demotivation troll paid by them to discourage anything that threatens their business model.

Again, promote your superior alternative, instead of demotivating other people. They're the first ones that will support your good idea, because they will feel empowered by having cut airlines from their lives.

&gt;Its not 2% passenger transport emissions, the entire global aviation industry is 2% of the emissions, if you just look on passenger transport emissions its far less.

Are you going to exempt anything smaller than 2%? 2% is huge. 2% is a cut that we don't need to make in something important. 24 more cuts like that and we have halved our emissions.

&gt;That feel when you're so ignorant about the state of the world that it starts to sound racist. No, aviation is not restricted to the rich countries in the world, holy shit dude. The largest airport in Ethiopia for example serves 1.6 million passengers per year.

"ep4c5ma","I certainly didn't mean to imply that I look down on rural areas. I can completely understand why people would rather live in rural areas than urban ones, and where you live is an individual preference. There's no right or wrong answer.

And as someone who lives in a big city, I definitely see a bias assuming that people in rural areas are somehow less educated, which I agree with you is wrong and ignorant.

That said, I think there is legitimate frustration that our political system is not adapting to the demographic changes in our country, and that is disproportionately giving rural citizens more of a vote than urban ones.

The Senate portion of this is debatable. The Senate was specifically designed to give voters in less-populated states equal representation, although some of this actually isn't completely historically accurate, but that's a whole separate dorky rant!

So I'm alright with the Senate remaining as is since it was meant as a check on the power of the majority, but I do think the House should double in size because, well, the population is not quite the same as it was 200 years ago.

But most importantly the electoral college has to go. It's an arcane concept that wasn't built into the constitution and was intended to subvert the will of people in case they voted ""wrongly"" so smarter people could override their votes. We can't keep going on having presidents win the White House via the electoral college while losing the popular vote. It's just not remotely democratic. One vote, one person -- or else we're going to go down a serious rabbit hole if millions more Americans voted for one person, but their opponent wound up in the Oval Office. This will eventually begin to tear the fabric of our country apart.

THAT'S where I think a lot of the urban resentment stems from, because obviously the electoral college benefits less-populated swing states and has deprived other voters of their voice. We literally put Iowa up -- a state with 3 million people -- as some kind of hallowed barometer of the national mood just because the first primaries happen to take place there. Candidates also spend an inordinate amount of time campaigning and catering to voters in swing states, specifically because they know their votes count more than votes in larger states that already lean heavily right or left. This reinforces the nation's political divide. If politicians were forced to campaign more evenly across the country because every vote carried the same weight, it would force them to moderate their views and relearn the art of compromise. It would also dilute the power of extremists on both sides of the political aisle.

While the Constitution was set up to protect the minority, we're veering toward a tyranny of the minority imo. Basically, our politics does not reflect the huge demographic changes taking place, and this IS shortchanging urban voters.

So yes I feel those political frustrations are legitimate. But otherwise, I think our rural areas are cool, unique places and I certainly don't think they deserve the hate or stereotypes they sometimes get.",1559037416,"and as someone who lives in a big city, i definitely see a bias assuming that people in rural areas are somehow less educated, which i agree with you is wrong and ignorant.","wrong and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"wrong and ignorant","wrong",NA,NA,0

&gt;Except the Right is super angry and violent. They've committed multiple terrorist attacks

Let's talk facts instead of meaningless platitudes and empty claims. 46% of the voting public voted for Donald Trump. 43% (myself certainly not included) currently ""approve of the job Trump is doing in the White House."" Are you so blindly partisan and ignorant that you'd take far right-terrorist attacks and conclude that the entire right is super angry and violent? According to RAND and the UMD Global Terrorism Database, since 1992 out of those murdered in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, 92% were murdered in Islamist terror attacks. I know for a fact you're not going to say muslims are super angry and violent. Does 9/11 skew that data? Yes and no. I'd argue the more ambitious and deadly an attack is meant to be, the more serious the threat of similar attacks, especially when post 9/11 there are plenty of cases of thwarted bomb plots on airplanes and botched car based attacks that in similar circumstances have killed 80+ people. When an Islamist terrorist killed 50 people in a nightclub, did you stand up and say that muslims are all homophobic?  I bet not.

Now we look at right-wing terrorist attacks, accounting for 6.6% of terrorism deaths over the same time frame. The OKC bombing, second only to 9/11 in death toll, accounts for 77% of of that 6.6%. That said, the OKC bombers were part of a ""right-wing"" group that is even further to the right than the alt-right. They reject the legitimacy of law enforcement and the federal government, and the bomber was furious after the FBI Waco siege, the results of which were his motive in carrying out the bombing on the Alfred Murray Federal building. How many republicans do you know that would choose as a target a federal building that housed the Veteran Affairs rehab center, DEA, secret service, and Military recruitment offices? Probably not a fair categorization, but you get the point.

If you really want to blame the right for Dylan Roof shooting up a church, should the right say the left is violent and angry they lost the election, so angry that they are to blame for the attempted mass shooting at a congressional charity baseball game that left several republican congressman shot? Dylan Roof was a racist, and you could argue that Trump emboldened him, but he didn't know or care if those people were right or left, just that they were black. This guy attempted to assassinate sitting members of congress because they were republican. Days ago an armed women tried to ram through the white house fence, and this wasn't even her first attempt. Is the left out to kill right wing politicians? 

Back to terrorist deaths, in the same large period left-wing terrorism accounted for just 23 deaths. However of that 23, 13 occured in the two years following Trump's election. In those first two years, right-wing terrorist attacks killed just 5. So why then do we hear so much about the upswing of right wing terror on the right? Well, just about every single one of those channels is citing a study that is questionable at best. The study claims, ""Last year[2017], 20 of the 34 terrorist murders in the United States were connected to right-wing extremism."" But the study includes murders like this one:

&gt;Kelly Raisley, believed to be a member or associate of the 211 Crew white supremacist gang, was arrested on first-degree murder charges for the murder of his uncle, Randy Gene Baker. Baker’s wife and sister were similarly arrested. The motive was apparently personal.

That sound like a right-wing terror attack?

&gt;White supremacist Devon Arthurs allegedly shot to death two of his roommates for making fun of his recent conversion to Islam. All three, and a fourth roommate, were members of Atomwaffen, a neo-Nazi group.

Really?

&gt;Wesley Andrew Hampton, a self-declared white supremacist, and another defendant allegedly robbed and murdered a man in a home invasion.

?

None of those are terror attacks, and frankly none of them appear motivated by rightward leanings. Another study oft quoted included the case of a man who dropped out of school after being harassed for being a republican. He then took a machete to a coffeeshop and blathered on about being persecuted.

Just because you and most other women love to play the victim, it does not mean that I like to play it as well. I was merely correcting you because you made a false statement.

&gt;It absolutely has to do with privilege, and the actual fact that you use patriarchy in quotations as a way to delegitimize its existence shows that you are the one who is out of touch and completely delusional. But I can see that just by seeing what you've said in these few paragraphs and skimming through some of your comment history.

Likewise. You have clearly been brainwashed by the retarded feminists. But keep on whining and using the patriarchy as an excuse for your failures. I'm sure that it will help. 

&gt;I don't even know where to begin in regards to your statements about women's expectations of men in the dating world. You're just stating opinions or maybe personal experiences. Your own self-consciousness about your role in the dating world is pathetic and deeply distorting your view of women. It's not 1950 anymore. Women aren't complaining about men who don't make the first move or men who make less than then. If you think all women want to have sex like they do in porn then you definitely haven't had a real interaction with one in a long time.

No, you are simply just ignorant about what is happening in the dating market. And if you look at what women want in a man, and the type of sex that they say they like, then it's pretty much the same kind of sex that people see in porn. Women want a well-endowed guy who can last for ages. Go to women's subreddits and forums and see what they write about men and sex. Their criticism related to sex is always about the guy's size and stamina. Check them out and you will see that I am right.

&gt;You have this negative idea of feminism and believe that they hate men, when in fact they probably just hate YOU because you're self-centered, confused, and have absolutely no idea what is going on with the fight for women equality. Arguing with you is pointless, and you will never grow as a human being if you continue to hold on to these disgusting views. Try reading a history book. I would suggest ""Caliban and the Witch,"" by Silvia Federichi. Now, she's a feminist and a marxist, so that might turn you off, but read the book and you will learn so much about the struggles of women. Maybe it'll even give you an easier time in the dating world.

Now you are just projecting. You are very confused, stupid, hypocritical and ignorant. You are the one who has no clue about what feminism actually is. You are so stupid and ignorant that you actually think that feminism is about gender equality.

Solaria then attempts to get volunteers to become warriors to aid in the fight against the monsters though the villagers quickly decline for selfish and lazy reasons. After all, why should the mewmans fight when their queen can simply use magic instead? The answer may surprise you...

Just as Solaria is about to depart (with a baby Eclipsa with her. Oh!! So Cute! How Adorable) Mina then tells her how inspiring and powerful of a queen she is. This leads to the Monster Carver to convince Mina to join her and become Mewni's greatest warrior. It's difficult to admit but this makes Mina (somewhat) sympathetic to understand. Because to begin with, it showed that Mina was simply a peasant who was just trying to survive as the war between the monsters and mewmans raged on. Then she met a powerful Queen who saw potential in her and simply asked that Mina swears her loyalty. That very same devotion and belief in her queen is what allowed Mina to survive and live as long as she did given how she was the last of the Solarian Warriors (that is until now).

Probably for once in her very difficult life, Mina was seen as someone worthy and was told that she can be as powerful as the queen she admires. Mina is then awaken from her memories as the crow from the rooster is heard and then declares that she shall finally bring justice for Mewni just as Solaria once did long ago...

Back in the Monster Temple,  it has just been revealed that Moon has betrayed Star and Eclipsa. Moon believes that Eclipsa is not fit to be queen while admitting that she blames Eclipsa for taking her away from her family and so orchestrated with Mina Loveberry and the Magic High Commission to remove Eclipsa. Star becomes enraged and begins to fight Moon for igniting a revolution against her very own daughter. Star had worked so hard to justify the decision she made to allow Eclipsa to be queen and believed that her mother was finally supporting only to discover it was all a lie.

Moon then tries explain that Mina was already beginning to try to dethrone Eclipsa and simply stopped her from going too far by having Mina under her command instead. Moon then tells Eclipsa that she has the choice between surrendering the crown to her and to have the family leave Mewni forever or she shall unleashed the Solarian warriors onto the Monster Temple. Eclipsa begrudgingly agrees to her terms and so the magic wand is returned to Moon once more.

[Meanwhile the MHC are watching this all unfold and are celebrating the surrendering of Eclipsa with a pizza party.

This may have just become the most ironic title given in the series history. And that's saying something. As Rhombulus and Omnitraxus Prime are shown happy to soon return to the glory days, Hekapoo is less then convince that everything is fine. She's still worried about Mina and so bails on the party to go somewhere else. Though now, there can be no doubt just how selfish and ignorant that the MHC truly are. If anyone deserves to be evil, then it's them.]

Just before Mina arrives, Moon attempts to reassure Star that exiling Eclipsa from Mewni is what's best to end the conflict but Star no longer trusts her mother anymore. Mina is pleased that Eclipsa has surrendered though still wishes to kill her and her monster love. Though Moon tries to persuade Mina that it isn't necessary, she realizes too late that Mina seeks more than just death for Eclipsa and Globgor. Mina wishes to fulfill her vow to Queen Solaria to destroy all the monsters once and for all. Moon then reveals that she was the one who created the Solarian Warriors and so casts a spell to undo the magic.

...But it does not succeed.

Mina explains that the warriors have pledged their loyalty to Queen Solaria and so Moon's magic has no effect despite being the creator. Betrayed, the group attempts to flee until the warriors block their escape. Mina then has her army arrests all the monsters and monster supporters to be executed. It all seems hopeless as Mina begins to attack them with her Solarian sword until...

Just before Mina arrives, Moon attempts to reassure Star that exiling Eclipsa from Mewni is what's best to end the conflict but Star no longer trusts her mother anymore. Mina is pleased that Eclipsa has surrendered though still wishes to kill her and her monster love. Though Moon tries to persuade Mina that it isn't necessary, she realizes too late that Mina seeks more than just death for Eclipsa and Globgor. Mina wishes to fulfill her vow to Queen Solaria to destroy all the monsters once and for all. Moon then reveals that she was the one who created the Solarian Warriors and so casts a spell to undo the magic.

...But it does not succeed.

Mina explains that the warriors have pledged their loyalty to Queen Solaria and so Moon's magic has no effect despite being the creator. Betrayed, the group attempts to flee until the warriors block their escape. Mina then has her army arrests all the monsters and monster supporters to be executed.

* The Origin of Mina Loveberry

The story opens up interestingly on the past of Mewni and the life of Mina Loveberry before becoming the (insane) warrior she is today. Mina is seen as a struggling rag peddler when suddenly a monster comes to attack her village! Mina and her village are then saved by none other than Queen Solaria ""The Monster Carver"" who claims the land for the mewmans even though the village was actually built on the monster's own nest. Solaria then attempts to get volunteers to become warriors to aid in the fight against the monsters though the villagers quickly decline for selfish and lazy reasons. After all, why should the mewmans fight when their queen can simply use magic instead? The answer may surprise you...

Just as Solaria is about to depart (with a baby Eclipsa with her. Oh!! So Cute! How Adorable) Mina then tells her how inspiring and powerful of a queen she is. This leads to the Monster Carver to convince Mina to join her and become Mewni's greatest warrior. It's difficult to admit but this makes Mina (somewhat) sympathetic to understand. Because to begin with, it showed that Mina was simply a peasant who was just trying to survive as the war between the monsters and mewmans raged on. Then she met a powerful Queen who saw potential in her and simply asked that Mina swears her loyalty. That very same devotion and belief in her queen is what allowed Mina to survive and live as long as she did given how she was the last of the Solarian Warriors (that is until now). 

Probably for once in her very difficult life, Mina was seen as someone worthy and was told that she can be as powerful as the queen she admires. Mina is then awaken from her memories as the crow from the rooster is heard and then declares that she shall finally bring justice for Mewni just as Solaria once did long ago...

* Moon the Traitor

It has just been revealed that Moon has betrayed Star and Eclipsa. Moon believes that Eclipsa is not fit to be queen while admitting that she blames Eclipsa for taking her away from her family and so orchestrated with Mina Loveberry and the Magic High Commission to remove Eclipsa. Star becomes enraged and begins to fight Moon for igniting  a revolution against her very own daughter. Star had worked so hard to justify the decision she made to allow Eclipsa to be queen and believed that her mother was finally supporting only to discover it was all a lie. 

Moon then tries explain that Mina was already beginning to try to dethrone Eclipsa and simply stopped her from going too far by having Mina under her command instead. Moon then tells Eclipsa that she has the choice between surrendering the crown to her and to have the family leave Mewni forever or she shall unleashed the Solarian warriors onto the Monster Temple. Eclipsa begrudgingly agrees to her terms and so the magic wand is returned to Moon once more.

\[*Meanwhile the MHC are watching this all unfold and are celebrating the surrendering of Eclipsa with a* ***pizza party.*** 

*This may have just become the most ironic title given in the series history. And that's saying something. As Rhombulus and Omnitraxus Prime are shown happy to soon return to the glory days, Hekapoo is less then convince that everything is fine.

You learn it from your parents an other people close to you. And people tend to want to speak their native toung if they can. That's not ""improper"", it's just how they speak. 

The problem with your question is that you clearly make the age old mistake to assume that any non-standard way of speaking is just being lazy, or people are corrupting the language, are just doing it wrong because they didn't pay attention in school etc. The reason that's wrong is because that's just not how that works. It's not the case that there is a correct standard language, and any other speech is just an incorrect version of that. Different versions of the language are called dialects, and they're just as much of a language with it's own vocabulary, grammar etc as the standard language. They're just not the dialect you learn in school.

You probably wouldn't ask why scottish people are so lazy and ignorant that they choose to speak poorly. If it's different enough and people aren't aware of any socio-linguistic context, it's easy enough for most people to accept that ""dialects"" are a thing that exists and there's nothing wrong with that.

The Marine Corps would never, and has never, authorized or granted the use of the SS bolts for designating *any* role in the Corps. They have also never and would not designate any other Nazi-associated iconography for such a purpose.

We know that the Marine Corps did not give these people authorization to use the SS bolts. They did that *on their own*.

Now, you can argue that maybe they didn't know what it meant. But then you'd have to be able to show that *all* of these people were unaware of the association the symbol carried with the Nazi Schutzstaffel.

In order to make that argument, you'd have to assert and demonstrate that Marines are *breathtakingly* stupid, and so ignorant at all levels of rank that no one noticed or said anything about these flags or symbols.

No amount of apologia for the use of these symbols changes that. These people are *Nazi sympathizers*.

"emfndtx","In your first comment, you claimed you went into the movie with no expectations. I didn't address this because I didn't think it would be useful, but now I feel that I must. A lot of the things you bring up in this second comment are expectations. You expected Luke to act a certain way. You expected the First Order to be perfectly functional and logical and without weakness. And you expected similar things out of Snoke. You expected Rey to not have any proficiency with her force abilities.

And I'm not saying I went into the movie without expectations either. My point is that we all go into these movies with expectations, and this movie meant to address the very concept of expectations. Literally everyone's plans for this movie failed. Snoke's plan to defeat the Resistance and gain another powerful Force user? Failed. Luke's plan to stay out of the fighting and stay forever on that island? Failed. Rey's plan to get Luke to become the warrior she expected? Failed. Poe's plan? Failed. Holdo's plan? Failed. Phasma's plan? Failed. Finn's plan to escape and see Rey? Failed. Rose's plan? Actually partially succeeded because she did get to destroy parts of Canto Bight. But mostly they failed too. 

This movie was one of the most anticipated movies in one of the most aggressive and toxic fanbases (Kylo is literally a toxic cosplayer. He doesn't need the mask. He dresses up because he wants to appear like a Sith Lord). They were addressing how different people deal with failure. With their plans for how things should go, going wrong. I saw all the fan theory posts. People wanted certain things out of this kind of a movie, and when we were *all* surprised and *all* told ""This is not going to go the way you think"", some people reacted more like Kylo, and some reacted more like Rey. 

This movie was about how to deal with failure and disappointment. And no, that's not me saying ""they made a bad movie so we can all learn a lesson"". I think my positions on the movie have been made pretty clear. 

&gt;He ignited his lightsaber. Anyone who points an active weapon at anyone (including Police) is doing so with an intent to kill. 

True, but also not what I compared it to. I didn't say ""aimed a gun"", I said ""drew their gun"". Pulling out a weapon is not an intend to kill. Otherwise you'd have intent to kill every time you cleaned your gun. Or moved it. Or just wanted to go to the shooting range and take some practice shots.

Luke touched darkness, reacted, then hated himself for the reaction. I don't understand what's so impossible about that. It's exactly the same Luke we saw in Empire Strikes Back. He had that dream where he killed Darth Vader in the cave on Dagobah. He literally reacted to the darkness in front of him, and then realized he'd only hurt himself by striking with fear in his heart.

And then, years later, his fear of the dark side almost pushes him to make the same mistake again. Reactive fear. And he's sickened by himself. The dark side was a huge trigger for Luke (remember how he reacted with anger in Return of the Jedi?). 

&gt; He hated dark side only upto second movie. He sensed good in Vader and turned him around. Had he been extremely averse to dark side, he would have tried to kill Vader. 

Right, he sensed *good* in Vader, which is why he gave him a chance. He didn't suddenly become ok with the Dark Side. He literally saved his father *from* the Dark Side. And do you not remember the Dagobah hallucination? How did he react to seeing Vader then? 

&gt;Are they so arrogant and ignorant that they:  
&gt;  
&gt;Will not shoot a known resistance fighter, is he came right in front of them and told a Yo Mama joke.  
&gt;  
&gt;Will only shoot resistance ships once (in the beginning they do send out fighters, and Leia floats back to the ship). They could easily do it again.  
&gt;  
&gt;They would make no effort to trap the fleeing enemy.

Yes.

And this is one of the things I was talking about earlier. Why are you upset by these events? We don't seem to disagree about what the First Order did. But you seem to be in denial about what these events say about the Firsts Order. It says ""they're over-confident"", and you're unhappy with this. Why?

Is it possible you expected them to be brutally competent? They're obviously still dangerous, but did you expect them to function properly and always been logical? That's just not the villain these films are constructing. The First Order is brittle. That's the point. 

&gt; It's staring right in the face of audience. 

and

&gt; The movie didn't focus on first order's hubris

These contradict each other. You can't have it both ways. So which is it? Was this an obvious flaw in the First Order's actions? So obvious that the audience could easily go ""they should just send some ships ahead"", or whatever. Or was it not present in the movie? 

I think you've done the easy part already. You've recognized a flaw in the plans of a character/organization\*. But you didn't connect why the filmmakers put it there. To give us a specific reason why the bad side fails. They're overconfident. They literally wait for their supreme leader's ship to show up just to watch the final fight. There was no reason for Snoke's ship to be there, and the logical thing is to have Snoke nowhere near the danger. But they're all overconfident, and that is why they fail. 

\*Really, it's both because the hubris is more rooted in Hux himself, since he's commanding things. But the flaw is in the hierarchy of the First Order, which has given a fool like Hux power that he doesn't deserve

&gt;but presented it as *smart tactics and thinking of* the resistance.

Smart and desperate. It wasn't some massive plan that would undo all of Snoke's power. It was a clever plan to get out of dodge (while still taking on massive losses). And it would have worked had Poe not accidentally told the plan to someone that was willing to sell them out (DJ). Actually, this is also on Finn's shoulder's as well. He let DJ listen. It's both of their faults.

&gt; But what did he learn by killing him?  

*We* learned that Snoke was really just an overconfident fool that could be easily tricked despite all his power. Again, this plays into their whole hubris thing. But I don't expect Kylo to have demonstrated he learned this in the two hours after it happened (that's all the time we had left in the movie, give or take. In-movie time, not movie run time btw. I'm estimating how long that last fight took). 

Also, I imagine this might all go to Kylo's head. He might become overconfident as well, even though he didn't defeat Snoke in a fair fight. He might buy into his own false legend and start thinking he's way tougher than he really is.

&gt; Gain power? 

He's now in charge of the First Order? Political power, not Force powers. There's more than one type of power.

"eme09q3","&gt; First off, Luke didn't actually attempt to kill Kylo. 

He ignited his lightsaber. Anyone who points an active weapon at anyone (including Police) is doing so with an intent to kill.

&gt;  Kylo, a passionate angry young man, kills a bunch of people and goes dark side, mostly out of spite. 

Out of spite he killed Jedi students and went to the dark side. I think that is a very flimsy reason to join the Dark side. Maybe he didn't agree with Jedi teachings at all, had heated discussion with Luke and then left to seek out what he agreed with. But that's not what happened.

Luke is also optimistic. He almost turned to the dark side but he pulled himself out by the sheer force of will. He hated dark side only upto second movie. He sensed good in Vader and turned him around. Had he been extremely averse to dark side, he would have tried to kill Vader.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; This is not a plot hole. 

Ok, let's say it is not. Even though it would have been THE MOST logical thing to do. It's staring right in the face of audience. I know first order is a reflection of neo-Nazi (Not Nazi). Are they so arrogant and ignorant that they:

* Will not shoot a known resistance fighter, is he came right in front of them and told a Yo Mama joke.
* Will only shoot resistance ships once (in the beginning they do send out fighters, and Leia floats back to the ship). They could easily do it again.
* They would make no effort to trap the fleeing enemy.

Perhaps they are full of hubris, but that's very subjective. The movie didn't focus on first order's hubris, but presented it as *smart tactics and thinking of* the resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; how did Kylo's character progress by killing him? 

I didn't mean it as in he didn't switch sides. But what did he learn by killing him? His designation changed from apprentice to supreme leader. It appears he probably killed him to:

* Gain power?
* Didn't like the way Snoke boasted about controlling his every action and thought?
* Disagreed with his ideology? We know he is not a sith, perhaps his ideology is different from the Sith. Perhaps not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It's exciting to watch and I'm glad someone is finally making the fascist stand-ins finally acting like actual fascists, through and through. 

That's literally what sith do and it is told about in every trilogy. In return of the Jedi, Vader wanted to kill Sidious. and Sidious wanted Luke to kill Vader. 

In revenge of the sith, Anakin tried to kill Obi-Wan, his master. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Rey grew up on Jakku and had to learn to fight from a young age. 

Self-defence, not fighting. As I said, it is different to knock out a few untrained thugs and completely different to kill praetorian guards.

By what metric am I judging their skill?

In novelization Kylo himself said that they were more powerful than him. In Comics we see how they were trained and selected. They are more than capable of holding down a horde of stromtroopers.

Rian based them on ceremonial guards of Samurai, not the fascist regime.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; She used a staff, which is fairly similar to a lightsaber 

Lightsaber is not similar to staff. Darth maul had a staff, you can look how his fighting style is different when he holds light saber.

Swinging lightsaber isn't going to train anyone and if I am not wrong, Rey learned that she was force sensitive in TFA. So I don't think she had a whole lifetime of experimenting with powers.

She was basically a Jedi nerd which enabled her to:

1. Defeat Kylo (when he was wounded, yes. But Kylo at that point was trained for atleast a few years.
2. Take a light saber away from Kylo, which is, being stronger with the force than him, inherently.
3. Kills 3 praetorian guards.
4. Breaks a lightsaber.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But The Last Jedi actually explains this in the background. It's subtle. 

Once again, she discovered she could use the force too in TFA. Fantasizing about doing something and then actually doing that are different. A good movie should show the struggle the main protagonist goes through, and it should be more than a minute.

We can see how other movies implemented it:

* Luke thought he was strong enough to defeat Vader. But lost his hand instead.
* Anakin couldn't defeat Obi-Wan when he thought he was more powerful than before.

Just because Rey knew Jedi mind trick exists, she shouldn't be able to use it immediately. And that's my take on this.

These movies were visually impressive and had good battle sequence. But everything else was..not good. They could have made it better, but they couldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; She's made incredible leaps that seemed unlikely, but not impossible. Just like Luke did in A new Hope.

"eleui8e","&gt;primary school biology

Intersex exists - it's not just Male or Female.

Your primary school biology probably didn't tell you that, though, did they?

There is SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), to help people match to their true gender.

I am a trans woman, and I want SRS someday. My gender is female, and my sex will reflect that in the future.

&gt;Gender is irrelevant

Tell that to gender experts, and you will find that you are wrong.

&gt;Why do you think it is intellectually competent to throw basic and constant fact into question?

If your ""basic and constant fact"" is false, then yes, I will throw it into question.

Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and people like them, are not gender experts. They are assholes who have an education, but they don't (and haven't) attempted to learn or understand what it means to be transgender.

&gt;But it's clear that neither of us will get anywhere.

Agreed. I think you would rather listen to hate than to read up on this.

I know it might seem hard to try and learn, and because of how it is hardly taught in ""primary school biology"" (have you got past that point yet?), it doesn't make sense to you.

Just read up. Being ignorant helps no-one.

&gt;armed with basic fact and reason

...

Your understanding of the transgender community is what I'd call basic, so I will agree with that.

&gt;you continue your agenda based pseudoscience

Oh... do you think gender experts (who actually understand and agree with transgender individuals existing) are lying, and just have an agenda?

Do you think experts are lying to people about gender, because you are so right-wing, biased, and ignorant that you don't know better?

The US has seen 300+ cases in 3 fuckin' months. It's currently seeing the worst outbreak in 20+ years. It's on pace to break its worst recent year for cases (2014 - 664).

Other diseases are also making a comeback. Whooping cough, TB. To say it's the least of our concerns is stupid and ignorant.

"ekbfa3y","See, I wouldn’t say Ren is too bad. His problem is just that he’s so bloody naive and ignorant, that he still treats everything like a game. It’s not that he necessarily treats his party bad, like Itsuki, but it’s that he sees them as NPCs, and only thought that him being strong mattered; they would just catch up. He’s so used to being a solo player in his VRMMORPG game, that he just applied it here too. Yeah, him just rushing forward and thinking his party would just take care of the rest is stupid, but it’s more being a naive 16 year old rather than being a jackass.    

I think there’s a bonus chapter where all the heroes do a party swap that explains the others faults.    
Motoyasu’s party are made to act like a bunch of cheerleaders down to Myne, and they kinda hate it.     
Itsuki has to be the centre of attention, and has everyone else just cover him.

"ek7xc6v","A very famous book has a scene very much like this, so reading it might give you some insight: [Hyperion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion).

&amp;#x200B;

Given what I know of the book, and other modern day cognates, let me try to explain what the quote says to me. Do you know about fundamentalist Christians in the US that try to bring about the apocalypse through their actions? These people foment war and suffering so they can bring about the apocalypse. Why? Because they believe that if they bring about the apocalypse that it will cause events to happen that are detailed in the Christian Bible. The gist of it is: the righteous (meaning good Christians) will go to heaven and the rest will be damned to a Hell on Earth. These people are fucking nuts, but they capture the feeling I get from this quote.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine someone, a man by implication in the quote, who has nothing or has lost everything. This person has been driven mad by his losses and sheer amount of suffering he's been through. He, in his madness, wants vengeance. He wants things to change so that he can be on top. So he prays for storms. Storms could be literal storms, or they could be great change, or war, etc. Things that would upset the status quo. He's got nothing left to lose, so he wants to watch the world burn; because anything is better than what he's living through now.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to do a bit of ripped from the headlines, imagine a simple man doing what his ancestors have been doing for many years in the past. He's  a laborer, maybe a farmer, something like that. Suddenly he doesn't have a job anymore because of the ""global economy"" whatever that is; he doesn't understand. Suddenly he doesn't have anything, or so he convinces himself. Where's the pride in his work? Where's the respect and the money he used to get for doing his job? He hears from others that others overseas and far away have taken his job. He also sees immigrants coming to his country and taking skilled labor; nothing he can do or understand. But they, they get the respect and the money he used to have. So, he wishes for a great change to take place to force the world back into the world he knew. In his madness, he prays for storms. And he thinks that those storms will bring him peace; that is, make it so that he can have what he thinks is his again.

&amp;#x200B;

These men, cast in a modern light, are the poor and ignorant that are getting left behind by modern economies that have no place for them. These are your Trump voters, your Brexit Leave voters, etc. These are your arrogant simple people that just want back what's ""their's"".

"ek6iwhk","EXACTLY.

We need integrated, widespread social networks that can facilitate spreading messages of cultural acceptance and human positivity - progress and coexistence. 

We could get everyone on these communication platforms and use marketing and media technology to organically foster these society - anchoring ideals. All while breaking down geographical boundaries between communication!

Er, but we got Facebook and Instagram instead. 

I hate being the pessimist - but I'm not even sure what counts as a widespread measure that would be effective at this point - the cutting edge of widespread communication technology is actively used to lead society down this dark road for profit. 

Regulation, legal action, trusting our leaders, artists, professionals.

None of that has done any good. In fact that is part of the issue, they are not trustworthy. We largely idolize idiots and cheats. Braggarts and lowbrow hecklers. Surface level heros who give us a whiff of cool when we don't even have a solid enough concept of self worth to have value in our own real life characters. 

People are too stupid and apathetic to organize on a large enough scale. They are happy sucking down mediocre media and ignoring or not understanding the issues as long as it means they don't have to do any more dreadful thinking on the matter. 

We clearly need tons of organization, discussion, social exposure, compassion, intelligence and technology married to solve issues of human suffering. 

Those things are being actively muted to the point of being devolved. There are people with an active interest in society not getting its shit together, and who stand to profit more the worse it gets. They use politics, technology and entertainment to foster societies where these situations are limited. 

Why is public discourse so focused on ENTERTAINMENT?

You can't escape the water if your brother-rescuer is pushing your head under.

These people with their hands so deep in our lives need to be exposed and held accountable for their actions - the entire tree of corruption shaken for the safety of a future that is worth fostering. 

Marketing, analytics, entertainment, politics - it all needs to be hoisted into transparency with technology. If you were served content based on targeted marketing you should be shown with no degree of uncertainty what was used to determine the decision. 

Politicians and corporate management should have absolutely transparency and historical record of their decisions, stances and financial influence. 

I love you all but no one is going to understand that shit. Your average person won't even be able to understand what the fuck you are getting on about with your conspiracy theory crap. You will have lost them in the noise at ""this is extremely important"".

Certified rant at this point, but I can't see how you fix a problem where the money and technology are subverting cultural progress and at the same time the people fueling those industries are sufficiently isolated and ignorant that they don't even see the issues, and possibly can't or won't see the issues if someone manages to get their attention with a well articulated description. 

And it cyclically reinforces itself - people are at the mercy of their own lack of introspection being harnessed by asshole marketers who are being paid by assholes who don't care about what their actions do to society as long as they stay rich and isolated from it.

Am I a dick for harboring resentment for the average person because they are so fucking stupid that all it takes is an entertainment industry and some 6th grade lies to fuck society? Because they actually don't care about any of this stuff because its complex or requires them to be educated on a topic that isn't immediately entertaining?

I mean I do dumb shit too but I know when I'm about to walk everyone off the fucking cliff and that considering my life more important than the net of humanity, or actively not thinking about injustice because its complex - is backwards as shit and something that would confirm that I am a weak, self centered piece of shit.

My grandmother and I went to Walmart recently for some herbs, spices and snacks. I had been looking for something, can't remember what it was now so I guess it wasn't that important, but I knew that it could be used two different ways so I wasn't sure what 'category' it fell under therefore I didn't know what isle to look in. After roaming the isles over and over I saw a young man starting to stock shelves so I thought awesome i'll ask him! I start walking over to him and it turns out he's hearing impaired! An older gentleman got to him before I did but because the kid couldn't understand him he just backed away slowly then walked away altogether.. I can't sign very well at all (I have a deaf cousin but I don't get to see him often at all because he lives so far away so my ASL is stupid basic) but I noticed there was something similar to what I had wanted near where he was standing (I'm telling you it's DRIVING ME INSANE that I can't remember what it is) so I picked it up and pointed to the label and then made a motion  to show that I was going to do with it, turning it upside down and shaking as if I was shaking something on food. He immediately knew what I meant and directed me to the right isle, all with a smile. Which by the way it was NOWHERE near where I thought it would be, I'm an idiot. Now........... this is where I wonder if I was the asshole.... 

&amp;#x200B;

A lady not far from us saw this and followed me out of the isle just to let me know how disrespectful she thought I was being. I had no idea what she was talking about, so I said ""I'm sorry?"" That prompted her to go into this mini rant about how kids today are so entitled and ignorant that we treat the hearing impaired like second class citizens. She berated me for how I attempted to communicate with him instead of 'speaking slowly' so that they can read my lips. I finally just apologized for offending her and just continued on my way before I flipped my lid because what the fuck is this super terrific happy fun time bullshit you're spewing at me?

&amp;#x200B;

But after spending some time thinking about that day, was I genuinely the asshole here or is this lady just off her nut? I feel like speaking slowly to them would be disrespectful. Was I wrong to do what I did? I thought it would be an easy way to communicate quickly without making a scene or making him feel awkward...  I don't want to be THAT person, I have nothing but respect for the hearing impaired and questioning if I was that truly offensive is really truly bothering me. :(

They just haven’t met the right combination of the opposite sex that will make even them tempted.  

Now, the good person will notice this and they themselves will pull out of that relationship and set boundaries to prevent it from getting further. **This is where the trust lies. You trust your partner to stop it before it gets further.  That’s perfect.  Crushes and infatuation and finding others attractive sexually is perfectly normal.

Although I never seen him in real life, he was a great friend that I really enjoyed talking to and playing video games with and such. I’d known he used racial slurs, but I’d been used to it since i’ve faced racial issues/jokes my entire life (me being black). Well anyways, one day, I hear about some guys (Juniors in high school) at my school gang banging an 8th grader from a nearby middle school. I’m completely disgusted and appalled already, but then I come to find out these same guys decided to start an instagram live video during the horrid act. At this point, i’m completely furious and decide to tell my girlfriend and my friend, ranting to them due to my extreme anger. I tell my girlfriend and she said she’d heard very little rumors about it and agrees with me how disgusting it was, but the first thing my friend says to me is, and I quote, “Were they black?”. Me, being in the complete rage that I was, became even more enraged. How the fuck could he have the audacity to ask me that fucking question? Not only am I black, but IT WOULDN’T FUCKING MATTER EITHER WAY. After that, I got into a long, rage-fueled argument with him and another person (who basically is almost always riding his dick about everything he believes) about black people and crime rates.

Some context: My dad has worked at a large mill for 5+ years and knows pretty much everyone there. He has been telling everyone there, including the bosses, that his son (me) will be working there all summer to make money for college.

Here’s the catch, I have a job, I’m 18, and I’m going to a technical college which will not cost me that much (~15k for my degree). My mom and him both demand that I work there to save money for college, and every attempt I have by saying I don’t want to work 12 shifts 5 days a week, I’m 18 and can make my own decisions, and that I love my current job, are shot down by them.

I’m living with them for college so I’m saving money but it seems unfair and ignorant that they think I want to waste my entire summer working 12 shifts which I don’t want to do due to seeing how unhappy my dad is after work, quit the job I love, and work in what I’ve heard is a toxic workplace from the stories of my dad and his coworkers.

My god you... You aren't being serious there, right? Like.. AHHHHHHH. Ok... Okay... Look... It's okay... He's not an idiot just... He's... Uh... 

THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT! IT WAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR BY THE PHRASING WHAT I SAID, BY THE PHRASING OF WHAT YOU SAID, THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING THE- My God man. My God. Just. Just can you... You fucking pelican ass double dutch piece of insolent womb-shredding work... Can you just look for one second at anything you are saying? Do you read your comments before posting them? Do you SEE how... Monumentally willfully ignorant you are?! Do you know what the USSR was for one? No? Okay! That's fine! It really is! You don't know everything, neither do I, no one does! If you don't know something that's fine, but you have Google! You have a library! Goddamnit, just listen. Okay. I'll tell you.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or the USSR, was a union of a few dozen ""independent"" republics. The purpose of these republics was to maintain small-scale control over the individuals in the union. Russia, the dominant nation in the union, ended up completely owning everyone. The same happened with Yugoslavia, Serbia pretty much controlled everything. What you are describing isn't a new idea, its been done. Maybe they didn't make it a small enough scale you say? Let's a city of 100,000 people. I relatively small city all things considered. To achieve the tribe like system I am talking about, each ""segment"" or ""tribe"" would have to be 100 or fewer people because that's the cutoff for an everyone knows everyone society because of how our brains works. This means you would have to separate a city of 100,000 into 1000 different communes and make them all get along and work together. This requires central authority, back to totalitarian problems. It also means that the entire way our society functions would be ignored. You cannot have a function modern day economy (moneyless economy, but still an economy. It's just an economy of resources) in this way.

Okay. We got that out of the way. Good.

Now, the ""read a book"" part.

To understand history, to learn from what past mistakes were exactly, how and why they were made, you need to read. I'm not saying you're dumb, I'm not saying you don't have any points whatsoever, what I am saying is me sitting here and telling you stuff, it's not gonna help you understand what your ideas imply any better. It's not going to help your ideas evolve and grow and change because you are dead set in your ways. I recommended books specifically because they provide so much good information and can help you understand more about communism. Will it make your opinions be less communist? I doubt it. What it will do is make it so you actually understand what you're talking about and help you have legitimate ideas about how to solve the many problems that communism has. Who knows, maybe you can solve the overly complex riddle that communism is but you are just so woefully uninformed and ignorant that you will not ever solve it like this.

Learning is how you can actually have arguments that mean something - right now all you have is ""Communism sound cool and I want it to work, so it should work"" with no understanding of why anything went the way it did in the past. I'm not saying communism isn't an idea that you can have, or that communism will always fail, in fact, I gave conditions in which it could succeed, but what you fail to recognize is the why of communism failing. You fail to educate yourself and then try to argue you're right by the tune of ignorance. 

I'm trying to help you man, just... *sigh*
TL;DR
I'm not saying read books because you're dumb, I'm saying it because your ideas don't make sense within the confines of communism. There are legitimate points to make but you aren't making them.

"eg6x6je","Working on a space opera with some fantasy and horror elements. Inequality and the causes of it is one of the major themes I want to explore. I guess the most prominent example would be the Empire that serves as the antagonist in the series (initially). The nobles of this Empire have completely control over the technology that powers the lives of all its inhabitants and style themselves as gods and its main followers angels. 

They serve as a possible future where the elites controlling all the resources without supervision from the masses will result in them becoming too big to be held accountable with the lower classes being full slaves.  In this society:

\- The nobles, or gods, can live thousands of years if they wish to and control the means to upload minds to virtual afterlife. This helps them keep the masses under control over the promise of a 'reward in their heavens'.

\- Information does not flow free and only nobles and appropriate institutions (clerics, bureaucrats, engineers, among others) are allowed to be educated and develop their advance technologies. This leaves the masses uneducated and ignorant that the 'magic' the nobles let them use is something that they could to given enough study.

\- The core worlds of the Empire are all beautiful with plentiful resources, while the conquered worlds and outskirts barely have enough to survive and live at the mercy of local barons and criminals.

\- Artificial intelligence developed by the Empire has the capacity of becoming sentient. These 'Risen' typically start as robots in humanoid bodies. Per official law, if a risen is discovered, it is meant to be placed into an organic-like body to serve the Empire as a way to quell AI uprisings before they even begin. This Risen eventually can become full citizens and even marry non-nobles (although this is rare). However, the common people are extremely prejudiced against them as well as most nobles and most of the Risen are destroyed before the official authorities can protect them.",1549846807,"this leaves the masses uneducated and ignorant that the 'magic' the nobles let them use is something that they could to given enough study.","uneducated and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"uneducated and ignorant","uneducated",NA,NA,0

I've been pan-africanist for several years and embrace that title even if people think it's cheesy or somehow outdated. So let me clear this up. I'm not trying to earn stripes but just let you know i'm not in the business of making excuses for whites or 'caping for whites'. So let me clear this up further. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As I said it’s as simple as voting or educating someone. If you can’t do that you’re part of the problem, whether you’re white black hispanic Asian Indian etc.  
&gt;  
&gt; Except not enough people even do *that* or else the world would be a different place. Plus you have no choice but to speak up if you’re a black person because racism can and will affect you and your loved ones. Also why are you making it about yourself? In life, part of surviving is multitasking and taking on multiple issues. If you can do that at a 9-5 job, it shouldn’t be too hard for you to speak up against racism. I never disagreed with you otherwise on that but your language around this topic is suspect. 

1. I do community organizing. My mom used to work in soup kitchens and volunteered with the Black Panthers in Oakland then later the LA chapter. After moving down south she had me late (late 40's, which back then was beyond rare as far as births go) and had already converted to being a Jehovah's Witness by that time. She gave up the fight but my uncle was always active in social issues and so i'd kind of 'tag along' to rallies and such. I grew up with pan africanist beliefs via him and other men around me. Not only community organizing but I work with social workers too on certain situations, as well as try to be involved in workshops with local BLM and similar groups. Been involved in a lot of protest and 'know your rights' seminars when it came to police harassment among other things. I also teach small classes to local youth in my area (mostly South Dallas and Oak Cliff areas) about West African history and the resistance of Afro-Caribbean slaves in the west indies. My current thing i'm working on is helping out with ""vegan soul food"" vendors at a local event which is focusing on health betterment in the black community. I'm all about educating and helping the community, especially younger folks who seem to be caught up in foolishness where I live. I'm in the Dallas area now, and things aren't exactly 'organized' down here. So no i'm not an 'enabler' who sits by the side lines. ""Busting my ass working"" wasn't a direct reference to me, it was just to the composite person, the everyman. I'm personally always active. So once again you misconstrued me and made an assumption, just like I did, so we're both even. Onto the next one. You don't know me and I don't know you. I put words in your mouth before and you assumed wrong about me. Call it even and let's move on. 

2. 

&gt; Why do you Im making you the enemy? I’m simply replying to your comment. 

I meant that in reference to how my actions or words of seemingly putting words in your mouth and speaking out of pocket that you originally referenced in your previous post may have come off offensive and I may have made myself look like ""The enemy"" or been rude. I had meant to apologize. You didn't do anything to provoke the apology I just figured i'd do a side-statement and say so beforehand sorry if I had originally come off as acting like I knew you or making unnecessary assumptions or mini-insults. Once again my bad. That was the meaning of my ""enemy"" statement, to apologize and do what Liam apparently couldn't do--and that's check myself. So once again my mistake, in all seriousness.

&amp;#x200B;

3. As for whether or not I have ""white friends"". I've got a small number of actual ""friends"" (acquaintances are another story). Most are minorities but we sprinkle some ivory faces on top of that in the mix here and there lol. But so what if I do? that's not really the point I was making. I kind of went off on a tangent sure but I don't have some secret fear of white people's judgement, I give **zero fucks** about it to be honest. It is what it is. I was just stating that just to be stating it so probably it wasn't welcomed here. Once again my mistake but I Wasn't ""protecting"" or ""caping"" for white people, and it's offensive and ignorant that you would automatically assume that about me. I don't know you and you don't know me. That's not what my point was, and if that came off the wrong way that's on me. Preaching to the choir. 

4. MLK's view on moderates--100% factual and basically backed up by my ""liberal"" comments--is well known and i've actually always agreed with it and bring this up to the endless pools of people trying to whitewash MLK's image and message today with stupid revisionist history. So you're **preaching to the choir** here. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. 

&gt; You can keep doing that. Other people can recognize that in a racist society most white People will have their own racial biases that they haven’t left at the front door, whether they’re active or inactive. I’ve experienced it. People here have experienced it. Again I don’t see the need for your “not all white people” response. I’m kind of disgusted now. Your response is similar to OP’s. They’re both off base. It’s as if you feel guilty or something and don’t want to paint all white people in a bad light because god forbid that happens, but literally no one was doing that. You made strawman arguments like “he’s not a maga supporter” or “white people who aren’t racist might be a surprise to you” and you really did a bad job at hiding your preconceived notions and biases. I’m frankly disappointed with your response.

&gt; On What Causes Us to Leave the Faith

THe first cause they point out is misunderstanding context (surprise surprise), and turing our belief into a house of cards that tumble if one is removed.  The example is the literal 6 day creation, if that is shown to be false then everything else must be too.  I think this is an oversimplification and a rather insulting one since he admits many former students and leaders in the faith are among the apostates.  There may be some but most of us end up challenging what we were told it says by actually going to the source and reading what it says and studying it.  This is very close to ""ExChristians only leave because of what a particular church or christian did,"" we're not that dumb.

&gt; In reality they were only rejecting a doctrinally bloated take on Christianity they mistook for the real thing.

See?  Insulting.  Such a thing may have put us on the path of doubt, but you never end up at the end of a journey after the first step.

&gt;  I couldn’t agree more.  I regularly encounter people who left the church because of particular beliefs or practices that are far from what I would call mere Christianity.

Ugh, get a room you two.

&gt; The second factor is unmet expectations. 

Again, same with the first, that may be a factor to get us on the doubt train, but it is always a long journey.

&gt; One of the most common expectations that deconverts have is that the Bible is completely error free. And not just that it is inerrant but that it must be inerrant or else it cannot be the word of God. Somewhere along the way they were told that in order for the Bible to be the word of God it had to be free of error.

Jee I wonder where we could have gotten that fro...OH YEAH THE BIBLE.  There is some interesting metal gymnastics going on here to try and reinterpret what it says, the very thing they are accusing us of doing ""incorrectly.""  

&gt; The third factor is that we have not done a good job of communicating the content of the faith in what Charles Taylor calls “A Secular Age”. 

This is annoying.  First he says that we leave because of what someone says that is an incorrect assumption or interpretation of the Bible, so the fix is to offer a correct assumption or interpretation of the Bible based upon what they believe it is.  All of it is subjective...unless its what they say, then that is objective.  Par for the course of apologetics - they are correct and everyone else is incorrect because they accept it so everyone else must too.  They just cannot fathom why what works for them doesnt work for everyone else.

&gt; Solution to Christians Leaving Faith Pt.1

Blah blah blah - they need to be indoctrinated with the correct interpritation, which is theirs obviously.

&gt; To illustrate your first point, some research suggests that autism is positively correlated with a tendency toward atheism.

Wooooowww.... Really?  I get what he is trying to support about a social system playing a role which it does to some degree, but then to throw out what is essentually considered a ""defect"" as the cause for atheism is another insult saying we are mentally deffective to not be a Christian... Im getting angry.

&gt; as far as correct belief is concerned

There it is, they are correct, and everyone else isnt. Why?  Because they believe so.  You cant convince these people of it any other way.

&gt; There is more to being a Christian, however, than just being saved.

No shit Sherlock.

&gt; There is also the matter of what the Christian community has identified as the boundary markers for correct belief.

Pot calling kettle black....there is a lot of that here, that the solution is to make sure we all understand the ""correct"" version and that would solve everything.

&gt; No doubt some would say that a biblical conception of God is precisely what brought them to the place where they could not believe in him anymore. As tragic as I think that is, at least they are rejecting the God of the Bible, not the God of their ill-formed theology. 

Wait...soemthing I agree with, is he going to make a valid point that...

&gt; s I mentioned previously, many deconverts reveal in their deconversion stories that the catalyst for leaving the faith came as a result of being disappointed with God, or at least the concept they had of him.

Nope.  Fuck.  Its not being ""disappointed"" with god or the concept of it, it is not finding anything worth while or realistic to accept the claims of it existing.  Sure the god of the Bible is an asshole and douchebag, but that doesn't negate the existence of such a being - I know many humans who fit that bill.  **We arent Misotheists.**

&gt; In reality though, they had a significantly unbiblical conception of God

You assume to much.

&gt; Yes, if people think that this life is simply about being as happy as one can be, they are bound to be disappointed. From a Christian perspective, the primary focus of this life is about becoming holy not merely happy.

This is a common theme with apologists, they assume that we think that nothing bad should happen or that Christians should be perfect and coming to the realization that isnt true makes us reject the dogma.  No.  The Bible says nothing of the sort, and many of us are far more knowledgeable about that text then they are.

&gt; I understand there are former believers who did have a more or less biblical conception of God and no longer believe in him for various reasons, some moral, some intellectual, some existential.

Wait is he going to admit that he was wrong about...

&gt; But deconversion narratives reveal that for many that was not the case. 

**Jesus Fucking Christ** who the hell is he speaking to?  In most cases that is *exactly* the case.

&gt; Instead of rejecting the God of the Bible, they rejected a distorted version of him. 

They seriously cannot accept that some people just dont accept bullshit as gold.

&gt; Back in the 1980s, I was a big fan of the Christian heavy metal band Stryper. And in one of their songs, “Reason for the Season,” they actually sang, “Everyday can be a holiday when he is with you.” Um, don’t tell that to Job!

...wait did he seriously just say music is a contributing factor for... *sigh*

&gt; The solution to Christians becoming atheists (Part 2)

Ok, 2/3 through... I can do this...

&gt; Former believers sometimes explain it as analogous to an adult trying to believe in Santa Claus.

In some ways yes, in others no.  We dont start wars and live our lives around who is right, Santa or Krampus.  Fundamentally though both a myths with no basis in reality from an empirical aspect.

&gt;  It’s easy for kids to believe in Santa because their understanding of the world is so primitive and ignorant that the Santa story can fit within it without much difficulty.

Similar to how our ancestors who primitive and ignorant in many aspect of reality? Hmm...

&gt; Somewhere between 6 – 10 years of age, the idea of an overweight man sliding down all the chimneys of the world in one night, with a sack of presents begins to feel suspect. 

Because no one in reality can do that, the math doesnt add up, and there is evidence that he is not the culprit of the deeds he is said to perform... wait how is this different from religion again?

At least he does admit they are similar as far as the process goes.

&gt; First, we need to do a better job of doing apologetics.

Well, you're doing a terrible job as it is, so try harder?

&gt; So much internet apologetics and even published works at the popular level are unhelpful.

Well at least he admits it.

&gt; Individuals who leave the faith should be leaving because they found the best of Christian thinking to be lacking, not because a self-styled apologist let them down. 

Again, that is *exactly* what happened, who the fuck did this guy speak to in his research!?

&gt; To counter the negative affective influence of our secular age on faith formation, we need to immerse ourselves in another culture; the church.

Yeah entrench yourself further within an echo chamber that refuses to answer or acknowledge what is happening... great solution. /s

&gt; Do you see that as a danger?... Theoretically I suppose it is. 

Not theoretically, realistically.

"eee7i91","And for that matter, what about black artists who were exploited by other blacks in the mainstream industry? For example, would this ""double negative logic"" therefore mean that it's OK to sample TLC's tracks all we want, because they got massively burned by Pebbles, Babyface, and LA Reid collectively? Or how about the many Motown artists who got yanked around during their time with Berry Gordy?

Oh, and can we sample black artists who were under the aegis of black-owned music companies that treated them decently, made sure they got paid (and paid correctly) and publicized, and brought them out onto the world stage? How about black artists who own their own production houses, like Juan Atkins? Is that OK?

What if I want to cut up Wilson Pickett's ""Land of 1000 Dances"" or ""Mustang Sally""? Since these were cut in Muscle Shoals with white backup musicians (and, for that matter, some of the best and most prolific in R&amp;B, which further mangles OM's arguments here), would I have to vocal-eliminate Wilson Pickett and only use the backing tracks? Would that then be ""fair"" to Wilson Pickett? Or how would I deal with something on Stax, where the house band (one of the most legendary in R&amp;B and Soul) was pretty much a 50/50 split, racially, between black and white?

"eeak342","If you want some insight this happened to me recently, funny enough and this was my experience. Several months ago my ex contacted me to tell me that she was gay, well at least that she was ""confused"" during the period of our relationship and it was pretty obvious from her FB profile as to what she meant. The main differences in my situation were that we were together for a pretty short time and we haven't remained in contact as I live on the other side of the world and I just don't do that regardless. She contacted me from a pretty apologetic stance, saying that she was sorry for putting me through that and that she was sorry for ruining our friendship. 

Honestly, my immediate reaction was pretty indifferent. If anything I was just so surprised that she seemed to feel so concerned about the way I would react and that she seemed to feel so guilty and ashamed about it. All I did was just sent her back a message telling her no worries, that I was really happy for her that she has clearly figured it out, and that I wished her all the best. I will admit that it did briefly cross my mind that I felt a bit insecure about how feminine I might be because she dated me of all people but I of course understand how irrational and ignorant that is.

I have heard that people can react negatively about it in that they can believe that you were just toying with them, that you may view them as repulsive, that you were wasting their time etc but I can't believe that any reasonable person would come to any such conclusion for any significant amount of time. I would expect, however, that he will be very introspective about this news though. I know when I was told I thought back to all of my memories to see if there was any way I should have known this beforehand out of curiosity. Overall I would say if you believe him to be a reasonable and understanding person then just go for it, it may provide a great deal of closure and insight into your previous relationship that he considers important, as it did partially for me.

&gt;a French person isn't different from an American 

The previous comment made perfect sense in the context of geography, which has a role in defining and shaping a nation's culture. I *sincerely* hope you won't deny this statement. Also, a Frenchman and an American are different people, hence the distinction. 

&gt;you're acting as if France is dependent on needing to know German or English, they aren't 

Nobody said that France is dependent on needing to know German or English. The previous comment simply states that because France shares borders with multiple nations and is near many others, the French have an incentive to learn the languages of people with whom they share borders. It's an advantage, not a dependency. 

&gt;It comes down to better education and more of an incentive for people to learn different languages 

I'm not so sure about the better education bit. Are you referring to K-12 or University? The previous commenter said that the incentive for Continental Europeans to learn different languages stems from the fact that their nations are particularly small and share borders with many other countries. As stated, it's an advantage to keep the peace between you and your neighbors. 

&gt;but it's a bit pathetic and ignorant that so many Americans struggle to even speak basic Spanish when a significant percentage of their country speak Spanish as their native tongue

Despite the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most used language in the United States, there are 50 states that have different demographics entirely.

"edrvb4j","I mean, in general the recipe for revolt/revolution is three parts: motive, means, and method.

Motive: one of your key necessities must be removed. Food/water, shelter, clothing, safety, and something to burn free time on. Without this, the other two don't matter. This is what causes unrest, rather than just disapproval. Basically, a threat to a person's way of life.

Means: You have to be in a position to be able to revolt. Tokugawa Ieyasu mostly prevented rebellion by taking away the right to bear arms, and keeping the military occupied. The strongest dictatorships tend to keep their people so broken and ignorant that they're incapable of revolt. However, one person revolting is just a terrorist. Thus-

Method: There has to be some level of organization. This tends to grow organically over time as small cells of potent unrest link up with others, and collect impotent cells of unrest and give them means. This is often where peasant revolts fail or succeed. Generally (though not always), if you look deeply enough into popular revolts, you'll find a cabal of elite persons with something to gain from it. They're generally the ones providing Method to those with means, and Means to those with a method.

Lastly, and this is really the binding agent to everything else, people have to believe there is no other option. Revolution is a huge risk. Even if you win, you may still personally lose. That's why those other three pieces *must* be there, and why it can all still fall apart without this. If there is a less risky path, odds are you'll choose that path instead. In a way, that's the most deviously effective part of democracy. In some small way, you feel like you can affect positive change that will protect your way of life. And it really can have an impact.

I am specifically attacking THIS PARTICULAR argument, which I find silly and ignorant. That is, SPECIFICALLY, that the View of the Hebrews and the Late War are similar to the Book of Mormon, so much so that it calls into question the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

There are many OTHER reasons to doubt the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, but these particular ones are NOT good ones.

To call this a strawman -- when it is the entire point -- is silly. I set out to debate *a particular point someone made*, and we're debating that particular point, and leaving everything else alone.

If you're going to use VotH and TLW as an argument that the BoM is not true, then you need to do the following:

1. Show how these books are similar to the Book of Mormon.

"ed5mxny","&gt;So the best way I used to compare between the 2 religions is by watching debates from the true religious people since they are the best people to symbolize their religion, and I watched debates for sheikh Ahmed deedat and how this guy was single handedly debating queues of Christian people and Christian scientists, and to be be honest this guy just made me hold my religion even more , you can go and watch his debates in YouTube if u doubt me .
&gt;

Thanks, I'll check it out. Although, properly comparing two old religious traditions goes far beyond just watching a single video of YouTube apologetics. I hope you treat your faith with more seriousness than that.

&gt;Another thing I did is traveling to a non Muslim country and see how they live , and this is my experience: people are not as close as Muslims to almighty GOD not even comparable , because as a Muslim I pray 5 times a day in all times and I feel very connected to GOD , something bad happened to me ? I make duaa and I get relieved , meanwhile in non Muslims countries nothing like that happens , maybe u occasionally pray and do some rites but definitely not as close as Muslims .
&gt;

Yeah, the west has become largely secularized. Most of the Islamic world has not - but some of it has. Go visit Central Asia and you will find Muslims as ignorant of their faith as a lapsed Catholic in France. But large pockets of the faith survive, and God willing, will, like Noah's arc, replenish and renew western societies.

&gt;Another thing I noticed that the women isn’t as respected as in my country , even though u think that we treat women like an animal but actually women are a red line in my country and she can never be messed with , and she has to be always prioritized in all aspects of life , while the women there just grind like men and they don’t look at the nature of the women and how god created her differently form the man and it’s not fair for men either to get equal rights like women in legacy for example .
&gt;

Yeah, women are objectified sexually in the west; used in a culture of easy sex, and it's had terrible effects. But, that does not make it ok to deny women basic mobility rights or other fundamental forms of autonomy, or legal equality. That's false logic.

&gt;So I basically figured out that people are just to shallow about my religion and the media doesn’t show us as we are expected to look like rather than that terrorist beast that has to be avoided .
&gt;

It's easy to brush off doubts and concerns raised by others by simply dismissing everyone else as shallow and ignorant. That way, you don't have to do any difficult intellectual work yourself, just sit back, watch some YouTube videos telling you you're right, and judge others. 

&gt;After I came back to my country I just wanna say I’m proud to be a Muslim man ALLAHO AKBAR .

"ecxjjq8","Alright, so let me take this bit by bit. How was obama a disaster? Serious question. 

Denuclearized the DPRK? Are you high? They still have nukes right now, and an earthquake did all the damage to their *ICBM program*. Noth the nukes, just the ability to throw them at us. Trump did nothing but saber rattle, and allow the regime to use the west as a scary bugaboo that will give them propaganda grist for the mill for a decade. If you don't take them seriously, strongman dictatorships collapse. That's been the policy for decades. Let them implode socially.

Trump is doing nothing about their IP theft. He is just fighting a tariff fight, a pale sight compared to what a smart president would do, and shut them out of every industry. If he had balls, he would cut all ties, declare them persona non gratis, and tell our trade partners that anyone doing business with china has 2 years to cut all economic ties. China is absolutely a hostile power, but if you want to crush them, you have to kneecap yourself too. It would hurt more than trump is willing to hurt, so he half asses it. Not his fault china sucks ass, but he has the ability to do more. Unfortunately, lots of chinese people will starve if we do it.

Running from ISIS before we kill them all, instead of annihilating them and supporting the Kurds is basically telling the world that America forgets our friends. It's not Trump's fault we are there, but now the people there need our help and we made it our business. Again, if he had balls, Trump would just annex the territory already and actually build up the region and ensure we don't let Russia, Turkey, and the Arab states exert power there, which is what is happening now that we are pulling out. Putin loves Trump's move of handing over nation after nation to their interests.

Tax bill was a disaster, and we are about to dive into a recession because of it. He pulled money out of the lower and middle classes to fund stock buybacks, and now that he can't even bully the fed. reserve properly, like better presidents did, the interest rates are going up in an overbought, overvalued market, and since he never put any market protections in place, or began to regulate banks to keep them from doing shady as fuck shit, it's starting to get jumpy, and heading for a crash again, and this will mostly impact middle and low class Americans. Because when crashes happen, millionaires have equity to sell to eat, and everyone else doesn't.

The decrease in legal immigrants is a dumb as fuck campaign promise, and a dumb as fuck thing to actually do. Literally every part of our economic system relies on cheap labor from immigrants trying to make a fresh start, even Trump himself hires immigrants en mass at his own businesses for low costs. He's not making us safer, he's just starving businesses for cheap labor, encouraging them to move to cheaper markets overseas or across borders. Also, this nonsense about immigrants is entirely race baiting garbage.

I am currently on medical insurance only because obamacare made it affordable. my friends are on insurance because of it. Every other proper developed nation has good, cheap, public healthcare, and it costs them less to get the same damn quality we get. We spend double what Sweden or England does by % of gdp on medicine, with no tangible improvement on quality of care or general health.

Finally, The Paris Accords made us not look suicidally stupid and ignorant. That wasn't the world thinking we could be bullied, it was them thinking we were adults. NAFTA was an actually good trade deal that just needed updating, we do a huge amount of business with mexico and we generally bend them over a barrel.Canada deserves good trade deals, because they consistently help us on the international stage with all kinds of shit. We want to encourage Canada to continue our special relationship, where the US fucks something up, and Canada covers our ass. Trump is seen as a bumbling, lecherous, weak-willed moron internationally, and *everyone knows he's Putin's bitch*. If you think for a second that anyone respects us more for him being our leader, you are an actual idiot. Shit, even the Swiss news insults him regularly.

&gt;Pulls heritage card.

You claimed I had never met a native person in my life, you were being fucking ignorant.

 ""Have you ever met a white person or been off the reservation in your life? Because it seems like you have no fucking clue what the rest of Canada, what real cities and real society is like?"" (See how dumb and ignorant that sounds?)

Did you notice that the person I originally replied to was saying that the **reservation system was a ""carrot and stick"" approach to abandon their culture**? And then I actually **disagreed** with that?

I'm not saying the reservation system should be abandoned, I am saying that the reservation system is the only way that **will** work. The only way you can keep a culture alive when it is incompatible with ""modern society"" is to keep it out of ""modern society"". Modern society = functional government. Function goverment = collecting tax from **all** citizens, and distributing services to **all** citizens. That is not the reservation system, thus, it has to be kept separate and distinct. 

But what I'm **also** saying is that I don't see a ton of historical examples where **separating people by race is good**. Do you have any? There are *tons* of examples where creating two classes of citizens has resulted in the most horrible things humanity has ever done, but not the other way around. I don't have a solution - but you will not convince me that treating someone differently because of their race is the way *forward*. ***That is fucking racism***.",1546220557,"(see how dumb and ignorant that sounds?)","dumb and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"how dumb and ignorant","dumb",NA,"how",0

"ecngisj","Now, I know that this kind of question has been asked to death, but I would still like to know to have a decent conversation with some people.

My stupidest thing happened not too long ago actually. I was having severe diarrhea and I pooped in my pants uncontrollably. As soon as I felt something weird on my pants, I ran straight to the toilet and I took my pants off, seeing that there is some shit in there. My ass was leaking diarrhea and some it landed on the bathroom floor. I did however make it to the toilet to take a shit. Little liquid pieces of diarrhea was still around, and I wanted to get rid of them by wetting some toilet paper and wiping the diarrhea off the floor before drying it with a towel and I kept the towel and put my dirty soiled underwear on the wash basket.

Unfortunately, my mother found little pieces of wet toilet tissue on the towel, and she asked me about it. I told her what happened, and she flipped out at me. She told my father and he was pissed off too. They had to wipe the entire toilet clean with disinfectant wipes, as they told me what I had done to clean the toilet was wrong.

The next day, I was lying in bed still sick, and my mother found that soiled piece of underwear from last night on the washing basket, and she was pissed off, more than she was the previous night. I had absolutely forgotten to tell my parents about my soiled underwear after getting that bollocking for it. It took a while for my mother and father to forgive me.

I really look back at those events in pure shame and disgust. I was old enough to know not to do that kind of thing, yet I was so boneheaded and ignorant that I thought that I could do this myself. I feel like such shit. I live in a house with my parents and my three younger sisters, and if anyone of them would get sick, I would have had nobody else to blame but myself.

2. Whether or not other people are racist and ignorant, that does not give you license to be racist and ignorant.

3. The fact that there are some Chinese people who really respect your culture means that at least some Chinese are people with a moral high ground on you. So you can't logically defend your position of being superior to all Chinese.

"ebs74r7","&gt; What I am describing us objective free speech,

Objective? Locke that was a founder of these principles was how I am using the words. You can redefine them to make your argument if you like, that only makes you objectively a liar though. Congrats.

&gt;  what you're on about is some juridical play on words to make you think you're free

Again, just because there is a law to protect your freedoms from being violated by another doesn't invalidate your freedoms, that is anarchy. Only Ancaps talk of both principles, you seem to have conflated them as the same thing.

&gt; Exists outside reality he says while calling me ignorant, lol. 

Outside of physical reality. You bring to me the rights so I can touch and feel it, tell me what color they are and the shape and then you can say they are in reality. You are being stupid here. They exist abstractly. Only an immature brain that can't handle abstract thought wouldn't understand that.

&gt; Reality is everything that exists... 

So where in reality does freedom exist? Love? 1? Where is the number one? There are abstract concepts that exist in our minds only. The ability to think abstractly is a thing humans develop after childhood typically.

&gt; leave it to liberal writes to ignore science to further their agenda.

What? You see it is talk like this that is so stupid and ignorant that makes me hope you are just trolling, that you are just playing at being this retarded.

&gt; My natural right to property starts when I can defend my 'property' from invaders.

You do have the right to defend yourself. But again, you saying that there shouldn't be a law to defend that is anarchy and those aren't the same. You are conflating the two separate concepts. Then did Hitler do nothing wrong? Is there no such thing as murder, since if you aren't able to protect your life you don't have the right to it? That is pretty sick and anarchy, not freedom.

&gt; My juridical right to property is granted by the constitution and I can legally kill you if you step onto it.

So is my right to speech.

And no, if you invited me to your home and I am doing nothing to threaten you or your liberty or property, you can't then just shoot me.   You don't have that right legally or morally. Again, anarchy is what you are pushing, not freedom. You are conflating those.

&gt; Anarchy IS freedom. And yes that is exactly what I'm saying.

And the mask falls. No, they aren't the same. Only a retard or someone woefully ignorant of the discussion would thing they were synonym. Just because YOU define those for your lame argument actually makes you wrong and the liar here. lol

&gt; I can't build my house anywhere, because the government would fuck me over if I did. 

Yes, but even if it didn't, you would violate others rights to their property if you had unrestricted access anywhere and everywhere. That is anarchy. You anarchists are funny little creatures, aren't you?

&gt;In theiry I can though. 

In theory, you can. But you would be violating another's property if you built it on theirs. Which from a rights and liberty perspective, are wrong and immoral. To the amoral evil anarchist, it is all good. Which is why no one will ever take you seriously except other equally deluded zealots.

&gt; In a free world you would be free to build your house inside my house and kill me if I tried to stop you.

That isn't free. If you have to constantly worry about others violating your rights. That is anarchy, different concepts and ideas. Try again. So are you AntiFa or AnCap? Anarchy can't work with society, what you are advocating for is the end of society. That isn't going to happen and if it does, you won't live long enough to see how wrong you are.

&gt; No? You don't hace the right to yell bomb in a theatre.. you'd get arrested. 

Yes, if there was the violation of others rights to life, liberty, or property, you should be. 

&gt;""Liberal free society"" does not exist.. 

Well, strictly speaking no. It is an ideal Locke, Jefferson, Madison wrote about. And ideal to strive for. Some are striving better than others, like the US. Unless you have another?

&gt;liberals are lawmongers who would rather vote AWAY their rights than get their feelings hurt.

Those are liberals in name, yes. We generally call them regressives because they act that way. I use the liberal term in that those that pursue liberty like Locke and Jefferson. Not the retarded way that righties call lefties libtard or anything so dumb.

&gt; They are self evident to you because you grew up with it.

I was quoting Jefferson son. One of the champions of freedom and liberty ideals and thinking.

&gt; They are the same. How am I lying?

Because they aren't. And being wrong is lying to you apparently.

&gt; And? He was right about that.

Ok, not going there. Saying Hitler was right about killing Jews isn't ok. You are either just a common troll to think that or a massive retard. You have no argument when you say that murder and genocide are ok.

&gt; You keep coming back to liberal writers for some reason... I'm not a cuckold.

Not to them. Only to the anarchist ideals and zealotry. 

And it is because, son, that you are using their words and have a massive misunderstanding of what they spoke of and what is being spoken now based on those foundations.

&gt; I dont care what is ""generally accepted"" 

Son, that is how words work. If you redefine them for your argument, you lost. If you can't use them in a way generally accepted, you lose communication. Or is that too abstract with your little mind?

&gt; God is generally accepted

So? Words aren't God, kid.

&gt; I hope you're not using that as an argument for his existence or the validity of the bible? 

I wouldn't even know how to start figuring out how you jumped to that conclusion. I hope you aren't conflating freedom and anarchy to find unicorns. That is how stupid you sound. 

&gt; ""You don't agree with me so you must be trolling"" You sound like a libtard crying about russian bots, man.

And saying Hitler did nothing wrong, you sound like a Nazi. I am using my rights and ignoring you. You are free to say something trolly, insane, or retarded (you will probably do a combo of all three, just to prove me right).

tell me, is it true or false that the income gap in the us shrunk to its lowest point during the active years of the new deal, and it was much worse prior and has gotten worse since?

is it true or false that corporate welfare far exceeds welfare collected by the general population which, here's a twist for you! is also corporate welfare! do you know what its called when an employer can pay someone half a living wage and then have it made up with tax payer money? welfare!

"eb4eah4","If that is the level of understanding socialist, revolutionist people of the West (just my impression browsing Reddit and especially seeing this post) has regarding the world then it is no wonder capitalism is still going strong. You are so naive and ignorant that I often think that any kind of revolutionary idea in the West is completely a lie, a controlled fake opposition maybe. With these kind of ignorant nonsense you people do more harm than good to the movement you are supposedly hoping for. 

Do you know how the world order we are currently living in came about? The starting point was some people going out and engaging with the world, personally getting to know other cultures other people. They sailed out of Europe and went everywhere discovering and expanding their horizons. They used this progress to colonize and siphon the world but that's how they gained power, that's a fact. 

So if you want to truly change the world you really should go out and expand your horizons instead of getting brainwashed through 3rd party sources. I didn't read that book, it might have some valuable ideas in there and it might just be you spouting bullshit and not the book but there is a problem here with you (and most of the anti-establishment people) with your high horse and low understanding. 

So why the fuck did I wrote all of this? Here: 

&gt; massive protests in Brazil and Turkey, which by even conservative estimates were probably the largest protests in human history. They happened in a relative flash and changed relatively nothing. In Turkey's case, a small public park is saved at the cost of new fascism. In Brazil's, possibly a new fascist leader who openly supports the military dictatorship. In all cases: continued or accelerated exploitation of the environment. 

Now unlike you, I have the honesty to admit that I don't know Brazil too much to be able to understand the real situation so I will refrain from bullshitting about it. However as someone who actually lives in Turkey and demonized by Western media I can say that you are incredibly wrong to the point of malicious intent.

This is a deep and complicated issue thanks to everything about Turkey in your stupid countries purposefully being presented with an agenda and mostly dead wrong, so I will not go into details unless you want me to (this is an old thread you can send a pm if you are curious) but I will just say this: the protests in Turkey were neither massive nor anti-establishment. Turkey is surprisingly a democratic country, more so than most countries even in EU and definitely US (post-coup quality of the democracy is going downhill tho) so the government really is a good representative of the middle lower class public. The ""massive"" protests you are talking about was establishment people demanding that we put democracy aside and give them their power back (as it always happened with coups in 1960 71 80 98). These are the same people who organized rallies that openly called for military intervention a year before the protests. It was never about a public park, it wasn't about democracy and it certainly wasn't middle-lower class people. Middle-lower classes in Turkey lives in the Eastern part of the country, where most of the public resistance to coup(2016) photos come from, not in the VERY MOST RICHEST DISTRICT IN TURKEY where the said park (Gezi Parkı btw) is located. 

I can and will post many sources here to validate the points above when I get to home. I will also add some Middle Eastern sources where even Arab Spring protesters were conflicted about the protests in Turkey because here we have Egypt protesting to establish a Turkey-like democracy (Mursi's own words) and then there is again protests in Turkey. I saw a lot of articles being shared warning Egyptians, Libyans, Syrians, Tunisia protesters to not misunderstand and support the Turkish protesters.

It actually goes pretty deep in some cases.

I definitely gotta side with the pitchfork writer on this one. First time saying that but that’s not at all how his lyrics come off. Especially with the lack of auto tune you’d have to be close to deaf to not hear the emotion coming out of his voice that’s riddled with pain. Yea he doesn’t make it complicated or sound fancy, he says it directly how it is. His voice is filled with the voice of someone struggling off of the same drugs he’s talking about. While drugs are fun they are also a hell. And his voice and music captures both sides of that instead of just one like most songs to hit you with the plain and ugly truth of things. 

&gt; the production and vocals represent some disgusting meeting between pop punk and hip hop

Disagree the samples were put in such a subtle way to where combined with trap beat and everything else they all flow and fit together perfectly. They did a good job picking the right samples to use as well like the guitar from the underoath  sample really added to the dark sound and emotion. 

&gt; It's a tacky nostalgia act,

&gt; any influence it’s had is only a bad thing for hip hop.

And this is just overactive and stupid. As someone who said peep sounds childish this just reads as some middle schooler trying to be edgy. Anything that pushes hip hop forward and evolves the sound isn’t a negative it’s literally a positive.

I understand that you think marketing can only work in one way - and that because you've worked in the field, you're magically capable of knowing what's marketing in a community video with absolutely no margin of error.

To me, that's comically arrogant and ignorant.

That doesn't mean you're wrong, however. As I already said, I think you're right that some of it is scripted.

The uncertainty is about exactly what is scripted and what's not.

However, if you actually watch the show for a minute and you forget what you THINK you know - you will notice Chris isn't actually looking at the teleprompter or reading from a script when he goes into his passionate in-depth answers.

That's why I'm saying I don't think his answers are scripted in any kind of detail. There's no way a guy that's so lacking in polish and presentation can memorize a script with that kind of content and deliver it perfectly.

So, to me, he comes off as genuine - and I don't think it's ""just marketing"".

Honestly, I don't think CIG are particularly good at marketing overall - and I don't think it's been a big priority for them.

Obviously, they're aware that a lot of people are ignorant of game development at this level by now - and they're starting to understand that they have to expect less of people and present things with a certain coat of ""marketing sugar"" to avoid the worst and most vocal whining.

Black Americans discuss black pride because they are generally unable due to tie their heritage or culture to a specific nation or ancestry *as a direct consequence of chattel slavery.* Even after slavery ended, American culture has minimized, dismissed or demonized  Black American culture as being anything from low brow and uncouth to inherently criminal.

He found, to his outrage, that whites were not prepared to give medical treatment to the blacks and even taunted them with lewd racist abuse while the Indian volunteers were treating them. He also discovered that the blacks whom they were treating had not been wounded in battle: some had been taken prisoners and flogged mercilessly, leaving festering sores. Others had not been involved in the protest but had been shot by the white soldiers 'by mistake'.

&gt;I have yet to find any racist quotes by Gandhi after 1906. If somebody knows of any between 1906 and 1914 (the year he left South Africa for India), I'd be very interested in seeing them. 

Brief Google comes up with the following:

&gt;Sept. 9, 1906: “Even the half-castes and Kaffirs, who are less advanced than we, have resisted the Government. The pass law applies to them as well, but they do not take out passes.”

&gt;June 4, 1907: “Are we supposed to be thieves or free-booters that even a Kaffir policeman can accost and detain us wherever we happen to be going?”

&gt;July 3, 1907: “Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised – the convicts even more so. They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals. Each ward contains nearly 50 to 60 of them. They often started rows and fought among themselves. The reader can easily imagine the plight of the poor Indian thrown into such company!”

&gt;Feb. 2, 1908: “The British rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that, like the Kaffirs who can be pleased with toys and pins, we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.”

&gt;Dec. 2, 1910: “Some Indians do have contacts with Kaffir women. I think such contacts are fraught with grave danger. Indians would do well to avoid them altogether.”

Edit: 1939: ""I have no doubt about the soundness of my advice. However much one may sympathise with the Bantus, Indians cannot make common cause with them.""

Mining isn't literally just running a computer as a electric heater in the middle of nowhere for no other reason than to make money. 


Mining is transaction monitoring, with a monetary reward for you using electrical power and computational power to do it, rather than a banks server farm as typical. It's basically akin to the difference between downloading a movie from Apple's or Google's server or downloading it from a peer-to-peer torrent network. 



If you actually want a valid comparison, you need to look at how much power the regular banking systems use for their servers farms, and the answer is also a fuck tonne. Anyone calling it ridiculous based on the total power usage for mining is clearly clueless and has never put a single thought into how much power say Visa or JPMorgan consumes. You'd need to compare some sort of kWh/USD or kgCO2eq/USD transferred figures to actually say anything.
