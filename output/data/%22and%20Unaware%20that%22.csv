If you are so unbelievably out of touch, insensitive, and unaware that you think it's okay to serve your son's mother divorce papers on his birthday, you shouldn't have custody of him.

You claim 

&gt;Only thing which have kept me sane is my little one. My country thinks custody of a baby under age of five should be given to their mother. And by my knowing of her, she wouldn't let me have any custody of child. Now when my son will turn 5, I can finally go to court for divorce and custody. 

If you cared about this boy, you'd never destroy his birthday and every birthday for the rest of his life by forcing him to remember the anniversary of the day his father asked his mom for a divorce. 

If you were a decent parent you would have known this intuitively. But you didn't. 

It didn't even occur to you.

You're using the kid and his birthday as leverage and you've chosen a time when your wife will be less able to protect her son from a man who would do that.

&gt;If the vaccine is the first Covid-like antigen you encounter, your future responses to similar antigens (vaccine or virus) are pre-programmed to mimick the first antibody response. Meaning you will keep your sub-par antibodies and will likely never produce robust immunity via natural infection.

Interesting. Do you have any data supporting this claim?

&gt;While it‘s true that the vaccine buys some time, it just delays the inevitable.

What does that mean? If you mean catching covid is inevitable, i agree absolutely. But you the catch covid with a 3 times higher chance of hospitalization which is not a good sign, neither for you organism nor for all of us paying the receips.

&gt;What we should be doing is early treatment and prophylaxis.

I am all for prophylaxis. Which prophylaxis you know costs less than $20. Can be produced for the whole world in under a year? Except the vaccine of course.

early treatment is only possible if the system is not overwhelmed. Where i live during the last wave they had to postpone surgeries for cancer patients, heart surgeries for children and tooth removals which need narcosis because they needed the intensive care units which are limited.
Of course we should treat everyone as early as possible, but what could we improve on that front?

&gt;The vaccine neither significantly lowers viral load, nor does it shorten the infectious stage by very much.

depends on your definition of ""significantly"" and ""very much"".
The data I have seen shows that it does according to the common definitions.

&gt;If anything it enhaces transmission bc vaccinated people are likely less -or asymptomatic and unaware that they are infectious.

This might be true in some cases, but also a large chunk of unvacvinated people are asymptomatic and spread itbthe same way. The pattern you describe does not in any form dominate the overall data.


&gt;Reinfection cases are unbelievably rare, as opposed to breakthrough infections.

And we all can be very happy for that. But would you say that people that expercience vaccine breakthroughs really develop weaker immunity than they would have otherwise?

"ho06itz","I have no intention of being rude, but you are not the one to say whether he is autistic or not, yet convince him into believing it

I am autistic. I got the diagnosis only after realising it myself. The first proffesional I reached out to told me that I was too intelligent, social and ""normal"" to be autistic. She called me manipulative for trying to trick her. Trust me, a lot of proffesionals themselves don't ubderstand autism and use outdated, incorrect and hurtful information. Many people don't believe me when I say that I am autistic, since they all see it as some tragic, horrible illness that makes us unable to function and be ""normal"". Neurotypical people generally refuse to understand autism, so I'll make it easier:

Autism is not an illness. Even so, it is a disability

Autism is not inherently bad or good. It's not a disease nor a gift. It just is. It's a neurodevelopmental condition that we are born with, but many go undiagnosed and unaware that they are autistic. It is a difference of the way we function, think and feel. We consider it to be a variation of a brain's function, rather than an abnormality. We may communicate, behave or think in a different way to most people, and in a world that is not built for us and refuses to accomodate and accepts us the way we are, we struggle. We do struggle a lot.

Books, media, proffesional education on the matter of autism can be very wrong in many ways. If you want to know about autism, ask autistic people. It is that simple. No one can know better than us

And the person themselves knows the best if they are autistic or not. I could've believed the psychiatrist I first visited and spent my whole life thinking I was just being manipulative when I was sure that I was autistic. It is part of our identity, I knew I was autistic, so I looked for other psychiatrist and everything made sense to him

Believe him. And be there for him as he dicovers all the things about himself. He will appreciate it

I am sorry this comment is too long, and I am sorry if I sounded aggressive. I don't shame you for calling it a disease or not believing your cousin.

You know, just because his instructor suggests he take this girl out doesn't mean he is obligated. It is not his job to entertain other girls, and the teacher could be trying to set them up in a way, thinking they could have lots in common and unaware that you are in the picture. If you are uncomfortable, he shouldn't even entertain it. He should inform the teacher and the girl that he has a girlfriend and doesn't feel it is appropriate to take this girl out without his girlfriend present, because he doesn't want to risk his relationship.

Sit down with him and discuss this. Express your fears and what you feel is appropriate within your relationship. Tell him your boundaries (what you are ok with and what you are not). If him taking out another girl during the whole week you are gone seems too much, tell him that you are not ok with it and he needs to cancel those plans for the sake of the relationship. Mean it. Because if he disregards your feelings, spends the entire week bonding with her, and perhaps developing an infatuation with her, that could be the end of your relationship.

The appropriate response to the teacher would have been if he immediately said ""Let me discuss it with my girlfriend first"". That would have told the instructor that he is in a relationship and that they was crossing boundaries into his personal life. Tell him you are uncomfortable by the whole idea and want him to tell them that taking out another girl is inappropriate and disrespectful to his relationship.

If he doesn't want you there, it could be a red flag.

When that night came, he was not gentle with me at all and didn’t make me feel safe or good with him at all despite him saying he would.

"hlxas18","When I was growing up, one of the things that I recognized that I had a deep desire to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and myself.

While I was growing up, one of the things that I recognized is that it was really important to me to feel good and not feel bad. And it's important for me to look good and not look bad. And it's important for me to be considered wise and aware. Cuz I really bad don't want to be unwise and unaware. I'm convinced that someday I'm going to do something really stupid and it's going to kill me.

I recognize these three very important desires is being all based in a survival strategy. As long as I'm not feeling bad, looking bad or being unwise and unaware, I know that I'm going to feel good and safe and I'm going to stay alive.

Later on I started to recognize that there are certain things I could think about. Certain thought patterns. And certain ways of behaving that had the ability to hinder, limit or eliminate my ability to walk in the type of freedom I mentioned at the beginning.

I even figured out that there are certain thoughts, thought patterns and behaviors that I could engage in that could either, make me feel bad, look bad and be unwise and unaware. Or could help me feel good, look good and be wiser and more aware.

And I got that life, with all these variables could be complicated. But even recognizing that it was complicated, was a thought as well as a thought pattern, that actually was a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words the more complicated I thought life was, the more complicated it seemed to be. And the whole time I was just wanting to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and myself. And then I started seeing that I was getting in my own way for being able to enjoy that freedom. And then because I was feeling bad about one thing, I would try to feel good in another way. And too often I saw that whenever I tried to feel good in another way, just trying to overcome feeling bad about something, I usually ended up making more mistakes than solving problems.

Now here's why I said all this...

Everything that I just mentioned is talked about in Scripture.

My desire to experience the freedom to cause and create something wonderful for others and myself, scripture lets us know that this desire comes straight from the Holy Spirit. It's given to you just like your eye color is given to you and your height is given to you. And your parents are giving to you. This desire comes directly from God himself.

And it turns out that the desire to stay away from feeling bad looking bad and being considered unwise and unaware, that is a survival strategy. Tied directly to our physical body. In scripture this is known as the flesh. And in Scripture, or informed that it is this part of us that can get in the way of us being able to enjoy the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and ourselves.

And it turns out those thought patterns, those thoughts and those things that we do, those are the things they get in the way of us enjoying the freedom I keep talking about. And in Scripture, it gives us ideas on how to overcome these types of thoughts and these types of actions they get in our way.

The lessons that are available to us start in Genesis chapter 3. And they run through the entire New Testament. And scripture calls them instructions in righteousness. If it had a different name, it could be called instructions on how to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and yourself.

A lot of people view scripture as a book of what they have to do and what they're not allowed to do. I don't look at scripture that way at all. Not even a little bit.

I like a scripture as being an instruction manual on how to live my life so that my thoughts, my thought patterns and the things I do with my body, constantly support my desire to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people than myself.

That's the tip of the iceberg. I've never found any other type of writing, sacred or otherwise, they gave me such clear instructions on how to live a life where I am not subject to the circumstances in the situations that life can throw at me. Which means, I get to walk in what I consider to be a pretty high level of freedom. Of course I recognize that there's higher levels of freedom that I'll never be able to walk in. But it turns out that I'm pretty happy with the level of freedom I get to enjoy.

I've been enjoying this kind of freedom for 25 of my 60 years. My only wish, is I wish I'd been able to start sooner.

As a side thought....

Science is the study of the stuff that surrounds us. What I have found in Scripture, is an instruction manual that allows me to experience the freedom that I really want to experience no matter what my surroundings are.",1637775257,"cuz i really bad don't want to be unwise and unaware.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0

"hl89jt7","My roommate broke our bong over the summer so rather than spending $100 on a nice new bong I decided to spend the money on a desktop vaporizer. Ended up with a DaBuddha vaporizer that costed me $115 on sale (just checked the prices and it looks more between $150 and $200 now). Pretty much exclusively use it for smoking herb now and it's just a way better smoking experience than a bong or a pipe. You can really taste the flavor of the weed when compared to smoking and i have noticeably less nasty flem than I did when using the bong. Everyone I've used this thing with is like ""I gotta get one of these"". Another big perk is you can use the vaporized bud again to make edibles. First time I tried I want sure how much so I just put a tablespoon in some cookie dough and went for it. Took longer to hit than a dispo edible but boy was I ripped once I kicked in.

In my experience though I ended up smoking more once I got the vaporizer than I did before. A big part of this is just the convenience of it. I don't smoke in my house so I gotta go outside and usually wouldn't smoke during the day (lots of families and little kids in the neighborhood around and I'm not trynna by that guy tokein on the porch all day). The vape isn't nearly as smelly as smoking so I started just using it inside. This led to me smoking a lot more casually than I had been previously. I also just have more stamina for hitting the vape consistently than I would for hitting a pipe or a bong. Don't really get those nasty deep coughing rips like you can get when your smoking. If you're already pretty responsible about your weed usage and not worried about it I'd say definitely send it but for me personally it started to become a problem in terms of my usage. I've started working on cutting back but I was definitely in a haze there for awhile and unaware that I was becoming so dependent.

It's incredible how you're the only person who went after this dude for being ""in the wrong"", yet multiple people have pointed out your the one wrong, yet you think all of them are wrong, going so far as to call me socially inept for pointing out your inability to literally do the damn thing you told him to do.

"hki0317","I'm going to give you a brief overview.

I learned that the desire I have to experience the freedom to cause and create something wonderful for other people in myself, is the same desire that the Holy Spirit has for my life.

I learned that there are thoughts and thought patterns as well as behaviors that can hinder, limit and even eliminate my ability to experience this Holy Spirit desire I have in my life. And that these hindering factors, are called sins.

I learned that my desire to feel good and not feel bad. To look good and not look bad. And my desire to be considered wise and aware while avoiding being considered unwise and unaware, that only comes from my body. And could be considered my body's survival strategy. But all of it's covered with in scripture. I didn't know that.

I learned that one of the ways to see that were created in God's image, could be expressed this way.

God is a creative being who creates with his words. Who created, creative beings who create with their words.

I learned how important it is for humans to cause and create things. I learned how far-reaching this desire actually is. And that it's possible to cause and create wonderful things. But it's also possible to cause and create things that are not so wonderful.

I learned that the very first word in the Bible, also contains the plan of salvation. That the name of God, also contains direct references to the work of the Messiah and the work of the Holy Spirit. I wasn't expecting that.

I also learned that what I had always been taught four types and shadows and prophecies in the Old Testament, can also be seen as an instruction manual for Jesus's life.

And the last thing I'll mention. I found 10 things that showed up after Adam and Eve's tree experience I give up wonderful picture of what it is to be human. And what shows up when humans start to do their very human thing. But I also learned that 90% of the teachings that Jesus gave us, were designed specifically to undo the thoughts and the thought processes as well as the behaviors, of what shows up when we start to behave like Adam and Eve did.

And because I know how unclear that is I'll say it this way.

After the tree Adam and Eve we're more than willing to blame anybody but themselves for what they did. And what Jesus teaches is that we are to take responsibility for your own actions. It turns out you can't cast blame on others and at the same time take responsibility for your own actions. These two ideas are usually exclusive.

The last thing I learned was that if you understand Genesis chapter 3, the rest of the entire Bible makes a lot more sense.",1636836569,"and my desire to be considered wise and aware while avoiding being considered unwise and unaware, that only comes from my body.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0

Alison was NOT in any way out of sorts though. She was sober and in control the entire time. She knew Emily was delirious, and could see her losing consciousness when she initiated the kiss. Emily did not initiate it or give any indication that this was what she wanted, even in the moment. Emily was not even conscious of the fact that this was really Alison, being both delirious and Alison perpetuating the belief that she was dead by not revealing herself to be alive, thereby pretending to be a hallucination of sorts in order to take advantage of Emily's vulnerable state.

Paige didn't lie to her. She didn't trick her so she could get a kiss. All she did was be there. And yet you choose to believe that Paige was further in the wrong here than Alison.

"hhmywq3","Unpopular opinion, but NAH - he's clearly dealing with some severe trauma regarding babysitters. He needs to work on this, not only for the sake of your relationship, but for his kids as well.

[Trauma changes the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181836/) and so, to an extent, his responses to situations involving babysitters is a result of this trauma being triggered which causes him to essentially RELIVE IT. [This is biologically valuable because trauma helps animals learn how to survive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792048/) \- but this is really out of balance with most modern circumstances humans find themselves in within a largely safe society. 

So when it comes to the idea of leaving a loved one in the care of a babysitter, he is triggered and reflexively defending against re-experiencing that traumatizing event. Imagine if he relented and something DID happen to the child? This would only reinforce the trauma and his behavior, and it may cause him to take more extreme responses. Because he is both terrified and UNAWARE that he is terrified - [and fear impairs our ability to think rationally](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/202007/how-does-fear-influence-risk-assessment-and-decision-making). 

So speaking rationally to him isn't going to convince him to not be afraid - because his rationality is already impaired by the topic and his brain is already hardwired to respond to this topic in fear-based ways - fight, flight (avoidance), and freeze (hoping the topic will go away or ""hiding"").

The only way to deal with this is for him to recognize he needs help, and that begins either with seeing a therapist about his trauma, or recognizing the [signs of distorted thinking](https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/).

&amp;#x200B;

This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and no one is really to blame here. The only thing that can be done is to focus on how this impacts his mental health, and how he might be modeling unhealthy behavior to his children because of his trauma without ever realizing it. So to be a good dad, he needs to deal with his own emotional health. He needs to set the example for his kids that when you understand you have experienced trauma, just like when you break an arm, you need to see a medical professional to make sure it is ""healing"" properly.

"hh66mb4","I can’t quite pin it. It’s surreal to me. We have countless vaccines, medicines, pills, treatments etc. for all kinds of illness and people trust their doctor just fine and have so their whole lives. 

Now the medical field which they were comfortable with the last few decades, suddenly they’re evil and their medicine is poison and the devil himself made the vaccine? Wtf?

I personally don’t think it has anything to do with masks or the vaccine. These are symbols through which people project our growing collective divide. Our society has gone through a lot, especially over the last 20 years. Terrorism, wars, financial crises, diminishing purchasing power, environmental fears, drug epidemics, racism, mass shootings, and now a pandemic. All on top of an ever-divided political aisle.

People lack both the intelligence and the platform to express their frustrations in a constructive matter that will be listened to. That combination means the expression to want change gets perverted into fanatical, nonsensical, and fruitless efforts. Namely, not wanting to wear a mask or take a vaccine to preserve your freedom. Pure irrationality.

Honestly, i think it is a cry for help when these people dismantle their life to avoid a vaccine. And not the whiny til you video “blah blah please feel sorry for me because I’m a fucking dumbass” kind of cry for help. Rather these people are so deeply uncentered, ungrounded and unaware that they use the mandate as a means to release the emotion that they’ve had built up inside caused by other unaddressed issues. 

It’s like when someone is having a bad day, but they are keeping it together. Then when they get home, they drop their mail in the gutter water and just lose their shit finally and get upset and swear and start letting out all the frustration from the day. The mail getting dropped is arbitrary. Not a big deal. But it is the straw that broke the camel’s back to released all of the negative emotions.

That’s all masks and mandates are. They are arbitrary and meaningless symbols. It’s just people don’t have the capacity to express their suffering or seek help in clear ways, so instead they project onto something arbitrary that isn’t the cause of the emotional flailing, it’s just the trigger of something deeper.

People just lack awareness to realize this projection and recognize their unhappiness stems from somewhere else. A person ought to focus on finding what that true source of unhappiness is and less time pretending like masks and vaccines are evil.",1634600982,"rather these people are so deeply uncentered, ungrounded and unaware that they use the mandate as a means to release the emotion that they’ve had built up inside caused by other unaddressed issues.","ungrounded and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"ungrounded and unaware","ungrounded",NA,NA,0
"hh5p6j4","On many exit ramps, you should still slow down to at least close to the advisory speed. On some of them a regular car can go much faster, but that is not always the case. Many exit ramp are tight or decreasing radius and require caution from all cars.
        
This is a sensitive topic for me, I'll admit. My cousin was in the ""the exit ramps have the same speed limit as the road"" camp for a while. He did not have a tippy vehicle, in fact, he drove a Nissan 300ZX.

I'd like to think that we can all agree that cat calling, approaching women walking alone at night, and similar behaviour is inappropriate. Not sure the word ""inappropriate"" goes far enough.  I'm a dude and I don't want people doing either of those things to me, either.

I see two kinds of problematic behaviour involved, though. In OP's case it was probably someone that is socially awkward and unaware that it was inappropriate. In the case of the guys approaching girls at night... I tend to think those guys are self-centered jerks -- the guys that think women ""owe"" them a response.

That said, thinking about it now,  I can see how the dynamic could be interpreted poorly. You're both getting on the bus. He saw where you got on, and where you got off.

"hgc9db4","One of the things I've been working on has everything to do with this messy world of subjective experiences.

Part 1. That everybody has a desire to experience the freedom to cause and create something wonderful for others and ourselves.

Part 2. At a certain age, we start to realize that there are certain thought patterns and certain things that we can do that can hinder, limit or eliminate our ability to experience this level of freedom.

Part 3. As toddlers, we start to experience and develop the desire that says feeling good is good and feeling bad is bad.

As young teenagers, we start to experience and develop the desire  that says looking good is good and looking bad is bad. It's even good to associate ourselves with that which looks good and bad to associate ourselves with that which looks bad. And this experience is built on top of the first experience that makes sure we feel good.

As a young adult we start to experience and develop the desire that says it is good to be wise and aware and it is bad to be unwise and unaware. This is built on top of the first two desires. And we will take the rest of our lives trying to figure this one out. Especially when circumstances and situations come at us and change up what challenges are facing.

In my previous response I mentioned the first two parts. So I want to say more about this part 3.

Not only do we develop the general desires to feel good, look good and be wise and aware, but we also as individuals, develop very specific survival techniques that allow us to overcome the first time we ever feel bad, look bad, and realize we are unwise and unaware. 

These individual survival strategies become a part of who you are. They are personal to you. And to recognize that already working within you, all you have to do is take a look inside.

When I was five I was made of fun of and it felt bad. I decided that I would rather be laughed with than laughed at. So I chose to use a strategy that I was familiar with. And that was being funny. So I made the class laugh with me. My first strategy was humor to survive when I was feeling bad. Being funny now is a part of my personality traits. But more specifically it's part of my survival strategy.

At age 12, I was made fun of again. It felt bad. And I used my humor to laugh it off. But they were laughing at my looks. And I didn't understand what it was about my looks that would have them laugh at me. I remember deciding that I needed to figure out why they were laughing at me. So I used one of the tools I was familiar with. And that tool was being intelligent. So I chose being smart as a survival strategy. Within 6 months I had already memorized against a book of world records. Just to practice getting to know things. Remembering things. And being able to utilize the things that I remembered and had learned. Being smart became a part of my personality traits. But more importantly it became part of my survival technique.

As a young adult, I lost three very important people in my life. My fiance of two and a half years. And my two roommates. I had done something to mess everything up. It felt bad. I sure didn't look good having everybody walk away from you. And I was an idiot because I had been unwise and unaware that my actions were going to cause such a disaster. What I saw was that I had been being harsh and mean. I chose to be nice. I knew how to be nice. But now it was more important to be nice more than ever. Becoming a nice guy became a part of my personality traits. But more importantly it became a part of my survival strategy.

I'm fully convinced that these experiences, is subjective as they are, our common to everybody. In 25 years filled with counseling, teaching, and working with individuals with the understandings of parts 1, 2 and 3, I've been able to get people to recognize what controls them. Which is the survival strategies. I've been able to get people to keep these survival strategies, while developing other strategies that have them move forward in life. Because it is these strategies that have a tendency to hinder our ability to experience the freedom we're all looking for.

It also turns out, and this is one of the most important aspects in this particular response. It turns out that our survival strategies, is what has us decide what we claim to be good and what we claim to be as bad.

And the concept here is exceedingly simple. If something makes us feel good, look good and be considered wise and aware. Then it's good. And if something makes us feel bad, look bad and be considered unwise and unaware, then it is bad.

Now obviously when you get into the studies of it it gets more complicated. But that is the basics of how it works.

All our concepts of fairness, Justice, selfishness, selflessness, even our ideas of being altruistic, are all found in these 3 parts of what I call the messy world of subjective experiences.

I don't think I've said anything controversial. I think I've said things that everybody relates to. I think what I've said are things that you can look in your own life and see as being the case. There might be some nuances, that would actually end up being covered in teaching or training once you start getting into the subject matter.

Alright. I asked because

&gt;In the past I have attached quickly and then found out things that I don't like, and continued pushing through anyway in spite of it. Even getting into relationships. Then later I worry because we're not aligned meanwhile they're happy and unaware that something is bothering me even when I express it.

&gt;But I've grown a lot since then and concluded that it's better to just be upfront about the things that are important to me rather than just read between the lines all the time whilst people pleasing.

This is an issue of boundries and I'm glad to hear that you've worked on it. Stating your needs and/or what bothers you is good! 

But there is a difference between being upfront and going too fast. Asking someone 1. why they're dating (are they looking for something casual or long term?) and saying you're looking for a more long term relationship is different than 2. stating WHAT you'd like long term. Even assuming she's not dating casually, you don't even know if she likes you like that yet! And that is a conversation you have to wait to have until you've gotten a good rythmn down, and know you both like each other. And definitely should have sober. 

I mean that advice in general. My suggestion about not taking things for granted applies to that (not assuming what people want from their future, or that they'd be in your future at all). When we take things for granted we rush to do what we want/think instead of remembering to ask for and consider other people's needs

People can and certainly *do* judge people on whatever basis they choose.

My basis is no authoritarians. An authoritarian is somebody who cannot handle dissenting opinions, and cannot simply have friendly disagreements.

My criteria are not explicitly political in nature, but it may not surprise you to learn that it frequently means I filter out lots of authoritarian conservatives and progressives alike. People who are ignorant and unaware that, in general, everybody is just trying to live their best life. People who believe that when somebody disagrees with them, it is because they are stupid or evil.

In general, I am filtering out good people who make other good people out to be monsters, just so that they can feel better about treating them badly.

Look at my downvotes. I got those by making a very mild statement about evidence. Look at your diatribe. That's because I touched a nerve.

I look for *curiosity*, not judgement. A curious person would have asked me to clarify. Instead, you told me how I'm wrong for believing what I believe-- Beliefs, by the way, you know nothing about.

To be clear, I don't think you're a bad person. I don't think most authoritarians are overall bad people. But authoritarianism is certainly a bad habit.

"heoafav","&gt;in many ways gender is meaningless, but our society doesn’t treat it as such

Right. Because a very short time ago gender and sex were the same thing. We treated people differently due to sex realistically.

&gt;Truly, it’s the lack of social acceptance that causes most of trans people’s problems.

Ok but what if I told you that you aren't guaranteed social acceptance? I mean do you accept conservatives? 

&gt;To build more on the race aspect of this conversation, I’m going to deconstruct your appeal to the black communities you’ve interacted with. Like every aspect of our society, the issues hat plague it often intersect with each other. People of color are perfectly capable of perpetuating other aspects of discrimination. Homophobia, anti-semitism, misogyny, and all kinds of bigotry can be found in certain pockets of these communities across the states. It’s also worth noting that black people are capable of reinforcing their own oppression, especially if they’re in a higher economic class. Although that isn’t the only factor.

They can also be anti-white, hate men, hate Christians etc. All sorts of bigotry people are susceptible to. But you only see it when it applies minority groups.

&gt;I can imagine that the people you’ve interacted with may hold some problematic views

Literally all I said was that they are less left wing than you imagine. If that is problematic to you, take it up with them I guess. Tell them they ain't black if they ain't a democrat or something. They'll love it I promise you. 

&gt; I would suggest you talk with more members of the community and see what they think of police brutality, systemic racism, and other subjects we’ve discussed here around race.

"hea4ew7","I want to distinguish two different things and then I'll give you my advice.

Going on within you right now you have a huge desire to experience the freedom to cause and create something wonderful for other people and yourself. This desire comes straight from the Holy Spirit. And it is your own spirit's desire. It just so happens that the holy spirit's desire and your desire are identical.

You have another set of desires going out within you. You have a desire to feel good and not feel bad. You have a desire to look good and not look bad. And you have a desire to be wise and aware and not be unwise and unaware.

This is an explanation of your fleshly desires. There's nothing wrong with these particular fleshly desires. It's only when we start to feel bad, look bad or be considered unwise and unaware, that we run the risk of allowing sin to enter into a life.

You've also already figured out that there are certain ways of thinking, and certain things you can do, that can interfere, and limit or eliminate your ability to experience the freedom you're looking to experience. And in every case these limitations are sourced from your flesh. (This is covered in James 1:14 Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.)

So this is my advice.

It's your job to discern what's going on. Are you simply licking your wounds because your feelings have been hurt? Are you concerned that you look bad? Are you afraid that other people consider you to be unwise and unaware, or not wise enough or aware enough?

Cuz these come from your flesh. And if you recognize this is something that's coming from your flesh, now you know the appropriate action to take. And you don't need my advice.

The other thing to discern, is are you upset, because what you want to experience is the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and yourself? Even more specifically, are you desiring to experience the freedom to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for others and yourself?

These desires are all about what it is to be a Christian. What it is to fulfill your purpose while you're here. This is where we get the motivation and the instinct to produce the fruits of the Holy Spirit. When you're doing this, then you can say that you're doing it for the least of these my brethren. When you doing this this is when you can recognize that you're visiting the orphan and the widow and the reflection and your religion can be considered perfect.

If you recognize this is what's going on with you, when you don't need my advice. And you already know the appropriate action to take.

You have my prayers, my support, and my understanding. What you're going through isn't fun. But all of it is necessary.",1632612842,"and you have a desire to be wise and aware and not be unwise and unaware.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0
"he8egok","You've got two major different sets of desires going on within us.

Your body's desire, is to make sure that it does not die. It accomplishes this by making sure that it is feeling good, looking good and being wise and aware.

The moment the body starts to feel bad, look bad and see that it's being unwise and unaware, the body will do everything in his power to get back to feeling good, looking good and being wise and aware.

In contrast, you also have a huge desire to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and yourself.

This is a spiritual desire. And it is described in scriptures coming directly from the Holy Spirit. 

And it turns out that there is an overlap of what the body desires and what the spirit desires. In other words as long as you're feeling good, looking good and being wise and aware, you're probably also experiencing the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and yourself.

It is only when the body starts to feel bad look bad and be considered unwise and unaware, that you've run into a chance that instead of following the desires of your spirit you end up following the desires of your body.

What scripture is talking about giving up your will, it is very specifically talking about giving up your will to survive. That part of you that is doing everything in his power to make sure it does not feel bad, look bad and be considered unwise and unaware.

but because the desire to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people on your cells is exactly the same desire that the Holy Spirit has for your life, there's nothing about your will that needs to be giving up concerning this desire.

Now if it was just as easy as being able to always discern between the two desires, life would be sweet simple and easy.

But it takes some training to figure out am I trying to produce something wonderful for my family by working 120 hours a week so that I can get rich? Is that actually walking in freedom? Or not?

And this is where a scripture lets us know that we are to test all things and figure out what stuff works and what stuff doesn't work. What stuff is good and what stuff is not so good.

"h7n8nrp","Try and get swabbed while you still have the bump. It gives your best chance of seeing whether you have it or not. If not in a few weeks go get a blood test done (the longer you wait, the more accurate your score typically. Though you should try and get it in a reasonable time). Make sure the doctor doesn’t diagnose by eye, it’s not accurate whatsoever. And make sure you find a doctor or clinic (I went into a walk in clinic) who will check you even if it looks “normal” or you have no bumbs. Also keep in mind a blood test only test for antibodies (as herpes is not in your blood but on in the “infected” area). It won’t tell you the location you have it. Make sure when you get it swabbed or have a blood test that you are informed of both types (hsv 1 which is more common on the mouth and known as coldsores but can also be spread to the genitals and hsv2 more commonly found on the genitals and rare on the mouth) and if you have one, the other, both, or none. You may find you already have type 1 as it’s aften asymptomatic and we get it from relatives or parents who have kissed us as children. Type 1 is no different than 2 but for some reason doesn’t get as much flack (as it’s not typically related to the genitals I presume). Regardingless, having either doesn’t make you a nasty person and doesn’t make you a different person. 

In the meantime, don’t have sex. Just to be safe. Another thing you can do is just research what HSV (herpes is), what’s it’s like to have it, and how it spreads etc…. In the case you do have it, it’ll help you come to terms faster and learn that it’s common and easy be managed (if it even has to be). If you don’t have it, it’ll educate you on the matter, help you know how to not contract it, how to go about screening your future partners (it’s not typically on full sti screening and people are often asymptomatic and unaware that they have it), and helps one de-stigmatize it and alter your views on it.

Fortunately, they now have to give a minimum of 10 hours in between shifts (still not enough for minimum) and that supervisor isn’t in charge of actual scheduling anyway.

Screw CLOPENING, should be illegal.

These jobs do nothing to help you progress in life anyway. 40 hours for $400 a week, TOPS. Such a ridiculous fight to get our $2 hazard pay back.

One of the managers made a “joke” to another employee asking about pay, saying “Let me guess, $10 an hour isn’t enough for you, you want $20, right?”

Other stores are voluntarily raising their own minimum wage to $15+ an hour, which does make them harder to get into because of “competition”. 

Supposedly US federal minimum wage would be $23 or $24 an hour if it had kept up with inflation.

Still too high, because that’s SOCIALISM????? Fine, but you must still agree that $7.25 SINCE 2009 (12 years!) is super toxicly stagnant, right?

The ENTIRE POINT of working is to BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE!!!!!!

Dumbasses saying “You’ll become more conservative as you get older, you’ll get out of your “socialism” mindset.”

First of all, you right-wing red-fear mongerers, don’t even know WTF “socialism” actually means. SECOND, learning just how unfair society really is has done nothing but push me further left.

And most of our Democrats who make it into presidency are still too conservative, they’re still too capitalist. Right-wing Democrats.

Real progressives don’t get a chance (Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders). 

We just get these outdated boomers who are completely ignorant and unaware that everything has CHANGED.

They’re allowing corporations to get away with it, because those corporate bastards KNOW that these boomers are too STUPID to realize that things have gotten worse, and so they continue to allow the corporations to be the ones really running the country.

I see some jobs on Indeed still ADVERTISING $7.25 an hour!!!!! IN THE PANDEMIC!!!! WHILE MANY PLACES ARE VOLUNTARILY RAISING PAY!!!!! The single digit minimum wage needs to die!!!!!

And these dumbass boomers cry (seen it in person in my store) “NOBODY WANTS TO WORK ANYMORE!!!!!” because they’re COMPLETELY missing the point WHY people are refusing to work.

COVID unemployment paid more than a lot of fulltime jobs. Pissed me the fuck off. Not that unemployment paid $600+ a week, but that minimum wage won’t raise up to or past that level.

$600 divided by 40 is $15 by the way, coincidence??? Seems like a trial for the $15 minimum wage to me.

These dumbass greedy fucks try to guilt us into wanting higher pay, because they want us to feel “guilty” and “ashamed” for wanting to be paid a living wage.

We’re just serving rich elitists who make more money than anyone will EVER NEED IN MULTIPLE LIFETIMES!!!!

And FFS, we can’t even get health insurance without working, and that can even be a fight to get, all these BS number of hour requirements, and then all that “meet your deductible BS”, and “hospitals can give the absolute minimum of care, if not outright turn you away”, and if they treat you at all, you’re still getting a 5, 6, possibly even 7 FIGURE BILL AFTERWARDS!!!!!

Just remember, even the rights we have today, only exist because of violence. We won’t get fair equality by peaceful protesting. It’s fucked up, but it’s true.

And when people have NOTHING TO LOSE, they aren’t going to give a FUCK about “listening to authority”, or if they’re even pointing a gun at us and threatening to shoot us, sometimes that’s what people WANT.

But you know, instead of dying, if this society can’t het better, I would like to just live to watch it completely collapse.

"h63hpix","CW if it isn't obvious by the topic of this thread: discussion of rape.

Firstly, for the sake of pedantry, in most U.S. states (where I'm presuming they're from, but maybe I'm wrong) it is illegal to have sex with someone under the age of consent, which usually is between 16 and 18 years old. In some states, a 17 year old who has sex with a 15 year old is guilty of statutory rape and could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, even if both parties claim to have consented. In some, a more specific age difference is defined, such as a difference of at least 5 years.

The person's language is vague, but if they claim they were a minor (so, depending on state, either up to 15 years old or up to 17 years old) and claim to have had sex with an adult (usually perceived as being over 18 at youngest or over 21), then it is not outside reasonability to suppose that the person is implying they had sex with someone that was likely at least 3 years or older than them when the victim was under the age of consent.

It does not matter if the person brags about it, if they considered themselves to be consenting, or otherwise; legally, they are defined to have been raped.

Further, speaking in terms of social development and social structures, adults are usually going to be stronger, have more finances, have more institutional power, and otherwise have more leverage against a victim to such a degree that informed and authentic sexual consent is impossible. Generally, we as a society have deemed it to be the case that, for instance, anyone of 16 years old or younger can't have informed consent to have sex with an adult over the age of 21. In some states, minors cannot consent to sex with anyone more than a year older. In some states, minors cannot consent to anyone above the age of consent but can within a range below it. But, generally speaking, there is a very clear trend in terms of both legislation and social norms.

Further, rape victims, regardless of gender or situation, can be manipulated into not considering themselves initially to have been raped. As someone whose family works in social work, and who myself has helped multiple friends get out of abusive relationships were they were raped and only came to identify it later *because* their friends helped them realize it by telling them, it is, putting it very generously for you, incredibly flawed and misled to claim that if the victim doesn't ""identify as a rape victim"" that they weren't raped. Rape victims are subjected to manipulation and abuse such that, often times, they can't initially verbalize or identify that they were raped. Be better than that. There is no excuse for rape of any kind. Doesn't matter if they claim to have enjoyed it, doesn't matter if they don't ""identify as a rape victim"", doesn't matter if they were unconscious and unaware that it happened; there was no informed consent, and in the case of the screenshot above, there was no possibility for informed consent due to the difference in age and consequently power and development.

It was like.. I had no outlet at all. No wonder I zoned out for hours on my computer or in a video game. I remember that was all my life pretty much besides school and the fake holiday celebration stuff. I was still excited to get gifts but I always had these conflicting feelings like I was numb or that it was the one time I could feel a little more safe, knowing that people are expected to be positive on a holiday. I never felt like I was genuinely happy inside though.. It was like no matter what.. I just felt this emptiness. I always felt on guard and if it was like a big celebration that involved relatives, I would just feel uncomfortable and like an outsider..

It would be so jarring to see how they act in front of people outside of the family and then within. =/ And this is like.. me being a 11 year old kid just quietly observing everything going on and not comfortable being myself.. whatever that meant.. I guess.. just being able to express myself? It's so weird growing up and not having anyone you truly feel comfortable talking to or confiding in.. and even if it wasn't for something deep on a personal level and just wanting to ask for a small favour..

I always tried to find the person that seemed the least upset but if everyone was upset then... I just internalized it and dealt with it alone...)

Now when I look back, I could see that it would be hard for my siblings to help me with anything when they weren't helped themselves and were also neglected.. so yeah...

"gzy60od","&gt;So, I should let my child burn their hand because they won’t listen to   
me about not touching the fire? Or smack their hand? Both results would   
be considered punishment would they not?

When a person is so unconscious and unaware that they are likely to seriously harm themselves without intervention, then it is reasonable to most people to take action to change their activity. This does not need to take the form of punishment. Moving someone's hand away from fire is not likely to cause pain and any pain caused would be likely far less than the fire would cause. Pain minimisation is a motive in the action, rather than cause of pain. If someone seems to only respond to physical pain as a method of learning then it is wise to explore why the person is not receptive to learning through other means, rather than simply justifying further pain.  


&gt;my student makes the choice not to learn the material and I make the   
choice not to give them credit. I could punish them with extra work. Or   
let them fail, which would also be considered punishment

If a person chooses of their own free will to not participate in the class work then perhaps it is appropriate to ask why they are there in the first place? Are they there against their will? If so, then no amount of punishment is going to take them on a learning or emotional journey that will make them want to be present. If anything it is more likely to cause them to be upset, possibly bottling it up and then lashing out later against someone else. The massive number of school shooting in the US is relevant here.

"gyoxowr","You're right that in hindsight I would not take this project on but it wasn't really that I couldn't handle the project. The issue was that I was given mixed messages - should I lead the project or should I follow orders? I would love to have led the project and done it my way - then it would have gotten done much more quickly. But my boss didn't trust me with the project because I was new, so he told me to follow orders from a principal dev. 

The principal dev had an absolutely stupid approach to the project but I didn't feel that I had the authority to overrule him although I questioned him multiple times but he kept reiterating to do it his way. 

I had finished coding in 4 weeks, which was the deadline listed on the card. So in my eyes I hit the deadline. But after you finish coding you review it with the product team and at this meeting they gave me a whole new set of changes because they changed their mind and didn't like the original spec. 

I told my boss this happened at the sprint meeting and he is so aloof and unaware that he didn't remember. Then he had a meeting with the CEO and suddenly he's freaking out about this project when two days ago he barely even remembered it existed. 

He typed in a very urgent way ""WHAT IS THE STATUS ON THIS PROJECT? IT'S TAKING WAY TOO LONG!"" I reminded him that I told him that I had finished and had the QA meeting and that there were brand new change requests that I was working on. He doesn't even give responses when I say things like that - he just leaves me hanging??? Most I can hope for is a thumbs up emoji. I have no clue if what I'm saying is getting through to him.

Then the next two weeks he blamed me for the dumb approach of the project as if he wasn't the one to tell me to follow the other principal dev.

In reality in that last two weeks I was working on what is essentially a new project, but my boss sees it as taking longer on the old one. We have casual discussions about how long it should take and I'm sorry but it's impossible for me to say. Looking back I could have not taken this project, and I could have been less optimistic in my estimates, but what is a managers job? Are they supposed to do anything other than hire people and fire people based on whether a singular project gets done, having no idea about the internal details about what's going on? I can self reflect all I want and I have, but this is partly on him as well. Why is it my job to estimate how long this project should take when he's the one who is familiar with the codebase top to bottom with years of experience and I am still discovering the codebase as a new dev?

"gxiubfz","If I had the ability to hug your neck right now I'd do it. Your response here is so unbelievably insightful. And you're doing yourself a huge favor by paying attention to what's going on with you. And you're willingness to recognize what's going on with you will give you a leg up and figuring out how to get rid of all of these horrible experiences you're going through.

One of the reasons why God offers us forgiveness for everything that's happened in our past is so that we can simply let go of the past. The difficulty is is that we have spent a lifetime relying on the past to inform us how to best approach our future. It is simple survival mentality to learn from our past to prepare us for our future.

And God though, it's the reverse that is true. We give up the past, so that we can look at our future completely differently than we've ever looked at it before. A future that is empty of everything, now can be filled with anything. And the only real question is, what do you want to fill your future with. Especially, what do you want to fill your future with if you let go of everything in your past?

I personally, fill my future with as much love life and freedom as I possibly can. I do this for the glory of God and the cause of Christ. (And this is the most religious thing you'll ever hear from out of my mouth.)

Not everybody can hear what I'm about to say. And I've been saying this for quite a while. And it is a hard thing to hear. But consider, just for a moment, that your feelings of fear, sadness, anger and hatred that you've been putting on other people, actually belongs pointed at yourself.

Every time you've let yourself down, you become fearful that you're going to let yourself down again. You become sad that you've let yourself down. And the anger and the hatred you feel is because you've let yourself down repeatedly.

Now you can either waste your time feeling bad that you feel bad. Or you can move on to the next step, which is forgive yourself for the events of your past, and start creating a future of your own design, that is worth putting all your effort into.

And just so that we're not confused about something. Your spirit within you longs to walk in the freedom and experience the freedom that is in Christ. Your spirit, the spirit that agrees with God, longs to cause and create wonderful things for others in yourself. And if we gave a title to these wonderful things, it would be the experience of love, joy and peace, or anything that would allow for the experience of love, joy and peace.

Your sense of purpose is hidden within yourself. And the way to expose that purpose is to start moving forward, into a future of your design, knowing that you will be led of God's Holy Spirit that dwells within you, when you look for all the ways that you can experience the freedom to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for others and yourself.

This last paragraph by the way, is how we figure out how to walk in Christ. It's how we figure out how to be in Christ. It's how we find our purpose in life. A purpose that is centered in Christ.

And the truth is it's actually not that hard. Especially when you start figuring out how much freedom is involved when you're causing and creating something wonderful for other people. When you get the focus off of your own life and put it on to causing and creating something for other people. I mean is it really going to be hard to walk in freedom? Absolutely not. It's the greatest thing in the world.

One last side note...

In order to survive this life, your body comes with it a part of your brain called the amygdala. It is the job of your amygdala to make sure that your body does not die. It takes a lifetime to figure out how to do this.

It started when you were a child and you started to figure out that it was good to feel good and bad to feel bad. And then as a young teenager you started to figure out that it was good to look good and bad to look bad. It was even good to associate yourself with things that look good and it was bad to associate yourself with things that look bad. And then as a young adult you started to figure out that it was good to be wise and aware and it was bad to be unwise and unaware.

Everybody does this. The only issue with it is, is that your body does not have any moral standards. Your body does not care how it stays alive, it only cares about making sure that it stays alive. So any threat, whether that threat be an actual threat or simply perceived as a threat, your body will react. And it has been those reactions throughout your life that has caused you to be sad and angered and filled with hatred.

Those bad feelings come from us not choosing to be loving in a situation where we could have been. A lot of people don't realize that the definition of sin, which is to miss the mark, is an indication that the Mark we missed is that we were trying to hit the mark of the high calling of Christ by being loving in the moment. And when we chose instead to simply survive the moment and lash out at people who are making us simply feel bad, look bad or seem like we're unwise and unaware, that that lashing out costs us the experience of life. Which is the experience of love, joy and peace. The second part of the definition of what sin is, is to miss the mark and therefore miss out on the prize. The prize is the life that God wants for you. A life free from fear. Free from anger and hatred and sadness.

If I had more time to spend with you, it sure would be a lot easier to get you going in the direction you want to go in. The best I can do is to give you a little bit of advice.

Look up in Scripture the fruits of the Holy Spirit. Concentrate all your efforts in producing those fruits. You have the Holy Spirit living within you. You have the ability to produce these fruits. Spend all your efforts in producing these fruits.

The second part of the advice goes like this. Be willing to feel bad. Be willing to look bad. Be willing to be considered unwise and unaware. So that when you do feel bad, look bad and are considered unwise and unaware you don't lash out at people because they have an opinion of you. Other people's opinion of you don't matter. It is God's opinion of you that matters. And this is how you can ignore what's your faced with. And instead concentrate your efforts on what really matters. And what really matters is God's opinion of you. What really matters is the tools that God has given to you, especially God giving you the Holy Spirit to lead you and guide you on how to produce the fruits of the Holy Spirit.

I've given you a lot to digest. Forgive yourself. Let your past go. And start walking into a future that is worth your time and your effort. It will be a future that is loaded with fruit. And that's the first place to look.",1620585244,"and then as a young adult you started to figure out that it was good to be wise and aware and it was bad to be unwise and unaware.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0

I suspect we have the same view on this, and I suspect that you contradict this view later in this comment. Here’s my view: I am entirely the product of the natural processes in my body and brain. There is no soul. I’m just a pattern.  

&gt;	We have no memory of countless prior tortures, so there is no persistence of memory through entanglement, demonstrably.  

Yeah, the different “branches” wouldn’t exchange any information. They’re entirely separate.  

&gt;	This should rule out the whole thing, should it not?  

I fail to see how this follows? Do you think I’m asserting some kind of transmigration of a soul across different branches? It’s as simple as this: there is a universe where you don’t die. That’s it, that’s the whole thing.  

&gt;	if you died tonight and through this effect you continued to exist without knowing it, would that other you really be you?  

If you didn’t die tonight, but you had a possibility of dying, would you wake up as you? Or did the “real you” die? I would say there is no “real you,” or rather, the real you is the one that you are experiencing. You simply don’t exist in a world where you died, obviously. Unless you’re saying that each universe has some separate, non-interchangeable “soul,” a materialist view of consciousness allows for no distinction.  

&gt;	You would be dead and unaware that this entangled version of you exists, just as if the theory had meat, we must each be part of this ongoing cycle already.  

In the universes where your brain died, or whatever, you just *wouldn’t be there.* You would wake up in your bed unaware of the fact that you had died in countless other universes.  

As for how this theory would impact me, or decision-making in general, I think it is significant in terms of “what can a person expect to experience as the possibility of their death approaches one hundred percent?” It’s... not good, in this scenario. That’s pretty impactful. I think people would probably prioritize their health a lot more in a world where this was seen as a likely correct theory.

"gwbv1tf","I'm not defending rape at all. But to make rape a justified accusation and ensure it is taken seriously in all cases, there needs to be a clear boundary drawn somewhere along the intoxication spectrum. I can't see an alternative objectively measurable place beyond consciousness - but would love suggestions.

I can't think of any method of 100% eliminating rape as a crime within society. While numbers may fluctuate and hopefully minimise, you will always have a minority of either wildly inappropriate and indecent humans or people with mental health problems who will rape. 

While ideally we would have no rapists, and therefore no risk of being incoherent and unaware - that isn't reality. In the real world, I would argue that multiple individual decisions can make you more or less likely to be raped. I don't feel that's an incorrect statement. If you are drunk, high, topless and walking down a quiet, high-crime neighbourhood at 2am - you have made a number of decisions that will statistically increase your risk. You have full control of your actions, but limited influence over evil rapists.

The problem is that we are treating rapists as normal people who are going to see the error of their ways if we just display anti-rape morality through society. Based on the fact they actively choose to rape people, I would argue many of them are beyond appeals to morality.

"gtujf13","To me it sounds clear you want some action and get away from the routine; you put a gun at your head to feel some thrill of doing something.

Your friend got murdered yet that motivated you, that's the right call, but now, it's been some time, and you lost your purpose, you've lost the thrill and the fear, you have nothing but void positivity, and people tell you should be grateful; but people don't thrive in peace, people thrive in conflict; even your own biology is designed to deal with constant physical stress and that builds your heart, makes you healthy, and makes you stronger; which is why exercise is so healthy; but also your mind, it wants trouble, it wants something broken to fix, to live for; we were designed for the dangers of the brutal nature, we need conflict.

Make you wonder why people play videogames, watch movies, etc... where their characters lives miserably, or has some big trouble to fix, they identify with such character, despite living lives that are nothing alike; doesn't that express the desires of a person?...

Do you know why people say ""man of action"", yes, there's a reason behind that, you wanted to save the world and then here you are, just working, doing nothing truly meaningful for your community; that is going to drive you crazy, of course it is.

You don't need someone to be nice to you, you don't need drugs to take your wish for action away, you don't need someone to tell you there's something wrong with you.

You need to go out there and save the world, or at least your world.

So now you have two pills to take, you can either take the blue pill and go the standard path, quench this desire for action with drugs, convinced and unaware that what drove you crazy was this lacking, and attack the symptoms rather than the cause of the disease, to become a happy little cog of society.

Or you can pursue this wish of yours, get out of your comfort zone that has been imposed by society, and save the world; it will not be easy, it will be stressful,  you will cry, you will laugh, you will feel everything there is to feel; and that will make you strong, you will also exercise, every day, to ensure your body follows your mind. So how do you save the world you ask me?... or how do you save your world?... well, you are an engineer, you are already the holder of some of the most brilliant talent in the world, and most people waste their talent, just following orders, so make your own, innovate, there's so many problems in the world that need engineering solutions, and some of these problems are for you to fix, and there's so much money to be made in these markets, you could be making a living off this, but that's up to you to decide, because that's a big risk, just ask risky as going 120mph on the highway, but this is the real deal.

So choose a path.",1617911096,"so now you have two pills to take, you can either take the blue pill and go the standard path, quench this desire for action with drugs, convinced and unaware that what drove you crazy was this lacking, and attack the symptoms rather than the cause of the disease, to become a happy little cog of society.","convinced and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"convinced and unaware","convinced",NA,NA,0

It is something so deep, that it cannot really be explained, but recovery looks different to so many. Some have strong opinions but there are also people who just want her to live and some who would rather just push out of spite. Pretending to be concerned. I go through a cycle of grief over and over but I literally think I too would fear if I did not know that I have rights. I don't need my mom to fix it if I am stuck. Knowing what you are able to say no to will help. I think that recovery should be a choice that Eugenia can choose. I mean her mom fought ""for her"" and now that fear is stronger and I can only imagine if I were in her situation, fear is eating her up. I don't see this relapse as much of a choice, but closing up hope inside. She used to see a different way. I know there is no way that she is able to make decisions on her own. I know her situation is worse than ever because of little things she may not be aware of. If I thought I did not have a choice and my mom was the one who got me out and all i have now is haters and my mom to help me out of my confusion I'd give up inside. Eugenia can fight and choose. She does not need her mom unless she chooses to make her mom guardian. I think that no human being would just cause themselves to suffer so much just for the supposed glory. If she wanted help how would she get it anyway? How would she get it when she does not know if she is in a conservatorship herself. What if she wanted out of something different but we couldn't see it. Education may be a way. I got my own rights back. I was my moms paycheck and I did not know it. I thought I had no rights and i never had any idea somebody got my own paycheck and was supposed to use this to feed me. I was unable to feed or clothe myself according to the people I reached out too to ask what certain things mean. They couldn't talk to me.

"gsvd8h8","The Gnostic sect of early Christians had in one case, which may not have been widely accepted even among them, postulated that the creator in the OT was actually a lesser God. Named Saklas (may not be the exact spelling), this creator deity was extremely jealous and unaware that he himself had been created by a higher God. This, it seems, was an attempt to explain why the god of the OT seemed to be such a stark contrast to the God that Jesus was proclaiming. 

In order to rectify the situation, the One True God sent Jesus to properly teach the lessons mankind was *supposed* to receive and apply. 

This wasn't an accepted view by the larger church at the time and pretty much died out within a short period of time. I think that the Gnostic view was pretty weak and didn't really align with accepted Jewish theology in the first place. But it does propose an interesting concept that sought to explain why God had been so 'punishment' oriented in the OT.

I think the main flaw is that Jesus wasn't violating the spirit of Mosaic Law (which, apparently to Gnostics,  Saklas had given), even though he seemed to violate the letter of it (a view called Legalism). In fact, it shows a refinement of the existing Law and shows how that Law is fulfilled by loving your neighbor as you love yourself.

I know I'm not really talking about the main point OP raised, but all this tangentially shows support even within the early Christian community for a similar point of view in regards to God being a lower deity than a greater God.

But let's say God is below a greater God and the Bible doesn't reveal this. I don't think that it would change anything substantially because we're supposed to have a relationship with the God we've been given. It may potentially be that the Mormon view of each planet having its own God is true, but even still, those aren't the gods we're dealing with.

However, you don't really go to hell just because of what you believe, but rather what you do. Except, since what you do is informed by what you believe, you're far more likely to do things that you aren't supposed to. Ultimately God wants you to have good relationships with Him, others, and yourself. You accomplish this by following the teachings He has given to us. If you don't believe God exists and therefore don't believe you should act in the best interests of everyone, up to and including your enemies, then you aren't as likely to fulfill the expectations God has for the people He will ultimately bring along into the new creation.

Adding to that, you're going to get a second shot at all this during the Milennium Kingdom, as we all will. After the rapture and the tribulations God will resurrect all flesh to live under the reign of Jesus for a thousand years. During that time you'll leave Heaven or Hell and have a chance to accept God's authority. You'll be able to see Jesus in the flesh and decide then whether or not you still disbelieve.

Most people, when subjected to evil influences - and, yes, much of this country is, constantly - manifest evil behavior. They don't necessarily do it out of sadism or cruel intent. They do it out of banality, from the desire to belong, and out of lack of thought and imperative to broader empathy.  


Most people can be taught, with sufficient exposure, to be different, but they need that exposure to be constantly reinforced.  


A portion of people are both sufficiently driven to worry at their concept of the world, and inclined to altruistic empathy, to resist a strongly conformant societal drive toward evil, but most will continue to think of themselves as perfectly good people as they become increasingly (in the case of the left fringe) embroiled in irrationally obsessive codification or (in the case of the right not-exactly-fringe-anymore) actual fascism.  


It isn't a ""most of"", ""both sides"". That's your own cognitive dissonance, not the reality.  


It isn't because the left is inherently better. The left can (and the fringe wishes it could) push toward its own kind of totalitarian dystopia in the name of equality of outcomes, and think they were heroes. But right now, the left fringe is basically nonexistent in this particular country, in both numbers and organization, where the dangerous side of the right constitutes a plurality, and we have very concrete evidence, from less than seven weeks ago, of how far down the road that has progressed.  


I assume you close your eyes to the severity of the reality because you want to believe in people. This is an admirable trait. But, the thing about humans is, we're basically a veneer of constructed norms around a core of animal. And I don't mean that as an entirely bad thing. The animal core is as much a part of our nature as the societal norms, and shouldn't be disparaged. But when the societal norms are deliberately sabotaged - and, politicians across the political spectrum will do things that constitute sabotage, but I'm not talking about the politicians right now, and I *am* saying that the same parts of the animal instinct make some political inclinations (not specific to the left/right spectrum, but partially correlated) more susceptible to the particular brand of sabotage currently occurring - when those norms are deliberately sabotaged, the delicate machinery keeping the veneer in control, and not-evil, can easily break down.  


Brown coats thought they were heroic. Nazis thought themselves patriotic. And, no, by Godwin's own words, this is not Godwin's law. We're talking about a literal repeat of the progression that led to Nazi Germany, and we just passed the Beer Hall  Putsch. And your friends and family may ""feel the same"", but there's a difference between being fully aware of the entire context, and, well, not.  


The racism thing... it's real, and most of them would deny it, even now, but it's... I wouldn't call them evil for that. They're unexposed, closed off. They react in ways that are telling, to a black couple... to a white-passing guy who inadvertently reveals himself to be jewish in a place where nobody has any business being a jew... to my very mixed extended family. But they aren't actively violent, most of the time. They're unwelcoming, sometimes, but most of the time, they're just... overly curious, and unaware that they're forgetting their own standard of manners. It's relatively benign, at that level. Or it was. Two years ago, when we last ventured out of our region, there was significantly more visible hostility, desire for violence, and malice.

"ghj820x","What you are arguing for (in part) is essentially [psychological egoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/#PsycEgoi). If you read the page I just linked, you will find that the claim that people fundamentally act out of self-interest is dubious at best, so I’d like to push back on that a bit. 

I think a better argument to make is to drop the self-interest part of your argument and focus on the “people are okay with taking on small risks” part of your argument. That idea describes the COVID-19 situation quite accurately. For younger populations, COVID-19 presents an almost negligible risk. People are okay with taking that minimal risk, whether you agree with it or not. I know I am. I am acting rationally by maximizing my happiness; the joy I get from partying, hanging out with friends, eating out, being free, etc. far outweighs the low risk of something bad happening to me from catching COVID. This is the same cost-benefit analysis going on in the head of everyone who makes the same decision as me, whether they are consciously aware of it or not. 

The obvious response is that this is selfish; while I am at a low risk, older and more vulnerable populations are not. I could potentially spread the disease to them. But this doesn’t seem to have any affect on my cost-benefit analysis. It becomes difficult to argue exactly why this is the case.

"gh2d86r","I agree.

I think my point was mainly that there is probably something of an upper limit on competence/intelligence when it comes to this type of appeal.

That being said, the Bush Jr presidency does show a massive danger of this. Because Cheney played a major role in that administration. And that's the real danger, having someone behind the scenes who is both evil and competent. 

To me it seems that there's two things that saved the US to the worst excesses of the Trump Presidency. The first is Barr coming in as late as he did. And the second is Trump being so narcissistic and unaware that he was unable to follow or listen to his advisors.

And I think that's the real danger. Someone who has a competent and evil advisor. But I think even when it comes to those there are a lot of self-defeating mechanisms. Look at Cummings in the UK or Stephen Miller in the US. 

Those men might be somewhat smarter and more competent than Trump and Johnson, but they too think far too highly of themselves and lack true competence. I think it's very rare for someone like Cheney, who is both wholly self-serving and largely competent, to rise to these kinds of positions.

"gghtatt","1) Any sources regarding the insufficient conversion rates of K1 into K2?

2) The Inuit have livespans of 45-50 years. It's quite counterproductive to use their diets as an example for healthy diets. Yes, consuming a high amount of meat can make sure that enough D3 is available even in countries in the north. However, inuit also consume meats that people don't generally consume such as seal, walrus and whale, all of them high in vitamin D.

Germans already consume WAY too much meat  already even according to omnivorous dietitians. The average German, vegetarians and vegans excluded, consumes 1.2kg meat per week. The DGE, which is the largest German association for nutrition and quite conservative i.e. rather sceptical towards vegan diets, recommends a maximum of 300-600g per week. With a consumption of 1.2kg per week, the majority of Germans still are vitamin D3 deficient after winter. Reducing that amount according to the recommendations would further increase the number of deficient Germans.

Your suggestion of consuming even more meat doesn' have any scientific foundation.

Vegan diets are indeed cholesterol-free. All cholesterol that our body needs it makes on its own.

3) B12 is produced by bacteria in our soil. It is not naturally part of any animal. More than 95% of farm animals nowadays will never eat grass outside, which is why they also won't graze and therefore eat traces of soil with their feed. Pigs and chickens have to be fed B12, as they cannot produce B12 on their own.

Ruminants can produce B12 if they have enough cobalt. Therefore, ruminants are fed cobalt, but B12 as well to ensure that there is no deficiency.  

When it comes to wild game and fish, you're right. They can naturally obtain B12 from their food.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is a vegan myth which they spread to justify their lack of B12.  

I'm not lacking B12, as I supplement it. Therefore I also don't have to justify my lack of B12. Therefore I also don't spread myths.

4)

&gt; Then you must know that ALA conversion rates are so poor that you can't meet your needs from ALA 

ALA conversion rates are indeed quite bad. However, consuming a variety of ALA sources every day can make sure that enough DHA and EPA is produced. Some vegan dietitians indeed recommend supplementing DHA and EPA. This can be done with algae oil.

&gt; There is no DHA or EPA in plant foods. 

It is in certain algae.

5) 

&gt; Many people (about 45% of the population) cannot convert beta carotene  to vitamin A because of the BCMO1 gene. For those who can, it only does  so at rates of around 3%. 

This is indeed a very bold claim. Any sources?

6) 

&gt; They why do vegans have the highest rates of anemia? All iron is not the  same. Heme iron is vastly more bioavailable. Ignoring bioavailability  seems to be a hallmark of veganism. 

Many people are un- or misinformed and unaware that they have to make sure to include good iron sources into their diet. Anemia can have different causes, either iron deficiency or B12 deficiency. Also, anemia takes some time to develop. Having some bloodwork done every year is important particularly for people who are unsure about whether their diet is adequate. 

Iron deficiency isn't a vegan problem. It is prevalent particularly in women, no matter the diet, between 10 and 50 years due to their menstruation.

7) 

&gt;Carnitine is not essential.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yes it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Carnitine  performs a critically important role in energy metabolism and is  synthesized in the healthy adult predominantly in the liver and kidney.""

You don't seem to know what the word ""essential"" means. Essential doesn't mean that it's important in this context. Essential nutrients are nutrients that we have to provide to our body through food, because our body cannot make them on their own. 

Carnitine is *NOT* essential. Our body makes it on its own, which your very own source states: ""Carnitine \[...\] is synthesized in the healthy adult \[...\]"".

8) 

&gt;Taurine is not essential.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes it is.

Your very own source states the following:

""Taurine is often referred to as a non-essential amino acid (technically  an amino sulfonic acid: 2-aminoethane sulphonic acid). It can be  synthesized in humans from the amino acids, cysteine and methionine.""

It's non-essential. It can be synthesized in our body. We don't have to consume taurine in our diet.

9) 

&gt; Good luck with that. Again vegans are deficient and it is only found in animal products. 

It's not essential. We don't have to include it into our diet, just like we don't have to include taurine or carnitine. Our body makes all of these on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you want to be a vegan, go nuts.  But requiring some obscure foods and relying on inefficient body  conversions is why so many vegans get sick and why it is a nutritionally  poor diet.

We're not requiring any obscure foods. Body conversions are efficient enough. The reason so many vegans get sick is because they're not adequately informed or unable to include safe sources for particular important nutrients into their diet. Veganism is not a nutritionally poor diet, which the largest organizations for nutrition and dietetics in the world have shown.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Humans have eaten meat  for 2,000,000 years. We evolved to eat meat. There were no vegans prior  to the development of artificial supplements because the diet was  impossible.

So what? Also, the fact that there were no vegans in earlier times isn't due to there not being artificial supplements. It's due to the small number of different foods that were available. B12 wasn't a problem a hundred years or more ago, as B12 is made by bacteria. Different crops and plants weren't processed industrially and there were no fertilizers used back then that destroyed the microorganisms producing B12 in the soil. Therefore, people back then ate B12 that was stuck to plants they ate in traces. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There have been no vegan cultures, tribes, or civilizations in human history. It is made up, a modern fad diet.

additionally, i also discovered that my positive roommate has not been following the isolation guidelines we were given in the first place. i only go downstairs to use the washroom and retrieve my food from the fridge, otherwise i’m cooped up in my room all the time. yesterday i really had to use my assigned washroom so i went downstairs masked only to find her walking around the kitchen without a mask (this was before she got her positive result). that was the first time i’d seen her in the common area all week and i really thought she was following all guidelines and now that i’m aware she wasn’t my anxiety has skyrocketed. i also feel incredibly stupid for not saying anything yesterday because i heard her coughing in her room beforehand. this whole experience is messy and instead of studying for my exam tomorrow i’m sitting here typing this out LOL. this was way longer than i intended it to be so if you read to this point... thank you. 💕

"g9ujnll","Paul normally can handle himself in these discussions, but on this topic, he's struggling terribly. His appearance on Vaush and this showing, they're among his worst discussions intellectually. I find myself agreeing with both him and TJ, but TJ kind of got me with the idea that he can do everything that Paul is doing to attempt to change the system, while also saving a few more lives by voting Biden now.

I can't reason my way out of that point and I'd fucking love to ... Paul has the right idea, we shouldn't be voting Biden, but TJ is right that it's one of two choices we have and that's it. It's as simple as that. History will be made regardless of if we withhold our vote. It's too late to get a better candidate.

The fact is, it's our own damn fault. We had Bernie. He was SO CLOSE to winning it all. And yeah, the DNC pulled some strings, but if the people knew what the fuck they wanted and had a little integrity, it would be Bernie right now. We caused this because of our own ignorance and aversion to voting. We allowed the DNC to pull a fast one on us. We had our chance to make a change and in less than two weeks time, we let the weakest candidate in the race steal it all away from him. That's a testament to how weak we are as a party.

I don't think Paul is stupid, I do think his argument is more emotional than it is rational. I know this because this is my problem too. I fucking hate Biden ... He is a conscious devil whose goal it is to undermine the people and increase corporate profit at the cost of millions of peoples well-being. I hate how he treats Bernie. I hate that he stole the lead from Bernie through behind door deals. I hate that he is going to become the most powerful man in the country. I do not want to see him as President. I dislike him more than Trump. To me, Trump is just a buffoon.

Biden is a cancer and he is representative of a particular cancer which has spread to most of the democratic party. On some level, I want the democrats to fail. I want the people who voted for Biden to suffer for having chosen the lesser candidate. I want America to reap what it sows because on this issue I am spiteful. This is the top reason why I will not be voting. Maybe Paul feels that way too.

"g71aj9i","Well this is a weird question to read for me. I'm a non-technical development manager. I don't think I'm a bad manager at all, but only because I recognize my technical limitations. I have a fsking brilliant team of senior and principal developers who with all due respect just aren't great a communicating, organizing, and prioritising. That's where I come in and why I was hired; I won't be on anyone's code reviews to advise them on best practices at a coding level, but I do have a ton of project management, people management and testing experience which is the gap this team currently has. 

I guess it comes down to self-awareness. I've worked for technical bosses who were aware of their short comings as people/process managers and that's fine. I've worked with non-technical bosses who were self-aware of their short comings at a technical level. 

But really for me it boils down to I cannot tolerate working for people who aren't self-aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and I cannot work for someone who is completely incompetent and unaware. That goes for technical managers as well as non-technical managers (though I absolutely expect non-technical managers to understand enough to hold the conversation at a high level of project organization, architecture, and/or design, even if they're not assisting down to the coding level).

"g37z873","First of all, I commend you for asking, even if people might become rude about it. There’s a lot we don’t know and a lot of info that changes over time, you shouldn’t be assumed to just know everything. 

If the people going out to party were only going out in situations where all individuals want to assume the risk, or would be “fine” (i.e., no one who cared about getting COVID would get sick). However, there are very few people where this rule remains true. Most people don’t think about all of the other people they interact with who they could be exposing, because it’s a really weird thing to think about that we’ve never had to consider before. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of some people you may encounter who didn’t sign up for the risk you took on by going to that party: grocery store workers, food service (including contact delivery), transportation partners (Ubers, buses, planes, etc.), apartment/home maintenance staff, roommates/suitemates/housemates, professors/TAs/peers, any medical professionals or law enforcement, and even just people you’re waiting in line in front of or passing by (yes, even outside). These are all people you see who didn’t take on the risk of going to the party you went you. Sure they’re taking a risk by being out in public, but there’s a general societal standard of mutual respect and limited contact.  Sure the cashier at Publix knows there’s a risk by going into work, but they’re hoping that wearing masks, sanitizing, distancing, and general expectations of limited risk are going to be beneficial to lowering their risk of contracting it. Additionally, many of the people mentioned may not have a choice to be out because their job requires it or it’s a situation where distancing or isolation is unavoidable. 

But let’s just say it’s a more ideal situation and you don’t see any of those people. You’re locked in your house, getting contactless food deliveries, you experience no emergency (maintenance, medical, or otherwise), and the ONLY contact you have with other people is when you go out to party. Then that should be okay, right? Well actually not even then. You’re still putting others at risk, even if mostly indirectly. A more direct consideration is employees at locations you may be going to this party. Bar or club employees are being exposed, and while they most definitely understand the risk they’re taking on by working in such an environment, your individual decision still increases the risk of transmission to them. And to others. This is where the indirect part comes into play. Every additional person inside a party has a level of risk of having COVID (assuming they’re asymptomatic and unaware). That potential risk only affects their health if they are in strict isolation. However, when that one person interacts with someone else, the risk is passed on to them and every single person they interact with. So say Jerry doesn’t think he has COVID and goes to hang out with Molly one day. Jerry isn’t just exposing his risk to Molly, but also to Molly’s roommates, coworkers, and professors. And there’s also risk to the contacts of all of those people, and so on and so forth. Yes the risk is lower with each person away you move, but there’s still a risk. Now going back to that party. The situation with Jerry and Molly could have affected a lot of people, even with just one hang out. Now consider a large group of people all a part of that interaction. Think about all of the people interacting with each other, and the people they see, and who those people encounter.. a single interaction can exponentially increase transmission of a contagious virus. And the environment of a party/bar/club/etc. is a perfect storm for virus transmission. People are usually close together, not wearing masks, breathing heavily (dancing, singing, talking loudly), and add in alcohol/drugs, everyone’s judgment is lowered and there’s going to be some even less smart decisions made. 

And one final important thing I want to note regarding this is people choosing to take on risk when going out in public (in typically necessary situations like grocery shopping). Yes, people who don’t want to sick could (ideally) stay home and isolate and never have any interaction with anyone ever again. But most people can’t do that and don’t want to. Regardless of political views, everyone knows the economy has been hit hard and we want it to recover. We want our lives to get back to normal. And for the most part, we can start moving towards that **but it needs to be slow**. We can’t go from one day us all being locked inside to going out to raves the next. We have to make gradual, incremental changes as we learn more about this virus, take strides towards a vaccine or treatment, and try to keep as many people as can alive and healthy. So places are starting to open up, but some have mask mandates or other restrictions. We’re trying to get people back to affording their rent and food and feeling sane again, but trying to keep risks down. That requires an enormous level of trust in others and courtesy towards others. You have to trust that other people are making smart, low-risk decisions so *you* don’t get sick, but you also need to offer the same to others by not engaging in high-risk activities so that *they* don’t get sick. Spreading COVID around a community (because let’s be honest, a perfect bubble of partygoers will never be maintained, there’s going to be some “leaks” of interaction with outside individuals) is just going to cause increased outbreaks, more illness, more deaths, and likely spur another shutdown (to varying extents). It’ll just be moving backwards weeks, and possibly months, with the only positive outcome being a fun night with friends. 

Now I know I probably didn’t say everything completely right, but I tried to give a little context to why people are hating on parties so much. It’s not just about the people at the party, but everyone else in a community as well. To get through this as a society and hopefully get a life that’s as close to normal as can be, we **have** to stick together and work as a team.

"g2dijiw","I am here to have a healthy conversation about this; I have not come into this with hostile intentions. Yes, this is mainly something I have reposted from another thread, and I am adding onto it. And if I come off as smug, smarmy, or otherwise hostile, please let me know.

The big thing about this whole debacle is that its a trans slur because stupid people aren't utilizing it properly. It is both a slur and not a slur at the same time - lemme explain.

'Trap' is a fictional trope used to define a character set explicitly in one gender that utilizes features such as clothes, expressions or mannerisms of another, to force a separate character or viewer (which is most likely the same gender as the 'trap,' depending on the target audience) to question the validity of their sexual orientation. I have recently heard an idea that a character falling under this term is eventually forced into revealing their true gender on a later date - if you have examples of this throughout Japanese media, then I would love to have a look at them!

Continuing, it is not specifically a trans slur because it has no involvement of someone who is trans. It's like trying to starting a campfire with no wood, tossing a lighter in a pit, and saying that said bonfire is, in fact, lit. The wood, being trans, is nonexistent. It's not there. You cannot say you've started a fire because you've thrown the lighter, being 'slur,' into an empty fuelless pit, being 'trap,' with no wood in it. The 'trap' IS the opposite gender than it is presenting. They have not transitioned from one gender to the other. The term 'femboy' or 'feminine boy' does not work, for they do not necessarily have to be feminine. It'd be like saying that because one sport involves a stick hitting a ball, that must mean said stick should work in other outdoor games. Terrible analogy, but I hope you get the picture. The term is more on par with, say, 'crossdresser,' and 'trap' is just the weeaboo, nerdy variant. But because the word is still new, it's complicated, and 'crossdresser' may not work... It's weird.

The problem arises when dipshits use it against trans people because they can't tell the difference between fiction and reality, and use it in the scummiest way possible, creating a divide between communities. I'm saying fuck those people. The word and idea of 'trap' are not normalizing hostile thought processes towards trans peeps. I love em'; they are what they are. A man who has transitioned to a woman is, in the end, a woman, no matter how hard sick fucks try to exclaim that they're not, or that it's a 'trap' because they do not, and are not willing, to understand its meaning. Those people are using it with malicious intent in mind. Once again, fuck those people.

By attempting to ban the word, it will only instill dissonance between LGBTQ+ and anime, causing the peoples who have previously used the term against trans people to find a new expression, and the people saying that it is a slur to have an increased sense of moral superiority. Neither are in the right here. The deafening minority in both communities are inciting hostility because they do not comprehend the differences. On one end, the uneducated pompous (possibly trans) people believe they have sufficient knowledge to understand that the term is a slur, while ironically refusing to listen to other trans members of their community saying that it isn't. The knuckle-dragging pieces of human filth on the anime side using the term willy nilly on trans peoples are an annoyance, garnering more hate for the said unharmful term when they don't represent the anime community.

I need to drive the point into your noggin that this term does not incite violence, and does not harm others. Words do not kill others; people kill people. And no, this unharmful trope won't harm others. And the same goes for other topics as well. Shipping two characters will not hurt something nonexistent. Rape victims can have rape fantasies, and that's healthy because it is fantasy. And if people want to use that term to define who they are, they should be allowed to do so.

Before I finish this off, here are a couple of general quotes regarding 'fetishization' by random people on the internet, since I couldn't fit this anywhere else. I'm sure someone will attempt to use the term 'fetish' in some fashion, so here you go.

* ""Fetishizing is when you view a person or group of people as acceptable only when their existence serves YOU.""
* ""Wish that people understood that fetishism means ""dehumanization to the point of reducing a person to their sexual traits without an understanding that in real life these people don't act/look this way"" and not a person enjoying fetish content/creating niche fetish content. If your relationship with porn and sex is so immature and unaware that you can't grasp the concept that you shouldn't use porn as a way to teach people how to perceive the real world/real people, you shouldn't be inserting yourself into conversations about sex, kink and fetish.""
* ""Here's a fun one. ""MLM is bad because it is a fetish."" Said the person treating it like it is only a fetish.""

TL;DR, 'Trap' is a trope whose entire purpose is to make another person question their sexuality. It isn't a trans slur because 'trap' does not correlate anything trans whatsoever. It is still a trans slur, though, because people are misusing it. This trope will not cause others to harm other people.

Also: I think Felix should be considered trans, but you know, to each their own! Headcanon and all that.

"g0uv983","&gt;Please show me a study that correlates victimhood mentality with a lack of self-accountability.

There isn't a studies about this because it's not really something that can be studied scientifically using statistics and scientific knowledge. There's no studies that disapproves my claim either. You can think it about yourself, if you're told all your life that you're victim, system is against you and that you cannot succeed, how it will affect you? 

&gt;Did you watch the videos? Blacks and whites use drugs at the same rates and blacks are arrested at higher rates, and I provided the source for this. The architects of the drug war have admitted that it was racist, and I provided the source for this. If you continue arguing this point I will assume you're just trolling.
Again, black people have more encounters with police because they commit more crimes. Naturally, they get arrested more often and also there comes the drug charges.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-21

&gt;It the cause of the trouble in black communities MUST be either 1) racial inferiority, or 2) not racial inferiority. Since it is not racial inferiority, it must be the other thing. The other thing is called systemic racism.

Wow, if we exclude option no. 1, black people's problems must be because of racism? There is no African American culture? They do not have cultural problems like every other ethnic group has? Are they somehow superior that only reason why they aren't as successful as other cultures and ethnicities is because of racism?

&gt;Sure. Can you explain the wealth gap in terms of something other than systemic racism (which includes the legacy of explicitly racist policies like the GI Bill, early Social Security, the Homestead Act, etc.)? Can you explain why a black college graduate is twice as likely to be unemployed as a white college graduate in terms of something other than systemic racism? Can you explain why traditionally white names are 50% more likely to get a callback than traditionally black names? Can you explain why black American continue to ""choose"" to live in polluted areas in inner cities with bad schools in terms other than systemic racism? Can you explain why blacks are over 3x as likely as whites to be arrested for drug possession even though they use drugs at the same rate?

Yes, as I said, it's cultural. Black people do not hold themselves accountable as much as other groups does and do not have the right role models. They make poorer decisions because of the culture and surroundings. It doesn't come back to systemic racism, because it's long gone and it's up to them to make their decisions and enhance their own communities. They're affected by the victim mentality which is pushed by people like you, which affects their thrive to succeed and therefore there's a wage gap, they lack the thrive that other (like the Nigerians that I used as an example) have because they're fed this bullshit that they cannot succeed because of their skin color which is not at all true. Again, employment falls into the same category. People have their prejudices, it's not racistic to have these, they're in sub-consciousness. Black people portrait themselves negatively, with the gang culture, rap music and over representation on violent crimes etc. Black people do not work hard enough to rise from their ""polluted"" areas and they do not hold themselves accountable and transform their communities themselves. Again, when it comes to drugs, black people are more likely to be involved with police because they commit more crimes.

Why'd I need to give you sources when you haven't given any viable sources? The propaganda you pushed me earlier had no real scientific methods behind them, they were just statements and opinions, like I've given you here. If you wanna refer to authority, you know that's a fallacy, right? I have serious doubt about your state of mind, you do not seem to be willing to argue and do not have an open mind set.

&gt;Nope, you said Indian immigrants have high incomes, not that black immigrants have high incomes. Also, income isn't wealth. Blacks with the same income as whites have significantly less wealth. Source. I care less about income inequality than wealth inequality.

So, black people tend to safe less money and that's an issue? Why on Earth would you care more about wealth inequality than income equality? This makes no sense, if one group makes the same amount of money, eventually they become as wealthy if they posses the same sense on economics. The wealthiest ethnic group is the Jews in America and they controlled most of the slave trade there. 

&gt;To reiterate, this doesn't account for the disparity in drug arrests, and the fact that the war on drugs was explicitly started to target black communities.

There's a very little proof that this was explicitly started to target black communities, you know that the source for this claim comes from one dude? How trustworthy is this statement? It isn't. 

&gt;C'mon. Appeal to authority doesn't fly. And, even if it did, there are WAY more successful black people who agree with me. So, this argument fails twice.

I'm talking about academically successful people, which aren't the ones that you're referring to. Also, you've been appealing to authority with your unscientific sources all the time.

"fzgpvjy","As **Copycatch**, James Deacon had a simple job. His Thinker power enhanced the speed and efficacy at which he learned things, being ideal for skill acquisition and information synthesis, with a twist: Copycatch always learned more than he should. This effect was insidiously subtle, as James wouldn’t realise he hadn’t been taught what he’d learned until someone pointed it out to him. For example, after several hours of martial arts practice, James was asked to perform “that really difficult kick,” the testers referring to nothing in particular. He then proceeded to attempt a 720\* flying spin kick, which he absolutely whiffed, but nevertheless had never actually seen, practiced or heard of. Previously undated events would be given timestamps, suspect lists would narrow down or appear ex nihilo, and James would be none the wiser until someone said “I never told you that.” 

And so, Copycatch’s job was simple. He would be given material to read, memorise and synthesise, then be asked to deliver a presentation or report on the topic. Copycatch would deliver- straight-faced and unaware that his information was anything out of the ordinary- _case-defining_ information that his Watchdog compatriots would leap at. 

So that report, where St Louis was determined as 5 years away from HOSV status? _Didn’t actually contain that information._ Perhaps if there’d been a little more detail as to the gangs’ infiltration of the PRT there, or more accurate ratings of the villains and the threat posed by their plans, you could infer that the situation was that bad. But where others saw the reported fours and fives, James got the real eights and tens. 

Due to bureaucratic chaos only partially unrelated to a Simurgh attack that year, James never got the chance to deliver his adjusted report on St Louis. No one asked him about it. And so he stewed in the information that the PRT would be doing _nothing_ to help the city. He never considered that they didn’t know what he knew. Why? Because he _couldn’t._ That insidious fragment of his power functioned as a self-Stranger effect. Until someone pointed out that what he knew was out of the ordinary, he would never, ever consider that it was.

This made **Double Diamond** a dangerous and effective man. Now that he didn’t have to confide in anyone what he thought they already knew, the man was off to the races for discovering and defining weird shit. By always learning more about the current events of the city, by bantering with villains and heroes each chance he got, and by keeping a solid working relationship with his employees, DD was both absurdistly competent in what he did and preternaturally aware of goings on. His crew would be sent out to catch a rival drug run as though it had always been the plan. People were “fired” (via gun,) even if their subordination went unreported. Combined with that heroic lilt that he never quite lost- keeping civilians out of the fire fights, making sure real heroes were given their due and that the bad ones never got far- St Louis certainly benefited from his rise to prominence. 

Then the Simurgh hit.

I had profs who were literally reading textbook passages in class.  Of course i won't attend lectures after 2-3 weeks of boring readings, I can do that myself lol.

"fypxkqz","&gt;What we’re saying is that anyone, whether they live a healthy lifestyle or not, is susceptible to catching coronavirus

Please don't tell me you believe a healthy person that boosts their immune system daily and hasn't been sick in literally years has the same chance to catch coronavirus as someone that eats junk, has a lifestyle that lowers their immune system and is often sick??   

&gt;because they could positive for COVID-19 and spreading it to others even if they are asymptomatic and unaware that they have it.

The WHO corona task force leader literally said ""asymptomatic spread is very rare"". 

&gt; No amount of healthy living will protect you from contracting it.

BS.  Ww know that people with deficiencies (like Vitiman D) get it more often and much worse. 

&gt;but it will not protect you from being infected because you have no antibodies in your system to combat a new virus.

Coronavirus is not new.  For example if you get the antibody test done you will test positive if you had a cold within the last year or if you received a flu shot last year.  Just because this strain is ""new"" doesn't not mean it can survive in a healthy body for long.  Again asymptomatic people ""very rarely"" can spread it.  

&gt;The very small action of wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus.

No it can't and the random control trials say they are not effective in stopping the transmission of airborne viruses. 

&gt;If EVERYONE wears one, regardless of their health/lifestyle choices

Absolutely false.  Improper mask use (like a vast majority does) can cause MORE INFECTION TO SPREAD.  So your comment is clearly not true because I see at least 90% of people wearing loose masks, touching/adjusting with dirty hands, reusing masks, contaminating without even knowing.  That is why the actual RCT's DO NOT RECOMMEND cloth masks.  

&gt;So no, that isn’t ‘literally the logic people are believing.’

Also allegedly the main argument is that the hospitals will be too full because the death rate on covid is about the same as the seasonal flu.  So if the hospitals being too full is the problem who do you think fills up the hospitals?  The ones that are chronically sick, not chronically healthy people for the most part.   So being healthy and having a boosted healthy immune system is about 5 million times more effective than wearing a piece of cloth on your face if you are really concerned about violating freedoms in the name of ""health and well being"".",1595293904,"&gt;because they could positive for covid-19 and spreading it to others even if they are asymptomatic and unaware that they have it.","asymptomatic and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asymptomatic and unaware","asymptomatic",NA,NA,0
"fyovn7g","Nope, that’s not what anybody is saying. What we’re saying is that anyone, whether they live a healthy lifestyle or not, is susceptible to catching coronavirus, and are also fully capable of passing that virus on to other people; either in their own household or strangers they encounter in public. 

To slow the spread, everyone should wear a mask, because they could positive for COVID-19 and spreading it to others even if they are asymptomatic and unaware that they have it. 

No amount of healthy living will protect you from contracting it. Your good health may aide you in fighting off the virus, but it will not protect you from being infected because you have no antibodies in your system to combat a new virus. 

The very small action of wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus. If EVERYONE wears one, regardless of their health/lifestyle choices, then the virus has fewer opportunities to spread, until it dies out in the people who are carrying it.

"fxbuue9","&gt;Where would I go to invest?

If you have reached Step 5 of the [PFC money Step steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps) and you have some money you are confident you won’t need for at least 10 years you could  invest in a low cost, passively managed, globally diversified, index tracking (i.e. ""couch potato"") portfolio such as those discussed on the following pages.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/investing 

https://canadiancouchpotato.com/about/	

The simplest solution is to use a passive robo-  advisor account (eg. WealthSimple, JustWealth, NestWealth, RBC InvestEase). After asking you questions about your goals, timeline, knowledge/ experience with investing and your comfort with volatility they will choose and then manage a suitable ETF portfolio for you. You would be able to set up automatic contributions. The total annual management fee would be about $70 per $10,000 invested.  This compares to about $200 per $10,000 invested for typical bank mutual funds.

Step 3 on [this CPM page.](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/) shows the math and mechanics of using a brokerage account to purchase ETFs.  If it looks daunting I suggest that you use a robo-advisor.  Otherwise, Step 1 will help you determine a suitable asset allocation and in step 2 you can choose a ""Light"" Asset Allocation option for that asset allocation.  Depending on the brokerage you use you may be able to use iShares's PACC plan to automate purchases of  XGRO or XBAL.  The annual management cost for these options would be about $20 to $24 per $10,000 invested but make sure you understand the trading and maintenance fees.  Questrade  is a good choice for ETF investors because: 1/ they don't charge commissions for ETF purchases  2/ they don't charge maintenance fee if the account balance is above $1000 3/ they support DRIP and they support Blackrock’s PACC.

&gt;How do I make the break?

The mechanics are that you open new accounts at your preferred financial institution and fill out the forms so that can request a direct transfer from IG.  

There is no requirement that you give IG the heads up that you are making the switch but if it has been a beneficial and cordial relationship you will probably want to do so.  You can mention that when you started you were young and unaware.  That you haven't minded paying for the advice and management that you have received.

"fwti0g9","Thank you sincerely for your honest feedback! Sorry for the late response. 
I just wanted to provide a short update now that some clinics and specialists are starting to take appointments again.

1st - Medications
I decided to contact and visit a nearby clinic and GP since I was having COVID-like symptoms. After being tested (and cleared), *the GP wanted to review my medications while I was there*. 
She, like you, was concerned with the number and dosage of Benzodiazepines and Sedatives I was taking daily, and was very surprised that I was prescribed such medications long-term at such dosages. 

When I told her about my cognitive issues, fatigue and similar issues, she actually LAUGHED slightly and said she was surprised I was able to function as well as I was (probably the Vyvanse). 
She didn't change anything (apparently it's dangerous to stop or reduce dosages of such medication when taken for a long time) DID order bloodwork (interesting results...below) and made 3 refferals for:
1. An Endocrinologist (for my Hormone, Thyroid and Blood sugar levels which my Pituitary Gland, and Thyroid might not be regulating properly.
2. A Psychiatrist (for a med review, plan for dose reducation/reduction in number of meds)
3. Neurollgist (for Migraines, Nystagmus and Congenital Eye-condition which may be correlated)
4. Ophthalmologist (to asses optic nerves, eye condition, find ways to improve my congenital eye condition + see if there are possible surgeries or corrective devices for improving my low vision)

In addition, she also reffered me to the CNIB (Canadian National Institute for the Blind), therapy services, and a regional advocacy organization for people with physical, mental or developmental disabilities.
It was amazing how much they were able to help over the past month! 
I was truly surprised and unaware that there was any support for me in day to day living!

With that being said, I'll leave it off with a quick summary of the bloodwork and urine findings and what may be the main cause (besides overmedication) of my symptoms. 

Initial Blood Labs were mostly normal - great for the most part (""ideal cholesterol, no signs of heart or pulmonary stress) but Sodium Levels were abnormally low, glucose was low, creatine was low and hemoglobin was very high. 

Urine showed very low Urine Concentration, low sodium, very low urea levels and I was told it was basically ""very dilute"". 
I took another urine test which was spaced out 3 then 6 hours after drinking any fluids and it showed similar results. Apparently I have a rare and (unrelated) condition called **Diabetes Insipedus**. 
This condition is a result of a ""miscommunication"" and disregulation with my Pituitary Gland and Bladder which makes me thirsty alot of the time, and causes me to pass urine at a very abnormally high rate (apparently going 7-10 times a day, peeing steady fkr 2-3 entire minutes is NOT not normal). 
Likewise, the Diabetes Insipedus is also probably to blame for my poor sleep (getting up to pee or drink multiple times), absorption and processing of minerals and medication possibly. 

So, since the last week and a half, I've been taking a small dose of Desmopressin, which has REALLY reduced my need to use the washroom, increased my quality of sleep, reduced my need for tranquilizers and helped with my energy levels and concentration in the day as a result!

I'm really excited and hopeful to see what the future holds, and really truly amazed by how much something seemingly unrelated would make such an impact.

I'm glad I decided to go with my instinct and seek the opinion of a secknd doctor - at the very least to review my regimen of medication!
At the very worst, the ""status quo"" would have remained, and I would have simply cleared my mind of the matter - but on the contrary, when I felt something was not right, and multiple people on Reddit, as well as friends and family thought ""I was on a lot of pills"", I knew it was time to get a second look. 

Now as a result, an entire avenue has been opened to me. 
It's not a matter of ""which doctor is better"", but a matter of ""*what* is better for me"".
Once again, thank you all for your insight and honesty!

Is information widely accessible though? For everyone? Just asking the question. The media we consume controls the narrative.

Yes, because unfortunately there will always be a small minority of the general population that is sufficiently callous and unaware that they believe their personal beliefs are more important or somehow protect them from an uncaring and harsh reality.

When it comes down to it, I believe we should support the population as a whole, and in this case the opinions of the majority are quite clear. Unfortunately for that small number of people who want to protest, that means not letting them put everyone else at risk.

What annoys me most about the protests, all the threads on this sub and others is that those promoting protests seem to have a completely callous, uninformed or indifferent attitude towards the pandemic. It has shifted and altered the lives of most people on the planet, changed our economy and our futures in a way that will be written in the history books. It has killed hundreds of thousands of people and will likely kill hundreds of thousands more until an effective vaccine is found and the largest vaccination campaign in human history is undertaken. The pro-demonstration sorts seem to be of the attitude that the virus isn't that bad, that it won't affect or kill them, and that those that it does kill or maim are faceless and therefore don't matter. They seem to feel its their right to risk the lives of others for their own causes and beliefs.

"fsugxf2","(TW rape)


I was involved with a married man 17 years my senior leading a double life in my teens. Even leaving out a lot of details this is a long story. 

When I met him at 15, I thought he was 23 based on the date of birth on his Facebook. Predatory enough, but it was even worse than that. He was from America and claimed to live in another European country and only came to my city for work, so we pretty much had a long distance ""relationship"" with physical dates every few months. At the time I had just begun to develop and get deeper and deeper into anorexia, so I was vulnerable, longing to be understood and felt unloved and lovable. On top of that, I was raped (by someone else) that summer. I assume that made it a lot easier for him to groom me. He was hot and then cold, manipulative, made empty promises etc. It was like he intentionally gave me hope that he cared about me as much as I did about him, only to treat me like crap the next day. Over the years, there were several occasions where he literally told me to stop spending time with other people because only he cares about me and I should spend all my time talking to him. 


My mother was very much against the relationship, so when we met, we couldn't hang out in my room. Instead, he'd pressure me into performing sexual acts in hidden corners in public. He didn't even invite me into his hotel room - because he was hiding me from his wife I didn't know about. A few days after my 16th birthday, he made me give him a blowjob in a park. From then on, every time we met, it was clear I was supposed to perform oral on him. And I did, because I was in love and thought we could be something. Meeting him always went like this: He'd tell me he was in town for a few days and didn't have much time, would I like to see him? He'd say he was going to call me and tell me to be ready to go and meet him as soon as the call came. I was always so excited and completely crushed when it didn't work out. So, one day when I was 17, he called me when I was in school. I happened to be on break, so I went straight to the train station to go where he wanted to meet. He took me to a park and led me to a part  with a lot of trees and bushes where we wouldn't be seen. I don't remember the details, but he pulled down my tights and tried to penetrate me anally which didn't work. All I know is he left and I had to get out of that area. When I came out between the trees and bushes, a young woman saw me and asked me if I was okay and if I needed help. I was so embarrassed and unaware that I did need help because my ""boyfriend"" had just raped me. There was another time he raped me anally. I remember feeling awful afterwards and I tried to piece together my emotions in writing over Skype, but he completely ignored it.

When I was 17, I tried finding information on him using things I saw in his Facebook pictures. I succeeded. That night, I learned that 1) he had been married for over 10 years 2) he was living in the same town when we first met, and did so for almost a year until he moved to another town. He never lived in the country he claimed to live in. 3) he wasn't 8 years older than me, but 17 years 4) even his name was fake. He was using his middle name as his first name, but the last name was made up.

My world came crashing down. Over the years I had noticed several inconsistencies, but I chose to ignore them. Like when we were voice chatting on Skype when I suddenly heard a female voice in the background and he hung up... I decided not to confront him with the information because I felt I was in the wrong for snooping. It hurt so much being forced to connect the dots whenever he logged out of Skype all of a sudden or when we met and he said he was too busy to spend more time with me, knowing he was going back to his wife. His wife had an online presence on social media and it was awful seeing photos of their life together while I was only good enough to masturbate for him on Skype. 

After graduating high school, my life improved, I made friends, got a job, spent time outside my room, fell in love with another guy etc. but I still talked to him. I was fed up with his lies and told him I knew everything. He didn't even apologise. He even had the gall to guilt trip me for having my first consensual PIV with someone other than him. 

I'm still not nearly done processing this ""relationship"". It took me a while to realise he was a predator, groomer and abuser and that an adult being attracted to a teenager is not okay. It's not okay for an adult to make a teenager undress and perform sexual acts on camera. It took me a while to realise our relationship was never equal and my consent was manufactured and based on lies. I didn't truly realise our relationship was traumatising until four or five years after it ended. It's a really touchy subject that I haven't really started unpacking in therapy because of the shame that comes with seemingly consenting to this. For years I ignored everyone's warnings and concerns. I was really defensive when it came to him and hung on to our relationship at all costs. However, I have to admit a part of me misses him, the relationship and the time. I truly loved him (or more accurately I felt what I thought was love, I guess), and when he made me feel good I felt amazing. Everything he did made me experience intense emotions when I was numb to pretty much everything outside my mental illness. I was painfully lonely due to my eating disorder and distancing myself from everyone, so the bones he threw me gave me hope for a future in which I could be loved. I believed him when he said he cared about me, and I was aware he did spend several hours a day away from his wife to talk to me.

Wait a minute this is a condition? I never knew I had this|yeah, that was my first reaction when somebody told me about it!! i totally thought when i was younger everybody did it as bad as i did.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf1nh3/)
I have this too, as a result of OCD. Hair, eyebrows, pimples, scabs, you name it. Do your loved ones know, or do you find yourself hiding it?|When i was younger, my parents had no idea it was not absolutely natural. It was relatively easy to hide until i hit puberty, now my face is full of just.. red. I try hard to hide it but when it comes to anything on my face, it always gets brought up from worry. I only found out it was actually a condition a few months ago, so only my parents know ive been diagnosed. otherwise anybody that knows me pretty much knows that i pick at any surface of my body and make it bleed on the regular. But yeah, if i could just make pimples not appear, i would so much rather everybody not know|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf31q2/)
What does s/h mean? Also what does treatment consist of? I feel like I might have this but do a pretty ok job at hiding it so I'm nervous about asking for help.|s/h means self harm. so hurting yourself on purpose. I havent found much that can help, but I've noticed that an increase of my ADHD meds (a stimulant) causes me to be more anxious, and unaware that I'm picking. On a day to day basis the best thing I've found is just holding something in my hand like a squishie or another stim toy, and avoid looking at pimples or anything like that on others. Honestly, if if you can being it up with your doctor and if needed, without your parents|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frfgld3/)
It's also known as tweeking.  I didn't know that non-metheads did that stuff.  It's got to be miserable.  My ex's family has a few dope addicts and I've seen them dig big ass holes in their faces ""working on a pimple"".|oh damn, I didnt even know that was an effect of that.  Honestly, from so many years of it, unless I really dig a bad one (a scab)then I usually am numb to the pain. but the visual effects are for sure really noticeable|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frexrpg/)
What kind of medication do you take?  That sounds a lot like what my husband does .. he constantly picks at the back of his head, and it got infected bad one time and had to have it drained.   He doesn't even know he is doing it half the time.|For adhd to help my focus, i take concerta and for depression, prozac. Yea, a common occurence from it is that you dont usually notice when you are picking then suddenly theres blood everywhere. It does sound a bit like that, and im sorry he had to go through that!! Ive only had minor infections, nothing thats sent me to the hospital or anything.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frexsak/)
What spot on your body do you visit the most?|either my face or arms. most of my worst scars are on my arms, from having such easy access for so many years. I wear t-shirts often so its hard to resist there|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf28nk/)
What’s your favorite thing to pick at?|scabs!! bug bites in the summer especially. although its incredibly pleasing, i hate picking pimples. anythig shaped like a bubble gets me riled up to do it really|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf31lf/)
How do people react to seeing you?|people stare. alot. especially little kids. it doesnt help that i also have dyed hair and usualky stand out in a crowd, but ive gotten used to people just awkwardly noticing all the redness|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frf63pi/)
If you start ADHD meds avoid amphetamines both me and my friends have found it can make you pick and scratch|yeah, I have found that having a high dose of my old stimulant heightened alot of my problems, including the scratching and stuff|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frfsyu4/)
I have this but with my nails and the skin around them. I chew and pick my fingers and toes. For some reason this kind isn't considered as serious because ""oh yeah I'm a nail biter too.""  It's gotten so bad that my dentist a couple years go said the dentine is wearing down on my teeth, and that's hard to restore, and that I needed to stop. The picking of my skin has led to scarring that I was told may be permanent.  I'm getting scared I'm ruining myself for good and I don't know what to do. I've had a lot of success with antidepressants quelling some that compulsive behavior, but that's it. I have ADHD as well and I take medication for it, but that hasn't really made a difference.  Have you found any success in any treatment?|unfortunately, no. this is also a symptom of mine but with picking the skin with my nails, not teeth. Yeah a big stresser for me is the fact that so much of the scars are permanent. I really feel you on that one. Unfortunately the only thing I've found that helps is having toys (like stim toys, squishes etc)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frg7zg3/)
Do you perhaps like to dabble in the methamphetamines?|No, I havent taken any drugs like that. heard that it was a factor for some other people though, which I can see. as far as I can remember I've had it for a long while, furthest memory is destroying a mosquito bite when I was 8|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frghjnk/)
Oh my God how much worse is it quarantine? My skin is badd|it's so terrible!! at least when I was in school I had distractions, being bored is the worst part of it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gobrsa/i_have_dermatillomania_ama/frgw2k3/)

"fpjvoqc","I’m a lesbian and while I never really identified with “conservative” when I was young and unaware that I was gay, I did grow up in a Christian home that had some conservative values. Being a Christian was part of my identity as a kid. I accepted God into my heart when I was 5, went to church every Sunday, my parents were involved with Young Life and so was I. I was never specifically enthusiastic about it (getting me to church was always a chore), but it was part of my identity.

I moved halfway across the country for college and that’s when I started to realize I may be into chicks. Since I wasn’t living at home anymore, I stopped going to church and didn’t really involve myself in any Christian specific activities, but I still believed in God. It probably took me 4 years to no longer consider myself a Christian which is about the same amount of time it took me to accept and acknowledge I was a lesbian. Those 4 years were hard for a variety of reasons and one was trying to find a balance between my beliefs and my orientation. I read and researched a lot and came to my own conclusions in the process. I consider myself an agnostic now, I honestly just don’t give a shit about if there is or isn’t a God. I don’t think it particularly matters much, at least not to me.

It’s really hard to unravel all these things at once when they’re instilled in you at such a young age and become so much a part of who you are even if you aren’t hyper enthusiastic about it. Being Christian can be a part of your identity that really binds you and your family. There are a lot of shared experiences and memories that I have that are associated with my family’s religious beliefs. I often feel like an outsider in my family for being gay and then I’m also an outsider for not being a Christian and I think dealing with that in your teens and 20s can be really difficult because you’re still in the process of figuring out who you are in a variety of ways. I’m 36 now and much more confident in who I am than I was when I was younger so it makes it easier. I think it’s kind of fun to be the outsider now, especially since I have a lot of young nieces and nephews who I can offer different perspectives to.

While it hurts to cling to beliefs that don’t respect you, it also hurts to feel alone and rejected by people that are supposed to love you unconditionally. Feeling like you need to choose one hurt over the other is incredibly difficult. I think for some people at least in one situation they don’t feel alone and it’s a hurt they’ve at least been dealing with for a while, a hurt they’re comfortable with. I think a lot of these types are just looking for answers to help deal with their conflicting thoughts. I don’t think seeking them out in r/conservative is a responsible decision, but I think some people are desperately seeking validation from those that are comfortable with. It’s a hard thing to understand unless you’re actively in it. I was fortunate that while it was difficult for my family initially to come to terms with me being gay and it took a lot of time on their side, they never stopped loving me and they came to my wedding last September. I still don’t know how my family actually feels about homosexuality, but I also don’t care anymore because I feel loved and accepted by them and that’s all that really matters to me right now.",1588682233,"i’m a lesbian and while i never really identified with “conservative” when i was young and unaware that i was gay, i did grow up in a christian home that had some conservative values.","young and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"young and unaware","young",NA,NA,0

"fm792p0","I just learned that we're going to be closed until next year. Wow. But I've been doing this for a long time. Usually, at the end of the year, I get into...Shakespeare. Why? Because standardized testing is over, nobody is looking at my classes and trying to control what I'm doing and...I like Shakespeare. It's for me. Every time I teach the plays I teach, I learn something new or find a new source or find a new way to look at them.

Usually, things get kinda weird. See, I don't want the kids to just 'get how beautiful the words are!' Most of them aren't ready for appreciating it at that level. I want them to understand who the people are, why they do the things they do and what Shakespeare was trying to convey.

Example: at the beginning of 'Julius Caesar', Caesar is going into a festival at the head of his troops. The festival involves a foot-race around the city, run by young men. He sees Antony off to the side and calls him over. Antony, he says, when you run around the city, make sure you pay attention to my wife, Calpurnia. Antony says he will, absolutely. 

What no one ever talks about is that this is a fertility festival. 

(those with sensitive stomachs should stop right about....here.)

Before the race, the young men sacrifice goats and dogs. They flay the animals, getting covered with blood as they slice the animal skins into long strips. The young men then run around the city waving these bloody strips. If a woman wants to ensure an easy pregnancy or safe birth, she steps forward and opens her arms. The young men then pause in their race to whip her with the bloody skins, 'blessing' her. 

And we discuss fertility and the disconnect between how they (teens) feel about pregnancy and how adults then (and now) saw it as proof that the gods had blessed you. This leads to discussing the symbolism of the gifts they've been getting every Easter since they were babies (eggs...bunnies...on green grass...). This leads to a broader discussion of 'rituals' and how they don't even know they practice certain rituals in their lives-

-but all along, I'm driving to this point: what kind of husband PUBLICLY ANNOUNCES that his wife is the reason they don't have kids? He's insensitive and unaware that he's insensitive. He misses the cues around him (and what happens right after this? The soothsayer warns him about the ides of March and Caesar disregards him as crazy...if Caesar had paid attention to the warnings, the signs all around him [WHICH, I KNOW, IS KINDA THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PLAY], maybe he would have lived.

And I can do this because nobody is pushing pushing pushing, gotta get those scores up (my scores are just fine, better than most) and I can take these deep dives and burn tons of calories and INSIST THAT MY STUDENTS GO WITH ME, because now, that's their grade.

So I have to figure out: how do I do this with Google Docs, a GoPro and the whiteboard I'm going to buy tomorrow?

"fm5icjw","Well, that's unfortunate. I'm really  sorry to hear that he is being so careless of your needs. I assume that means he did not follow through on your convo about the quarantine contract? The problem is, if he was merely  being  unobservant and unaware that you were overwhelmed that's  one level of problem, but if he knows and isn't  moved to step up his game that's  a whole other level of problem. Then it moves beyond the specific things you need done and becomes a broader relationship issue, about selfishness and how well he is caring for you (as you should both be caring for eachother). Right now it sounds like you're the only one doing any care taking. This sort of thing has the capacity to rock a relationship's foundation. There are only two things I  can think of to suggest. One is that he may not feel that your conversations are mutual, but that he is being ""bossed around"", because he doesn't  see the need for x,y or z to get done, so he feels like it's just a problem you have and that you are creating a  problem for him, especially if  you are coming to him with a list. If that's  the case then approaching it Socratically may help - by which I mean phrasing everything  as a question. Instead of ""the clogged sink needs to be fixed"", you could try ""Do you agree that we need to keep the house maintained while we are on quarantine?"" ""what do you think needs doing around here?"" ""Do you think the sink needs to get unclogged?"" Then every response can be followed by more questions. If he says no than you can ask ""why not?"" If he says yes you can ask ""Do you think that's  a chore you can take on, or would you rather tackle a different one?"" If he says a different  one than which would he prefer? If he agrees that he will do it you  can ask ""What day can you do it by?"" If he sets a date too far off you can ask ""Does it seem healthy  for the kids to have bacteria growing in the sink that long?"" Of course if you choose this you have to ask these questions in a tone of voice that says you care what his answers are and you have to listen and consider if he has a point. If you ask in an irritated tone he will just get defensive. The point of all this being to get him using his own agency in planning for household  care in a realistic way instead of glossing over it. That's  frustrating though because it really feels like a lot of handholding of a grown man and dancing around that in a mutual relationship you shouldn't have to do. Which leads to the only other suggestion I can make, which is that he is thinking of all this as a set of discrete issues - that you want quiet time, that you want chores done, and not seeing that it has the potential to be a much bigger problem for your relationship if he disregards you when you feel overwhelmed and creates a distance between you because you feel uncared for. So you could approach the conversation from that angle. At the end of the day though no amount of juggling how you approach him can solve it. He has to choose from in himself to respond. I hope he chooses to hear you! I am wishing you luck.",1585773506,"the problem is, if he was merely  being  unobservant and unaware that you were overwhelmed that's  one level of problem, but if he knows and isn't  moved to step up his game that's  a whole other level of problem.","unobservant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unobservant and unaware","unobservant",NA,NA,0

"fkwk84r","I am not trying to downplay the importance of testing and recognize that I may be missing a very important piece of the picture here -- but I am a bit confused at the moment. 

It seems that the amount of testing we are conducting has essentially been framed as directly equivalent to our handling of this and our potential success in confronting the virus's spread. 

My confusion is in squaring that with the measures that have been taken and the instruction being given to the public - particularly bearing in mind that where we are now, is so well beyond the phase of trying to isolate the virus and prevent it from spreading state to state, etc...

It would seem, and again -- I could be totally missing something huge here -- that the crucial part of testing is to not only have a clear picture of where we're at but also so that anyone, particularly those who are asymptomatic and unaware that they are potentially virulent and contagious, can be ID'd and appropriately isolated and ""social distanced"". 

But -- it seems that we are already essentially applying that level of instruction to EVERYONE. If everyone is being told (or at this point - mandated) to isolate and essentially behave as if they were already infected -- how is it that testing remains such a crucial part of the process? 

And would having isolation and quarantine be more based on testing not run the risk of actually having MORE people remain active until or unless they got a positive test - as opposed to simply going all in and having EVERYONE behave as-if, test or not, as we're doing now?

Just trying to connect the dots. But it would seem that even if we had tests for everyone immediately - the action to be taken would be the same as what's being done now, would it not?",1584595069,"it would seem, and again -- i could be totally missing something huge here -- that the crucial part of testing is to not only have a clear picture of where we're at but also so that anyone, particularly those who are asymptomatic and unaware that they are potentially virulent and contagious, can be id'd and appropriately isolated and ""social distanced"".","asymptomatic and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asymptomatic and unaware","asymptomatic",NA,NA,0

Best advice available is to wash your hands, continue social distancing and encourage elderly and immunocompromised people to distance themselves as well (they are most at risk of severe illness or death if infected).      
It is likely that many people are already infected, but may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infecting others.  Unless we test large numbers of people we will never know for sure.      
Where we will have trouble is if too many people fall ill at once and overwhelm the available health system.

"fkrmxw5","My parents have passed away but I am quite sure that if my mom was still here she'd be saying what your parents are saying :/ Like yours, they fought with each other for decades, threatening divorce til the end but never following through. This was probably because making each other miserable was familiar and predictable, and maybe even satisfying at some level. 

I've been thinking about them over the past few days because my brother is super concerned about his finances now that his industry is tanking due to coronavirus. He has also over-leveraged himself with a few investments that are rapidly losing their value. For him, like for my mom, it was always so important to have the approval - or rather envy - of others, even if that meant borrowing money and being single-mindedly focused on work and the acquisition of wealth and status, usually to the detriment of their social relationships.  It's not as though any of this made either of them happy - like hungry ghosts, they were never satisfied by the things they bought because things couldn't fill the emptiness inside. 

Now that the economy is tanking he is super depressed and anxious and wants to know that he can rely on me for financial help. I find myself angry that he has unthinkingly been living exactly the way my mother did - he's lived his life til now with the sole aim of proving himself as ""successful"", even at serious cost to his own health, and now that it's all crashing down, his sense of self worth is going down with it.  I can't help but see the influence of a mother who lived her life trying to show us that the most important thing was to build a life capable of making others seethe with jealousy. Even if that life was really rotten behind the curtains. 

Like my mom who visited me twice in ten years of living in a city a drivable distance from her (i was always expected to go to them, because her work was too important), my brother has been absent in my times of need, choosing to book multiple holidays a year with his partner or alone instead of planning visits or joint holidays even. His partner is a narcissist who reminds me of my mother...she  lets her dogs have first rights to space on their couches when me and my partner come over, neglecting to get them to move so my partner and I can sit. Because the dogs are like her kids. And now they want a bail out from me. 

I have a lot of anger about this. I feel like my family tree is filled with poisoned fruit - I see the same patterns repeated among all of the extended family members. With most of them I've gone no contact. These are not rewarding relationships - they are hungry ghosts focused on their own needs above all else, and nothing is ever enough for them either. No amount of concern, no amount of money or care will satiate the emptiness they feel. Like how your sister's good will in gifting your parents a holiday was met with slaps and abuse. 

I agree with you that emotional maturity is required to grow out of such family situations. It is unfortunate that family members like these are so emotionally stunted and unaware that they can only make life miserable for those around them. 

I wrote all this because your story resonated with me, and I am sure others can relate too. I hope you are doing ok. It sounds like you have managed to come out of your family situation with a good understanding of what's what. And you're right, it bothers you so much because you still love them despite all their problems. Hang in there, you're not a bad person for not wanting to call for another earful of ""you don't care about me."" 

I still feel a lot of pain when i think about my upbringing, even with them gone. I mourn for the parental support I never had, and unfortunately will probably never have, though I can try and not repeat their mistakes with my kid when they come along.",1584472006,"it is unfortunate that family members like these are so emotionally stunted and unaware that they can only make life miserable for those around them.","stunted and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"emotionally stunted and unaware","stunted",NA,"emotionally",0

We have no idea how many of them will get sick, because (as the South Korea numbers show), a LOT of young people have COVID and show zero symptoms. Without the SK government's intensive testing, those young people would be out in the community, spreading COVID. Instead, they're at home or hospital getting treatment.

**In America, all those young people are untested and unaware that they're sick. They have no idea they're spreading the virus.** In a few weeks, those young people might be fine or they might be fucked, but one thing is certain: the people they've spread it to includes a lot of older folks who will not survive the summer. The older folks who get it die. Not a few here or there. Like 10% for the 60+ cohort.

The lowest, serious estimate of death toll from COVID in America alone was 475,000. To put that in perspective, that's about 160 9/11s this spring and summer. And that's not the worst-case scenario. That's the scenario where we shut down the country as best we can and try to ride this out.

"fhzuxcm","Rain fell from the blackened sky. It fell in constant windy waves and landed among the rustiling canopy of the trees that young Adam was currently weaving through. With each frantic stride the the young boy in the jean jacket and look of horror on his face was getting farther and farther out of the woods next to the small town of Black Creek, Alberta. As Adam began to see the dim lights of the town peeking through the thick of shadowy trees in front of him he failed to see the protruding root underneath him. Catching the top of his foot the young man crashes into the ground, his arm twisting underneath his torso shot a sharp pain up his shoulder. Wet grass and rain water splash upwards as Adam tries to scramble up to his feet with only one arm, the other tucked to his side in pain. The young boy was so close to home and the thing behind him was getting nearer.  

The small town of Black Creek,with a population under a thousand, was whisper quiet as it was almost 2 in the morning; most residents worked for the local mill and were up by 5 in the morning to be on time for their shift. This included both Adams parents, who were sound asleep and unaware that their son had snuck out of the house. Unaware that the thing in the woods was only a few steps away from there only son. It snarled and snapped at the young boy, lines of drool landing onto the jean jacket and mixing with the rain water that fell upon him.

Adam slowly, shakily, turned his head to look at the thing chasing him. It loomed over the frightened boy and was mostly masked in the shadow produced by the tree canopy that blocked the moonlight, from time to time a gap would open and outline the beast in a dim glow from the town. From what little the boy could see a monster stood before him. Head of animal bone and antler. Skin of torn flesh that was pulled tightly across its tall bipedal frame.The ghoulish beings arms began to outstretch and reach at the child laying below it. All the while the storm above raged and roared with lightning and thunder, which gave Adam clearer views.

The boy screamed. He Kicked and punched with one good arm, a clawed hand with dead skin hanging off of bone finally grips the jean jacket he wore, the creature stands upright and throws Adam towards the edge of the woods. Another hard fall to the ground and Adam tumbles down the hill that reaches up towards the forest. The rain was no longer shielded by the trees above and began to fully drench Adam with sheets of water. Adam struggled to stand, his injured arm further hurt from the second fall and dizziness from the rolling.

As soon as he could the young boy wearing a now heavily soaked jean jacket looks towards the monster, however he sees none. Just a dark line of trees with shadows as black as the night sky. Adam cries out and runs towards the town, he knew he was told never to go into the forest at night but he knew he needed to get help. Instead of sneaking in the window into his room as planned he instead slammed and knocked on the front door of his locked home to wake up his parents.

The door flies open and Adams father sees the young boy, soaked to the bone and holding a dislocated shoulder. He drops the bat he was holding which clatters to the ground and grabs his son bringing him into the hall, frantically questioning what had happened to him. After a few minutes of scared sobbing Adam could finally tell his father about the thing in the forest. The father’s heart stops for a moment as he listens.When he is finished Adams father lets go of the still crying child and rushes to the door quickly shutting it and making sure to lock the deadbolt.

It was only a few days later when a vehicle was seen pulling into the town of Black Creek, Alberta. It was said to be painted turquoise blue with a nice mosaic of flowers along side of it. Parking at the sheriff's office the 5 occupants leave the vehicle. A woman in an orange sweater with dark rimmed glasses. A well dressed blonde man with an ascot.

"fcdtizw","&gt; A universal healthcare scheme in the United States would ultimately lead to the majority paying for the minority, who, in the US, tend to be in the worst health. This would not be a very good think for social cohesion, to say the least.

Its also going to get really stressful when (assuming it happens in 2020) that we ramped up to socialized expensive universal healthcare just before the baby boomers our biggest generation hits their geriatric period of their lives and our healthcare costs are going to go through the roof.

&gt;
And because increasing taxes on the wealthy is also unlikely due to the nature of politics in the US, universal healthcare would ultimately end up burdening the lower-upper through lower-middle classes and increasing the debt to even more catastrophic levels.

The belief that we are going to pay for such an expensive system through taxes on the wealthy is hilariously and pathetically not feasible.  I'm all for a progressive tax system where the wealthy pay the most amount of tax (they do already), and where capital gains is equal to income (should already be this way), but wealth taxes, jamming taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals to the sky, is going to implode the countries economy.

The Mueller Report confirmed that many people in Trump's election campaign were associated with Russia and doing illegal deals with Russian agents, and that Trump's sons attempted to make illegal deals with Russian agents but weren't able to actually do so. (Mueller appeared to be really generous in assuming the best from Trump's sons in that section IMHO...)

Donald Trump is then either completely incompetent and unaware that many people he hired who were working directly on his campaign were compromised and working for Russia, or aware and complicit in their deals. Neither one of which is something we should expect from the President of the United States.   


Likewise, the President's adamant refusal to release his tax returns, even after promising he would do so, combined with the statement by Trump's sons that they do a lot of business with Russia, is troubling. When you add that to the above, it may not be hard and fast proof, but it sure does seem fishy.   


Add to that the fact that many of Trump's decisions in foreign policy end up favoring Putin, the fact that he literally asked Russia to hack Hillary's e-mails on television, the withdrawal of several sanctions Obama placed on Russia, and a pattern emerges.

His decisions to side with Putin's word over the US intelligence services, his withdrawal of US forces from countries at odds with Russia, the fact that he's had secret meetings with the President of Russia against standard policy, his active interference in Mueller's investigation into Russian ties to his campaign, all of which don't make much sense for the President of the United States under normal circumstances.

As someone who has worked service positions, and who knows people who've been in delivery and transportation services, you're not in the wrong.

The king does not speculate about the debtor's motivations, nor try to justify his behavior, nor pretend trust still exists. He simply cancels he debt: The debtor doesn't owe him any restitution. 

Now both the debtor and the king are free. The debtor, obviously, no longer has the king's anger hanging over him as a threat. But the king, too is free: He can now look at his servant without being filled with feelings of betrayal, anger, or need to punish.

"exsfa3h","There is a magical syndrome called the Cloning Disease which can infect any human or alien humanoid. It secretly turns them into a giant shapeshifting amoeba (although they still retain the outward appearance and texture of whatever species they used to be, so that the victim isn't alerted to their having a problem, at least initially).

The only risk the Cloning Disease must make to alert its victim to its presence is to ramp up the victim's appetite, which is part of the Cloning Disease's method of reproduction. So whenever the victim can eat enough to increase their weight by a significant amount, the Cloning Disease then afflicts the victim with temporary insanity--the pathogen is not self-aware, but it is still capable of taking over the victim's mind temporarily, compelling him or her to flee from their comfort zone and go find a nice place to hide for a few hours where no one will think to look for them.

This is when the pathogen compels the victim to divide by mitosis, and is when the disease is most vulnerable, since if they are now discovered it will be clear what's really going on. The victim strips naked and the body sheds its outer layers of camouflage, so that the humanoid-shaped mass of protoplasm can finally do its splitting-apart thing. After this, the Cloning Disease again goes dormant in both the old and new copy of the victim, so that both copies of the victim will eventually regain consciousness. Whichever copy wakes up is allowed by the organism to realize fully what's going on--that they are no more who or what they used to be, but now how to learn how to survive as a fugitive and leave their old life behind. This copy steals the clothes and whatever valuables had been left behind and vanishes into the urban night.

The second copy to awaken is still infected, but he or she has her memories suppressed--as far as they know, they might have been drugged and robbed and left in this alleyway to sleep off the sedative. So they will go back to their old life, file a police report, and be none the wiser--still ever hungry, and unaware that there is now another version of themselves, a doppelganger if you will (or maybe two, five, or twenty, or who knows) roaming the streets of their city, or the corridors of their home space station, or their starship posting, or whatever.

The Cloning Disease is known to some law enforcement and special investigative units tasked with dealing with both technological and supernatural threats. They look for reports of muggings and being left naked in a storage closet or an alleyway somewhere. They also have a database of known infected Clones who have so far escaped capture. Some of the more dangerous victims have been able to skip from world to world, station to station, colony to colony, evading facial recognition  systems and continuing to carry the Cloning Disease with them.

Yes, it is possible for one of you to have not gotten it, but I would still inform both of them just in case. The person who I contracted it from was asymptomatic and unaware that he had anything. So I called him and just basically said, ""Hey, I was wondering if you had a second to talk. I just wanted to let you know that I was just diagnosed with genital herpes; in this case, HSV1. As my blood tests came back negative from January to March, and you're the only person who I've had any contact with in the time it would take for my initial outbreak to occur, I'm fairly confident that I contracted it from you. I just wanted to let you know so that you can go get tested and take the proper precautions moving forward.""

He was devastated and kept apologizing to me, but we later found out that he had dated someone with HSV1 for a long time, and chances were that he had gotten it from her and just never had an outbreak, so he was unaware. I told him I wasn't angry at him (which was true; I was angry at the situation but not at him) because he hadn't known, but I just wanted to ensure that he knew so he could be more careful moving forward.

It's what you just said: ""I would consider freedom a good thing."" Why? There's nothing *intrinsically good* about freedom. In absolute freedom, I could just kill you because I felt like it. Is that good?

We should only care about freedom when freedom provides benefits to us. I shouldn't have the freedom to murder you, right? Clearly not.

&gt; I would say that the putting parents in jail is unnecessary and the education of the child could be enforced by the state without putting the parent in jail.

Yes, but this is a position he *advocates* for. It's not just a personal one. And he believes that companies *should* enforce these practices.

"esq18fq","I know many would disagree with me, but for me I think she doesn't like him as of right now. Her views on him are entirely platonic. HOWEVER, I would also say that more than she can't or isn't seeing him romantically, it's more like she has grown closer to him to the point that she is mistaking her affections for a close friendship. In other words: she isn't aware that she likes him. She's so dense that she's oblivious to even her own feelings. Reason? She gives the vibes that she cares about him more than a friend but at the same time gives vibes that she doesn't like him like the other girls clearly do. She does blush quite a bit when Fuutaro is around, but her honest behaviour tells me that she sees it more like being embarassed of the opposite sex and her closeness to Fuutaro, which she may percieve as inappropiate for a relationship between 2 students. Also every girl has had their feelings built up to the point where they admit it and become aware of those feelings. Itsuki hasn't had that yet. Many point different parts of the manga where she gets flustered with him around, but why are her feelings kept as mysterious when the other girls display what they feel and had proper built up to their revelation? With Yotsuba it made sense because she is Lolikano and her feelings were tied with the reveal of her identity. Itsuki doesn't have that (that we know of) and it would feel like repeating Yotsuba's gimmick of the girl who has been aware of her feelings the whole time but chooses to not pursue her feelings because of her sisters/other reasons. For me it just feels right for her character to be completely dense and unaware that she likes him, mistaking her blushes for mere embarassment. She just doesn't seem like the character who would hide that big of a burden without showing some sort of guilt/remorse. Just carrying Yotsuba's secret was so hard on her that she decided to break her promise to her and make Fuutaro remember who Lolikano was. That being said, imo this is why this arc is so important, because when she realizes that she likes him, she'll look back and remember all the moments they had together and see that she cared a lot about what he thought of her, cared about their times together and going as far as she could not only for her sisters' or Raiha's sake, but also Fuutaro's.",1562193640,"for me it just feels right for her character to be completely dense and unaware that she likes him, mistaking her blushes for mere embarassment.","dense and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely dense and unaware","dense",NA,"completely",0
"espgkmr","What are your thoughts on the way they consistently deny having plastic surgery? 

That someone’s choices about what they choose to do with THEIR bodies is THEIR business and that being a public figure does not give anyone the right to demand a list of their medical procedures, what type of Spanx they’re wearing and who installed their extensions.

Let’s just clarify things here, this is not about the **Kardashians** specifically right? Saying that the reason you feel “icky” about them is because they deny it and they’re role models and I can only guess at how you must feel about say, Nicole Kidman, John Travolta, Michael Jackson and we could go on and on and on.

Not you or anyone else is entitled to demand someone’s medical record because they’re popular. Their bodies do not belong to you just because they’re rich and famous. And trying to legitimize it by saying they’re role models and people admire them sounds pretty hypocritical given the sheer number of models, actors, singers and other cultural celebrities that are admired by the exact same people and not asked to undergo an x ray to prove that they don’t have butt implants.

I don’t know where you got this idea that all these uneducated and impressionable girls that you say you’re concerned for actually exist.

Are you going to stick with that? Because I challenge you to google “Kylie Jenner lips” and tell me  how far down the page you have to scroll to get to the first mention of surgery and lip fillers. It’s insane to me that anyone would say “if they don’t publicly list all their surgeries then how will the young women who admire them know that they weren’t born like that?” I’m guessing the hundreds and hundreds of hours that a camera follows them around from reality show to paparazzi.

&amp;#x200B;

***From National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future (NCTAF)***

•	Nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within their first five years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think the main reason is that teachers, liked school, they were good at it, they agreed that rules and requirements mattered, they respected the process and their roles within it, and they were surrounded by like-minded people in their high school honors classes and collegiate peers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then  they get into teaching and quickly find out that teachers (and people like that) are NOT the norm.  College grads (4 year grads, not 2 year or ""I went to a semester of juco"") are less than 25% of the population.  WE are the ""weird"" ones"" Not them.  And that's hard to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of teens are, to be blunt, brutal. They cant wake up on time, deal with ""no"" very well, dont want to work hard, incredibly selfish and unaware that it's not all about them.   And to go from everyone in your community at college is on board with school, and rules and working hard and all that to 125 students most of which would rather skip meals than be without their Instagram updates or work towards making their families proud, well . . . it's a huge shock. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I didnt go to college to baby-sit teenagers"" is a common complaint by new teachers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I teach at a low-level Chicago public high school, so my view may be a bit skewed to the negative, but the turnover in my building has been MASSIVE the past few years. I feel like a stranger in my own building lately.  I barely know any of their names.   

&amp;#x200B;

Teaching is simultaneously the best and toughest job in the world.  For many the toughest part outweighs the best part and they give up on a career they spent four years and $100K earning a degree in.  If that doesnt tell you how hard it is, nothing else really will.  

&amp;#x200B;

What do they do after they figure out that their English/History ed degree will never be used despite paying $100K for it?   IF you have a degree in Math/Science Ed, you have lots of non-teaching options, but all those in non STEM subjects?  I wonder what they do after they leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

""If you want to take things in that direction, I should mention that the Freeflow Fighting System, the foundation of the Arkham series, also goes against the spirit of Batman. He is supposed to be fast, decisive, strategic and stealthy, not someone who gets into huge brawls with a coliseum full of thugs.""

There are plenty of comic depictions of him facing several foes at the same time. Unorthodox, not to mention crazy, is to see bruce wayne with super-powers able to make several metahumans envy of him. Its making a game whose 2 most well-remembered gadgets are actually stolen from criminals. But we don't need to go so far as to the comics (or the 66s series). AO cant even remain faithful to what was depicted in AA and AC.

""The Shock Gloves aren't his technology.""

That's PRECISELY the point. You cant see the forest because there are way too many trees obscuring your view. If you cant see reason, justification or sense behind the criticism... Maybe you should question yourself if the problem lies not in you.

Do you need me to spell it out? If Batman uses the gadget for the majority of the game to the point that the stolen gadgets become the strongest memories, they are alien to the batman mythos. 

If am to play a superman game, i want to use the abilities commonly associated with him. Super-strength, super jumps, flying, heat vision... I do not want to read minds. I do not want to cast spells. If it is a Flash game, I do not want to swim and communicate with sea creatures with my mind. If it is a green arrow game, I do not want to cast spells and travel in time. 

In a nutshell: AO, with its gadgets and abilities is less faithful to what audiences expect from a batman game. And it is even less faithful to the 2 games it had the obligation to maintain consistency. 

Forget realism, forget danger. Think consistency. Think brand-recognition.


""Besides, there is also the danger.""

Ao is the game that practically eliminated the danger. All the games had devices that would be instant-kills for enemies, like exploding devices, the voice-gadget, but they would have very limited use. Most of the times you would only be able to use it once. Maybe twice. In the case of Knight, most predator rooms are filled with enemies, constantly adapting to his attacks and changing tactics. 

I mean, using the remote claw to eliminate 5 enemies in a room? This is way too easy. 

""Bruce Wayne is not stupid.""

Actually, if we take AO seriously, he certainly is. I mean, when he was still training in Asia he developed super-powers that far surpass anything he was able to do as Batman. Casting smoke that instead of alerting everyone in the room actually make him invisible and inaudible to the point that inside a predator scenario he can run towards the enemy and take him/her down safely? If he abandoned this technique, he is a fool. 

Also, he is a fool for trading a totally bad-ass Bat-suit and his working grapnel gadget to the tech we see in AA. 

He is also a fool for not using his ""dead zone"" hologram for crime scenes in AA and AC. AK used this device briefly on a scene just to give some recognition to AK and to state that such device indeed existed. They were trying to give some consistency to the story, something that AO never bothered to do.

AO and its story were so bad that the game did not just screw-up its own story, but conflicts with what we saw previously as depicted as the future. 

And this is not subjective criticism based on what pleases or displeases someone. This is actually factual analysis, factual criticism that one should not be able to deny in good faith.

But if that is your idea of a good story, go for it. Like I said, to each, his or her own.

""He is aware that it's very easy to kill someone with those gloves.""

I never accused the game of that. Because, in fact, the entire series depends on a lot of suspension of disbelief regarding lethality of the gadgets.

My point is that it makes no sense to make high-tech punches when he is young, but conventional punches later on. 

""Being young and full of anger,""

Funny thing, his ninja dlc actually shows that in order to complete his training it would be required of him to totally tame his rage. And yet, in the main story it is quite clear that he still struggles with it. We are obviously asking too much of WN by demanding that they be consistent with rocksteady. They cant even be consistent with themselves. But why bother? Some people will sweat that it was a great story, demonstrating perplexity with people being unable to recognize it as such and being critical of it. The unfairness...

""and in the middle of a situation that overwhelmed him, it's understandable that he took that risk or didn't know how risky it really was. But after, not so much. Especially considering he almost killed Bane with them.""

Wow.

I just saw a fan of AO trying to defend the shock gloves. Yep, a grown-man with training in several fields somehow is too naive and unaware that electric shocks can be lethal. Actually, you said he almost killed bane? The truth is, the shock gloves allowed him to save lives that night. If anything, it proved that he should continue to use it. You never know when someone may need to have the heart restarted. 

""The technology Batman has at his disposal doesn't even try to be realistic""

Please, do pay attention.

I never brought the term realism. This is the second time that you try to defend a a straw-man. The first being lethal danger. All while ignoring the points raised. 

What I did say was that the technology was nothing typically associated with Batman. 

""I don't what you are talking about with turning invisible and inaudible, though. Where are you getting that from?""

Did you actually play AO? Did you ever used Bruce Wayne on his story dlc or predator segments? Because he clearly has these abilities. 

""And the remote claw has limited ammunition.""

Just enough to take down the majority of enemies in some rooms. I mean, in one predator room, as far as I recalled, I was able to take down 5 enemies. There is effectiveness, there is coolness. And there is something called auto-win. And to make matters worse, it is not even a Batman gadget, but from one villain. 

""Even if you don't upgrade the Fear Takedowns even once, you can knock out a maximum of four opponents by pressing a button several times and moving the stick in the direction of the next enemy.""


Which is countered by the fact that Knight features many more predator and combat scenarios than any previous game, several of them with lots of enemies. 

"" Damn it, those WB Montreal idiots didn't add enough things in less than a year!"" ""

So its now our fault if AO was a rushed job that utilized assets and engine and still delivered a sub-par experience? 

If you can not see the validity of the criticism being raised, there is no hope.


""Damn it, they didn't take things from us so we could enjoy gliding around Gotham without the Grapnel Boost, a mechanic designed specifically because it would be boring and too slow to traverse an open world as Batman otherwise. Why can't they do anything right? ""

If I decide to set a story in the 17th Century, there are certain restrains. I can not have space travel, hiv virus, the internet, video-games, cellphones, chemotherapy for cancer... 

Guess what? If a certain technical element was so cool that it is deemed vital to be present in a follow-up, then that follow-up needs to exist in a panorama that would allow such element to exist without conflicts. 


Like I said, they just wanted to use Joker. Everything else was with the same tech or better than the one available in City. If WM cant deal with the consequences of setting a game in the distant past of that series, then, quite simply and easily do not set it there. Create an alternate timeline. Now, are the people disgruntled by such disregard or lore to blame? Or WM should be blamed? 

You can not eat your cake and keep it too. When writer make the decision to set the story in the past, they need to respect the limitations that this will involve. But they simply did not care. They had zero regard for the characters, and even for the other 2 games. 

And you know what the worst part is? AO, while being a terrible prequel, actually stands quite well on its own. If it was an independent game, or the first chapter in an entirely different timeline, it would have worked much better. 


""You're free to not like Origins.""

Well, thanks for the reassurance. 

""But don't tell me that all the criticism it gets is fair, because that's not true, anyone can see it.""

I dont know for a fact, since I never bother to read ""all the criticism"" it gets. That would be a terrible use of my time. But I suppose that with so many millions of people able to write reviews, any game will receive some sort of unfair criticism. And that is precisely why this is an empty complain on your part. What you say makes no sense unless it is something related to commonly made criticism against the game. Of the points you have raised, I actually think the game needs to be criticized more. 

""If you think so, you don't know much about writing.""

Ok. You have just defended a game for neglecting blunders in terms of storytelling that involve contradictions bigger than the sun, and I do not know about writing just because I have defended that it is entirely possible for a batman origin story to be told while leaving Joker behind? Ok, then.

Just so you know, AO is not even his Origin story. It is about the origin of the joker, not batman. Bruce was batman for a few years prior to that Xmas Night. So yes, that Batman was already an established and known crime-fighter for years, with no Joker.

So we know the president’s campaign INTENDED to get ILLEGALLY obtained dirt from the Russians to use against a political opponent to WIN the election. And then lied to us about it claiming it’s about child adoptions. But that’s okay with you cause you know, it’s not like it’s a Democrat seeking help from a foreign government or anything. 

&gt;The campaign was not, one individual was doing it without the support of the campaign.

As I said, there are over 200+ contacts and 33+ meetings between trump campaign and Russia. All of them acting as “individuals” and not with support of the campaign. Some of them lied to the Senate and investigators about these contacts like Sessions, Kushner, Papadopoulos, committing perjury. But that’s okay with you.though. So your argument is that the president is so unintelligent and unaware that he had no idea everyone in his inner circle are criminals?

&gt;That is because the federal government already spent $380 million on election security with the 2018 Help America Vote Act.

Which doesn’t flows into the 2019 fiscal year. This act came from 2002, we didn’t have Russia organizing political rallies, sending disinformation bots, and attempting to hack 33 states to help a candidate win back then. And intelligence believes they’ll do it again. Dont you think we should put a bit more care in?

&gt;Your source there is Michael Cohen's testimony alone, that is not a source.  

Actually it is. See Cohen lies to congress about that project and we know cause it’s in congressional record. And since lying about it wouldn’t benefit Cohen in anyway since it wasn’t directly relevant to any charges he was facing, then that means he was lying to protect Individual 1. Like he always does. And I don’t see why we shouldn’t believe him. Remember when Cohen implicates Trump in those campaign finance felonies with porn star payments Trump claimed he knew nothing nothing about until the FBI raised Cohen’s home and found taped with the 2 discussing those payments?

They don’t like England? They never get to SEE England.  CoD esports is a niche interest at best, in the UK it’s not widely supported, chances are when they are here as little money as possible is spent on them.

"el8e1ty","May I Introduce, The Vampire

Reasoning: I chose this character to be a dark elf because of their resistance to fire and vampires have a weakness to fire, so really the only drawbacks of being a vampire now is the sunlight damage.

Gear: The mighty count can wield either mephala’s daedric artifact, the Ebony Blade or use Harkon’s sword with a destruction spell in the other hand and wears the vampire royal armor with vampire gloves and boots, plus the diadem of the savant, you also can wear either the ring of the beast if you chose the Ebony Blade or the ring of the erudite if you chose the Harkon spell sword style and any enchanted necklace of choice.

Play style: His style of fighting is charging into battle without fear, chugging all kinds of powerful potions he has at his disposal and when you deem it brassard, turn into a Vampire Lord. With that kind of ancient knowledge, all will fall before you.

Companion: I think it’s rather obvious who The Vampire would want by his side but just in case, you’re going to want Serena by your side as you’re loyal servant. Also you should have the great stead Shadowmere as your mount.

Factions: The groups of people that you should  associate yourself should be evil and unaware that what they are doing is wrong. A good example of what kinds of people I mean are the Dark Britherhood. You should also do plenty of evil quests and quest that can make you more powerful, such as the main story and the daedric quests.",1555636158,"factions: the groups of people that you should  associate yourself should be evil and unaware that what they are doing is wrong.","evil and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"evil and unaware","evil",NA,NA,0

This was about 2 or 3 weeks before he moved in with us. He had come over to pick up his key and casually announced that a friend of his would be staying on our couch for a weekend while she was attending an anime convention with him in the city. Keep in mind he had arranged the whole thing without ever telling or consulting roommate #2 and I long before moving in.

The day he moved in, I came home from work to find that he had moved furniture that was in the common areas to make space for his. For example, we had a little table by a window that he decided to prop up vertically, just so that he could place his cat tree there. He left the table in that position, still next to the window, the whole day, until I told him he just couldn’t do that.

Here’s the kicker; he had also decided to leave his computer desk behind when he moved in, because he thought it was too cumbersome. The problem with that is that he also had a desktop gaming PC and suddenly no desk to put it on. I came home from work one day to find that he had hooked up his machine to our living room TV. He had a wired mouse and keyboard, so the computer itself was in the middle of the room, between the TV and the coffee table. My other roommate and I told him that we understood he didn’t have a desk and that it was fine for now, but that he had to find one as soon as possible. 

He agreed. 

What followed was weeks of him sitting on the couch and playing (raging at) League of Legends for hours on end, him leaving his PC in the middle of the living room whenever he stopped using it, roommate #2 and I then trying to put it in a spot that didn’t make it look like we literally had a desktop computer in the middle of the living room and us asking him daily if he had found a desk. He would always answer that he didn’t have enough money for it (though once, 10 minutes after telling me he was broke, he asked me if I knew anyone who was selling a Nintendo 64???).

I was so happy when an ex-coworker of mine wrote on Facebook that her company was giving away office furniture because they were moving offices.

It is your home too, so you shouldn’t feel bad for expressing how you feel about the goings-on in your home. You can suggest it like “we’re both adults, I think we should both get into the habit of keeping up with our home,” and if he agrees maybe make a weekly chore list. 

If he relents or doesn’t attempt any changes, then at least lay down a boundary with him and explain that his parents don’t need to clean the entire apartment for both of you. And that while you appreciate what they’ve done, there’s no reason for them to clean anything more than *his room and bathroom.* If his parents come over again, there’s nothing weird about talking to them and explaining how this makes you feel guilty/bad for them/embarrassed/(adjective). 

I like my friends’ parents, but I would be mortified if I found any of them cleaning my living room or taking out my garbage and I’d be furious if my friend laid around while they dumped our trash and cleaned up our mess. So, I get the bitterness at your friend for lounging while his parents pat his ass and make his bed for him. But he admitted he’s sheltered and immature, so it’s likely he’s just really spoiled and unaware that moving out means you have to learn how to be a responsible adult. And he also appears unaware of what this “visit” portrays him as to his peers; an irresponsible child who isn’t willing to take initiative or change (and children don’t make the best roommates). But I digress...

Everyone in this situation is adults, so as long as it’s discussed before tensions over his laziness rise, then there shouldn’t be an issue.

Sure. I agree. He stomped backwards. If he stomped straight down, he wouldn't've landed on the player. He had every right to the ground below him. He chose to kick backwards. We have video proof of that. The fact that you can't see the stomp backward live doesn't mean it didn't happen. That's the entire point of slow motion.

This was not a ""hard play"". He sees the guy coming to the ball low. He jumps. He goes knees up. He knows there's a guy sliding beneath him.

In slow mo, it looks like he intentionally stomps down. It's a fucking dirty play that could have been completely avoided.

That is all they do

They form plans to manipulate others, then they wildly accuse others of doing what they are doing

Back in 2012 CIA et all used malicious ""grassroots whistleblowing"" to get the Syrian files going and undermine Russia/Syria while promoting revolution 

https://wikileaks.org/Syria-Files.html

Imagine how in Lord of the rings, the villain Sauron is fooled into believing that Aragorn took the ring for his own power (because Sauron is selfish and power obsessed and assumes that his adversaries will be as well), and this is why Sauron is completely distracted and unaware that Frodo is sneaking in to Mordor to destroy the ring

Sauron never would have destroyed the ring because, being the evil villain, he's incapable of resisting the urge to power and allure to corruption, and so this controls his entire strategy of thought 

The western intelligence agencies, bankers, and ngos are much like the mythical villain Sauron in this respect (though I must add I find Sauron more likable), they are largely incapable of believing that anyone anywhere would ever act for idealistic or selfless reasons and they see such a thing as a pure anomaly 

Similarly many of the Soros linked ngos have been attacking Russia for years now, then the ""dcleaks"" group releases Soros org docs and that somehow gets conflated and combined with the whole ""FSB sleeper agent Seth Rich"" thing 

More recently, look into the reports against Huawei and their Chinese 5g

Western intelligence agencies whine that the ""yellow Nazis"" are going to spy on us if we use their 5g tech

But the intelligence agencies don't disclose that they ALREADY spy on all of us (see the ""five eyes"" group) and the real issue is that they can't put a backdoor in a foreign run infrastructure like Huawei

Obviously these groups don't want to disclose the fact that they spy on us, nor do they want to draw attention to the fact Chinese infrastructure and industry is now outcompeting us massively in tech (because of our incompetent worthless neo-commissar technocrats) so they instead create a lie about the Chinese 

There is absolutely 100% nothing that WikiLeaks could do to get these idiots to STFU anymore than they would drop the Chinese 5g propaganda 

I repeat: There is absolutely 100% nothing that WikiLeaks could do to get these idiots to STFU anymore than they would drop the Chinese 5g propaganda

A flurry of snow from above and below, but she knew it was better than the blizzard that had raged just days before. She considered herself lucky it had taken so long to outcast her. 

There was nothing but fresh snow through the horizon. The only hint of color on the barren prairie was the red of her wool cloak until a speck of black appeared. She smiled weakly before kneeling down, stretching out her hand. The orbs blinked in and out of sight until the arctic rabbit ran towards her. 

“All alone out here too, huh bud?” Roxanne asked her newest companion, scratching behind his long ears. “Least you know where you’re supposed to go.” 

A pang of sadness moved through her chest. 

She wondered how such a small and fearful creature could manage to trust her. Yet her own kind didn’t understand her. Human beings that had known her all her life clammed up where animals opened up to her. 

Animals. She understood them and trusted them. They were the ones she had always found true friendship in. It was a gentle and trusting animal that got her exiled into the snow, to begin with. 

“You should all be free,” She whispered to the rabbit. She rubbed his head once more and stood, causing it to skitter away. 
 
A deep breath of icy air filled her lungs, making her chest seize up for a moment. It reminded her that urgency was the only thing she had now. Her hood wouldn’t keep her safe forever; the council had exiled her with no supplies. Not even a compass. 

To keep her mind off the goosebumps and ache inside her bones, she forced her small body to move. Her slender frame went as fast as it was able to. She walked even as her leg muscles started to cramp, hunger pangs rolled through her belly. 

Finally, as the sun began to touch the horizon in front of her, she paused. A series of small kicks came from her belly, making her mind drift back to reality. Roxanne took another painful breath of winter air, closing her eyes for a moment. Placing her hands on her small stomach, a lump pushed its way into her throat. As dangerous as tears would be out in the wind, thoughts of home raced through her mind. 

She didn’t regret freeing those horses from their cruel master, or any of the other so-called crimes they had stacked against her. However, she did regret leaving her husband back inside the brick walls of the city. Alone and unaware that, if she could just make it through this, he would be a father soon.

With Doordash, when we call or text the customer it goes through the app to mask your number and ours. It doesn't always work.

"ef8f2ys","Money is the root. These things only exist because someone was motivated to create them in order to make money. They then use marketing or advertising to sell them to you. Because they want money. 

Without a desire for money, humans would not be motivated to create advertisements that claim all the unrealistic stuff that they claim about what the various products will do for you. Money is a mechanism that tempts you to try to get more than you deserve in return for something. That advertising pollutes our minds with distorted concepts that influence our actions subconsciously. It feels like we are being controlled.

But we aren’t being controlled. We are weak and unaware that we need to be strong and wise in order to resist and maintain control. Wisdom is hard to come by because we are drowning in the marketing, and we are surrounded on all sides by a society that is fully fixated on the pursuit of money. This fixation has become accepted normality, as if it was the natural order of things, and we find ourselves lost in a state of confusion, writing posts on reddit wondering why people are unhappy even though they have all the toys, pills and entertainment that should be making them plenty happy.

It was once common knowledge that a TV commercial or a salesman could not be trusted because it was known that the motivation behind it was purely to try to sell you something. Wisdom.

It was once common knowledge that food was plants and animals prepared into a meal by caring hands. Wisdom.

It was once common knowledge that health was feeling strong and capable without the assistance of foreign chemicals and devices. Wisdom.

It was once common knowledge that relationships are built on mutual respect and empathy and sustained through shared experience. Wisdom.

It was once common knowledge that our environment was a shared space that we all depend on for survival and must all care for and maintain together. Wisdom.

But when advertising tells us that health comes from pills, relationships can exist anonymously through a computer, that food can come from a box, that corporations and government are in charge of maintaining our environment for us... then we are fooled, one human at a time, slowly but surely, and we teach our children to be fools, and the wisdom is gradually lost each generation.

Perspective is required to acquire wisdom, and strength is required in order to apply it. Both can only come from struggle and experience, pain and failure. That is what we ought to be learning and teaching each other about what to expect from life. Ease and indulgence are not progress, they are ignorance. Progress is building, extending, striving and going further.

Trump's refusal to reveal his tax returns, something that every presidential candidate for the past few decades has done, was a strong indication that he has something big to hide.

"ecpqgkf","EDIT: Sorry. I did not intend for this reply to be this long. But I realize the length supports what I talked about haha.

Yeah the question makes sense. This actually might give you clarity. I don't think it's stimming. From what you said, it's more of a reveal of how his mind works. Okay. So for me, when I think of dialog to say while socializing, it sounds like a one-way conversation in my head. It's almost a monologue. He may be the same way as me. Does he sound like he's doing a report on computers? Or like he's reciting a Wikipedia page? Because that's my monologue haha. 

How old is he? I didn't become aware of conversation norms until high school. My theory is that depending on severity, children with ASD eventually learn to filter out that monologue. I'm 28 and I still have that monologue. BUT. I can filter it out with ease on good days. I have 2 younger siblings also on the spectrum. When I was growing up, I recall us having one way conversations with each other. Our conversations always consisted of ""hey look at this toy/game/book and look at what it does/look like/says"" and that's it. And we were happy and unaware. That was also how we talked to our parents. Nothing else haha.

Honestly, I still kinda do this but I'm less intense about it. For example, my special interests are electronic hardware, anything music related, philosophy, and most sciences. I'll sometimes show my mom something related to those and talk my head off about it. She'll be like ""cool!"" and ""that's awesome"". I know she doesn't care as much as I do about it, but she does care about listening.

I think that's all that matters. He just wants you to listen. I know it's annoying, but just play along with it. He appreciates the attention trust me. 

Also, he might enjoy and benefit from learning computer programming or anything computer related.

Maybe his ""overtalking"" could actually be considered stimming the human need to socialize. Like, he wants to have a conversation but he literally does not know how to, so he resorts to a drawn-out, one-way monologue. Like I said in the previous reply, I always expect people to talk about themselves and their interests because that's how I am. He may be the same way.

There is a LOT of evidence that Russia was tampering with the US presidential election in 2016. That Russian agents made fake internet accounts to pose as Americans and forward propaganda and disinformation. That Russian hackers broke into the Democratic Party and Republican Party's servers, and then leaked specifically chosen e-mails from the Democratic Party meant to make them look as bad as possible. There's evidence suggesting that the Trump campaign may be connected to the Russian tampering of the election, so Robert Mueller, former director of the FBI, is working with the Department of Justice to investigate it.   


Donald Trump has been very angry about this, and recently replaced the US Attorney General because he wouldn't shut down the case. Trump's former Attorney General Jeff Sessions got revealed to have lied about his minor involvement with Russia in front of Congress, and thus to avoid conflicts of interest basically stated that he would  recuse himself from the case and not interfere with it. Trump recently requested that Sessions quit, with most analysts believing that the only reason he'd do so is to replace him with someone that would either shut down or severely hamper the investigation.   


Meanwhile, Mueller has found many guilty parties who worked for the Trump Campaign and have admitted to illegal dealings with Russia, including Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort, who made a deal with Mueller to turn over testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence. And Trump's lawyer Mike Cohen admitted that he had been in negotiations for building a Trump Tower in Russia while Trump was running for office, which meant that a candidate for President was financially involved with another country.

Because people are stupid and unaware that they are hurting themselves and others by their actions *in the long term.* 

The profit margins for stores is far thinner than you think it is for remaining open. If a third of people just drive over the county line and get their stuff, that's a third of the potential income gone for the store, who have no control over the taxes they are forced to charge.

The store then doesn't make a profit large enough to remain open and is forced to shut down. 

Now all of the people without personal transportation have to go further by bus (if possible) or beg rides to get their services in the next county over. Making it harder for these people to get the things they need. 

This is shit that happens. 

This is basically what Walmart does to small businesses.

I'm leaning your way.

&amp;#x200B;

OP - Lakerone13

To me, it doesn't matter whether that happened to Lightening or not.  The sad truth is that things like this have happened to many people.

Now, this does NOT mean it's happening to you.  None of us out here know you, your wife or any of the particulars.

This did happen to me, but again, I'm not saying it's happening to you.

I'm just going to point out something so you may think about what's going on in your life, because none of us out here online know.

I'll give a few tidbits of what happened to me, and there is a reason I'm doing this, my point will be made shortly.

Not long after our last child, my ex-wife got liposuction surgery (she didn't need, she wanted it - she ran cross country in high school and she was petite, fit even after the last child).

My ex-wife was always one to be able to speak her mind and she was no different regarding this.  She told me she was thinking about it, she and I discussed it.  I went to visit with doctors with her, she visited  with 3 different doctors before selecting the one who was going to perform her surgery.

Since I'm on this sub, we had a deadbedroom too.  She was the LL and I was the HL.  Since I've already said that this happened to me, I'm sure you've correctly surmised that she was only LL for me.

Another year went by and one day while she and I were in our family room, she informed that she was getting a boob job, the following Monday.  Now, for those that would crucify me, my ex-wife didn't need to ask me for permission first, it's her body etc.

My point in bringing this up is that my wife's actions were completely different from the year before when she got lipo.  She talked to me about getting lipo, had me go on doctor visits with her.

My ex-wife left me out of the loop completely about her boob job.  She let me know that she was getting it done in like 3 or 4 days from when she told me.  She'd already thought about it, researched it, visited doctors, selected one and already had the surgery date set and she only told me days before she had the surgery.

I'd been going to the gym for a long time.  She had recently joined me in going to the gym.

What I didn't know was that she was also having an affair (a few actually, but hey the point isn't really whether she was having 1, 2 or 3, the point was that she was having an affair).

OK, forget all the details I just wrote about what happened to me.

Think back over the past couple of years in your life, with your wife.  The topics don't have to be about sex, about her body, yours etc.  Has your wife changed in terms of what she talks to you about?  Does she no longer include in talking about things she used to?

Again, none of us out here online know you, your wife or the particulars.

I didn't know I was missing the signs but my ex-wifes's actions regarding her two surgeries were very different in how she involved me, communciated with me about them etc.  Something had changed.

She was going to the gym, she was having cosmetic surgery done and of course she told me that it was for her, to make herself feel better about herself etc. after having children.  

Physically she didn't need those surgeries, she wanted them.  She was 5' 3"" and weighed 115lbs yet she got lipo surgery.  She was flat chested but that never mattered to me as she and I had been together for decades by the time she got her boob job.

Her changes were for her but they were also for her to help her find other men as she was well into her exit plan and those surgeries were just one piece of her exit plan, which also included moving us to another state as she couldn't work in the state we lived in at that time so she had us move to a different state and then less than a month after we had moved there she told me she wanted a divorce.

Does this mean your wife is doing something similar?  No, it doesn't.

I'd simply say for you to really think about interactions between your wife and you and not just recently, but compare them to the way things were a few years back.

My ex-wife was changing, a lot over the course of two years or so and sadly it went right over my head.  I was caught flatfooted and unaware that she wanted a divorce.

At least in my situation, there were signs, I just missed them.

You need to assess things.  Many of us can and have offered advice, but it's just that, advice.  Only you know the particulars.

Try to look at things from a different perspective.  Look at them critically.  Looking at them through hope and wanting things to be OK means you might miss or dismiss things that don't fit neatly into the vision that you want, which is for things to work out for the two of you.

I mean, I'm rooting for the two of you to make it, for you both to be happy.  Divorce is a bitch.

Considering that often times in the Data Science realm you'll be connecting to multiple different disparate source data sets, some being those that are pulled from online sources, you're especially vulnerable.

I'm not a security engineer by any means, but [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) comes to mind.

Additionally, Python - like most every programming language out there, [has their own security team](https://www.python.org/news/security/) just for these purposes that releases bulletins on the security vulnerabilities in their language that are found. 

When a version of a piece of software is approved by an IT department, it usually goes into a software inventory list. The security team would then begin receiving security notifications for that software/version of the software. Additionally, the download of the software itself will have it's download checked to make sure it downloaded correctly and safely. 

When security vulnerabilities pop up, the security team will grab the hotfixes/patches and deploy them out to those affected users/devices within the company - without you even knowing about it. It's important that security teams keep up with what software is in their environment.

If, for example, your security team didn't know you were using Python - then when something massive like Heartbleed comes about - they may not know to patch it or update/upgrade your version of python or the library python is using that is affected - and now you sit vulnerable, and unaware that you are.

Making fun of someone who makes choices that make them into a shitty person and not making fun of someone for the way they were born is not virtue signalling. That isn't really something to argue.

This photo suggests that the person is autistic and unaware that the fun he is having is solely for the amusement and mockery of the person taking the photo. That's the other difference. That's directly taking advantage of his autism for a laugh.

They are becoming more and more common through cop watch communities 

Any space that you or I can access to get forms or the like ( open to the public/viewable to the public) is fair game to film through first amendment

"e53wjk6","Nailed it on the head. There's no point in asking about these virtually impossible situations. Humans  don't even put themselves through these kinds of theoretical ethical dilemmas. 

If a human was placed in these far off situations who the fuck is going to think about the ethical dilemma in the split second before it happens?! Who's to say ones ethics will hold up against self preservation in real life scenarios?

When humans get a driver's license there's no written ethical exam that has these kind situations to sort out. The bar for a human to get in a vehicle and drive is incredibly low compared to self driving cars already. Self driving cars log thousands of not millions of hours of road time with other cars driven by humans who can be irrational and unaware. That goes to show how good of a job they're doing already. Even now the AI is still being improved. What do humans have to do? Practice some hours with a permit (not even close to a thousand hours), a written exam about road laws (no ethical dilemma situations on the exam), and pass a short driving exam (with a really qualified examiner with a bunch of certifications right? Not really, just a regular human).

Sure the AI and technology is still young and needs work. However, there's much more potential for the technology to be safer drivers than the millions of human drivers today.

"e36ckc3","“Hello, this is Delilah,” the target said, answering her phone.

“Hey, it’s Jack,”

“Look who’s finally calling back, what can I do you for?” she asked with a smile. She instinctively twiddled a strand of her hair between two fingers.

“Can you help me with something?” he asked, forcing the urgency from his voice, “I’m helping the mall security guys make sure their camera system has good coverage and I spotted you on one of the monitors,”

“Uh, sure – what do you need me to do?” she asked, stopping in her tracks.

“Keeping walking,” she glanced up at the cameras, “Act natural ok?” he said with a casual chuckle, “Nothing yells suspicion like glancing up at all the cameras,” 

“Ok fair enough – just don’t ask me to steal anything, I’m a terrible liar!”

The common myth surrounding counter surveillance is that you want to employ all sorts of crazy manoeuvres in a ploy to get whoever is following you to slip up and make a mistake. Stop walking suddenly, sprint around a corner, climb the side of a building. The fact is, all these display the fact that you know you’re being followed. The trick to excellent counter surveillance is to deal with whoever is on your trail without them knowing you’ve spotted them. Any good intelligence operative will have spent weeks training counter surveillance drills and even then it takes a certain level of talent to pull these off naturally. Teaching a civilian counter surveillance 101 on the fly is next to impossible, so your best bet is to keep them calm, relaxed and unaware that they’re being followed and subtly deal with the threat. It’s not fun keeping assets in the dark, but that’s the job.

“So we’re just checking the coverage of all the cameras in this section, this shouldn’t take long,” Jack explained, “Can you find me somewhere with contrast?” he asked.

“Contrast?”

“Find me somewhere a guy like me would stick out like a sore thumb,” she laughed.

“What?”

“Hang on there’s a lingerie store up here,” she added with a giggle.

“Brilliant,” she laughed loudly.

“Don’t get too ahead of yourself mister,” she replied, Jack felt himself blush. Delilah wandered into the store, “So now what?”

“Browse, I just need to check something,” Jack watched from nearby as Delilah wandered through, just out of sight behind the underwear clad mannequins. He watched as the men hesitated, one of them nodded and did his best to stand nonchalantly outside the store as the other two entered, “How busy is it in there?” he asked.

“Not really, that’s why I go shopping at Thursday lunchtime,” she replied, Jack caught the curse before it left his mouth but she sensed the tension in his silence, “What’s up?” Jack approached the storefront casually, catching the eye of the man stood outside. 

“I want you to go into the female changing rooms in the back and wait for a second,” Jack said, “Obviously we’re checking the camera blind spots,” he added hastily. 

“Obviously,” he could tell she wasn’t quite convinced. Jack barged into the guy on guard who flinched, reaching for his rear waistband.

“Hey watch it buddy,” Jack put on the most entitled West Coast accent he could muster, the man cursed under his breath and then touched his ear. Alarmed that his headphones were no longer connected to a phone, he patted himself down and then turned to see Jack walking away, phone in hand.

“Hey!” he growled.

“You ok Jack?” Delilah asked, hearing some of the commotion. 

“Gimme a sec,” the guy followed Jack around the corner, taking a sharp chop to the throat before being dragged back around the corner and out of side of the mall. Jack coiled his arm under the guy’s neck and grabbed his own hand, raising his elbow up high and locking up the standing guillotine chokehold. The man gasped and struggled, but his strength quickly ran out and he slumped to the floor. Jack thumped him on the back of the neck for good measure and reappeared from the alley, “Sorry, spotty signal up in security,” Jack lied, he walked to the opposite side of the exit and sat on a bench. He waited for the two other men to emerge from the store in a panic, their third no longer in spot and his phone not responding, “Delilah can you leave the store for me?” 

“Sure,” she seemed amused, “What’s going on exactly?” Jack was barely metres from her but still had a threat to deal with.

“And now, I want you to turn right.” He steered her past the alleyway, the two men having discovered their friend re-emerged, hot on her trail. Jack hunted the hunters. 

“What now?”

“Keep walking, straight and true,” he instructed. Jack watched the thug on the left draw a snub nosed revolver and ready it at his side, “I’ll call you right back,” 

Jack stooped low, grabbing the revolver and forcing it up, smacking it into its holder’s face. He then flicked it around, smacking it into the face of the other guy. Jack held onto the revolver with his right hand and slammed his forearm down on the wrist, disarming it. He snapped his left elbow back into the throat of the first guy and then rotated sharply and pistol whipped the second guy across the face. The first guy stumbled but still had fight in him, so Jack stamped on the side of his knee to drop the man down and then kneed him casually in the face. There was relatively little commotion as Jack walked away emptying the revolver, wiping his prints with his jacket sleeves and tossing the gun into a nearby rubbish bin. Delilah was one of the observing crowd members, her jaw had dropped somewhat.

“Delilah,” Jack said with a smile, taking her arm and turning her as he walked away as casually as he could, “How about that drink?”

But why do you think the poachers do what they do? When it comes down to it, it's the best way these individuals have found to earn money and provide for themselves, and perhaps their families. That's the problem here, these people have to turn to such a horrific practice to survive.

"e03wcfh","You say that you are being honest, but even if you are being honest you are still asking to exploit someone. The natural way of things is to pay people for labor.

You are asking for someone to provide to you a large amount of unpaid labor. According to you it will take 3-5 months, let's say 3 months. A low, starting salary for an inexperienced software developer might be $50k. Let's assume a relatively modest 50% overhead. This means that 3 months of pay is $18,500.

Once the demo is done, if the demo meets some unknown and unspecified criteria by a third party, you say that this person will invest $15k in the project. At that point, the programmer would have already spent $18.5k in opportunity costs, so the project is $3.5k in the hole. But there is no guarantee that the investor will like the demo.

So you can see that this is an extremely one-sided proposal. No matter what happens, if the project succeeds or fails, in either case, the programmer loses. That is why this proposal is exploitative. It is so one-sided that it is morally repugnant.

Does 'meditation' necessarily imply 'good meditation' or 'correct concentration'? Is it whatever happens when you sit still and watch your mind?

"dywmyfa","I agree with everything you have said.  

I definitely overstated the ""danger"" of emotionally unavailable people.  My observation is that those who are emotionally unavailable and unaware that they are tend to leave a lot of broken hearts in their wake.  I also see how the syndrome of emotional unavailability can create a population that can be taken in by destructive social movements and ideologies.  It's like any developmental maladaptation, it can foster negative growth when treated with stigma or positive growth when treated with nurturing.  It's easier to just discount these people as monsters, lock them away, shut them up, than it is to offer help.  I hear lots of positive talk about addressing toxic masculinity but I then also see callousness and scorn leveled at the victims of it by those same advocates.  If we insist on painting these details with a broad brush, everything's going to end up a mess.
                
There is a growing body of research that shows that the mind's ability to adapt and change diminishes with age and that the flexibility of parts of the brain to growth come at specific times for specific skills.  When developmental mile-markers are missed at certain periods, those skills and abilities may never be fully developed.  I remember reading an article about children who were locked away by abusive parents and didn't learn to speak or socialize.  After they were found and freed, they never did succeed in verbal communication or socialization despite decades of intensive therapy.  It seems like there are points in brain development where the wiring anneals and if certain connections aren't made, they never can be.  Substitute skills and adaptations can be learned, but it's not the same as the native ones.

I know that I over-regulate my emotions.  I easily and willingly allow my rational mind to short-circuit or take precedence over my emotional mind.  The thing that baffles me sometimes is that everybody tells me that in doing so, that I should, at some later time, have some catastrophic emotional release or meltdown.  In 43 years, it's never happened.  I'm not anxious, not fearful and not prone to any sort of emotional extremes.  The only real downside to my situation is that I have dampened reflexive affect and don't form strong emotional connections.  I have developed a set of skills for social interaction that, I think, works for me.  I don't really crave deeper emotional connections, so I find no hindrance there.  All-in-all, I see myself as a slightly defective person who has, despite this, managed to succeed to a comfortable level.  I don't plan on seeking help in any way because I don't need it.  I liken myself to an acquaintance of mine who is a bilateral leg amputee.  He gets around fine on a skateboard.  Everybody keeps telling him to use expensive clunky prosthetics or a heavy wheelchair but he can zip around town on his board faster and easier.

Ok, you don't want to get a massage where handjobs are going on, totally get that. So let's scratch those off the list.

But, that doesn't mean the other places are good either. Often times the other places that charge say 200 baht (6 dollars) for a 1 hour foot massage and 400 baht for oil are just really low quality. 90% of the time the masseuses (if it's a woman) will practically rip you off and waste your time by just using the lowest/laziest form of massage. They basically just swirl their hands around you for an hour, exerting no pressure. In Thailand, working hard = only if you *have* to and these people are low paid anyway so why would they want to end up with sore hands from giving a real massage all day? 

Most of the legit shops are bad and staffed with just lazy people who will swirl their hands on you for an hour.

I'm not saying the sword would bounce off the gorilla like a rifle round ricocheting off a tank. But it's also not going to pierce through the gorilla enough to deal any kind of meaningful damage because that outcome demands several things to happen:

1. The knight has to be in position before the gorilla charges

2. The weapon has to be angled directly perpendicular to the gorilla's torso if there is to be even the slightest chance of a decent stab

3. The knight has to (as mentioned) have the strength to brace long and hard enough for physics to do the work and let the gorilla impale itself. If he can't hold the weapon in place, it'll cause at most an inch-deep wound that wouldn't kill the gorilla in a thousand years.

4. The gorilla has to be so enraged and unaware that it wouldn't simply slap the weapon away

5. The knight has to be 100% unwavering in the face of a wild animal twice his weight charging at him.

Those requirements put together make it virtually impossible for the knight to get in a good hit. I refer you again to the video linked, he has one chance and that's it. Once the distance has been closed no amount of dodging is going to save him.

"dtbc032","The fact that we have empathy for Will and Hannibal in this show is no accident.  It's not merely two attractive men in fancy clothes serving each other soup.  It is a very well weaved tapestry changing what the word Killer means for this show:

What a killer is in this show is far far away from what a killer is out of this show.  This is not just for Will and Hannibal, but Every Killer in the show.  
~

So in this post I will break down how killing and empathy are linked by breaking down the killers in season 1 of the show.

Killer Empathy:  
Killer 1: Will says emotionally that this killer was trying to apologize for what he'd done.  We see a bed, and there is a tenderness.  Next scene Will is in the Shining bathroom as he admits to Jack that this is killer who cares.  
Which makes him empathetic.  Jack asks the question we are subconsciously asking, how is that possible?  Will gives no answers like the show will continue to unfurl this out.  
(there is also the antler thing being used as a healing aid, this I think subconsciously also contradictorally puts the antlered creatures including the Ravenstag as a healing creature and thus very slyly making Hannibal more empathetic as well).  

(Hidden Killer 2: copy cat is the exact opposite, conceited, mocking, heartless. Hannibal is also the one differentiates himself from all other killers often in ways that make him the brutalist. More on this later.)

Killer 3: A man who is lonely and tries to connect with people by killing to them and listening through spores. Anyways that implies he's an extremely lonely and broken killer and thus empathetic.

Killer 4: Abigail kills Boyle. Hannibal tells her this cannot be seen as self defense and before that Crawford was highly suspicious of her.  In reality I doubt that the FBI would be quick at all to be suspicious of a child in murders in this situation and if they were, they would assume it was from extreme parental abuse. In the show world she is pretty much treated like an adult using her childlike nature against authorities to manipulate them.  Anyways, a female child who has been subjected to possibly severe trauma under threat is empathizeable. 

Note: when Hannibal kills it is quickly and we don't get to rudiment over it for a long time.  Much happens quickly, unlike the other killers.  This also makes him appear more Godlike, as he is making moves faster then we can process and understand it.

Note 2: this is very obvious, but Will doesn't kill til Season 2, but Season 1 there is a great deal of building up empathy and concern for his character.  He is sick, he is helping stop killers, he is being manipulated, he cannot handle situations well before he get's sick so that he is naturally frail, troubled, he wants to care for people and dogs in need. Besides that the whole time we are given reasons to be angry at Hannibal as the cause of this anguish. 

Also Will and Hannibal's care for Abigail is a huge way we are made to root for them.  As they are caring for a hurt and lost child.  Or at least attempting to.  

Killer 5: the 'lost boys' are boys who are lost, confused and a woman their 'new mother' directs them to kill their families.  It is hard to think of boys as killlers.  Especially ones being manipulated as such.  

Killer 6: Things are getting darker.  I almost gave up the show at this point cause this episode disgusted me so much.  But it's also an extreme contradiction cutting the skin off people is horrendous, but he is creating 'angels' to pray over him.  Aka this is a faith search.  Psychopaths do not think of spiritual matters like faith.  
Also his cancer in the same episode we find out about Bella's cancer.  He ultimately takes his life, turning himself into this angel, which the impossibility of this adds to the spiritual element.  Adding another layer to this, Will looks up at this 'angel' in a spiritual way.  AKA killing Can be spiritual in this show.  Killing means something different here because we are in another universe then our own, one about killing and spirituality, killing and lonliness, or even love.  
Note how this high up angel body takes from SOTL but the message is from one of mockery to something different.

Killer 7 Nurse is killed brutally and criminally insane hospital. (hannibal we find hasn't killed as Chesapeak Ripper in 2 years at this point, adding to the mystery of his character). We start to realize Gideon is very troubled and hates therapists and has been abused by them.  The possibility that this is all a grand manipulation is brought up by Chilton.  A realistic thing to consider.

Note:Hannibal has a therapist (not sure which exact episode this is revealed) but there is a new dimension to Hannibal, as having a weakness of feeling alone.  (thus empathy creating).  

Ep 8, Killer 8 Tobias: There is much less to feel empathy for him, but there are still some things. Franklyn is a mix of being an annoyance and having an adorable quality to him. Franklyn has a friend who he is concerned about as being a psychopath.  Remind you of anyone?  Anyways Tobias courts Hannibal with killing. We see some signs of coldness from Tobias like we haven't seen from killers so far. Tobias get's rejected.  Later Hannibal kills Franklyn (which I think it is implied that there is some sort of relationship of feeling towards Franklyn from Tobias as well, creating some subtle empathy towards Tobias at this point)  Even though Tobias says he was saving Franklyn to kill later, we are wondering on some level if he too cared a little for Franklyn.  Everyone no matter how cold can potentially love in this show. And Tobias is very upset and tries to kill Hannibal and Hannibal kills Tobias.  

Note: even though Hannibal kills Tobias and clearly is manufacturing everything, he does get hurt, and this also creates empathy for him while at the same time more suspicion towards him.  

Note:  Will is rejected by Alana when he reached out for her.  Will is very vulnerable in this scene and so this is a really big deal as far as things that could 'push' Will's sanity.  And thus, we understand him and what he is going through, empathy. 

Ep 9 Killer 9: there is little to empathize with this killer, but he is old.  He has lost a son. 

Note:  The Human Totem Pole like all of the killings also are extremely dehumanizing, which has an effect that makes us empathize with the killed much less.  In the show the killed are often have very little story, we don't know who they are.  Dressed up in artistic ways makes them into something else, no longer thinking of the human. Empathize with the killers but not the killed.
Also it's not just Hannibal in the show that makes art of their kills, It's like every killer.  Including Will (once he does). Hobbs maybe was the only one who didn't have some sort of death art, but he did still have the antler room.

https://imgur.com/a/o3ooD Here is a hand from the mushroom episode made to look alien and green with something artificial coming out of it.  Very far from a recognizable person to be caring about at this point.

~

Ep 10, Killer 10 Georgia Madchen is completely unconscious and unaware that she is killing, is a child and is suffering a great deal, and is empathizeable.  Will cares about her a lot and relates to her in a deep way.  Perhaps sees himself in her somehow.  Georgia is completely innocent and also pretty much a child and needing care and love.  One of the most childlike characters in many ways.   Again this shows him wanting to be a father to someone and care for someone who depends on him.

~

Ep 11, Killer 11: Gideon also courts the Chesapeake Ripper and tries to communicates with him through an organ basket.  Will catches him.  Lecter plants Will with a gun to go after Gideon.  Will takes a violent action by taking the gun. This has been directed by Hannibal.  Gideon is empathizeable because he has been messed with by Chilton.  

Ep 12, Abigail is confused on whether to trust Will and then Hannibal comes along, and Hannibal seems to say he is going to kill her that despite the fear she feels, tells her in an incredibly tender way.  (again confusing what is considered loving in the show).  

13 and some final thoughts:   Again and again peopel's instincts are doubted.  Alana is doubted for wanting to find what happened to Will, episode previously Will is doubted by Abigail to be good.  But Hannibal is like never doubted by anyone.  Everything always goes in his favor.  It is like fate itself supports him.  There are several things that happen that go in Hannibal's favor as well where I don't see how he could have been the one to direct it.   It just happened, as if he really were a dark God in this world.  One is where Gideon goes to jail exactly when Hannibal stops killing.  How could Hannibal have guessed that Chilton would have had this evidence and started to where Gideon down til Gideon killed people to look like the Chesapeake in a way that would mimic the Chesapeake ripper.  I guess Chilton did talk to Hannibal so it is possible Hannibal passed that idea to Chilton.

In this world the killers have been made empathizeable, they deserve our care.  Slowly tearing down what we think of as killers.  That they feel more then the average person.  That they are deserving of empathy and those killed are nothing worth thinking about anyway.

Will and Hannibal I don't believe would be likable characters in a normal situation.  But what's especially interesting to me is that this at first glance doesn't feel like an alternate universe.

"dt0ipk3","Not all do. Many who become aware of the problems switch to buying humanely raised meat. Some don’t because they don’t care enough to, and some can’t because of financial reasons. Some switch off chicken, beef, and pork entirely and eat seafood because fish and shellfish do not have the nervous systems to experience suffering to nearly the same degree. Some turn vegan, some turn vegetarian and only eat eggs and dairy from humane farms. There are dozens of ways that people stop supporting inhumane farming. However, perhaps the ones you are mostly thinking of simply aren’t really aware of the problems. 

If you can accept those, then the only thing left to disagree on would be the numbers and definitions. For that, we can use [this](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017) which says:

&gt; 75% of US adults say they usually buy animal products “from animals that are treated humanely,” despite estimates suggesting fewer than 1% of US farmed animals live on non-factory farms.[5] This suggests a psychological refuge effect where people justify their animal product consumption by incorrectly assuming they are eating ethically-produced food.

There are other useful facts in there, but I think this is the most relevant. While they would clearly be wrong about where they are getting their meat from, what is important is their belief in this case and how it affects their choices. If I believed the meat I was buying was humanely raised, but it turns out I am wrong and unaware, that doesn’t make me hypocritical, but it would make me ignorant. To be hypocritical, I would have to know that the meat is not humanely raised and still buy it.

"dsuy7b2","You get good through practice, experience and through doing a lot of research on examples of what others have done (books, papers, google, youtube, anything etc...).  

It's tough when you start out, especially in an environment like you've mentioned, but don't take it too personally if someone is impatient and unaware that a 3rd year intern is still learning. Because you are still learning. And anyone in your position would be. Hell, a 2nd year Grad is still learning. When you start working, all of it is an exercise in tenacity bc your ego takes a blow at first. But you get better over time, and one day you'll surprise yourself bc you suddenly confidently know what you're doing.

I helped teach the design course as a TA at my uni, and I still was learning a ton when I went into industry. Some of the senior engineers weren't as patient as I would've liked either, but it forces you to be more meticulous in your work. My first job I could barely use AutoCAD (we learned SolidEdge in uni) but after a handful of years in industry I'm fluent in AutoCAD, CATIA V4/V5, Inventor and SolidWorks. 

A lot of university is to give you a foundational base knowledge and to give you the skills of how to learn on the fly, because much of what you do after school will be an extension of what you did in university, not a carbon copy (otherwise it'd be rather boring...).  You'll be learning new topics, theory and software as you go through your career. You'll need to apply those problem solving and work habit skills you got from university in order to, as I said, learn on the fly. And that means tripping up and making mistakes here and there at the start of something new. Just own up to them and keep going. That's how you get better.

If you're really keen though. and if you really want to get better, get an eval copy of the software you use (Aerospace, so CATIA I'm assuming? Solidworks?) and start designing stuff at home and get a prof, or a buddy from class (or if you can find a mentor) or someone to critique it. I got 100% score on my final drafting project in uni, and when someone in industry saw it, they tore it to shreds. Point is, keeping going, keep learning, keep your chin up, and you'll get there.

Are most so gung ho about disclosure because we want our suspicions validated so we can believe that we believe or is it for vindication in part so that we can rest at ease knowing the nay sayers are wrong and we can kind of gloat about it all. Personally im a a believer as much as im a believer in the fact that i can inhale oxygen to live but i dont rely on any politician to decide what i believe under any circumstances because ive always held firm a blanket belief that regardless of who they are or what they stand for they just simply cannot be trusted for the most part to tell the truth. The most you get is double speak or some sound bite of pacification to satsify the crowd so they blindly begin to believe that theyve just gotten a clue as to what the big picture really is. Not to mention and its a matter of history that we always get the ""version"" of the truth that best affects the course of our futures so long as its given to us by them. So why do most turn to politicians for truth? Im assuming there are a great number of people that are completely obedient and unaware that there is anything more than their cars bills homes etc. Thats fine its their big picture and probably easier to navigate than the universe of problems beyond this planet but there are growing numbers of aware people and really keen whitty logical people who only live out side the box who still believe the majority of you tube videos regarding the subject and there are some high end classy yet fake videos out there but alot are fake.

"dri4ll1","Here's a secret:

Most people have no fucking lives. Or, at least, none important enough to warrant really slow replies. 

When people reply slowly, it's because a) they don't care about you, or (more commonly) b) they're doing it on purpose for some reason (and there can be a few). 

How am I sure of this?

Because I actually HAVE a life that requires me to be away from my phone. I am busy for most of my day, mostly because of having to schedule in meditation and exercise on top of work, and those two things are VERY important to me. Side note: Meditate, it WILL change your life. 

When I go out with people, hang out with them, see their true selves in their homes, relaxing, I consistently find that they all HAVE NO LIVES. NOTHING. They're all just following the motions, doing the usual, like e v e r y o n e else. 

They all just move from distraction to distraction, not knowing what the fuck they're doing. Let's go party! Let's Snapchat everything! Let's do some drugs! Let's watch stupid, mind-numbing TV! Lets play video games! Let's waste our lives by avoiding the  fact that we're all afraid to sit still and face the terrifying emptiness of our lives. 

Ask yourself, really, why do you do the things you do? Do you really want to be going to school? To that class? To that job? How many other things would you rather be doing? Why aren't you doing them? Do you know who you are, or what would make you truly fulfilled and happy in life? Why don't you? Isn't that an important question? 

Why did you come here to Reddit and vent this? Isn't it a pretty pointless thing to do? Couldn't you be doing something more productive (yes, definitely)? But what's the point, really, of doing ANYTHING? 

The point is to distract yourself because, if you don't, you'll go insane. Try it, try to sit still without moving for an hour. Easy, right? No, you can't do it, you won't do it. Why can't you do something so simple? It's pathetic. By why can't you? It's not because you don't have the time. It's not because there is no point to it. It's not because it's harmful. So why don't you just do it? It's just an hour! 

Because you have no control over yourself. You do not realize what you are. You are unaware that you are unaware. You are lost in an illusion, wandering aimlessly for decades until death. You will die without knowing anything about existence. 

It all stems from the fact that you are avoiding your issues without knowing, and these issues come from a place deep within you that you do not take the time to understand. And that place is unknown to you because you are COMPLETELY ASLEEP and unaware that you are unaware, but you are wholly convinced that you know what the fuck you're doing.

"dr6tc9q","Amateurs! I once took 60mg of 4-ACA-DMT on an empty stomach with a shot of vodka and a glass of OJ. After puking my guts up in the sink I realized I was no longer in this reality. I was still in my apartment, but there were dozens of shadow people piled into my place. I tried to get back to my room but they were mostly crowded near my door. It was terrifying. It looked like they were watching a peep show. Or like starving homeless piled up next to a heated entryway trying to stay warm. 

They were ice cold. Not just cold, but they were a void of warmth. I noticed that getting close to them sucked the warmth out of me. And as I realized this they noticed me. There weren’t any in my room, oddly enough, and it was like they weren’t able to go inside, lending to the feeling that they were observing me like I was some kind of tv show or something. But when I tried to go back in my room I realized I was already in there. Still in bed, likely tripping and drowning on my own vomit that I tripped I had puked in the sink.

Then I tried to go in the room. I couldn’t my wife open door was impossible toncroos through. The things stealing my warmth had someone made me one of them and I was trapped outside and unable to get back to my body. I pounded on an invisible barrier over and over. Panicking I lept toward the open door and sailed into the room. Knocking the shit out of myself in the process. I slowly got up off the floor, a horribly painful process. 

I’d gotten away from the shadow people but they had taken their toll on me. My energy was sapped and I could barely move. I sat on the bed and realized the energy draining hadn’t stopped. I was feeling older and older. I realized that I was not a man in his early thirties, instead I was ancient. Older than time it felt. At this point the illusion that is the physical world around us melted away. It was like removing a skin on a video game, and the common items in my room were no longer common. Writing was now kanji. Led lights floated and twinkled around singing a strange song. And a pair of lights one red and one green, filled the room. The lights were kanji. They were measuring my karma. I had been a terrible person apparently. I was shrunk to incredibly small size, my life and all my lives laid out in front of me. I was dying my final death. And I would witness all the hells this universe has to offer. And I did. Over and over. 

I tried to get my bearings and reduce my anxiety and steer the trip to a better lace but this wasn’t going to happen. I  noticed a strange sound and looked outside. I witnessed a terrifying reality. Billions of slaves lulled into a stupor, convinced they were alive but they were not. They were food. A horrible monstrosity hovered above us all. A hideous spider working furiously to spin a billion fake realities together to keep its food alive and unaware that they were being fed upon. Injecting its eggs into them to explode and feast upon our remains. And then I realized that I had always known this, and i have simple refused to accept it. And for that I was a betrayer. I betrayed the billions of those unaware of this living hell and so I am damned. 

Then it got bad. While I was focused on this glowing green space spider god, one of the shadow people had apparently made its way into my room. It struck me and threw me to the floor. It lifted my entire bed off the floor and kicked me under it and then slammed it down on top of me over and over. I was then flipped over and pinned under the bed. It showed me even more horrible things than the hells I witnessed before. I felt an ice cold point stabbing in the back of my neck. If I moved it would surely kill me. A song came into my head . Something I knew by heart but had never heard. The song was about my betrayal. It was a song that I needed to know. The only way to save myself was the final verse. If only I could remember the last line! I dug through my mind struggling to remember. It wouldn’t come to me. I was going to die and that was it. I had done this to myself. The thing in the room with me showed me a set of rules. It reminded me that it has shown them to me when I was a child or even before I was born. How easy it was to pretend they weren’t there. How easy it was to forget that we were all being judged and I had been judged the worst. The icey blade pushed in harder setting my mind on fire. Pain burned through my entire being. It whispered to me “ you’ve lost, you are the worst, and this is your fitting end.” And as I edged near the end of my existence, as I felt the very end of my being and the last drops of energy inside me slowly die, head the song play its final chord, the shadow said, “ Nah I’m just fucking with you!” The blade vanished, it flipped me over and a searing point of light blasted into my forehead and it exploded out of me in a huge geometric pattern. Circling around me in an uncomprehensible blur. And then things started going back to “normal.”

"dr20mcl","I just watched the video for the first time.

With the benefit of hindsight we now know that this is a tragic situation where officers responded to the report of an armed man aiming a rifle out the window of a hotel (sound familiar?) Only to find a young man who was just intoxicated and showing off with his work tools. We also know the cop that shot him is an idiot who doesn't have enough common sense to keep bullshit tacticool gear off of his work tools.

However...

If I was in Shaver's position and I was armed and I wanted to try to win a gun fight with cops, I would do exactly what looks like he did. I would first test them by disobeying an instruction early on, then readily and eagerly obey further instructions to first test them and then bring their guard down a little. I would then obscure my gun side with my body and attempt to draw quickly and disable them before they killed me so I could attempt to escape.

The officers don't have the benefit of the hindsight. They only have what they know. What they knew is that somebody said somebody in that room was armed and they had to check it out and take it seriously. They also have training and experience that includes watching gunfights and learning how cops lose them and thus how not to lose.

How do I know what I would do to increase my chances of winning a gunfight in Shaver's position? Because my Peace Officer Standards and Training Academy covered these issues. I saw what works for the cops and what works for the crooks. Shaver, while innocent and unaware that his actions looked threatening, absolutely 100% beyond all doubt looks exactly like a person who's using an known technique to shoot cops.

He is an innocent man and I morn his passing. I think the cop who shot him should be barred from police work for his dust cover alone.

None of that changes the fact this is a good shoot. The only difference between this controversial shoot and a clearly righteous shoot is that the Shaver was not in fact armed and didn't intend to shoot these cops.

At the time, the cops have no way to know his intent or whether or not he was armed. If the don't shoot and he's armed and intent to fire, then there is a good chance they've made widows and orphans out of their wives and children. If they do shoot and he's not armed then an innocent man is dead.

When you are in a life or death situation and it's a gamble, there's not enough information to know if you're right or wrong and you have to make a bet based on what you know and what you see and you're little gambling with lives...

Do you risk your life or the other  guy's?",1512942094,"shaver, while innocent and unaware that his actions looked threatening, absolutely 100% beyond all doubt looks exactly like a person who's using an known technique to shoot cops.","innocent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"innocent and unaware","innocent",NA,NA,0

 “Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death.” ― Gavin de Becker, The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence 

[If you ask a woman what she is afraid of and what she does to protect herself, she'll give you a list of specifics. Ask a man the same question, and he might not understand what you mean.](http://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/articles/nightmare.html)

If you look at crimes committed directly in response to romantic rejection, the majority of it will be against women or sexual minorities. Not all, but very much disproportionate to the population.  We live in a culture where women wearing the wrong thing is viewed as ""asking for it"", and if a guy rapes her because he felt entitled to sex from her, the chorus of ""what did she expect, dressing like that"".  Where girls wearing spaghetti strap shirts to school get sent home to change because bare shoulders might distract the boys. Etc.

It's not that men can't be victims. They absolutely can. And the culture we live in can be toxic to men as well as women.

But the person I was replying to seemed to think that the OP finding the situation creepy was just her being young and naive and unaware, that she was just overwhelmed by the attention.  Which shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it's like being a woman in this society.

"dqtns5m","When I was 17 I was fat, felt horrible with myself, had no self-esteem, drunk a lot and smoked weed constantly. My concrete thoughts on commiting suicide came when I was about 12/13, but I had an uneasy feeling about life even before that. I think that as a child I was just younger and unaware that suicide was something that existed, therefor it took me 13 years to learn about it.

About your age I started doing some other drugs, too. I felt alone and terribly isolated. Luckily I met someone who shared the idea of suicide, with whom I’d meet up and plan it out. Talking always helped us get through it.

I got a shitty job at 19, lasted about six months, heavily abusing substances all the while. Went away with some money I managed to save/they payed me when fired without motive and a tent. Had a mental breakdown in the misdle of a desert. Started seeing things that weren’t there. Went back to drinking, started smoking crack.

Dropped crack one day. I asked some 11 year olds that were smoking it to get me to the dealers house and after buying some shared a bit with them. Then while smoking it realized how fucked up that was.

That was five years ago. I had some issues after giving up crack and returning to my hometown that made me try for the first time to live sober. I managed to months back then.

For the past five years I drank heavily, while simultaneously achieving some small goals. For the most part, I was still depressed and hopeless. That changed about a year ago. I had a dream of being by the side of my paternal grandmother on her deathbed (she still lives, suffers alzhaimer’s, and lived depressed since I can recall) and saying to her that everything would be fine, that she could pass away in peace, that I had found the way out of the cycle, that there was no longer need for sorrow. I’ve held on to that dream, in hopes of making it a reality.

For the past year, I’ve slowly managed to feel a bit better. But it’s something I have to work on daily, and it’s hard. But it makes me feel better than what I was doing before.

One weekend I decided to buy a keyboard with the money I would’ve wasted on booze, started learning to play it. It eases my mind. I started reading again. I started running and lost about 25kg. I try and be thankful for what I have instead of always fixating on bad shit. I try to appreciate every moment of calm or happines I get, and through that I get some more moments each day. Before I only noticed the times when I felt bad.

I have the hope that I can recover, be better, be good, be reliable and able to help others in need. I know I’ll fight to achieve those goals even if I don’t manage to fulfil them, even if death comes before I can, because I realized that death will come eventually, and this will all be over. I don’t need to rush it. In the meantime, all I get is a bonus.

I hope the best for you, friend.",1512513202,"i think that as a child i was just younger and unaware that suicide was something that existed, therefor it took me 13 years to learn about it.","younger and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"just young and unaware","young",NA,"just",0

"dpy2gqb","&gt;  Has anyone experienced this with the game?

Yes.  Most winning players go through a phase where they get irrationally angry over bad beats.  It's the random element of the game...they know that they are a winning player, but they can't win every hand/session/week/month.  It fucks with your head because people who aren't as good as you are are making money while you are losing money.

That isn't to say that this behavior is good.  It obviously isn't.  

&gt; Can anyone suggest a way I can help him?

Yes but it's unlikely that it'll take.  A lot of people are too dumb to realize they are being dumb, and much like telling your friend that his girl is cheating on him, it'll more than likely cause him to lash out at you instead of confronting the real issue.

But, you can tell him that being that angry isn't healthy, and is only going to perpetuate a negative head space that's going to cause him to spiral which is going to be bad for his game and life.  Explain to him that poker, while both fun and profitable, should be a component of living, not life itself.  He needs to structure time to play and time to do other things.  He needs to approach poker as ""Did I play as well as I could"" instead of ""Did I win money/this hand"".  If he can't realize that people playing poorly is good for him in the long run, and the results of any one hand are irrelevant, he's not going to last in the game.  Like I said, a lot of people go through this because of the nature of playing the game at a high level.  The good ones realize what is going on, adapt, and grow.  The bad ones don't and eventually end up working at Walmart.  

But you should probably try to find another place to live.

"doywb7y","It really irks me that people try to pinpoint one thing that caused Trump to get elected. It was a ton of things that caused it. 

* For 8 years, the republicans have been complaining about Obamacare to the point that many of their base was confused and unaware that Obamacare and the ACA were the same thing. This caused the republican base to be mobilized before Trump was ever nominated. 
* For 30 years, Hillary has been the target (warranted or not) of numerous investigates and slander campaigns. This caused the US population in general to just not really care for her. 
* In general, the trend has been that the republicans and democrats swap presidents in the White House. The last exception to that rule had a single term. This is generally because people have a short memory and a really poor targetting of who is causing their distaste for the trend of politics and it's always blamed on the president. For the last 6 years, a republican congress had blocked Obama from getting any real changes made, and people blamed Obama for it.
* External propaganda, largely Russian, was targeted at both sides in an attempt to cause discontent and polarize our nation. 
* Trump came in and fueled the fire under Hillary by being the biggest mudslinger to ever be elected.
* Hillary was just the worst candidate the DNC could have picked. Many people were actively voting against Hillary without regard for who the other candidate was.
* Trump mobilized the White Nationalists by being the first candidate in many decades to not openly speak out against them. It's not that he himself is racist, its that he didn't condemn racism. 
* Hillary didn't campaign in some key states that she thought were a shoe in.
* Trump told blatant lies about things he flat out couldn't do. (Yes all politicians lie, but Trumps were probably some of the most blatant) For example, coal miners wanted to hear that coal jobs were coming back. Trump told them that coal jobs would come back, but either Trump didn't understand that coal jobs are gone because the people who used to operate on coal no longer operate on coal, or he knew that and lied about it. He also told people that he had a tax plan that would hurt him greatly, but every bit of information that's been released about his tax plan shows exactly the opposite. 
* Trump spent the entire campaign further polarizing the nation by discrediting mainstream media. 
* The DNC behaved improperly during the primary which caused many voters to want to punish them and resulted in them either not voting or voting against the DNC. 

The list goes on. The 2016 election was probably the most fucked up election cycle to ever really happen in the US. There's not one thing that resulted in President Donald J.

It is indifference, 0, that goes to hatred, 60, in a few seconds of ""acting above one's station.""

What men are realizing is that women love class-based society, as long as they are the class on top.  Is the help looking at me? HARASSMENT! Is the help _talking to me_? HARASSMENT!!! Is the help _treating me as though I am an equal and not a superior_?? HELP!!! HELP!!!!  It's very easy to activate this sequence of behaviors, just talk to a woman and ignore her nonverbal cues to be quiet.  She'll immediately start feeling threatened even if all you're doing is talking about the weather, because _women feel frightened around men who won't obey them_.  

Women feel _incredibly threatened_ by men who won't obey them, even the ""top tier chads"" have been socialized by positive feedback from women to obey them, it's just how mammals learn, positive reinforcement.  So males who haven't had that positive reinforcement, women can recognize this, and they feel utterly terrified at being around a man who hasn't been ""housebroken"" by the other women.

The women do this collectively, IMO it is an emergent behavior of which they are _unaware_. They socialize the men collectively, so that the men remain docile and stupid and unaware that most of their labor goes to support the ruling gynocracy.  At the top of every historical caste system was women who got to, well, we don't really know what they do.  They didn't farm, they had peasants to farm.  They didn't make clothing, they had servants to do that.  They didn't nurse their babies, they had wetnurses to do that.  They didn't raise their kids, nannies to do that. So, I guess, ya, they'd squeeze out a child or two, but for society women, _that was the workload_!

With the demise of the monotheistic religions, most of which place women in this privileged position, you can bet women have been taking drastic measures!

Back in my University days, I went to a talk on islam put on by the islamic students---what was weird is how many islamic women there were there, I mean, these were young, University-educated women, so what gives?

Afterward, I had a frank conversation with a couple young muslim women, and they admitted quite directly that islam was, from a woman's point of view, a 'sweet deal.'  Men are trained that they have a duty to support women and children, basically from birth they're raised to be serfs to their wives/children.  I asked, quite pointedly, ""so Islam is about controlling men, making them work for women?""

"dl1h1kr","Dave dropped his daughter off at high school, as he had done countless times before, then made his way back to County Road 117 and turned right to head to work. He had twenty minutes to get there and punch in, and since it was only a twelve minute drive, he knew he'd be on time. He had seen too many of his fellow correctional officers show up late, and he did not want to end up unemployed today.

But not more than two minutes later, he found himself stuck behind a line of parked cars. A number of drivers were milling about, discussing what little they knew about the problem. He pulled over and shut off the engine. ""Okay, what's going on up there?"" he called out.

A heavyset woman squeezed out of a Prius, and she didn't bother to try to hide her confusion. ""None of us can seem to leave. The road won't allow it.""

Dave struggled with the ridiculousness of the statement as he got out of his Chevy. ""What do you mean, the road won't allow it? It can't think for itself, can it?"" 

He heard a man shouting up ahead, but couldn't make out what he was saying. ""Walk with me,"" she responded. ""Just what I said. Some of us have tried to travel by car and on foot, but we can't even find Main Street, which should be right...here."" They had passed the sign for Route 48 a minute earlier, but the road itself was gone, replaced by a wide open field. 

Dave suddenly realized they had just walked past his Impala. Her Prius was right next to them and a long line of vehicles had gathered behind his car. ""Well, I've got roughly eight minutes to get to work, so if we could figure this out, that would be great,"" he said, checking his watch. It read the same time as it had when he dropped off his daughter. He still had twenty minutes. *What the hell?* he thought. He turned on his heel and got back in his car.

""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Perhaps there's another way you can take.""

""Well, yes, there is, but I'll be late for work. Good luck."" He restarted his car, turned around, and headed for his alternate route. But not more than two minutes later, he saw the woman once again getting out of her Prius and walking with...was that Dave himself? The space where he had parked was still vacant, so he decided to try again. Yet again, he met her as she was struggling to get out of her car. But this time, his car was parked in the spot as he passed it. He actually saw himself sitting in his Impala.

*What the hell?* He wasn't even sure if he said it or just thought it this time. He checked his watch again. Twenty minutes still. *If I take the back roads, I'll still be on time.* He punched the gas and took off. Left on Elm Street. Right on 7th Street. Left on Brook Lane. Left on 4th Street. Right on Genesee Street. Across the river and right on River Street. Left on 2nd Street. Right on Garden Street. Left on...

Main Street was supposed to be here. Instead, he saw Garden Street continuing ahead through an open field. The sign for Route 48 seemed highly out of place without the street itself. Dave looked around, took a deep breath, and turned left into the field that should have been Main Street.

The field was way too smooth to just be a field. It felt as if he was driving on the street. He turned his wheel slightly to the right and felt a drop off. He immediately corrected himself and got back onto the nonexistent road. ""Well, I'm definitely going to be late now. At least it feels like the road is here,"" he mumbled. He glanced down at the clock on his dashboard, and slammed on the brakes when he saw that he still had twenty minutes. ""OK, this is just insane,"" he laughed. ""How is time just stopped? And where is the damn road?""

Somewhere off to his left, he heard murmuring. He could make out two distinct voices. A man: ""Okay, what's going on up there?"" Then a woman: ""None of us can seem to leave. The road won't allow it."" The man, louder: ""What do you mean, the road won't allow it? It can't think for itself, can it?""

*Wait, that's me and the Prius woman!* he thought. He got out and shouted, ""Hey, over here! I found something!"" He jumped slightly as he heard the car door close. Instinctively, he turned to look, but his car was gone. In its place was a small silvery blue spacecraft.

""Are you the one they call Dave?"" asked a voice from...somewhere.

""Well, yes, but I'm not the only Dave in the world. Are you sure you've got the right one?""

""You are the only one called Dave who travels on that road at that time of day. You must be the right one. You must come with us. We will restore everything else to the way it should be."" The craft tripled in size, and a door opened. Dave felt compelled to walk inside, but something stopped him.

The voice continued, ""You, Dave, have been chosen as the Earth ambassador for the Intergalactic Council. Your objective is to explain why you humans have spent so much time and energy on killing each other and creating items such as footwear that lights up and battery operated sexual toys, and so little time and energy on getting to know your neighbors in this galaxy. Once you have met your objective, you will be returned to Earth unharmed and unaware that any of this took place, but be warned that your answers will determine how the Council deals with your planet.""

""And if I refuse to go? What happens then?"" Dave was overwhelmed and completely unprepared for this type of responsibility. After all, he was a corrections officer, not a diplomat.

""Well, then, the Galactic Council will have no choice but to destroy your planet. But do not worry, we will allow you to watch.""

Even though his view of humanity had been soured because of the crimes committed by the prisoners he dealt with at work, Dave swallowed hard and walked toward the spacecraft, determined to save the world.

She says she likes comfortable clothes and claims wearing a bra is the worst. Just look on tumblr for ""pokies"" and you'll get the idea. It's incredibly hot in an innocent way. You alther the intensity by choosing more/less sheer materials or keep it less sheer and show off side-boob. All passable as unintended sex signals. 

Aside from that she does little things to ensure she's the center of attention. The cat is in my lap and she'll come over and pet it leaning over so her boobs are 100% visible and right there in my face. Occasionally changes tops in front of me. Initially she pretended she didn't know I was about to come into her room (the door was wide open) but now If I wake her up there's a 50/50 chance she'll try to keep me captive with conversation while she changes into day clothes.  

Then there's the ""Whoops. Spilled chocolate ice cream (juice, whatever) on my pants. Better take those off and wash them right now."" *Peels off pants/shirt right there.* That's a pretty plausible scenario. Wouldn't want to ruin your favorite top/shorts. This works really well if you have a washer dryer right off the kitchen. Comes off as 100% innocent while allowing your to expose as much as you like.

"div2kyq","Not a NP, but I am a master's prepared nurse working in mental health specializing in drug and alcohol addiction. 

During nursing school I saw my share of blood and needles. You need that training to prepare you for a career in medicine. I think when people think mental health, they imagine a cute office with Rorschach blots, a big couch, sharing heart to heat conversations, ""Here's your Prozac come back in a month."" It's not all butterflies and rainbows. Remember when you work in a mental health setting you may have clients that are gravely disabled and unaware that the "" red stuff""on their foot is cellulitis, or that they have defecated in your office chair, or they may show up in alcohol withdrawal and vomit all over the floor. You might have to make trips up to the medical unit if your patient get hospitalized. I give injections all the time. Sometimes you tell someone you're a nurse and all of a sudden you get the ""Oh, you're a nurse huh? Hey look I got this weird thing growing on my back..."" and all of a sudden you're staring at an ingrown hair on some random guy's back at a family bbq. They don't care if you're a psyche nurse...a nurse is a nurse. 

Best advice would be to do some volunteering at a local mental health clinic and on an inpatient medical ward. I doubt you could volunteer on an into psychiatric ward, although that where you get the best exposure. 

Not saying you are, but if you're in it just for the money or the title...walk away now. Last thing mental health needs is more people whose hearts aren't in it 300%.

Para is .6 heat. ($6 usd)

"dfqdzz9","On planet after planet life had sprung up and eventually died.  Sometimes one creature at a time, sometimes all at once when a sun died, or a large asteroid hit, or a rogue black hole formed.  Sometimes it took out more than a world.  A few entire universes had been taken out by vacuum metastability events and other catastrophies.  

There were more variations on how life could die than how it could live and thrive.  Life gave it the most valiant effort, though.  Such inventiveness, creativity and drive had been built into each plant and animal and everything in between.  

It had at times seemed like it would go on forever, and some things would.  The virus's that had caused so many deaths themselves would now forever hibernate without a host. It was not really death, however - nor had they ever really lived.

Death did not want to move in too quickly on this last living creature.  It had a special prey that no longer lived.  It had eight legs and ferocious claws, but nothing to use them on.  It had been inanimate for a few hundred years, now.  It had floated on this chunk of space debris completely alone and unaware that it was the last living creature in all of existence.

It had long ago shed most of the water in its body, appearing as a dried husk.  Its metabolism had slowed to a point that it was nearly nonexistent.  It had survived freezing and scorching temperatures, incredible pressure and lack thereof, and years of inactivity, but a nearly nonexistent metabolism is still a metabolism and age and lack of food had finally reached the poor creature.

Death watched it.  Such a curious thing.  The long gone human race had called them ""Tardigrades"" or ""Water Bears"" and had rightfully admired them for being so hardy.  By the time people discovered them, they'd already existed over 500 million years.  

Death tenderly reached out his hand and stroked the microscopic animal.  As life began to fade from its body, Death felt himself coming undone.  Without life, there was nothing to die.  There would be no more work.  

It was peaceful, no whimper or bang.  There was no opening of the sky or other calamity to announce the loss of life of this last creature.  No momentous reaction from the cold deadness of space to such an important passing.  

Death would have let out a sigh if he'd been capable of such sounds.  There was almost nothing left.  The last of him unraveled as the spark of life in the tiny creature went out.

I'm sorry for your loss, friend. Genuinely. Before you read anything more, if you need to talk, let me know, because I'm here for you.

I work in this field, and it hurts me to say, I see SO MUCH of this in my line of work. People don't realize how much benefit they get from the state, and how it supports their life until it's literally to late. I have seen so many people go lib at the end of their life because they realize exactly what people like you and I have been talking about for years, and why we've been saying it--WE WANT YOU TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WHEN YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, WE JUST KNOW YOU'RE HUMAN AND WE LOVE YOU EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW YOU.

Part of me wants to say that you should stop forgiving them, but that's just so anti-us. It's always about compassion and love. And I think that's the part that's hardest. Admitting that our loved ones don't see the love and compassion until they're literally unable to care for themselves. And at that point it doesn't matter anymore, because they're too far gone to understand love as we know it. My great grandpa will never vote for his own self interest because even though he literally doesn't know where he is, he supports republican because he has his whole life and his ability to understand cause and effect is completely gone to dementia. He literally can't drive. He can't get out of his bed on his own.

But it's his right to vote, and he voted Trump. As a result, he will probably die this year--and without people like me helping him to be comfortable. That makes me so fucking angry I can't even stand it. I can't stand that Grandpa Joe will probably be cared for at an incredibly low level of care, and will be scared and unaware that his wife is dead, and will never understand that someone is there for him, because THAT'S WHAT HE CAN PAY FOR. But that's the world I live in.

The family cares. They want their loved one cared for. But me? I'm not made of money. My choices are as follows: 

1. Be broke as shit, but know I'm caring for your loved ones the way they want to be treated.

2. Don't be broke as shit. Rely on the government to pay, because babyboomers didn't give a shit about their insurance. Take care of them anyway, because your grandma and grandpa deserve to be taken care of for their contributions, even if they didn't save up a million dollars before they retired.

At one point while I was waiting to interview, a woman came out and yelled at the secretary because she hadn't called in enough people to interview that month, and she hadn't worked through scanning resumes as fast as she could. It was bizarre. And was exactly what they were doing.

My interview was essentially meaningless, with whom I assumed (and was) was the owner, and who seemed to be both pensive and unaware that he was not, in fact, intimidating. He also had an Xbox hooked up in the room, and empty coffee cups and shit all around. So yes, despite his suit, I knew I wasn't exactly dealing with a professional operation. But hey, I'm hard up for cash and willing to do most anything. He was a bit brief, and angry, and told me at one point that their owner (who was actually him, as I discovered) had lived in the UK like I did. This was a lie, and a pretty meaningless one at that. Then, after about fifteen minutes, he escorted me out.

It was around this time that they founded a company called Red Crown, Inc. The website's text is identical. Glassdoor's reviews are a nice mixture of five and one star reviews. The one star reviews detail how new recruits dress up in a suit and tie, drive to dangerous parts of the city, and attempt to sell over-priced, poorly working cellphones. Naturally, no gas coverage, no hourly pay, no health insurance. And, I'd wager you have to invest in the product in some fashion. 

Additionally, the owner (who stressed the importance of staying up to date on social media) hasn't indicated that he's moved to Houston. My guess? He's setting up shop around the US to make a tidy profit. But you were right, it's essentially a pyramid scheme. And now one that seems operate across state lines.

Anyway, I enjoyed my detective work. I'm going to contact the Better Business Bureau tomorrow and see what they think; I hate guys like this. They take advantage of people desperate for work and then throw them into more debt. Scum.

1. The rehashing of many many jokes. Repetition can be funny. Not if the joke was half ass in the first place then repeated 4-5 times in slightly different ridiculous ways. 
2. The characters seem to have lost substance and are now only vehicles for Seth's hit and miss comedy (still love the guy). Stevie used to be evil-now he's gay. Chris used to be dumb and unaware that he is disgusting and dumb-now he's super weird and has weird sexual scenarios. I'm not talking average young boy things either. Brian went from book smart alcoholic to pretentious cunt. Peter went from well meaning but simple father to verbally/physically abusive, alcoholic idiot amongst other things. Lois idek what she does other than yell at Peter. Oh and Meg just gets weird then normal then weird. 

3. I assume every episode is written all in one go based on a one to two sentence phrase Seth McFarlane scribbles on a receipt he found in his pocket while taking a shit.

You might liken the comparison to pedophiles somewhat of a joke, but that's really how it is.

MGTOW in that analogy is the story of how if some stranger offers you a ride home from the playground you don't get into the car. A kid is so innocent and unaware that there exists such evil in the world that they just step in without thinking twice. Many men are just like that, completely oblivious to danger, thinking that a woman could never ever do them any harm.

And to make matters worse with our state of affairs we have the pedophiles in power. Women with intent or willingness to do harm come to shut down warnings and to calls heed the dangers of relationships with women.

Could you ever imagine how things would be if you told a kid ""hey don't get in cars with strangers, that can be dangerous, and here's why.."" with a whole bunch of pedophiles interrupting and harassing with ""hey why don't you shut up about that and go not ride with strangers yourself if you don't like it?""

"ddba81o","That's good though. I'm happy that he's still able to get under people's skin. He was *never* perfectly received.

The people who think his content (his older stuff) was amazingly received by critics and audiences are either ignorant or too young to actually remember anything. 

MMLP and SSLP (especially SSLP) were railed by many critics. Not just for being controversial, but for ""trying to hard"" and just about everything that modern Eminem is being criticized for now. 

His goal was to always be this niche target that gets sprung to popularity by rebellious kids and penetrate radio with bars and offensive lines. That's kind of the point. If he doesn't succeed at that then he doesn't succeed at being himself.

This reason alone is why I find something like Recovery a bit hard to stomach as a major fan of him. Yes there are some fun and good tracks on there, but for the most part he plays it so safe due to the backlash that Relapse recieved...

Which is so ironic because Relapse is now praised, especially by this Subreddit. You see the same stupid comment every time I'm on an Eminem post; ""Relapse was a masterpiece apart from the accents!"" 

Yet I guarantee that these people would be the same ones that ragged on it for being different than what he's done before back when it came out. Why? Because people hate change. Period. It takes years for Eminem's music to grow on people because he's very ""in the moment."" Once you look back on it it always feels very reflective. He even talks about this on many of his songs. 

I'm even starting to see a lot of MMLP2 praise on this subreddit, which is so hilarious to me. It's just people being ignorant and unaware. That being said, I feel like the only two albums in his entire Discog that haven't been honest with his personality were Recovery and Encore. Every other album had him grow. Even Recovery, which may sound contradictory, had him grow as a musician, but wasn't necessarily honest with who he is as one. 

__________

I'm not saying you have to like Eminem. Hell, you don't even have to like his music. I personally don't care. What really bugs me, though, is when people dismiss your opinions just because they are different. In anything. The worst part is that their arguments against Eminem are often very shallow and misinformed.

You can hate his now flow (trust me, I totally get not enjoying a rappers flow, even though I do enjoy his new flow), but you can't say it is objectively off beat. You can also hate how corny he is, as he makes a lot of Dad jokes and very tongue in cheek bars. You can also hate how edgy he is. Etc. 

But I will argue against it for the same reason I'd argue for any other artist I enjoy. If you talk shit about RTJ i'll come at you I swear! And I just *recently* got into RTJ too. 

The point is, lets not judge people on the music they enjoy. Lets hear them out. If you disagree with me, please tell me why, instead of just dismissing me, or anyone else, as some lesser listener just because their opinion is different. Like, you can love trap music and the less understandable a rapper is the better for you, that's great. I'll argue with you for sure. But I'll never say you are objectively less of a fan than I am.

2) Hillary Clinton is so stupid and unaware that she held compromising conversations over telephone lines whilst in Russia itself.

3) Trump’s lawyer/adviser Mr Cohen was so stupid he held meetings in Prague with the hacker/groups themselves in person to arrange payment, along with senior officials of the Russian security services.

5) A private western company is able to run a state level intelligence operation in Russia for years, continually interviewing senior security sources and people personally close to Putin, without being caught by the Russian security services – despite the fact the latter are brilliant enough to install a Manchurian candidate as President of the USA. This private western company can for example secretly interview staff in top Moscow hotels – which they themselves say are Russian security service controlled – without the staff being too scared to speak to them or ending up dead.

"dcf3yxn","There's no such thing as a ""former"" MI6 agent, unless you pissed them off.

I think it's a better bet the Brits knew the story was bogus. This is what Craig Murray, a former UK ambassador, wrote about it:

""We are now told that the reports were written by Mr Christopher Steele, an ex-MI6 man, for Orbis Business Intelligence. Here are a short list of six impossible things we are asked to believe before breakfast:
""1) Vladimir Putin had a five year (later stated as eight year) plan to run Donald Trump as a “Manchurian candidate” for President and Trump was an active and knowing partner in Putin’s scheme.
""2) Hillary Clinton is so stupid and unaware that she held compromising conversations over telephone lines whilst in Russia itself.
""3) Trump’s lawyer/adviser Mr Cohen was so stupid he held meetings in Prague with the hacker/groups themselves in person to arrange payment, along with senior officials of the Russian security services. The NSA, CIA and FBI are so incompetent they did not monitor this meeting, and somehow the NSA failed to pick up on the electronic and telephone communications involved in organising it. Therefore Mr Cohen was never questioned over this alleged and improbable serious criminal activity.
""4) A private company had minute by minute intelligence on the Manchurian Candidate scheme and all the indictable illegal activity that was going on, which the CIA/NSA/GCHQ/MI6 did not have, despite their specific tasking and enormous technical, staff and financial resources amounting between them to over 150,000 staff and the availability of hundreds of billons of dollars to do nothing but this.
""5) A private western company is able to run a state level intelligence operation in Russia for years, continually interviewing senior security sources and people personally close to Putin, without being caught by the Russian security services – despite the fact the latter are brilliant enough to install a Manchurian candidate as President of the USA. This private western company can for example secretly interview staff in top Moscow hotels – which they themselves say are Russian security service controlled – without the staff being too scared to speak to them or ending up dead. They can continually pump Putin’s friends for information and get it.
""6) Donald Trump’s real interest is his vast financial commitment in China, and he has little investment in Russia, according to the reports. Yet he spent the entire election campaign advocating closer ties with Russia and demonising and antagonising China.""

"dbk4qtn","&gt; He took a photo of a classified propulsion system... you honestly don't see the difference between writing down words to communicate vs taking a picture of an actually classified technology?

Writing down classified information to communicate? No, there is zero difference. A photo is no more special than an email. Both were classified the moment they came into existence. His, because the photo contained details of a classified piece of technology. Hillary's because it contained details of top secret programs. 

&gt;And concluded that after talking with Clinton there was no reason to think she would have considered it classified. Like I said, it was an interagency disagreement

Specifically Comey stated that she was so ignorant and unaware that he would have had to proceed on a gross negligence charge. The only difference between the Submariner and Hillary was that the Submariner was believed to be competent. 

&gt;Not if the investigation is closed

Even then, because closing the investigation is not a step and it is not relevant to the courts.

&gt;No she couldn't... that would be ""illegal"" in the eyes of Comey

No, the internal network, not the state department public email network, but the secure terminal inside Hillary's office which she refused to use, would have been perfectly acceptable for her to have this conversation on. Seriously, did you read nothing except the campaign notes from Hillary's team? 

&gt;If that email is discovered per FOIA requests, then yes that is the definition of retroactive classification.

So now you think that classification is a matter of how it was discovered? Discovery doesn't change classification. What matters for classification is whether classified materials were used in its creation. Which Hillary did. 

&gt;You're talk about ""classified at the time"" is irrelevant to the discussion of retroactive classification. It just means the process in how something was declared classified. 

No, it means that it contained information which at the time of its writing was classified.

For example, Hillary wrote about a top secret program, lets say the drone strike program. Hillary knows that the drone strike program is top secret. Hillary uses the information she knows about it and writes that up in an email. That email is considered top secret *as she is writing it*

&gt;That's what retroactive classification is. All it means is that it was an email that was self created (not a sent document) and that in an FOIA request the content was deemed classified. That's all it is. You're talk about ""classified at the time"" is irrelevant to the discussion of retroactive classification. It just means the process in how something was declared classified. And No one has EVER been charged with a crime for a retroactively classified email. It'd be one thing to suggest that people should, but to say that this was a justified investigation where we knew full well no one has ever been charged with a crime for such a circumstance just made it clear that this was 100% political. Then we find out that the FBI is Trumplandia, throwing into question whether any of these emails truly were ""classified at the time"".

All of this applies to the selfie taken in the reactor room. It's self created, it relates to a classified piece of intelligence, it was transmitted outside of the classified network. 

&gt;ITS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

Except it has, it was being done at the exact time that Hillary was being prosecuted, the only difference was that Hillary was more convincing in her stupidity and ignorance.

"datvagq","I’ll bite. I don’t have a sob story and I’m not impoverished, but the process has been mentally damaging.  

I essentially sleepwalked through my sheltered, suburban, upper middle class upbringing. I watched a lot of TV. I did the bare minimum to get good grades in school. I went to college because that’s just what you did. I was generally bored and unaware that there were even interesting questions to ask.

Fast forward to post college, I’ve got my degree in mechanical engineering and I’m working in “sustainable development” (hahahaha!) designing energy efficient buildings. The phrase “a cynic is nothing but a disappointed idealist” describes my awakening class consciousness and eventually my existential despair. Seeing one too many projects get gutted because “sustainability just isn’t in the budget” was absolutely crushing. Whether by nature or by education, I have a tendency to question assumptions and started piling up the library books in search of answers. What I came to realize is that the problems we face are not technical, they are social, political, moral, and economic. Our systems and institutions are fundamentally flawed. We debate the merits of this or that construction technique without noticing that we’ve placed our buildings foundation in a swamp. Facing up to this fact is too scary so we double down and declare that by building higher we can improve the foundation. There are no cosmetic renovations that can repair structural flaws, the whole thing needs to be rebuilt. 

Running parallel to this process was an increasing awareness of our environmental predicament; climate change, ecosystem destruction, loss of biodiversity, population pressure, carrying capacity, resource shortages, etc., and the fact that our growth based economy is essentially one giant Ponzi scheme. Our institutions are completely incapable of dealing with these issues and we’ve come to mistake more of the poison for the cure. I don’t think this will end well, my guess is that the entire thing will fall apart before most people will let go of their ideologies. I now have existential depression, chronic boredom, and a complete lack of interest in things I used to care about and a revulsion that people I know still care about them. This particular rabbit hole isn’t for everyone, I can see why people avoid asking questions.

in non-physical we all have a lot of friends or even to say a it a lot of aspects that like to ""help out"" but at the same time physical is a experience/a journey so they won't help out in the parts where your SOUL wants to gain experience in this/that (whatever it planned) so umm yah you can say they don't all help in non-physical.. they honor the game/the journey/mission of exploring everything we are.. that's *the point* of the game! in the first place..

"d5l7gm3","No. From a pure programming standpoint, those issues can not at all be blamed on server load. The ""unable to connect to servers"" issues that were experienced in the first couple days were server load, but anything that involves a game crash, freeze, or broken functions (like the 3 step bug) are entirely due to poor programming.

EDIT: 

To elaborate, first off, a program should NEVER freeze or crash. Some freezes/crashes are unpredictable and can't be prevented, like when you try to run the latest Call of Duty on your Commodore 64 - but no crash or freeze should ever happen during the normal operation of a program on target hardware.

Now, excessive server load can cause latency, which can bring on it's own issues. For example, location lag would be somewhat expected, as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining a connection. The thing is, this should be programmed into the game - if the client can't connect to the server, it should, worst case scenario, run some exception code that displays a message saying ""ERROR: Cannot connect to server"" or something along those lines. It shouldn't freeze, crash, and cause your phone to spontaneously combust. Latency is pretty much the most expectable problem you will have in *any* internet based game - even if you *don't* have problems with server load, you *still* need to prepare for latency issues just for when players go into an area where they get poor reception, or run up against their data limit.

To make an analogy, it's sort of like a McDonalds. When there's a lot of people in McDonalds, you might have to wait in line to order. Knowing that this happens, they have several registers at McDonalds, and call people up to the register one at a time. When your order is ready, they call your order number, and present it to you at the counter for pickup. If there was some incredible, unprecedented rush, the McDonalds would tell people that the restaurant was full and that they should come back later. In this analogy, the McDonalds is a well designed program, that anticipates potential issues and is designed to still work under a load.

In the Pokemon GO McDonalds, if there's a line, they throw live angry badgers at everyone in the restaurant. Also, no matter what you order, you only get 3/4ths of a large order of fries and a lukewarm diet Pepsi. There is, supposedly, some way to order other drinks, but no one can tell you how to do it because all the employees were hired without their knowledge, and are actually totally untrained and unaware that they have been kidnapped from the local mental hospital.

"d5gdwiv","Many years ago I was fired from my job in a small ad agency: it was a Friday night, and I was leaving for a weeklong vacation in Disney World with my wife and kids. I was utterly unprepared for what came next, other than a vague awareness of some financial problems we’d been having with our largest client.

The official reason for my dismissal was that a search of phone records revealed I had made a phone call to the Executive Creative Director of a much larger local agency from a company phone about six months earlier. This agency was not a competitor to any of our accounts.

I was stunned. Initially I couldn’t even remember the incident, but later recalled that this ECD wanted to discuss my availability for an open position at his shop. The other job never materialized, and I forgot about it until that Friday night I was fired.

Years later I came in contact with the boss who fired me, and some comments he made tipped me off to what he could not tell me: I was actually fired because of some very high medical bills incurred at the birth of my third child and which the agency could not acknowledge without making themselves vulnerable to a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal. Since that time, I’ve seen similar incidents happen in many different ways. All companies, large and small, have ways of getting around:

"d4pouua","""I'll give you 10 minutes"" said Grim, as he lazily placed his Scythe against a wall. I looked at his face, well, where his face would be if it wasn't masked by the thick black fog that enveloped the inside of his hood. 

""Can't I just have an hour with him? He lived such a long life. He knows so much. Experienced so much. The man knows of heartache unparalleled and joy inconceivably huge. I want to learn it all before you take him to where he needs to be"" I responded. 

""They all do. Such is life. Sadly, I doubt this one will remember much of anything. 9 minutes."" Grim said as he ushered himself to a nearby chair. He made it abundantly clear that he was done debating, and if I was gather what I wanted I would have to make haste. And so, I turned from the faceless void of my dear friend, and marched over to the soon to be departed. 

""Hello Ramses"" I spoke out softly. Ramses' hand shook as his ears pricked awake. He turned in his bed and faced towards me, the milky white gunk that covered his retinas blinding him. With a trembling hand he made contact with my face. He rubbed down the ridges of my cheeks, slowly curved his fingertip around my lips and lastly fondled the upper parts of my skull, as he painted my face inside his mind. I looked down his arm to see a small tattoo imprinted across his wrist. '91820' it wrote, short and simple, but within its simplicity's it hold a tale of the darkest parts of man's hearts.

""Dad?"" Ramses asked out. ""You came back for me"". I could feel the heart in my chest thump out of pattern as Ramses spoke to me. The poor man had mistaken me for a long last one. Who was I though, in the last few minutes of his long life, to deny him this joy. 

""Hello Son. I came back."" I rubbed my palm across his forehead lightly, pushing away a small gathering of sweat. I could see his lip quiver as my words flushed into his mind, and the corners of his eyes begin to tear up. 

""Why did you leave me? I needed you..."" Ramses words bit with a venom I hadn't felt before. I couldn't comprehend the kind of soul crushing sadness that resided underneath three little words. 'I needed you'. 

""I know. I know. I'm sorry I wasn't there. But I am here now."" I sat down on a small chair next to his bed and gripped his hand lightly. The tubes running into his veins on his right arm chugged the last bits of their contents into his body, as Ramses could feel his body begin to slow down. 

""I needed you. They killed everyone. They burned their bodies. They marked us for death. They turned me into a number. They made me not human. Dad, they... I needed you so badly"". Tears poured down Ramses' cheeks as he choked on his words. I, too, felt tears begin to gather behind my eyes, as I held his hand tighter and tighter. Through him I felt it all. The persecution, the blades, the terror and the fear, all at once. I felt the black mark that was burnt in his flesh. Such incredible suffering.

""Son, I hope you know, that If I could have been there by your side I would have. I never stopped thinking about you. I never stopped wishing that one day I could see you become the man that you are tonight. You made me so proud. I love you. I pray that you never forget that I love you."" I didn't know if it was true. I did not know the man his father was. Perhaps he was a coward. Or, perhaps, he was a hero who died in a battle that no one man could win. I did not know. But in this moment of serenity, I felt as if the truth did not matter as much as hope. I could see the last bits of life drip out of Ramses, as he grew a smile that would make the galaxies dance with delight. 

""What happens now Dad?"" He asked me. ""Do I go to Shamayim?"" I rubbed my hand up his arm and pushed the tears that streamed down his face away, before responding.

""Yes, my boy. A man of your caliber was destined to always go."" I could feel the room grow colder as Grim walked into the room, standing behind me with Scythe in hand, as he looked at Ramses. I looked at my friend and asked, ""Does this hurt you? To be the Specter every human runs from?"" Grim simply turned his head to face me.

""Does this hurt you? To be the Specter who stands before every human and becomes the person they once were? I just send them where they need to go."" Ramses' eyes closed. His spirit floated high above his corpse, eyes closed and unaware, that he had even passed. Grim placed a single hand on his shoulder, which startled Ramses, but he quickly calmed himself down. 

""Where are we going Dad?"" He said, facing Grim. Grim looked at me, waiting for me to answer him.

"d4jf4w0","&gt; I disagree. Throwing in some 'bag' of 'stuff' is bad design. You need to have knowledge of the internal implementation to use it 'the right way'

It's a dictionary of values. Your alternative is a list of values (more specifically a tuple of arguments). How is one a ""bag"" and the other isn't?

The more important distinction would be the kind of validation that's applied to either the dictionary or list. So if you'd argue about a ""bag of stuff"", argue about the lack of strict validation, not about the input format. 

A list is no stricter than a dictionary. And the provided type annotations in PHP are hardly specific and restrictive when it comes to primitive types (you'd still need to do additional validation for most types of input you'd handle).

&gt; That's a good thing. Unrolling parameters is bad until we get proper named parameters in php. Until then I'd much rather explicitly force my consumer to know what the arguments are, instead of just 'winging it'.

This comes down again to talking about input format when your problem is lack of validation. You can validate an associative array. It's quite trivial.

&gt; A very bad thing to do. It makes the developer lazy and unaware that they're not the same thing. This type of inheritance is exactly why I banned the usage of extends in my previous project.

How can you claim they're not ""the same thing"" without knowing anything about the business logic of the app?

I find it awkward to defend inheritance, as I rarely use it, but I rarely use it because that's a choice I make in the context of my projects, and not because of ""bans"" or gross overgeneralizations, like you're making. 

The ""Item"" class here is very similar to the concept of a file. You have image files, text files, document files, archive files. But all files have a filename, size, date of creation etc. Same here. You'd find a similar ""base"" type of entity in many PHP systems. Drupal's ""Node"", WordPress' ""Post"". And here it's ""Item"".

&gt; A lot of assumptions. One of the strategies could be ""the first paragraph"". One could be ""max amount of characters"". One could be ""max amount of words"". If we are talking example here, this would be a great chance to show the power of interfaces.

And you're saying all those variations, which don't even match in type (string, int, int in your examples) should seemingly arbitrarily come out of the same getSummary() method depending on the strategy? ...

&gt; It won't help to unroll the parameters, it'll only add verbosity to the code.

That's a _good_ thing. Unrolling parameters is bad until we get proper named parameters in php. Until then I'd much rather explicitly force my consumer to know what the arguments are, instead of just 'winging it'.

&gt; There are three classes in total, so ""everything"" is two classes extending Item, for the obvious reason that they have the same base fields. Not exactly a bad thing to do. 

A very bad thing to do. It makes the developer lazy and unaware that they're _not_ the same thing. This type of inheritance is exactly why I banned the usage of `extends` in my previous project. Inheritance for the sake of laziness is an anti-pattern and a refactor nightmare. Yes, inheritance has its place in OOP, but not for code-reuse. 

&gt; They already might be. There's no type restriction on them.

That is exactly my problem.

&gt; What exactly would the injected strategy be here? If I want a summary, I probably wouldn't want the result to be arbitrary depending on what strategy was set for summary generation during construction. I'd want predictable output.

"d3quhrn","Here's what I would do, in brief.

1. Remove Qui-Gonn from the main action, replaced with Obi-Wan. This younger Obi-Wan will be brash and impulsive, very much in need of seasoning. Qui-Gonn would provide exposition and instigate character growth in Obi. When Qui-Gonn dies, Obi-Wan is left to teach Anakin himself, paving the way for a flawed Jedi in Anakin Skywalker.

2. Remove Chancellor Palpatine's story arc. The Emperor's role in the future makes more sense if he seized power aggressively. He never struck me as being terribly subversive in the original trilogy. Y'know, what with the death lightning and the very straightforward talk of turning to the Dark Side.

3. Replace Clone Troopers. Clone Troopers and Stormtroopers simply cannot be the same thing, despite the implication that they are. Instead, Palpatine has made a pact with (or coerced with the Force) a legion of unpleasant genetically grown creatures with devastating battle tactics to terrorize and weaken the Republic. The Emperor's involvement can be kept hidden from the audience for the most part, until the end of the trilogy, once the strategy of fracturing the Republic and swaying the leadership to make sweeping changes to an imperial dictatorship is complete. He can then destroy his secret allies and assume domination over the new Empire.

4. Show some despair! The people and their leaders need to be starving, battleworn, haggard, and impoverished by the end of the trilogy to make the drastic and frightening change of tone in the government to make sense. Palpatine's tactics will seem much more logical if the audience can see the public and the Senate start to grow terrified as worlds fall and fleets burn in space while the rest of the Republic starts to starve.

5. Anakin Skywalker needs to be far less petulant. Omit the storyline about his mother, and his love affair with Padme. Instead, have Anakin portrayed as an upstanding, if flawed, man. His downfall can be as simple as being seduced by a woman - maybe even a Jedi Knight. Cue pregnancy that he doesn't find out about until after the twins are born. Angry that she kept her pregnancy secret and unaware that he has more than one child, he murders her and begins his descent to the Dark Side while searching for his son.

You're really stretching it to say Kendra acts like Inara and River, but I'll give you credit because Kendra is suppose to be an exotic woman (Inara is a consort, Kendra is a reincarnated Goddess, both see  exotic to me), and a warrior, but she's not psychotic or psychic like River.

In MGS4, I think he both believed that he was Liquid and knew that it was a ruse to fool the patriots. He had to do this so he could be convincing, yet still pull the strings. By the end of MGS4, Ocelot had replaced Liquid's arm with a prosthetic. The events of MGS4 were all Ocelot, not Liquid.

What I think is up for debate is whether Liquid ever possessed Ocelot, or if he died and remained dead at the end of MGS1. I think it has the groundwork for both, but I lean towards Liquid died and never possessed Ocelot. I say there is groundwork for the alternative, since Ocelot's father was a powerful medium and its feasible in the MGS universe that Liquid spirit could have channeled itself through Ocelot.

"czv60r8","&gt; Well good luck playing hardly any Japanese games then. Removing face rubbing is far from the biggest thing an FE game has had removed from it, so you've likely played games with removed content without even knowing it.

Well I'm not too picky (I sound hypocritical right now, I know), but I have concerns when an entire feature is removed (which I was ignorant and unaware that the Live2D assets are still used).

Ok, that does seem fair.

"czg8v81","Hoxton's a ruthless, sociopathic bank robber with no real moral compass. He kills civilians just because they *might* have seen him, or they were too scared to react when he tells them to get down. He faces down Bulldozers, Tasers, Cloakers, Shields, and is fully able to effectively dual-wield most handguns. In the first PAYDAY game, he represented the 'Marksman' skill tree, with his weapons including the M14 rifle, meaning he's a crack-shot.

To quote him, ""*Let's break some necks.*""

1. One shot, one kill, $10,000 in cleaner costs.

2. One shot, one kill, two screaming parents, two more shots, $30,000 in cleaner costs.

3. For the sake of his personal entertainment, Hoxton beats him to near-death prison-style, then stabs him with a toothbrush.

4. Completely rakes him with gunfire and probably an RPG for good measure. Does not have XXL body bags, so he just leaves the body there.

5. Once again, shoots the kid in the head. Might need to watch out, though; Always be wary of the skinny, lonely teenagers, because they might be hiding a TEC-9 for the lunch break.

6. Due to the slowed reflexes of a drunk person, Hoxton could probably just kill him bare-handed. No fingerprints, either.

7. This depends on how well a Roman shield can deflect bullets. Then again, it might not even matter; If a .50 can go through a S.W.A.T Ballistic Shield, it can go through something from a time where Kevlar had never been invented.

8. This'd be interesting. Han Solo's the literal equivalent to Hoxton, in that both of them carry out illegal activities regularly and are experts in the ways of gun / blaster combat. I figure that it'd be pretty intense, but as always, Hoxton would probably just decided ""*No kill like OVERKILL*"" and wipe him out with either an RPG or an M79 grenade launcher whilst Han's behind cover. Then he'd probably try and steal the Millenium Falcon, fail, then go to Mos Eisley cantina to see if he could contact Bain about getting home.

9. Despite having no prior military training, Hoxton's capable of smashing apart wave after wave of armed response units, and depending on the difficulty / security level of the area, might end up needing to take on a hyper-elite paramilitary unit; GENSEC Elites. That in mind, it's not clear how much damage he could do up close to the Marines' armour using modern-day weaponry. Thus, for the purpose of being certain, he'd probably just use a .50 and turn the Marines' chest into an open cavern.

10. If we're going by current Bond, Hoxton smashes him. Current day Bond uses a Walther PPK, which, being a very small pistol with only a marginally high magazine size, would be easily outgunned if Hoxton packs any of the other pistols from Gage's Black Market. Additionally, due to his skills in dual-wielding handguns, it can be assumed that Hoxton is *incredibly* proficient in the use of pistols, reloading much faster than Bond can and packing twice as much firepower. Plus, Bond is rarely shown wearing body armour, and MI6 has a nasty habit of underestimating who they pit him against. Coupled with the fact that Scotland Yard is unlikely to know just how dangerous Hoxton has become since leaving England, Bond would be going against a much faster opponent, outgunned, unarmoured, and unaware that Hoxton is the *real* kickarse Englishman with the sharp tongue.

11. Jason Bourne, if I remember rightly, is a super-assassin with exceptional skills in everything Hoxton's good at. However, to consider that whilst Bourne knows how to hide, it's more notable that Hoxton knows how to disappear. Plus, Hoxton's not above using dirty, underhanded tactics (*His skill 'Low Blow' gives a critical hit chance when using concealed weapons*), but let's keep it to in-game abilities. For this, Hoxton packs a suppressed sniper rifle of some variety, plus an SMG. Bourne is shown hitting impressive shots whilst lying down, but Hoxton can hit some fucking *ludicrous* shots whilst he's jumping through the air or sprinting through a building. If he sees Jason, Jason is *buggered*.

12. Not certain of how good Hawkeye is, but as far as I know, bullets go faster than arrows. I'm also not sure if Hawkeye's superhuman in any way, but I'd say he seems pretty strong and fast. This one's a grey area, and it also depends on the environment. If it's an open area, Hoxton would probably just pack some dumb shit like a Vulcan minigun and shit out a whole fuckload of lead, probably also needing to dodge a good number of arrows and possibly being hit by them once or twice. If there's cover, it's a whole different ball game, and it also depends how good Hawkeye's...uh, eyes are.

13. Hoxton is not above beating women to death. Considering it's Black Widow, I wouldn't be surprised if she was capable of knowing all of Hoxton's whereabouts at any given time, and knowing about all of his skills, contacts, armoury, and previous experience. In close quarters, Black Widow would probably do pretty well, but put range into the equation, and it's entirely different. I'd say Hoxton has somewhat of a chance, and might win...1/2, I'd say. Again, really depends on the location, distance of engagement, and potential civilians.

14. Here we go: The ultimate crime-fighter against the ultimate criminal. For the purpose of this, let's say that Hoxton's engaged in an average H&amp;T robbery, on about OVERKILL difficulty. The police pull out, and Falcon swoops in. I had a look at his capabilities, but it doesn't list whether or not his flight suit is ballistic rated. Hoxton would probably just stay inside the bank: It's a highly recommended strategy on the heist, regardless of whether you're fighting cops or flying people. When Falcon lands and attempts to infiltrate, he either gets raked with machine gun fire until he's shot in the face, or jumped, pinned down, and stabbed with a combat knife repeatedly. Might take some effort to engage in CQC, however, as Falcon's much taller and much stronger than Hoxton.

15. Nolan's Batman gets stabbed *once* and nearly dies. And whilst he's a master of chi-power, he has no real way to bring down Hoxton, who'd be moving at speed, using high-powered weaponry, and is already resistant to being knifed, shot, and gassed. Additionally, whilst Batman has a habit of blocking all communications on local frequencies and turning off the power, Hoxton would likely know what to look for as a means of turning on the power. Plus, regardless of the fact it's Batman and he's a master crimefighter, he still refuses to kill. Hoxton, however, has no qualms with it, and would probably do worse things to Batman than Bane did in the sewers.

16. Whilst Ant-Man might be stronger when he's small and what-not, he sure as fuck isn't fireproof, and Hoxton has access to a Flamethrower. If he knows which direction Ant Man's coming from, and then saturates that area with Napalm, Ant Man's pretty fucked.

17. Now, Archer's pretty good. I'll give him that. But whilst it's claimed that him being shot 34 times is impressive, that's about the amount of times Hoxton gets shot *every two minutes* on harder heists. Not only that, but Hoxton is capable of doing most of the feats that Archer can; With the correct skills, he can run at speed without being winded for at least thirty seconds, regenerating all of his stamina incredibly fast, *literally dodge gunfire*, counter-attack martial-arts trained paramilitary units, wear armour that can stop sniper bullets, shoot from the hip whilst sprinting, reload whilst sprinting, make Tasers backfire, fight the Washington SWAT wearing nothing but a prison jumpsuit, operate most firearms with incredible proficiency, deploy sentry guns, defy the very laws of physics on which we operate as human beings, and a lot more. I'm also fairly certain he has a *lot* of blood diseases, considering how much he uses blood bags and medical kits. Additionally, Hoxton's entire attitude towards anybody with government ties is that they need to fucking die. He wouldn't hold back, at all, and that's pretty terrifying.

18. Winter Soldier is *insane*. Considering his experience in the army, and his additional training, Hoxton would definitely struggle more than he would with a gang of Cloakers. Plus, the Winter Soldier's almost super-human strength mixed with some ranged combat abilities would pose a significant problem for Hoxton. I'd say this is where things start getting a little shaky. The only way Hoxton could guaranteed win, 10/10, would be if he got the jump on him with a .50 caliber rifle. Otherwise, I'd say he's got about a 5/10 chance.

19. Captain America's about the same as the Winter Soldier, except with the added issue of an indestructible shield. I have no idea if Cap can deflect a 40mm grenade with it, or an RPG, but if he can, Hoxton may well need to use the old [""*Modern Day Robin Hood*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16d4Eakmr1k) technique and saturate the area, any civilians, and Captain America, in napalm. I can really see Hoxton doing fairly well, considering that Captain America is like a Shield on super-steroids.

20. A good place to die. The Chief is fast, strong, and could easily kill Hoxton. I'd say this is the point where Hoxton goes down swearing loudly, before being arrested and spending the entire Interdimensional Court trial grinning like an arsehole at M for how hard he kicked Bond's arse.

After that, he is sent to prison for the rest of his life, with no chance of parole until the Dentist pulls his [usual face](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/833/275/bc5.jpg) and manages to pay off a bunch of other fictional characters to break him out.

"cy4qez4","&gt; I don't know anything about cars but I do know about that stuff so you've given me something to keep an eye out for when buying a used car.

It's less common than it used to be years ago; both because there's been a significant increase in the quality and availability, and a reduction in the cost/price of replacement (OEM) body panels, i.e. door skins and fenders and the like -- and so it's often cheaper to just replace the whole thing rather than to try to ""undent"" and remold a bashed in piece of metal;  and then also there's been (finally) an improvement in the design of fender wells and such, so that they don't rust out quite as readily as they did with the vehicles from the 80's and prior. (And some will claim it's due to advances, but in reality its actually due more to the fact that cars are sold on longer lease/payment plans, and have significantly longer warranties, and so the manufacturers NEED them to maintain a better aesthetic appearance, so they finally made changes to the seams &amp; joints, techniques that were known all along to work in a manner that reduced rust; ironically that's been a double edged sword though, as cars which last longer mean people keep them longer and don't want to buy new ones as frequently.)

&gt;But the comparison to women is the icing on the cake. Many don't even have the courtesy to patch themselves up. They just show up, warts* and all. 

--

Well that's sort of the whole point.

--

The saying *used* to be pretty common -- at least among guys I knew -- guys who grew up in rural or suburban regions of the US working on their own cars, often refurbing/rebuilding/restoring some literal ""piece of shit/rust bucket"" that they picked up for a couple hundred bucks and transforming it over time, with a bit of money and a lot of elbow grease (i.e. hard work, personal time invested) into a literal ""show car"" that they could drive around to the envy of their mates.  

The thing is of course that, depending on how well the repairs were done, they tended to NOT necessarily last very long -- maybe a year or two at the most before the signs of rust would begin to reappear, or in the worst cases when some minor ""bump"" would end up dropping a proverbial ""chunk"" of bondo (like some fist-sized plastic rock) off the thing.

So not infrequently the solution would be to sell the car to some ""rube"" who didn't know any better, and who thought he was buying some ""like new"" car -- clueless, oblivious, and unaware that what he was getting was actually an old rust bucket that had been ""mudded up"" and ""glossed over"" (aka lots of bondo and a new paint job) -- and that within fairly short order, probably less than a year the thing would be revealed once again as the old rusty car that it was.

--

And... well what ELSE do teen and twenty something guys obsess over, and even arguably ""trade"" information back and forth amongst each other about?  Other than cars the obvious answer is women.  From there, well the parallels of bondo and makeup, etc -- they're just too ""juicy"" to NOT use; especially since you can use the jargon while the chicks are standing right next to you and they're likely to remain entirely clueless as  you're talking about: 

&gt;&gt;*""Hey man did you see Joey's new 'ride'?""* 

&gt;&gt;""Oh yeah, looks like she's gotta lotta mileage, probably been in an accident or two, plus she doesn't exactly seem to be firing on all cylinders if you know what I mean.""

&gt;&gt;*""Heh yeah, I mean she looks nice and all, but with that paint job, you gotta wonder if he remembered to 'thump for the bondo' you know?""*

Now you tell me, are they talking about the used car that Joey just bought?  Or are they talking about the girl he just started dating?

Actually it could be either one. They could be having that conversation while standing right next to their own girlfriends at some party; but only the guys would understand.

"cy41umz","I'd guess that Solnit has probably read a lot of the Esquire list, and it's clear she thinks ""there are good and great books"" on it. For example, I don't get the sense she's being ironic when she calls Lolita a ""masterpiece."" From what I've read, it sounds like Nabokov wrote HH just as you read him, which is where the genius of the book lies for many readers. In contrast, I think the Esquire summary of it [pulls a Kubrick on us](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/designing-lolita). And in many cases, it doesn't seem to be the books on the list that Solnit is objecting to (although there are some of those too), as much as the hows and whys of Esquire's choices in curating them.

&gt; Art is dangerous. I agree- but I also don't respect any authority to designate them the arbiters of what dangers are worth exposure to....  If disagreeing with Solnit over trying to control culture for her own ends makes me a neocon- then so be it. Trying to control art isn't the act of a liberal, no matter what she tells herself.

I don't think you're disagreeing with Solnit because I don't think she's trying to do that. If anything, she seems to go out of her way to emphasize that she's not establishing herself as the arbiter of what dangers are worth exposure to. 

In the original piece, she writes:

&gt; The list made me think there should be another, with some of the same books, called 80 Books No Woman Should Read, though of course I believe everyone should read anything they want. I just think some books are instructions on why women are dirt or hardly exist at all except as accessories or are inherently evil and empty. Or they’re instructions in the version of masculinity that means being unkind and unaware, that set of values that expands out into violence at home, in war, and by economic means. 

In the follow-up piece, she opens by reflecting on the differences between facts and opinions, while positioning her comments in the second camp. She seems to share your belief that there's no immutable relationship between signified and signifier: on top of discussing the interplay between readers' experiences and narratives, she explicitly argues, ""You can read Nabokov’s relationship to his character in many ways,"" before discussing some of the different ways that people have read Lolita. She also clarifies that censorship is not her intent:

&gt; I wasn’t even challenging anyone’s access to making money. I just made humorous remarks about some books and some dead writers’ characters. These guys were apparently so upset and so convinced that the existence of my opinions and voice menaced others’ rights. Guys: censorship is when the authorities repress a work of art, not when someone dislikes it.

And she ends by reiterating:

&gt; I had never said that we shouldn’t read Lolita. I’ve read it more than once. I joked that there should be a list of books no woman should read, because quite a few lionized books are rather nasty about my gender, but I’d also said “of course I believe everyone should read anything they want. I just think some books are instructions on why women are dirt or hardly exist at all except as accessories or are inherently evil and empty.” And then I’d had fun throwing out some opinions about books and writers. But I was serious about this. You read enough books in which people like you are disposable, or are dirt, or are silent, absent, or worthless, and it makes an impact on you. Because art makes the world, because it matters, because it makes us. Or breaks us.

So what am I missing, that leads you to believe that Solnit is trying to (or wants to) control culture? Does the Equire list constitute that too, or is it only when people recommend not reading some books rather than reading them?

"cwyzclx","When it comes to splitting the assets, it's going to come down quite simply to who has a name on the title/deed/debt.  Creditors don't care what the verbal agreements were to parents, or how you guys split up your expenses, or what's 'fair' in terms of splitting debt and equity.

Assuming you both split and move to apartments/family, you'll both still be on the hook for your joint debts/ownership of assets.  Either person can ""buy out"" the other by signing a quit-claim, which could be tied to either a financial agreement (ie you buy out his half of the land you guys own, or you give up your equity in exchange for him assuming part of your student line of credit), one of you walks away (ie just signs the quit claim and gives debt and assets to the other), or, one of you forces a sale (meaning neither one wants to walk away and you can't come to an agreement on the assets/debts, in which case going through the court a sale would be forced and you'll both end up splitting what's likely to be a loss based on your info).  

Your local laws may vary on the financial details of what I just listed out, but there's a few things to keep in mind regardless:

- You are the owner of the 25k of student credit debt.  He has no legal obligation to this debt.
- His parents have no legal claim to any money from either of you, although they could probably go to small claims court.  Due to the amount though, the cost/benefit likely isn't worth it, especially considering even if they win they can't just get a lump sum payment, as no one has it
- The 2.5 acre lot and the 'tiny house' is jointly owned by both of you.  Who paid what is irrelevant unless it goes to court to have one or the other buy out the equity or force a sale.
- Your current incomes, from a legal perspective, are irrelevant in terms of how assets will be divided in a legal situation.

Advice?  Get an apartment or move in with family, but keep the families OUT of your discussions.  Sort the financial details out later, but be willing to walk away from your equity in these assets in exchange for his assumption of the debt with them.  Dragging this out further is not going to do anything but become a nightmare...this is one of those know when to fold them situations that you learn from in the future.  Cut ties with his family, the relationship, and the assets of this situation.

Having gone through a very similar situation, I would also suggest not blindsiding the guy.  Unless there's a legitimate fear of violence or damage to your stuff, etc, or there's zero chance of having a conversation, discussing your feelings about your living situation, what you want to do, and why you want to do it, would be appreciated by him long term, whether he admits it or not.  He'll likely feel blindsided and unaware that things were trending poorly for some time and that you just 'up and left' without trying to fix or discuss anything.  While you've had time to think about these things and reach the conclusions and decisions you're now getting to, he has likely not done the same.  He may not be aware of it, and may have told himself they were arguments and not something more significant.  Take the assets, the debts, the parents on both sides...all of it out of the talk, and just discuss why you want to leave, and give him a chance to mentally come to terms with it.  Moving out while he's out of town (or in my case, while I was at work) was, in my opinion, a less than ideal way to handle the situation, and created a tone of bitterness and competition to ""get over"" on the other person that could've been avoided if things were handled in a better fashion.  That could easily cascade into a drawn out legal fight and cost money and certainly add stress to your situation.

 Again, this wouldn't apply if there's an actual danger here, and I don't have specifics on the long term trend of the relationship, it's just what I've come away with from my own experiences as a hockey playing dude that was in a funky financial situation after a less than stellar ending to a relationship that just happened to involve a newly purchased home.",1447430872,"he'll likely feel blindsided and unaware that things were trending poorly for some time and that you just 'up and left' without trying to fix or discuss anything.","blindsided and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"blindsided and unaware","blindsided",NA,NA,0

"cwqyi9b","I think you're drawing some strange conclusions, primarily by insinuating that due to the lovecraft stories, that warcraft is based on them.  For starters, the names and depictions of the old gods are borrowed depictions.  C'thun != Cthulhu, Yogg-Saron != Yog-Sothoth, etc etc.  Similarly, our planet is not the father of old gods.  It is strongly hinted that old gods are all over the universe, and our old gods have simply come from elsewhere.  It is not as if Azeroth spawned the Old Gods.

So, that part out of the way - the Pantheon is not able to destroy the old gods.  Resetting Azeroth is no exception to this.  Alganon dialogue is not indicative of titan capabilities.  If they were able to kill Old Gods without consequence (example of consequence; Y'shaarj) - then that would have been done when Titans first settled the planet, instead of simply imprisoning them.

So for the idea to be ""The Pantheon are a threat to all life on Azeroth"" - that is simply incorrect.  That would imply that the Pantheon are ignorant and unaware that simply destroying azeroth would not actually destroy old gods.

Now, we currently assume that the Pantheon is just not aware of all the shit going on with Sargeras or the Old Gods awakening on Azeroth.  If they did, they would be on their way to resolve it.  So ""something"" has to call out to the Titans, and say ""Hey shits going awry over here, can you come help?""

Things that would not send that beacon:

* Sargeras
* Old Gods
* Burning Legion
* Elementals

Things that WOULD ask for help if needed:

* Citzens of Azeroth

"cvss0se","It is imperative and essential that you become educated about this matter now. This is not a joke and your personal safety is on the line. I am telling you that because I got in one of those taxis after giving them the simple request of taking me from terminal A to terminal B. First they took me to a taxi booth where I sat at a desk in front of two filipinas with a filipino sitting behind me on the couch. They told me my plane ticket was canceled and I would have to buy a new one for 8000 pesos, which I promptly and adamantly refused. 

They then said that the next terminal was closed and they would take me to a restaurant. I told them just to bring me back to the terminal I came from (I thought they were insane for saying that a terminal would be closed). I figured I might as well go into the restaurant and try to call a real cab. I walk in and it's a strip club.

This is all while paying fairly high prices. Ended up paying around 1000 pesos all around. 

Eventually I was left outside of the strip club, dying to catch my next flight to Iloilo, the taxi drivers there see me and know exactly whats going on. This is my first time in a tropical country and I am taking in all the new sites and sounds on this street, with all my gear with me, surrounded by poor people, seeing my first cockroach crawling on a garbage can... etc. A taxi driver offers to drive me for 400, I am pretty angry at this point and am very firm with him so he actually takes me there... this is a two minute drive.

This is what you expect if you take the wrong taxi at the airport. I am not sure which one is the right one, the yellow or the white one, do find that out for your own sake. But honestly I would only be staying at a hotel that will send a shuttle to pick you up, or figure out the number for uber or grabtaxi in that city.

My advice for anyone going to any Asian nation is to have a ""drop point"" or ""landing zone""... when I stayed in Hong Kong recently I did the same thing, for my first night I booked at the Ramada... after that I stayed in Chung King mansion (low cost room) for 45 days, but the first day I was there I paid double or triple on a hotel room because I knew it is important to have somewhere safe to crash after you are tired from traveling. You will want a nice shower, nice bed and then you can wake up in the morning and you have leverage to get a good hotel price during the day, as well as safety to walk down most roads.

I don't like Manila in general because of stuff like that, I am sure overall it's not that bad once you get out of the airport.

You not being white does not help. They will rip off fellow Filipinos. If you are of any other race besides Filipino then the pressure is amplified a great deal. Actually there is a good chance that angry white guys are the ones who get the best deals because they know the game at that point. 

So that is my take away to you. Get pissed off, do NOT be passive, be rude and just ignore people who are following alongside of you and talking to you. Act like you are deaf and unaware that they exist. Learn this quickly and be happy to do it! I've spent 67 days in Asia this year, 21 in the Philippines and the other 46 in the busiest part of the Asian side of Hong Kong. 

Again if you are anything less than 100% pure Filipino then you will not fit in, you will be targeted. 

Do not accept that you are going to be ripped off, that's what I did, they will tend consider you passive and ignore what you say and take you on a ride. You have to find the right color of taxi on this subreddit and then be incredibly firm with them, and call them out on their bull, ""why aren't you taking me to the next terminal? the terminal is open and you are lying to me, take me there right now or i am calling the police, i have your taxi number. (and then show them your phone, even if its not working"".

Hate to make it sound bad but this is easily the worse part of the Philippines. It's bad enough to make me not want to go there, thankfully there is the ultimate option (Hong Kong to Iloilo) so that I can completely avoid that hole that is called Manila. I haven't been scammed a single peso in Iloilo and it has been completely good. The second best option is a hotel shuttle, the third best is uber or grab taxi, the forth best is a certain color of taxi, the fifth best and also the absolute worse is the other color taxi.. 

I recommend becoming a scholar on this subject before you go! It will make or break your trip, after this point it could be clear sailing and you could love your time in the Philippines. But if your experiences are bad enough, it will ruin both your arrival and departure as you may often need to switch terminals or rely on haphazard services to get from the hotel to the airport and back vice versa... be smart...",1444329651,"act like you are deaf and unaware that they exist.","deaf and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"deaf and unaware","deaf",NA,NA,0

"cvcfivk","The Matrix is one of, if not *the* best action movie ever made. 

Conceptually, it's amazing. It tells the story of a universe in which Earth, as we know it, is nothing but a simulation engineered to keep humans pacified and unaware that they are being used as energy sources in a world where AI creatures live independently and above us. To label it as a ""lame nerd fantasy"" is a major understatement. It's also not a fantasy at all, since all its ""supernatural"" elements are based on science fiction.

The over-the-top martial arts aren't over the top at all when you think about the opportunities if you have the ability to control the matrix. Those fighting techniques are what they *need* to do to survive in that world, since, as you know, dying in the Matrix is just like dying in the real world. So they use their abilities to the fullest in order to avoid being hurt, something they probably wouldn't be able to do if they limited themselves to ordinary fighting techniques.

The ""chosen one fantasy"" is an element that is present in several other films considered amongst the best. It's also a common characteristic of fantasy and/or sci-fi films, especially when they're set in imaginary worlds (curiously or not). Think Harry Potter, Frodo Baggins and Aragorn, Luke Skywalker, etc. My point is, just because it's a plot point, it shouldn't be seen as a handicap. It's simply part of the story.

Apart from trying to counter what you said, I can also add that the film was vastly ahead of its time, having used incredible visual techniques to create a realistic, yet, impossible world. Bullet time is just one of those techniques.

The cinematography was great, the acting, though not great, was still pretty good, it had an unforgettable villain in Mr. Smith, a compelling soundtrack, amazing sound and visual effects and a story than I simply can't see anyone being able to remake.

*What time is it???*

""It's 6:15 hurry up MJ I can't be late""

Unconsciously, my arms heaved the heavy blanket onto the ground and my feet 
made contact with the ladder leading to carpeted floor from the top bunk.

*Top Bunk? Why the hell did I sleep up here?*

Shrouded by clouds of confusion, the same ones that surrounded you on mornings after drunken nights of mistakes in your youth, I met my silhouette in the unlit bathroom across the hall. 
Like a dream, I was simultaneously aware and unaware that it had gone from Summer to Winter overnight; It was 7 AM and there was no light outside.
Inside the bathroom, the entirety of my hand slapped up the light-switch and as I looked forward into the mirror, a jaded child with boogers in her eyes looked back.

Haze I had not yet awoken from held me in her grip. 
*What the hell is this kid doing here?* 

""HI"" I said, and 
""HI"" echoed back concurrently from the child in front of me.

In confusion I scowled inadvertently, and once again this kid did it with me.
Finally free from Haze and her hands, I moved forward and in epiphany I realized this brat was me.
 
""WHAT THE FUCK?""
I hadn't noticed before but my voice was up an octave.
Photographs of birthdays past pressed forward into the sockets of my eyes.
One in particular, of brunette curls passed my ass, taken on my 8th birthday, a month before I chopped it all off, resonated with the current feel of hair on my lower back.
*I'm eight?""

Instantaneously, I burst into tears.
And just as quickly, I dropped to floor and sobbed silently, a skill I had acquired a few years prior, while hard ""thuds"" told me my father was in the kitchen, most likely making coffee.
An overwhelming anxiety attacked me as my mouth vomited words before I thought to say them.
A desperate combination of,""But i just turned eighteen?! What, where the fuck am I? What about my life? Am I dead, did a die"" escaped from my mind. 
And just as quickly as it came, it left.

*""What about my life?"" You mean the one you wanted so desperately to end you wrote notes in your iPhone and just about every notebook in the house with the hope that one day you'd get the nerve?* 

Hysterically laughter made my prepubescent body shake from the top, down and the tear streaks on my cheeks faded into hues of pink.
Unequivocally an act of God, Dad walked into the bathroom, in the midst of my laughter and begins heaving with me, handing me half a bagel and a mug of cold coffee leaving me with a  ""You're so silly!""  

I dressed into the outfit my mother had set out for me before she went to work and left my hair down, in all its glory.
""You're leaving your hair down?"" inquired my father in genuine shock.
The curls latched onto my head, in a community of straight haired envious children, had been the source of my social ostricization and the harassment I endured well into high school, when, coupled with a family structure whose foundation had crumbled, or perhaps never existed, left me riddled with an unstable mentality. 

The damages to my psyche had defined me as an adult.
No longer insecure and confident, maybe even cocky, at eighteen, and an alcoholic. 
An alcoholic devoted to music and the unique group of misfits I found myself enchanted with, and the belief that Death would *always* be there in my moments of solitude.

*This is my way out.*

I strutted out of the house and into Dad's Dodge Caravan, laying down on the space where the back seats should have been, right next to my little brother, who   was more like my twin, as we spoke our own language.

In class I walked straight passed the group of girls I had once regarded as my ""best friends"" and straight into the teacher, and demanded my seat be moved because people were begging to cheat off me. 
Being the teacher's pet had presented me with various gifts, like extended recess privilege and now, relocating me at my demand.
*Mortified* expressions grew on the faces of my ""best friends"" like weeds growing through concrete floors, and it became obvious they had been planning some sort of attack for the day.
When lunch came, I sat at the lone table of my academic nemesis and offered her the half of the bagel I had secretly saved in the pocket of my jacket that morning, knowing very well her mother prohibited such foods in their household and watched as she swallowed it greedily. 
She responded by offering to push me on the swings and I eagerly accepted.

I maneuvered my way out of every traumatizing social catastrophe till the start of middle school, where the majority of the friends I gained had gone, granted we never knew of each other till high school.

Despite the fact that the society had finally accepted me and joining clubs had made it so I could avoid the world wars of my parents, I was undeniably lonely. 
This state of perpetual loneliness manifested itself in my body, as every part of me ached everywhere I went, at the thought of the friendships I left behind in my past life.

If ""soulmates"" could have a connotation indifferent to romance, we were it, *all of us.*

I located the younger versions of my soulmates around the school with some difficulty, as puberty had dramatically changed their young faces and I took to looking at class rosters. 
The first of the soulmates to be found were Izzy and Dharma.
They had stayed true to themselves throughout the years, Izzy wearing a modest version of her classic attire and Dharma doing the same.
Approaching them, I realized I was not the person I had been in my past life, reserved to colors of dark blue and black, which had gotten me ridiculed, the new me wore bright colors on the opposite spectrum. 
*No matter, the outer and inner me never linked up, I'm still me on the inside*
I continued forward, and inquired as to the whereabouts of our favorite band's upcoming show. 
With a smile in my heart and on my face and one creeping up on both of theirs, they erupted into hysterics.
*What?*
The smile on my face fell into a frown as I stood dumbfounded and more humiliated than I had ever been in both of my lives.
Unable to recover from their laughter, their attempts to retort to me were futile, and I sped out of the area quicker than my legs could carry me, running face first into the wall, to which I heard a synchronized laughter coming from the entire cafeteria. 

In the bathroom I had realized that my lack of confrontation had made me weaker than I had been in my past life, where eventually, after years of repeated wounds, my skin grew thick.
I cried for the first time since that faithful morning where I had thought this blessing to be a curse.
*Holy fuck*

It came to me in that bathroom. 
This was a *curse.* 
This epiphany caused a pain in my chest more powerful than the ache I felt in my bones for those I once knew; a pain for those I would never know. 
I was no longer the person I had been, and despite the many trials and the existential crisis I had faced on a daily basis I had been blessed with a niche.
In this life, I had no niche.
I belonged to no one, while belonging to everyone.
I dropped to the floor and sobbed silently, a skill I had acquired in my past life, while calling out for Death, to give me her hand.
Death, who would always be there for me in my times of solitude, as the nerve set in, and I downed the bottles of Tylenol the nurse had lying around while she wasn't looking.

"cuzmwoc","I said this in my comment above, which is a bit rambly.  If you absolutely MUST get rid of him, find a family yourself to take him in.  I've never looked into this myself so I don't know where you could advertise it, but thoroughy vet the family and make sure he's going to a family who will love him and put in the work that you wouldn't.  Of course, that too would be work, and it seems you're unwilling to follow through with even a tiniest fraction of the obligation you have to this member of your family who loved you unconditionally for its entire life.
There are senior dog rescues that specialize in taking in, caring for, and rehoming senior dogs.  Do a google search for one in your area, though due to the fact that their resources are almost always stretched very thin, don't be surprised if they don't want to spend some of those precious resources caring for your dog for you becase you don't want to. 

But please don't give away your dog.  Your dog loves you; you and your family are its pack and its whole life, and even if you find it a better home than yours it will be confused, stressed, and sad.  My dog was abandoned by his first family, and he still has traces of abandonment issues.  It is unlikely you'll find a loving place to take him in, which is still unnecessarily tough on your dog, so euthanasia by your vet and amongst your family is the better option than euthanasia alone in a crowded and scary shelter.  Your dog will pass away happy and unaware that its owners love it less than he loves them.

  You need to nut up and face the reality of this decision.  If you decide to shirk your responsibility and not care for your pet, there will be real consequences, they will be heart-breaking, and they will be entirely your fault.  If you were hoping the people here would reinforce this dillusion that giving up a senior dog because you're unwilling to put in effort to care for him is somehow a choice without negative repercussions, you were wrong.  Believe it or not, when you don't live up to your responsibilities, the consequences are almost always going to be bad.

Sadly, my guess is that they were not an astute person, so there is a chance that they would take offense and either re-interrupt, or get really indignant. However, that is on THEM.

"ctuvwpy","This happens to me more often then I want to admit to and has been the cause for a **lot** of anxiety. Especially when I was younger and unaware that these behaviours were hurting my relationships. 

The best way I've found to avoid speaking impulsively, especially face to face of over the phone is to try to get some extra time before I have to say something back if I know I'm in a potentially upsetting situation. Any conversation with my boss, I have to be super careful not to say something I'll regret. 

* delaying my response with a series of ""Uhs"", ""Uhms"" and stutters. Not the most ""normal"" way to speak but sometimes all I need are a few seconds to process and come up with a response, instead of saying whatever comes to my head on impulse.
* another good way to buy a few seconds is to ask someone to repeat something, ""Can you repeat that for me?"", or a ""Wait what?"" in less formal situations. You already know what they said, but again, it can buy you those precious seconds to control the impulse

When I do screw up and say something I shouldn't have, I swallow my pride and give a good heart felt apology. (Even if I wasn't actually wrong) Face to face is best for these I find. Acknowledge what you did wrong, validate that person's feelings, state how you felt, reiterate what you did wrong and actually say ""I'm sorry.""
 
*""I shouldn't have said what I did yesterday, it wasn't my intention to upset you. I was frustrated with the situation, not you, and I spoke without thinking. I'm sorry.""*

Even if you're not sorry at all and weren't the one that was wrong, other people like being told that they're right and that you're the one that screwed up. Learning how to mildly manipulate people is a coping mechanism I've learned. It might not be morally correct but it sure as hell works.

"crquqya","Personally, I believe that every single human being is psychic to a certain degree.  I believe that what we call 'intuition' is this ability peaking through the normal mental noise.  Webster's defines intuition as the ability to know or understand something without any proof or evidence.  Could that not be psychic as well?  We call it intuition when a mother just knows that one of her children is in trouble, even though they may be in another state or even country.  People trust their 'gut' feelings when they just know something isn't right or that something feels like it is going to happen.  So my 2 cents is that we are all psychic but we do a good job at explaining it away.

So what would these psychic abilities be?  Where might they come from?  I believe that we are all souls or spirits temporarily melded with a physical body for the duration of an incarnation.  I don't believe we think with our brains.  I believe the brain is nothing but a physical organ that acts as the central hub of the body's central nervous system.  It is one of our key interfaces as spirits/souls, but that is not where our minds are contained.  I believe that the mind is non-physical and a part of our spirit.  This is why when we leave this physical plane we maintain our ability to think, feel, perceive, etc.

If this is the case, I believe that our psychic abilities are actually the subtle senses of our soul, or our non-physical senses coming through.  The soul is not limited by the physical and has access to non-local information in space and time.  The physical senses are very strong and powerful though.  They drown out the subtle senses of the non-physical.  Just for example, think of a gun shot sound going off near you.  What would be more startling and attention grabbing?  This mental perception of a gun shot sound or a real one going off near your physical body and ears?  Our physical senses are stronger by nature because our physical bodies require physical circumstances for our survival.  We have to be able to distinguish between what is in our mind and what is physical.  The drawback is that our species and society has done a good job at convincing ourselves at large that there is nothing more than the physical.  

I believe that we can learn to develop a relationship with our intuition/psychic abilities/soul senses.  First it takes recognition that it is there.  Second it takes learning mental discipline (like meditation).  Meditation is great because it quiets the physical senses and body down to the point that you can actually listen to and hear the subtle senses.  The military's protocol for remote viewing for example required a 'cool down' prior to viewing.  Same thing.  Third and finally, it takes practice, practice, practice.  Psychic skills are incredibly difficult to master.  Even the best of us get things wrong.  

I believe this is for several reasons.  For starters I think we have free will so any prediction of the future can be changed through free will intervention.  If someone tells you that you are going to wear a blue shirt tomorrow, you can say 'screw you' and wear a red shirt.  What would you have done had they not said anything?  Who knows...  That is another problem is that this stuff is soft and is very difficult to validate sometimes.  Lots of factors that can contribute to things changing.  I also believe that it is difficult to distinguish between real psychic information and our creative imagination driven by our own beliefs and expectations coming through.  The best remote viewing track records were ever able to obtain that I am aware of were around 80% accuracy.  You just can't get all of the mental noise out of the way.  When you know to expect some inaccuracies though it can help because you know to take everything with a grain of salt.  

Anyway, I've had it validated to me through my own experiences that I have had some psychic experiences.  I grew up going through the first 30 years of my life completely skeptical and unaware that I had this potential.  It was some amazing experiences that changed this perspective.

"crlctwy","If we take what you said as true then the reason the servers are down can be accounted to the non-payment of monthly server costs. If mdparity is absent then the servers will expire unless sufficient payment was made. As markets typically switch servers now and again because of attacks and LE pressure, we can presume that mdparity likely pays his server costs each month rather than say, 6 months in advance. I make this conclusion also because mdparity has been seen in the last 6 months and the servers only went dark last week.


If the BlackBank servers went dark last Sunday, then the chances are mdparity vanished 1-3 weeks before that, under the presumption that the downtime is because of server non-payment. When was the last time mdpairty was heard from?



If he has died, then BlackBank ends there and the Bitcoins never move from the current wallets. If arrested, then mdparity will have already been questioned by law enforcement since around two weeks have past, and law enforcement will question him within the first ~5 days, sometimes the same day as the arrest. Since the Bitcoin is not reported to have moved from any of the wallets then we can assume that either mdparity has refused to cooperate with law enforcement, has died/injured, or is a free man and is exit scamming/innocent and unaware that his servers are down.



The servers not showing a seizure notice indicate he has not cooperated/been arrested, but it's possible for law enforcement to take the market down without putting up a notice. The Bitcoins have not moved, and law enforcement do not necessarily know that MrDoe does not have copies of the private keys, so had law enforcement seized the servers the Bitcoin would be moved instantly to prevent salvage by MrDoe. I would say we can likely conclude from this evidence that BlackBank has not been seized by law enforcement. The standard procedure for law enforcement is to put up a seizure notice unless doing so would jeopardize an investigation.

Servers can go down unexpectedly for a variety or reasons. mdparity could simply be on a short vacation, leaving his administrative work to MrDoe, and has no knowledge that his servers are down and this situation is unfolding. As of the nature of the darknet and anonymity, MrDoe has no way of contacting mdparity to inform him of the situation.

&gt;Hei Bai had been the protector of a forest just outside [Senlin Village](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Senlin_Village) for thousands of years; however, after the destruction of the forest, he became enraged and unaware that it was due to the actions of the [Fire Nation](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Nation), he targeted the nearby Senlin Village and blamed the occupants. As the [winter solstice](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Winter_solstice) drew near, Hei Bai transformed into his monstrous form and terrorized the village by abducting one villager each day.  When [Aang](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Aang) came to the village, he attempted to reason with the enraged spirit, but was unsuccessful. Hei Bai became violent toward Aang, prompting [Sokka](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Sokka) to help Aang by attacking Hei Bai with his boomerang. However, Hei Bai quickly overpowered and kidnapped Sokka and took him to the Spirit World. Later, in an attempt to calm the angered spirit, Aang showed Hei Bai the acorns that covered the floor of the burnt forest, reassuring the spirit that the forest would grow back. Hei Bai's anger faded and he returned to his normal form. He took the acorn in his mouth and left through the village's gate. From that gate sprouted bamboo stalks from which the missing villagers stumbled out.

"cq6fj7v","There is only one problem player in our group. He is a rather loud guy. He also loves wine, and after a glass or two he gets even louder. Unless he is DMing, he can't focus on one thing. Because of this he was DMing, but then 'ran out' of time to prepare. Sometimes he walks away from the table during combat, other times he just starts side conversations with other players.

He also is very easily offended. For some context, we are (almost) all post-grad fraternity brothers.

"cq68yl8","I'm from Brazil, and  I agree with your statement, but it is somewhat vague. 

Even though elections are compulsory, you can simply vote 'blank' -  meaning that you are not forced to vote for a candidate, but simply to vote, that is the law.

Elections are held on Sundays to avoid the creation of a random holiday (which is really effective), and take place in schools or universities closest to the voter. 

The voting system is automated, making it one of the few in the world, and works really well; it is efficient and simple to use.

This sort of invalidates the 'being forced to vote' part, however, it is a problem because people are misinformed, meaning that they won't vote for the celebrity, but to the one that said one thing they approved of.

On the other hand, I have a perfect example for the 'celebrity' thing you said. A man named Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, actor, clown (yes, google him if you don't believe me) and singer/songwriter ran for National Congress to represent the State of Sao Paulo 'just for the shits and giggles' one could say, and he is also known by his stage name Tiririca (you don't need to speak Portuguese to understand how stupid this sounds). He ran in 2010, and not only did he win, but he was the second-most-voted congressman in Brazil's history. There's also this channel that did some interviews on the day of the election and asked why some people would vote for him, their reason was that he would make congress ""more lively"" due to his ""experience as a clown"". 
However the worst part: he is illiterate... He was prosecuted and said he had a disorder dysgraphia which did not allow him to hold a pen properly, meaning he could not take writing exams, forcing the prosecutors to drop the case due to lack of supporting evidence. Oh, and it gets worse: he was seen a few weeks later signing autographs (scribbles in this case) with his technically impaired hand, and just in case you wanted to know his logos: ""O que é que faz um deputado federal? Na realidade, eu não sei. Mas vote em mim que eu te conto"" (""What does a federal congressman do? I really don't know – but vote for me and I'll let you know""), ""Pior que está não fica, vote no Tiririca"" (""It can't get any worse, vote Tiririca"") and even ""Se eleito prometo ajudar todas as famílias brasileiras...especialmente a minha"" (""If elected I promise I will help all Brazilian families... especially mine"").

The voting system works, but the politics in Brazil are honestly so fucked up, and the biggest flaw in all of this is that some (mainly the working class) are so ignorant and unaware that they end up completely destroying the purpose of elections.

"cpwvc5e","TL;DR of why it won't work: You have to squat in front of your opponent with your knees off the ground and your feet square while you wait for them to react. As the offensive wrestler, you're the one forcing the defensive opponent to react, but in MMA that reaction will be a knee eventually and you'll get kneed in the face like the finish of Aldo/Mendes 1. 

LONG VERSION HERE: Basically this takedown is not just one takedown, it's an offensive chain of moves that ends in a takedown. Ruth has refined his movements and angles to a point that as soon as he shoots he's set a trap and you have to get all the way out of it from the beginning, or you WILL fall into it. The takedown that Ruth hits in this video is the FOURTH option in the series of offensive moves from what I can tell. 

This takedown requires the aggressor (Ruth) to be non-committal in the forward motion of his shot, but extremely committed to the level change. Basically the exact opposite of what you want in MMA. What Ruth does in this video is change levels and then lazily make an effort at one leg or the other. The entire idea of this series, and honestly wrestling in general, is to force your opponent into committing to a weight shift when you don't have to, and then take advantage of it. Also, it forces the defensive wrestler to think, which is something you DO NOT want to be doing while wrestling shot defense. In defensive standup wrestling, you train for everything to be action-reaction. What Ruth does is take advantage of your wrestling instincts by changing the terms of the action-reaction scenario. It forces the defensive wrestler not to just react on instinct like he has for the last 15 years, but to think, and make a few decision along the way. Those include: 

- To sprawl or not to sprawl?

If defense sprawls, Ruth has shot lazily enough and from far enough away that he can get out from under the sprawl without much effort, spin around, and finish the takedown. If defense does not sprawl, he comes to another decision.

- Which leg is this dude attacking?

If the defensive wrestler just kicks his leg back like he did in the video, it puts all of the weight on the foot that he didn't kick back. Ruth has a TD finishing style where he just spins rather than chases, and he's naturally a long limbed person. So Ruth's best case scenario is for the defensive wrestler to essentially just post his leg out there and let Ruth spin around it. His other option is to give Ruth the leg he originally shot at, and put all of the weight on the back foot. This leads you into the typical high inside single leg finish options. That probably would not have worked for the defensive wrestler though because Ruth had already made the decision to run this series as soon as he changed levels, and the defensive wrestler was being lazy and unaware that Ruth was not committing to his original shot. If he would have been on top of his game he would have realized that Ruth was too far away for a good shot to begin with. This leads to a final question: 

- Do I move forward or backward?

After Ruth got a hand on the defensive wrestler, he still had the ability to defend but he only had two basic options, barring any crazy shit. He could have gone forward and try to spin clockwise around Ruth, or backward and spin counterclockwise, since at this point it was obvious that Ruth was going for a low finish rather than a high finish so he shouldn't be worried about his balance. The thing is, Ruth has practiced this finish so many times, he already knew that the guy only had two options. He planned it that way. 

Ruth feels the defensive wrestler try to go forward first, this is where you see Ruth try to grab the far leg so that his opponent would just fall on his knees for the easy finish. Ruth missed the leg though, and as soon as he missed he knew that his opponent's base was super spread out, and all of his weight was set to counter-balance Ruth's forward finish, so he takes him backward. Common sense right? As soon as the defensive opponent realizes he's moving backwards, he posts a hand and tries to rely on Ruth's body being there to not put him on his back. Ruth realizes what's happening and spins out from under the defensive wrestler.

So to recap:

- Ruth set this up by faking a shitty shot

- Defense didn't realize that the shitty shot was a fake, and reacted with shitty defense

- Ruth realizes this and immediately gets to work taking the guy's balance away

- Ruth is very good at using his body. Most tall guys let their limbs get stretched out before they're useful. Ruth stayed tight until he knew he was in deep on the leg, and then reach his big ass arm all the way around the defensive wrestler's waist. When someone has your groin stretched all the way out and then reaches around your back to grab your far hip bone, they have more strength in their arm than you do in your entire body.

If your smarter than him, remind him in a way that makes him look dumb (rather than saying just saying you're smarter.)  Lower track math and english classes are perfect because you can just insinuate that he's illiterate or ask him if they're teaching him to count to 100 in math.  Make him feel like an idiot.

If he's intelligent go for literally anything you can get your hands on. Hot mother or sister works just fine, if he has a hot sister ask him how he represses the urge to bang her.  Stay away from making fun of his gf if he has one though.  No siblings? Go straight for the appearance. Hair, clothes, anything you can find stupid about him.  It has to be good though, something that will make him definitely look like an idiot rather than you looking desperate to get back at him.

These are all tactics I used to defend my friends in high school since a lot of them were picked on.  I, however, was relentlessly made fun of by older brothers and was pretty much immune to insults.  I am pretty smart so I usually got the best of people, turned things around on them and got them mad way before the even got close to getting to me because that was pretty hard to do. Here's what I would do not knowing this dude if I were you. Lets say this douche's name is Dave. You say, in a calm but mocking way in a voice trying to imitate Dave.

""My name is Dave, this kid's voice is pretty funny. Ha ha ha, I'll remind you guys all again tomorrow because I obsess over weird shit haha.""

If he gets mad, stay calm and just continue to mock what ever he says. ""My name is Dave, man am I mad right now. Look how mad I am.""

This may all sound crazy but people knew better than to make fun of me.  In fact, most people liked it because I put people in their place.  A few people are just too dumb and unaware that you can't really beat them but this shit works pretty well. Turn the tables man.

"ck4um8j","I went NC with my parents individually. 

My father didn't give a single fuck. He likely thinks he cut me off and not the other way around. 

My mother went the opposite direction. She called with increasing frequency. She called every personal number she had for myself and my wife. We blocked every number my FOO might use to call us. She contacted my wife's place of employment. The first time, my wife was not there. After the second time, her company blocked the number. She emailed both of us. At first, I tried filtering them into a hidden folder so I wouldn't have to see them. The temptation to look was too great, however. I looked anyway and was disgusted by the flagrant gaslighting and attempted emotional manipulation. Her emails are all now deleted as soon as they are received. I have no idea whether she emails anymore or not.

Eventually, my violent brother tried to intimidate me into breaking NC. My brother is a chronically unemployed hothead who had no problem driving across the country to show up at my front door unannounced. Now, he knew where my family and I lived, but he had already been explicitly told he was not welcome on my property after physically assaulting my preschool-aged daughter. He claimed he came to my house to ""check on me"" because he had heard I was in the hospital and I wasn't recovering well. I *had* been in the hospital, but over six months prior, and I was recovering just fine. He thought he had an excuse to violate my boundaries.

I stepped outside to speak with him, closing the door behind me because I was home alone with my two young children. He started rambling about how I ""probably didn't want to see him and he knew [I] said he wasn't allowed on my property"" but he ""needed to make sure I was alright"" because of what he heard.

I said, ""I have nothing to say to you.""

He asked if I wanted his phone number.

I said, ""no.""

He asked if I never intended to speak to him or our parents ever again. I could see the anger building in his eyes.

He started talking again and, to be honest, I don't remember what he said. I just remember seeing him get angrier the more he talked and being afraid that if he assaulted me and overpowered me, my children were inside my house defenseless and alone.

I said, ""Leave my property immediately.""

He stopped talking. He glared. Then he turned, walked back toward the driveway, got in his car, and drove away. I made sure he actually left, then went back into the house, locked the front doors, and double checked that all the windows were barred.

That is the last time I saw my brother or any member of my FOO. I was so terrified, my wife and I packed up and moved house within a week. We had a month remaining on the lease, but we just paid it and told the landlord we were vacating the property. We told him not to give out our contact information to anyone claiming to be related to us. Now, no one who might possibly give our contact information to my FOO has any idea where we live. We have a post office box. That is the only address we use on any paperwork.

That experience was terrifying, but I am proud of myself for how I handled it. I did not react emotionally. I kept my voice level. I did not allow him to get to me or trick me into divulging anything. I can look back on it and know I kept my children safe and unaware that anything bad was happening. I conducted myself with dignity and self-respect.

"cjnudyw","Yes, a deadhead named Kurt died smoking Persian.  He collapsed forward, stopped breathing, and his companions walked away, afraid and unaware that just a few minutes of artificial respiration is often all it takes to save someone from opiate overdose.  A while after, some kids found him, came up to our booth looking very shaken, they couldn't believe what they saw.  Being relative grown-ups, some friends and I went over, saw, confirmed, called the authorities.  I knew his face, had for years, but didn't really know him, though a lot of folks on tour did.  He was cool to touch, had been there a while, and a deep shade of asphyxiated purple--I prefer to recall him from a younger time, six or so years before, when he was fresh to tour.  He wore a black leather jacket back then, over his tie-dye, in an era when you never saw those two fashion styles together--it was a striking blend of hippie and street-tough, kind of a harbinger of where a certain element of tour heads were headed.  I guess he was ahead of his time. 

Yeah, that memory shaded the weekend a bit, fit in the worst way with the aforementioned bacchanalian swamp that the campground became after hosting what came to be called Shakedown Street for five days straight.

Well, since Constantly spews out new laws every day and enacts new bureaucracies and departments on a regular basis, that create new rules on their own, you would be wrong.


 
&gt;     I'd prefer govt size and spending at 1920's level.
 
&gt; Yea man, the roaring 20's. Nothing bad came out of that, am I right?

Yes. We had a govt intervene and make a normal downturn last for a decade. Whereas most of the rest of the world just had a hiccup. See, it was only called the Great Depression in the US, and nowhere else in the world,  because other govt's didn't interfere like ours did.


&gt;Not by companies, but by govt debt and monetary policy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this doesn't make sense. The government policies exist because we created them to counter the problems that private companies created. Nearly every regulation we have ever had can draw a connection to some type of crisis caused by the private sector that forced its need. Can you give me some examples of regulations that are fundamentally problematic?

Obamacare.

More power to do what?

So now you are ADMITTING regulations are corruptible and can be bad!!!

Are you bipolar and unaware that you are arguing against yourself!


&gt;You seem to want as ""small a government footprint as possible"", but how do you accomplish that without opening the door to a system that begins to get usurped by these private companies?

I just want less fed control. States should have more say.

&gt;The problem is that private companies retain too much power to the point where they can break down the system.

Where did a company bankrupt a nation more than the govt's that destroyed themselves?

You again failed to make a comparison of what happens in the real world. You only cited one sided talking points.

"chkzrc4","Mormonism is a very broad topic. It is further complicated because most mormons pick and choose among their broad canon of doctrine; the doctrine itself has been a moving target for over 180 years. Any given person may choose to be a literalist/fundamentalist or less literal and more liberal in choosing metaphor over strict dogma. The mainstream branch now uses standardized teaching materials in an attempt to keep everyone on the same page.

For a long time, the actual history of the Latter Day Saint movement has been hidden from most members. (If not hidden, perhaps, de-emphasized and whitewashed are better terms.) The information age changes everything. The truth about its origins and its founder are coming into focus. When that happens, member face the decision of whether what they have been taught matches the facts. One factor that keeps many attending is the social aspects. Whether it is true, or not, it is still a building that is open on Sundays where people can gather and sing hymns, pray, etc. Many *chapel mormons* remain ignorant and unaware that it may not be what it claims to be: *the one true church* on earth.

Of course I was making both arguments. I have been all along. That's what is so frustrating about this. You seem completely oblivious to everything I say and then seem genuinely confused and unaware that I'm making points that I've made long ago and defended over multiple posts.

This is, honestly, the strangest discussion I've ever had with someone. You continually analyze the quantity of arguments that I'm making and reference this as if it is a rebuttal. I make one argument and then, rather than address it you explain that I have made an argument and that you don't have to address it. When I make an additional argument, you point out that I've made two arguments and decide that I'm just being inconsistent rather than acknowledge that two separate points have been made. When I try to discuss one of the two (or more) points that I've brought up you just count up the number of points I'm specifically addressing in that post, say it aloud and then decide that you are unhappy with that. It's like arguing with Count von Count from the Sesame street. Every response I give to you, you reply with the equivalent of ""One! You've made one, argument! ah ah ahhhhh..."".

&gt; You have no basis for making this claim. In common law societies like ours, you can walk into a place if you want. You're only guilty of trespassing if you ignore a posted sign denying you entry, or refuse a legitimate order to leave. That's how the law works, and all your rationalizations won't change that fact.

This is not what a common law society means. Regardless, I know what you're trying to say and you're wrong. The ability to ""walk into a place if you want"" only applies to public areas. This right is not extended to private property or private institutions. This is precisely why I am not entitled to walk into your home without your permission. Your place of work is a private institution and you don't have this right to access that you, for some reason, think is true of a common law society.

&gt; You can believe it's wrong all you want. That's subjective, and i don't really care what you believe in that regard. My issue is with you saying it's illegal, which is an objective, and false, statement. And you have repeatedly failed to show me a law that is violated by doing it.

Me saying it is wrong for you to violate a contract is not subjective. At least it isn't subjective to me, specifically. Everything about society is fundamentally subjective but the idea that contracts must be held between parties is something that is agreed upon the general consensus of our society. That is as objective as anything ever gets in a society. It's certainly as objective as, ""murder is wrong"" or other forgone conclusions.

&gt; I don't HAVE to justify it to you. I don't owe you anything. I only have to justify it to myself. Whether you think it's wrong or not is completely irrelevant. You can make whatever subjective moral judgments you want. I'm not subject to your moral discretion.

BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE! It's fine if you decide you don't want to justify things to me. That's your prerogative. But that isn't what I was criticizing. You claimed that you had already successfully justified something to me. Now you are claiming that you don't have to. Those are separate issues. I'm fine with the later but you did not fulfill the former and your claim that you had is what I was addressing.

"cgjsjk6","**TL;DR** I have no idea how you contact your father, but I will tell you the story of my father's death, and I hope it gives you some kind of comfort. It will be long. I'm sorry.  But I'm crying right now as if I lost him yesterday, and it's been nearly ten years. I feel the pain you're experiencing and I want to reach out to you.

My father died in 2005. It was very sudden.  He was on the 5th day of a cross-country cycling trip.  He dropped dead on the side of the road from an aortic dissection.  He was 59.  He was always very healthy and athletic.  Ran marathons when he was younger, and when his knees went bad, he started cycling.  His knees were getting worse, so he was considering taking up golf after this one last trip.

And it was the last trip. He died on the side of a beautiful mountain pass outside of Sweet Home, Oregon. There is a cross on the side of the road for his memory. 

But back to your topic.

I was 24 when he died.  I had just moved to Hawaii from California to be with my fiance (who had moved there 7 months prior). I'd been there four months. We were starting a life together, and we were so happy. I talked to my father on the phone the day before he died. I was excitedly talking about plans for my wedding, and I remember that he had kind of sanguinely said, ""Just be happy together.  Don't worry about all those little details.  Just get married and be happy."" 

Then, when I was driving to work the next morning at 10 am (I had been up since 8), I dozed off and coasted to the side of the road where the rocks under my tires woke me up and made me correct my path. I lived a ten minute drive from my work, and it was 10 am.  There was no reason to fall asleep.

I worked my shift, but had forgotten my phone at home.  The restaurant was busy, but I was off by 2 pm, and zoomed home.  I got online and saw my uncle who lived in Wisconsin was also online.  I messaged him that I was so excited that I had just deposited money into some six month CDs for the wedding.

He only replied, ""You need to call your mom.""

So I did.  

And she answers, saying, ""Baby, Daddy had a heart attack."" 

""Oh my god.  Is he okay?""

""Oh, baby girl... he's gone.""  

Weeping.

I was silent for I don't know how long.  Sitting on my couch, looking out my patio door at My Hawaii, where I'd been living in a fucking honeymoon for four months with the man I was going to marry. The plumeria was sweet on the air, the clouds had come over and we were going to get our usual afternoon rain.  It hit me and I remember crying, but not knowing why I was crying.  Like my mind and my body were suddenly detached from each other. 

Skipping to the aftermath is hard, but I will.  (Summary: I flew home, planned his memorial, dealt with the details because my mother and siblings were apparently less able than I was to deal with these things.) 

While in California, I went for one night to my parents' mountain cabin, where they had brought the boxes and boxes of family pictures.  Their plan was to sort them all out and put them in albums. I needed the pictures because a family friend was creating a photo montage for my father's memorial. 

That night, while sleeping in the cabin, which had been my parents' beloved empty next project, where they spent their retirement being romantic and doing all the stuff they couldn't do when kids were around, I had a dream.

In the dream, I woke in the bed in cabin.  I awoke because I heard knocking on the door. I went down the hall and opened the door, and it was daytime outside. There was a woman standing in front of me, and I could see my father out behind her at the edge of the yard, near the street.  He had his hands stuffed into his pockets and he was sort of shuffling and kicking at the dirt, like a little boy who is in trouble for something.  He wouldn't look at me. 

The woman was really beautiful, in a strong-boned, natural kind of way.  Like Isabella Rosselini.  Short brown hair, no makeup, strong eyebrows, square jaw, full lips.  She was slim and her accent was vaguely European. 

She turned to me and matter-of-factly told me, ""I'm very sorry that I have to be the one to tell you these things.  Your mother and father have had a 'life-divorce'. Your father will be with me now, and I will take care of him. He loves you very much, and he loves your mother and your brothers very much.  He wants to say goodbye, but he doesn't know how.  Please be happy.""

That was the first of many dreams.

For a solid six months from then on, I had nearly nightly dreams where my father would appear out of nowhere. I always felt like I was running late when he finally appeared.  Like I had been foolishly navigating my way through some ridiculous dream, unconscious, and unaware that I was *supposed to be somewhere*.  Like we had arranged to meet in some familiar place in my dream world, like my childhood home, or my car, or at my workplace, but I'd been idiotically trapped in unconsciousness for so long that when I finally arrived at our meeting place, there was always very little time left for us to catch up.

And that's usually what we did.  He always looked young, dressed like he did during the 70's, before I was born, and always really healthy and happy. We'd just catch up.  Talk about what was bothering me, or what I needed advice about. He listened better than he ever had when he was alive.

Meanwhile, I felt presences during the day, when I was awake. It always felt like there was someone immediately to my left.  I could hear an echo on my left side whenever I spoke.  Imagine you're standing next to a wall.  When you talk, you hear a slight echo or resonance in whichever ear is facing the wall.  That's what it felt like.  It was always there.

In an effort to conquer my grief and move on, I took some meditation classes at this crazy hippie joint called the Clairvoyant Center.  One of the perks offered in purchasing the meditation classes was a so-called ""aura reading.""  During this thing, they sit you down in front of five ""clairvoyant students"" who are total strangers to you, and they tell you stuff.  You don't tell them anything. I took most of it with a grain of salt until one of them stopped the ""readers"" for a moment and told me that she was having trouble reading me because my father was with me and he thought what I was doing was really, really disturbing.  She proceeded to describe him in perfect detail.  ""He looks really rugged. He's wearing a plaid flannel shirt.  He has a beard and blue eyes and is very handsome. He's standing on your left, very close to you.  He feels like he needs to protect you right now from what we're doing, and it's really getting in the way of our reading.""

I'm not a terribly credulous person, and was doing this mostly for amusement. But this was too much.  It was just too weird.

She said, ""Okay, I'm going to ask him to go outside into the front yard if that's okay with you?  I'm going to love him and tell him that we love you and only want to help you with what we're doing here.""

And for a little while, that sensation of being next to a wall was gone. Just a little while.

The last dream I ever had where I felt my father visited me was about six months after his death. I had just talked to my mother that day, and she was going through another bout of grief, talking about how she just wanted her cancer to kill her so she could be with him again. (Yeah, she had cancer too.) I felt angry in my dream and asked my father why he never visited my mother in her dreams like he did with me. She was so desperate for some sign that he was still there, that he hadn't just abandoned her.

He leaned on the counter (this dream was taking place in a fogged-up bathroom where, for some reason, hot water had been running), and looked really, really sad.  He didn't talk for a moment. Then he said, ""I want to.""

""Then why haven't you???"" I demanded.

""If your mom knew that she could be with me in the dream world, she'd never wake up.""

So that was that.  That was the last dream. I have waited and waited for more, but since then, the dreams I've had about my father were *about* my father, not *with* him, if you get what I'm saying.  He's not interacting with me in a way that suggests he's actually there.  In other words, in all my dreams since then, my father has just been part of the dream, part of my psyche, part of my imagination.

I don't know what happened. I don't know if I was just dreaming him to cope with my grief, or if he was actually there. But I know that it gave me a tremendous amount of comfort.  And if, in fact, my father was actually visiting my dreams (which I entertain probably, logically, wasn't the case), he made it clear that it was because he felt safe doing so.  He made sure to tell me that it was because he trusted that I was the one who could handle it. My mother couldn't.  My siblings couldn't.  They would have broken if it had happened to them.  

The freaky ""clairvoyants"" made sure to tell me that the moment my father died, he panicked. He wasn't ready, and he had this giant load of psychic energy to dump that he hadn't dealt with. They said that in the moment, he had picked me as the most competent person to deal with it, because the others would have been unable to handle it. 

Nearly ten years later, I miss my dad almost every day. I felt it all again just writing this.  I don't know what happened, but I know that it was very real to me at the time.  I often wish he'd give me some sign now that he's still around, but he doesn't. Maybe it was all in my head.  Grief is powerful and mind-altering. But it felt very, very real to me.

Maybe your father hasn't come around because he's afraid of what it would do to you.  I know that my experience really dominated my life for awhile. It was disturbing.  Perhaps your father just doesn't want to do that to you.

"cfw9j5y","An improbably polished looking woman sits on a rocking chair on a sunny porch.  She is elderly, her gray hair is perfectly quaffed, and her wrinkled face is smoothed over with impeccable makeup.  She smiles wistfully into the distance, nursing a glass of lemonade.



*We all have a memory we love … You know the one.  That place inside where you can retreat to when the world seems bleak… That bright moment in the past that you carry with you, everywhere you go.*



Music swells.  Close up on the woman’s face.  She is smiling, her eyes sparkling, wrinkling at the corners.  The sun dances warmly on her skin.



*Now you can experience that moment again, in real time.  Memortek™ enhances your nostalgic recollections, making the details as vivid as the day they happened.*



The woman looks straight into the camera, laughing, flawlessly white teeth exposed in an exaggerated smile.  Her face fades into the image of a beautiful young lady dancing under the stars with a handsome young man. 



*Developed with cutting edge neuroscience, Memortek™ stimulates your brain’s sensory receptors whenever you use the parts of your brain dedicated to long term memory recall.*

----

“How are you Mister…Aster,” a balding doctor with glasses propped up by a large, greasy nose is thumbing through a chart.  An elderly man is perching on the chair across from him. 



“I saw a commercial…”  The elderly man starts to speak but hesitates. 



“Yes…?”



“For something called Memortek.” 



The doctor looks up. “And you want a prescription?”



“Yes.  Please.” 



“Why wouldn’t you take this to your primary physician?” The doctor lifts his glasses, rubbing his eyes with one hand.  “The free clinic seems like a hell of a lot of trouble for something like this. You must have been waiting for hours.”



Mister Aster brushes off the doctor’s questions. “I really think I could…benefit…from Memortek.” He slowly but steadily picks his words. “My memory isn’t what is used to be…but the memories I do have...I want to save them.”



“Well, you understand the drug won’t save your memories? It will just enhance the ones you have.  And you can’t exactly choose *which* memory is enhanced.  The memories that will interact with the drug will be the strongest, not necessarily the best.”



“Right.  Yes.  That sounds fine.”  Mister Aster is running his hands nervously along the sweat-stained band of an old hat. 



The doctor casts a critical eye over the overweight, grey haired man before him.  “You see, at this stage in your life…” 



Mister Aster’s eyes are pleading, desperate.  The lines in his face are downturned in an expression permanent sadness.



The doctor pauses, his mouth open, forming around a word.  He winces slightly at the dejected picture Mister Aster presents. 



The door of the examination room opens a crack. 



“Doctor Graham?  Your wife is on line two. It sounds urgent.”



The doctor straightens.  “Right.  Ah…Memortek was it?”  He begins scribbling on a pad, tearing off a sheet and handing it hurriedly to Mister Aster.  “Great, wonderful.  Just take this to your regular pharmacy.” 



The doctor exits the room quickly, and Mister Aster delicately folds the paper in his hands, placing it reverently in his shirt pocket.

 
----


Mister Aster is sitting in his favorite armchair.  It is well worn, purple velour, perfectly formed to his shape.  He takes a small blue pill from a full bottle, and places it squarely on his tongue.  He takes a large swallow from a cheap beer can.



He closes his eyes and rests his wrinkled hands on the armrests of his chair, waiting resolutely.



Breathing in.  Breathing out.



*Deep breath in.  Deep breath out.*



He is driving.  The windows are down, the wind raking through his wavy brown hair.  Gretchen is in the seat beside him.  Her dark hair is pulled into a loose bun, and she is wearing a brown dress with a pattern of tiny pink flowers.



And she is pregnant.  Radiantly, gorgeously pregnant.  She has one hand resting on her swollen belly, pushing out against the fabric of her dress; her other hand is gently clutching his arm.  His beautiful wife, gently caressing the curve of their unborn child.



“Slow down, Mel,” she coos softly. 



She had a soft, silken voice.  He missed that about her.  But she was here now.  He stirs in the purple chair. 



*Deep breath.  In.  Out.* 



“Don’t worry,” he is laughing. “I’m being careful.”



She sighs. “Right, but.  I think just to be safe… You did have that extra beer…”



“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Gretchen!”  Anger flashes through him.  “Get off my case, I can handle my liquor—just *trust* me!” 



Her hand retreats from his arm.  Her voice snaps, with a sudden edge to it, “Mel—“



He reaches across the seat, placing a hand over her mouth, cutting her off.  “Just stop!  We’re almost home, anyway.”



She wriggles beneath his hand, and he tightens his fingers around her jaw. 



“Shhh.  Goddamn it, just shhhh.”



He looks over at her.  Her blue eyes are burning with indignation.  He stares at her, at once aware and unaware that this would be the last time he would see her alive. 



A subdued sob racks his chest, tears dampen his wrinkled cheeks.  



*Breathe. Stay with her.*



He sees her eyes go from angry to afraid.  The car lurches around them, and they both catapult forward, propelled together through space.  His hand loosens, releasing her face, suspended in the air in front of her. 



She is crossing her arms protectively around her abdomen.  He stiffens his arm to brace her. 

Blinding pain.  The crunching sound of metal chewing them to pieces.  Her sweet voice: shredded, screaming, before suddenly falling silent.  Panic swallowed by reeling motion.  Chaos. 

He grips the edges of his chair. 



“Gretchen, I’m so sorry,” he whispers to an empty room.  His voice breaks.  “I’m so sorry.” 



As soon as he had seen the commercial for Memortek, he had known.  This would be his punishment. The memory he had relived every day since it had happened would be resurrected.  In real time. 



*We guarantee you won’t be able to tell the difference.*



He opens the bottle and takes out another blue pill, swallowing it just like before.  This was his penance. 



*… details as vivid as the day they happened…*



But things would be better this time around.

"cfv54o1","Two things:

&gt; The action, which Mr. Udall did not describe, took place after C.I.A. officials came to suspect that congressional staff members had gained unauthorized access to agency documents during the course of the Intelligence Committee’s years-long investigation into the detention and interrogation program. 

and also:

&gt; The Senate’s investigation into the C.I.A. program took four years to complete and cost more than $40 million, in part because the C.I.A. insisted that committee staff members be allowed to review classified cables only at a secure facility in Northern Virginia. And only after a group of outside contractors had reviewed the documents first.

Who is in charge here? One sees the real structure of the deep state at work, with the supposed elected leaders serving as a screen to justify the actions of the real power. Why else could Congress possibly gain unauthorized access to the work of the intelligence community?

This is the very classic case of the power shifting within the society. The USA is no longer run by the elected representatives, and the real powerholders are so used to the populace remaining calm and unaware that they're getting obvious and sloppy.

The reason I feel this way was because this certain homosexual friend of mine was straight in the past and was having a very great relationship with a girl whom he really loves. They looked like the perfect couple and were inseparable. But at one point of time they had a huge fight and broke up. He was a very emotional person, so you could see how the breakup affected his life, falling into depression and contemplating suicide. But something happened along the way, and while he was recovering from depression, he started to discover homosexuality and slowly, became more vocal and acceptable to the idea to the point where he decides to be openly gay and have a gay relationship. He reconciled with his ex-gf and they have decided to become friends. 

Now from this anecdote, do you think he became gay because his biological system decided that or was it the emotional scar that was left after the breakup, leading him to discover alternative relationships to avoid being hurt again? I guess we wouldn't know, or more importantly, I wouldn't know because I never asked him. 



What I am trying to say is I think we shouldn't make finite decisions or favor a certain outcome influenced by our own views and opinions when we still don't know the whole story, but instead from a neutral standpoint. Being in the neutral standpoint doesn't mean we should stop being civil and deny LGBTs the rights as a person, citizen or  more importantly a living breathing human being!

"cf63c68","""Organic"" doesn't actually mean much. Right when the movement began, government stepped in and took over and created labeling requirements that basically gutted the movement, all because Corporate America was scared of a grass roots movement promoting healthy non-industrial food production. I almost died several years ago, in large part due to malnutrition and have been extremely diligent in educating myself since then. 

Properly homegrown produce and meat will have exceptionally higher levels of nutrients than commercial ""organic"" or standard produce purchased in the store. It all starts with the soil and then the supporting biosystems; the chickens support the vegetable garden, cows, goats and sheep. The cows return more nutrients to the soil than they took, resulting in ever increasing fertility, plus providing an excellent food source for the pigs and chickens. All of the livestock, not to mention the microbes that count on them for a healthy environment, are necessary to produce healthy and nutritious life. But this is not what happens in America; Corporate American ""agriculture"" (CAA) is based on a mono-culture system, in vast disharmony with the way nature works. In fact CAA is so terrified of sustainable permaculture that it has worked tirelessly with congress and the USDA to effectively ban it's widespread adoption.

You are exactly right about vegetables making you sick. Most store bought vegetables (including ""organic"") were grown using chemical (heavy metal) fertilizers. The chemical build-up becomes so toxic that ""farmers"" have to plant root crops (potatoes, beets, carrots, etc) in between the cash crops in order to leach the heavy metals from the ground. Guess who gets to eat those toxic metals? I don't use pesticides. They are unnecessary if you practice good permaculture methods. Just think for a minute. In nature do insect pests eat all of the plant life? Why not? If we mimic nature we will have better results, rather than trying to play God.

The government works hard to protect the megacorp CAA industry, through the spreading of fear or through regulating competing methods out of existence. The mormon church is not the only organization to use fear as a tool to get its way. 

Look up raw milk on the FDA website and they will tell you that it is a toxic substance sure to kill you if you drink it. Yet millions of Americans drank it without ill effect, rather to the increase of their health, prior to the existence of the FDA. Look closely at the laundry list of all the reasons the FDA gives that raw milk is pathogenic and toxic. It all boils down to shit! Evey one of their points is caused by fecal contamination. If you eat anything smeared with crap you'll have the same problems. I don't know about you, but I don't eat shit. The FDA's statement on raw milk though is a tacit admission that crap is in the milk you buy in the store. If you don't know where your food is coming from or how it is grown, you are eating crap, toxic metals and chemicals, harmful hormones and anti-biotics, and God knows what else.

Sorry if I sound over the top on all this stuff. It is something that I am very passionate about. Belief in the church was the last thing to fall for me, before that I had my eyes opened to all the corruption and deceit in all the other facets of my life. You can always count on corrupt people at the top of any corporation or industry to make decisions based on increasing their own wealth and power, even if those decisions have bad (or even fatal) consequences for the end user.

"cegzjjg","Overly dramatic much?  The vast majority of people who contract herpes have very mild or no symptoms after the first outbreak. About half of people diagnosed only have symptoms once or twice.  For those who have recurring symptoms, the symptoms are generally mild and decrease in frequency and severity as time goes on.  Honestly, the common cold is generally worse and more debilitating.  

The chances of passing it in childbirth are highly unlikely, so calm yourself.  The risk is fairly low to begin with. If you tell your doctor that you have herpes, they will put you on antivirals during the pregnancy to be safe.  If you have a herpes outbreak during delivery, they will give you a C-section.

There is no guarantee that herpes will be protected against with a condom, but it can be in most cases, especially if you do not have sex during an outbreak.  Men are significantly less at risk at contracting the disease than women in heterosexual relationships.

Your wild conclusion that ""Being with someone with herpes is willingly infecting yourself"" is completely unfounded.  That is always risk, but there are many couples with one infected partner who go on for years without contracting the disease because they are informed.  I personally know of several such couples.

There are medications you can take to reduce the risk of passing along the disease.

A lot of people have herpes, but they are asymptomatic and unaware that they have been in contact with herpes.  Many of these people are unknowingly spreading it.  You may be one of them.  Herpes is always a risk during sexual intercourse.   It is typically not checked for during routine STD tests, unless the person has symptoms.

You are correct.  She is not one in a million.  She is somewhere between one in six or one in five people with genital herpes.  This statistic does not include herpes type 1.  Some sources indicate that the number of people infected is actually significantly higher than 1 in 5 - that's just the number who present symptoms.

Fun statistic: In the UK, 7 out of 10 people will catch one of the strands of herpes during their lifetime, but only 1 in 5 will have symptoms (cold sores if oral, genital sores if genital).

Your ""raging burning genitals"" comment is ridiculous as symptoms are generally mild and rare after the first contracting the virus.

If you don't want to date someone who has herpes, that's fine - I understand that, and I'm not sure I would have either - but you don't have to be an ignorant Dbag about it.

Edit:  In case you are interested, scientists are working on a herpes vaccine and may or may not be close, so this may be a moot issue in the near future.

My cousin ran at the gnome and as soon as my cousin's character ran into his space, the gnome jumped off of the boat. The deed was done.

We couldn't believe it. What have we done? We pushed a guy off of the boat and into the water. Did he die? Would he report us? We were in tears laughing and 100% convinced that we had pushed this gnome into the water.

This is a central problem in educating the public actually. It's tough to explain something well when it can be described in so many ways. To list some 'typical' symptoms doesn't always do much good. You can be socially awkward, have poor coordination, etc. and yet not have the condition. Yet some, like myself, don't fit the symptoms perfectly.
So, what I'm basically trying to say is that it is really, *really* hard to tell if someone does or does not have it based upon what they post on Reddit alone. Many high-functioning Aspies are undiagnosed and unaware that they are any different than most other people, but they still have the condition itself. It may not be what you expect though.
I concede the point that a great many people are misdiagnosed, which is true for a most diagnoses in general. It goes back to the ""hard to tell"" thing. They *could* be really shy and introverted, but otherwise no different than everyone else, or they could have Asperger's. Do we diagnose them or not? We don't know for sure what the truth is there. I guess the issue is self-diagnosis, I feel that this best fits what you are describing, but correct me if I'm wrong. This is a problem for all conditions and disorders, just like the hypochondriacs you mention.
So, I guess what I'm getting at is, it's not /r/Aspergers , it's all subs that are related to mental and physical health. I don't feel /r/aspergers is bad despite a large number of subscribers who don't have the condition, but this is all my opinion.",1386834225,"many high-functioning aspies are undiagnosed and unaware that they are any different than most other people, but they still have the condition itself.","undiagnosed and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"undiagnosed and unaware","undiagnosed",NA,NA,0

"cdkvvi9","The Terminator's alarms blare on its HUD.  Its internal power core has been damaged.  Unless emergency repairs are made, it will power down within the hour.  It must finish this fight.  It begins to walk forward.

The Predator sees the Terminator walking forward.  He takes off his helmet and removes his chest armor.  The Predator is nearly naked, only a loincloth and fishnet clothing cover its body.  It finally removes its wrist-blades, and charges.  The rain is a drenching downpour, both enemies obscured by it.  The Predator grins again.  This will truly be a good hunt.

The opponents collide.  Each blow staggers the other, even in their wounded states they attack with the ferocity of animals.  The ground below is pooled with both red hunks of flesh and green blood.  The Terminator is virtually stripped of its flesh now, the red eyes glowing in the rain.  The Predator is also in bad shape, two ribs are broken and lacerations coat its torso.  He shoves the Terminator, who immediately rises up, grabs the Predator, and flings him away.  The Predator kicks the Terminator in the chest, the metal endoskeleton dented by the powerful blow.  The Predator tackles the Terminator and pounds its head, hoping to take out its CPU.  The Terminator responds by reaching up and breaking one of the Predator's mandibles.  With a mighty roar, the Predator rises up.  He needs to finish this, now!

With increased ferocity he pounds away at the Terminator.  The endoskeleton is in bad shape, and the Predator's knuckles are skinned to the bone.  Even now the Predator persists, the Terminator also unrelenting.  The cyborg assassin knocks down the alien hunter, and begins to choke it.  The Predator, reaches around for something, until he finds his wrist blade.  With all of its strength behind it, the Predator decapitates the machine.  The glowing red eyes flicker, then dim out.

"cd82szd","Not true. You are unskilled labor and the technical knowledge you have is a jumble of data. You are at best, in most cases, Consciously Incompetent and unaware that ""you know nothing Jon Snow."" The *cases/examples* where I have seen some level of paid-internship exist is:

1. Accounting Major working for a Big 4 firm that will inevitably receive a CPA/Masters Degree. The rate of pay is above the market rate (near $20/hr for a Junior College student). In this example, you can do grunt work in the back office sifting through paperwork and compiling merely information. 

2. Engineering will often pay above Market rates, as my cousins work for a major Northeaster Engineering firm and did so during college for an internship. They were paid double or triple min wage, because there was value to be had. 

In the cases I've seen and read about where no money was paid either:

- the student didn't look hard enough
- chose a crappy major or employer for the internship
- chose a position that has a steep learning curve and provided no value relative to their career destination

With that said, I would work for FREE and get a SIDE job to work with an industry's TOP/BEST professionals, academics and leaders. Wouldn't you? Granted, of all internships, that is probably a small %, but if you do find it, don't quibble over pay; realive the nonpayment is an investment in yourself, your future and time *savings.*

Financial Services is a GREAT example today of the problem due to licensing and industry structure. It is an inverted pyramid, with most of the population in public financial services being 55+ and the new students entering, at best, can only bring value by being personable and professional there are STEEP barriers to entry:

- Licenses that often take 1 year+ minimum to acquire.
- Education requirements to obtain necessary certifications.
- Knowledge, that if you did not gain it during college or reading personally, you will take a long time to obtain
- EXPERIENCE, which is the biggie here, because that's what people are paying for, advice (which can only be given with enough experience and exposure)
- TRAINING; the industry has largely cut back on training because even a young trainer person, unlike an accountant, provides very little VALUE to the firm. Technical knowledge, unless you are in i-banking or a similar role, still matters minimally. 

----------------------------------

I don't agree with non-payment, but all factors matter. If you are working for free at a supermarket to get into middle management, then that's dumb. But if you are working for min. wage at a great firm, that if you get your foot in the door your pay and benefits will be 2-4x normal average wages, then it makes sense. 

On the one hand our generation is seriously exploited, on the other we are a bunch of whiney, entitled brats that ONLY want the specific dream job they had in mind so that they can continue to live the rockstar lifestyle they dreamt about when they were first pitched college. Remember, much of the MAJOR movies about college being a fun time were seen in the 90's. Prior to that it was Animal House and maybe PCU, but MANY of the shows/movies of the late 80's and 90's pitched to our generation how GREAT hs would be then how amazing college would be and finally, how life would BE AFTER college.

Christians believe the Bible to be the divinely inspired word of God. Does it not follow that if it is inspired, it ought to be internally consistent?

&gt;The census happened ten years after Herod died.

&gt;Archelaus was Tetrarch of Judea from 4 BCE to 6 CE. He was so incompetent that he was removed by the Romans and Judea was annexed into the province of Syria. Quirinius was then appointed Governor of Syria and his first order of business was to impose a census and a tax. This was the first Roman census in Judea, and the first census in Palestine at all in centuries. It caused riots and small scale revolts.

&gt;It did not apply to Galilee. Galilee was still under the authority of Antipas and not subject to a tax. No one living in Nazareth would have been affected by it or required to do anything.

&gt;No census ever required anybody to return to their ancestral homes anyway. It would have been logistically impossible and served no purpose. It is frankly an absurdity on the part of Luke and is almost ipso facto proof that he's making up his entire nativity.

We are talking about textual consistency. If you want to have a discussion about exegesis, that's fine; but understand that the question as posed did not invite extrinsic evidence.

&gt;Luke says Joseph and Mary went straight to Nazareth after presenting Jesus at the Temple.

For reference: Luke 2:39 And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.

So Joseph either took his family to Egypt after performing the rituals in Jerusalem (halfway through verse 39) or after a quick stop in Nazareth (after verse 39). The verse you referred to is not dispositive of the Matthew account if we view it in a light favoring textual harmony.

"cd3d95j","&gt;If we assume that the Bible strives for internal consistency, then we ought to begin with the presumption that all of the Bible is consistent absent convincing evidence to the contrary.

The Bible doesn't ""strive"" for anything. The Bible is an anthology of authors who were mostly unaware of each other and unaware that they were writing anything that would be canonized into the Bible.

&gt;Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem where Jesus was born. A week or so later he was then taken to Jerusalem for the ritual sacrifices and purification. Rather than going back to Nazareth (several days' journey), Mary and Joseph stayed in Bethlehem (less than a day's walk from the temple in Jerusalem) for the first year of Jesus's life. Given that Joseph was from the house of David, it is possible that he had family in the area, so he would not have been without connections and support while he stayed in Bethlehem. One year later, the wise men arrived in Bethlehem (after a detour in Jerusalem) and offered gifts to Jesus at his family's house. Joseph then had a dream where he was told to flee with his family to Egypt to escape Herod, which he did.

&gt;Years later, Herod died and an angel appeared to Joseph telling him to return to Israel. When he arrived, Joseph found out Archelaus was in charge, so he settled in his hometown of Nazareth rather than back in Bethlehem.


* The census happened ten years after Herod died.

* Luke says Joseph and Mary went straight to Nazareth after presenting Jesus at the Temple. 

* Matthew has Mary and Joseph already living in Bethlehem in a house and only deciding to move to Nazareth after they come back from Egypt because Herod's son, Archelaus, was Tetrarch in Judea, so they relocated to Galilee instead (and I guess never mind that the Tetrarch in Galilee is Herod Antipas, another of Herod's sons.

* Archelaus was Tetrarch of Judea from 4 BCE to 6 CE. He was so incompetent that he was removed by the Romans and Judea was annexed into the province of Syria.

This ten year gap between Herod and Qurinius is a big problem. Quirinius was never given any jurisdiction over Judea until 10 years after Herod died.

It's not a choice. You don't choose your reactions; you just react. It just happens naturally.

It's actually pretty easy to automate the music composition process for certain styles of music, but the decisions made about where to put music and what music to put there are based on intangible things that live in the human psyche.

For example, a scene of a woman taking a shower.  That's all that's on the screen.  The composer and the director make a decision about what the unspoken/ unseen content of the film is.  What type of music goes over it?

1) None, so that the audience focuses on her actions and we learn that she's a practical person who just wants to wash her hair and get to work?

2) creepy atonal music, so we know that she's alone, vulnerable, and unaware that evil lurks not far away?

3) the same music that played in the flashback sequence with her mother so that we know that as her mind wanders, she's thinking about that moment, so many years ago that she just can't forgive her mother for.

These are nuanced decisions that are 99% based on the intangible things - a directors desire, a story that needs some help, a gut feeling.  There's not necessarily 1 right answer (but there are loads of wrong answers).

"cbrg0yo","You may be right. Nothing is impossible. His wife may very well respond by fulfilling everyone of 1Kratos1's deepest wishes, and go get drunk at a strip club with him in celebration of throwing off the bonds of the TSCC.

I would say, given 1Kratos1's descriptions of his wife, and given the predominant attitudes of women (especially religiously-raised women) toward things like strip clubs, it is far more probable that she will react extremely poorly to the entire situation.

Regarding this:

&gt;Stop trying to put yourself above him, or even assume you know how to better handle the situation he's in. 

**Not above him**

Look, most of us have been there -- in that place where your utter rage at the incomprehensible lie you've been raised in and *helped fund* is stronger than your love for your family. [1Kratos1](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1klpef/wife_never_responded_to_my_email_about_polygamy/) [said](http://i.imgur.com/HOYax0v.jpg), ""I think I hate the church more than I love my wife,"" so he's clearly in that place. He's thrashing about in rage and alienating his loved ones -- partly in the hope that they too will recognize the lie and leave with him.


**Situation**

But his loved ones have the right to their own path of self-discovery and their own journeys, and there is a more compassionate and patient way to go about this than intentionally poking at the most painful topics he can think of to bring up. 

And, quite frankly, I would assume he has the ability to be more mature and restrained than he is acting. He is in his 40's, he is a father, and he is a spouse. He has maintained an [LDS](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1j3axw/am_i_the_worst_of_the_worst/) [facade](http://i.imgur.com/lldmogW.jpg) throughout his marriage, indulging in ""sins"" such as smoking and drinking only when traveling. He claims he has never cheated on his wife. 

All this indicates a man who is capable of restraint and control. A man who recognizes that his own impulses are secondary to the well-being and happiness of his children and his wife -- the family he has responsibility for. This indicates a man who understands on some level that once you become a parent, you are no longer free to indulge selfish whims, or to opt in and out of a relationship (in some form) with the other parental party. 

**Everything he's done**

* But then, [he](http://i.imgur.com/xlucjMe.jpg) goes to strip clubs.
* He starts a subreddit that is not only pornographic ([NSFW](http://i.imgur.com/6cObHoc.jpg)), but which *actively disrespects* a key tenant of the religion his wife still follows by fetishizing garments (and possibly his wife's autonomy regarding her personal image, see note at bottom). 
* He brags about their [private sexual escapades](http://i.imgur.com/PEO43f5.jpg) on public forum. 
* He intentionally brings up Joseph Smith and [polygamy](http://i.imgur.com/D7BZPQd.jpg) in order to goad her into a shocked response, with no apparent self-awareness of how his own sexual peccadillos may be viewed by her. 
* He [mocks her](http://i.imgur.com/YCB3H2W.jpg) for turning to him for support, when the whole reason she's experiencing doubt and emotional difficulty is *because of his repeated attempts to goad her into disbelief on his schedule*. 

To put the time frame of this in context, 1Kratos1 initally posted in the exmo subreddit (stating he believed, but disliked the church) on July 26 -- 24 days ago. Within a few days, he posted again, announcing that after reading all the exmo links he no longer believed and now wanted a [step-by-step guide to get his wife out](http://i.imgur.com/lNvUGHT.jpg). Over the course of the past **24 days** two themes have shown up in his comments in regards to his wife, sometimes in the *same comment*:

* The need for time and patience and to let his wife process the truth in her own time.

* His impatience with her unwillingness to question the church and leave *rightnowrightnowrightnow*. 

It is reasonable to deduce that 1Kratos1 has reason to believe the topic of unfaithfulness in a marriage is a sensitive/ touchy issue to his wife, given his choice to focus on drilling in JS's polygamous activities (instead of, say, focusing on [racism](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/racism-and-the-mormon-church.html) or [sexism](http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/06/17/sexism/) or the fact that in JS's time there were also [prophetesses](http://katepapers.blogspot.com/2005/05/lucy-mack-smith-new-england-housewife.html) and [priestesses](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=1171)) as a means of introducing cognitive dissonance to his wife. Yet despite his willingness to exploit her discomfort with JS's manipulative and immoral sexual behavior, he is incapable or unwilling to acknowledge that his own sexual escapades could be viewed as problematic. 

Furthermore, he seems completely blind and unaware that his behavior (specifically the strip clubs, discussion of their intimate life, porn subreddit, and at least 8 years of lies to cover up his ""sins"") will actually discredit all the information he provides through association, and will further prop up her faith in the church. 

He hits every bad stereotype of an offended, sin-loving mormon who is using manipulation and deceit to tempt faithful mormons away. It's so spot on that part of me wonders if he's a fictional persona created solely to prove that exmormons are just as depraved and sin-driven as they liked to depict us in Sunday School. ""Look, guys, I had this guy start a porn subreddit and brag about cheating on his wife, and they are cheering him on! I told you they didn't have morals.""

&gt;This thread is full of unsolicited advice for someone who never asked for it. 

He has asked for advice multiple times, and he has ignored every bit of advice that counseled a path or model of behavior different from the one he was already set on. He clearly believes that if his wife leaves him, it will have nothing to do with his own behavior. 


&gt;Ya'll need to get off your high horses.

I disagree. I think one does not need religion to have values such as honesty, respect, or fidelity.

The Oldest Tree on Earth: The Curse of Methuselah
by Roger McGough

**Poem One**

Once you had garden of Eden,
Now you have this. Vegas.
A playpen in the desert. Bliss.
Here, 5,000 years of Civilization
Can be experienced in an instant.
Have a nice day. Enjoy.
For in a flash it could all be over.

Kings, emperors, deities
Craven images cast in plaster, neon lit.
Look on my works,
Ye mighty, and despair.
The smell of money in the air
A tawdry son-et-lumière

(A one-way street going nowhere.)

Your immortals are mortal, they were once flesh and blood.
Escape the delusion, the noise and pollution,
The true immortals are made out of wood.

They call us Bristlecone Pines.
They call me Methuselah.



**Poem Two**

Methuselah, Methuselah, this human
christens me, for he has counted
The candles on my cake... 4,600.
Am celebrity now and no mistake.
Am named. Am given voice.
The years, like necklaces bestow
a wisdom, humankind can never know.
Millennia, they come and go.
Have no eyes, but have seen it all
Ancient civilizations that you can
Only read about, Methuselah has sensed.
Am not part of history... No,
History is parts of me.



**Poem Three**

Unlike words, tree-rings never lie.
One year was freezing cold and dark
The sun was hidden in the sky
I tasted brimstone and it left its mark
Like a noose tightening, like a charred wreath.
What is this thing, I thought, called death?

You can read me like a book
Open me up and take a look:
History laid bare, a garland here
a crown there. Plain as a pikestaff
for all to see. Each year jotted down by me.
The state of the nation, an annual report
in ever decreasing circles. The wheels
of fortune, the cycles of despair.



**Poem Four**

If I had lungs I would be coughing
A throat, I would be parched
If I had eyes they would be stinging
Flesh, it would be scorched.

Sulfur, smoke and cinders
enfold me like a shroud
There is no silver lining
only poison in this cloud.



**Poem Five**

Water, water everywhere and not a drop...
To think that down there, battery trees
Like plumped up turkeys stand proud and vain.
Bloated and unaware that they are but a switch's
throw away from death.

Water, water not forever...
For twenty-four hours a day, fountains play,
Spraying graffiti that mocks a desert kept at bay.

But nature has a way of saying ""Enough.""
After the pride there comes the fall
After the boom, the bust.
Remember man that thou art dust,
And unto dust...



**Poem Six**

Men drop to the earth like leaves
Lives as brief as footprints in snow.
Bristlecones enthroned on top of the world
Watch civilizations come and go.
They seek our secret, immortality,
But search in vain, for it is vanity.
If truth be known I would rather
be a flower, or a leaf that lives
and breathes with brief intensity.
My life is as thin as the wind
And I am done with counting stars.
On the side of this mountain
I might live forever,
Could you imagine anything worse?
My name is Methuselah and this is my curse.

Wrong, man. With *experience* comes wisdom. If you think you can just sit there and get old, and somehow that will make you wiser than someone that actual tries new things, then clearly you've got a lot of growing up to do. Your age isn't an indication of intelligence or taste, it's just how fucking old you are. There's a reason that there are still old racists in the world; age doesn't give you any new insight.

It's not about that. I'm just flabbergasted that someone could be so close-minded as to judge a film solely on the format that it's presented in. I mean, you have to realize how dumb that is, right? That would be like claiming Picasso isn't real art because his paintings aren't ""realistic enough"". Sure, you may not like Picasso, but calling it ""not art"" just makes you look inexperienced and unaware that there are people that dislike *your* type of art.

&gt;... a lot of words to put in my mouth.

No, not really. You said ""golden age"", which implies that there was a time when Hollywood was better. There wasn't, ever. Hollywood is, has been, and always will be about the paycheck, no matter what Quentin or any other director will tell you.

&gt; keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.

Don't worry, my brain is set firmly enough that it'll never happen. I can see how you'd be afraid of that, though. ;) Take care, good luck when your kid inevitably likes the complete opposite of everything you like.

"cadfevh","I kind of disagree. I commented below that the Del Ray neighborhood is extremely family oriented and there is no shortage of family friendly restaurants within easy walking distance of The Sushi Bar. It's easier and more effective for this restaurant to enforce a blanket rule in an impartial manner rather than leaving it up to someone's subjective interpretation as to what well-behaved means. I really think that most parents believe their kids are well-behaved.

For example, friends of mine have a 3 year old who almost makes me like kids...he's sweet and friendly but also quiet and extremely well-mannered. My friend apologized to me for her son's ""meltdown"" when he continued eating food off the table after she told him it was time for bed. It was such a non-event that I was initially confused as to why she was apologizing. My friend is always very gentle but firm with him, so he understand rules and boundaries. 

Conversely, my sister in law has a 1-year old and a 4-year-old who is absolutely wild. He is generally an okay kid but a little spoiled, no manners, few boundaries and completely undisciplined. She actually said to me that she doesn't think he ever needs time-outs or discipline because, in her opinion, he's such a good kid. I could not disagree more but I kept my mouth shut. We went out to dinner with them recently and I was mortified because he was out of his chair wandering around the table, getting in the way of other diners and waitstaff and generally being noisy and disruptive. SIL and husband were completely unphased and unaware that his behavior was super-rude and I guarantee they would not have understood why if they were arbitrarily asked to leave.

"ca51jm3","I get what's he's saying, but a large part of the reason people radicalise is because they don't agree with a governments policies (in this case, the UK's foreign policies, which are on a bit of an imperialist hangover).

At the end of the day, most UK citizens are so apathetic and unaware that our political system becomes more of a formality than a platform for change.

This is why radicalisation happens, people can say 'get involved at a local level' and go through the proper democratic channels, but this won't create any real change.

"c9qvv86","okay here, let me explain it as a guy who knows these things and is also myself heterosexual - it's just less boring than girls without dicks in porn(porn and real life are two VERY VERY DIFFERENT THINGS, LIKE MOVIES AND REAL LIFE) - it's fucking hot to see a girl fucking a girl and, instead of with a tasteless strap on - she has a dick of her own.

I'm just saying, you're making this a lot weirder than it actually is. What is the big issue anyway that girls have with this shit? Suddenly he's not alpha or cool/tough/or *something* enough for you now that you know a ""funny little secret"" of his? Although this is never the kind of thing you'd want your girlfriend to find out about because it's probably just a little kink of his while watching porn(rather than in real life), when she does, you should just be able to laugh about it with her and then go have sex with one another.


You have no right to be judging and the fact that it's ""a big deal in your mind""(I know, I know, that is what ""your mind is making it out to be""), is the weird part. So what? People have many sexual ideas and nuanced erotic play and feelings - maybe it's a normal part of girl psychology to be suddenly uninterested in a guy if she sees him as being like herself(wanting to get fucked or have a ... you know, inside you) - so suddenly that's what is in your head(which **probably isn't** why he watches that kind of porn).

**But you need to think of it this way, and GET BACK TO ME ABOUT IT** please, about how you feel about this: what if your boyfriend found out you watched girl on girl porn and found it kind of erotic or sexually tantalizing somehow even if you weren't really into it or into being a lesbian or having sex with girls yourself - then he 'confronted you' about it and made you feel judged - when really it's a non-issue and would just be something you weirdly got off on ..and it isn't that weird at all, but somehow he's going to make it weird because ""you're not supposed to be gay""(even though you're NOT gay, in fact you're DATING A GUY and fucking a guy regularly).. then he sat around ""worrying about it"" and ""being concerned"" and making posts on reddit about how his girlfriend did this and she tried to explain it that really when she thinks about being with girls it's kind of gross but still she watches the porn sometimes for something different than ""girl sucking guy's dick/sex/etc"" porn.


I once had a girl get SUPER WEIRD about me / around me / about everything to do with me one night when she and I were playing some sex game and she asked me if I had ever had anything in my butt and I said yes(a girlfriend stuck her toe there once, LOL, as a funny/cute thing, not because I necessarily would like to be ass-fucked).

It was disgusting to me because this showed me she was closed-minded and judgmental, and it really gave me an insight into her (unevolved) personality. Like, are you seriously that closed off and weird that you can't consider that stuff or 'anything goes' with your partner? So like I said, maybe it's just a normal(though weird and closed minded) part of girl sexual psychology, maybe you just don't want to be tricked into dating a ""gay guy""(but if he wants to be having sex with you then he's not gay), or maybe these girls are just closed-minded and unaware that there's nothing wrong or weird about it.

"c9fjwfl","I am a stripper.  

I do not think you've necessarily ""been had"" by someone who was calculatingly trying to scam you, but it does sound like this relationship is unhealthy, that neither you nor this woman are able to set healthy boundaries, and that you need to back away.  

As to ""being had""...there is a not insignificant number of men who come into clubs *specifically* to form transactional ""friendships"" with dancers.  They are, often quite openly, less interested in paying for a service (eg, watching a performance) than they are in being someone's patron: paying for companionship, friendship, the illusion of love, an amateur therapist, etc.  On a shift last week, an older man eagerly told me about how he refurbished computers for dancers, who then became his friends, and asked me if I was by any chance in technological need?   I told him no, and then excused myself-- this kind of attempt to buy a person/friendship goes way past my personalcomfort/ethics/safety boundaries, and those of many dancers, regardless of how profitable they may be.    

There are many reasons that customers seek out these situations, ranging from sinister to very sad--because they want to have power over the women and feel in control of the relationship, because they have self-esteem issues and feel that they need to contribute tangibly (financially) to a relationship in order to deserve companionship, or, like you, because they are emotionally vulnerable and unaware that this kind of patronage is going on.   In your stripper's possible defense, it is not always as easy to tell which of these things are motivating a friendly customer as it was with computer guy.  

Regardless of how exploitative these situations are or can be, many of the women who participate in these kinds of relationships do genuinely become emotionally attached to their patrons-- it's difficult for two people who are intimate with each other to NOT become emotionally entangled.  This presents a huge problem, and is why most newbie strippers are warned to never fraternize with paying customers outside the club: it is almost impossible to relate to another person like this in a healthy way, and the power dynamics of these bought friendships are so inherently toxic that they are a breeding ground for abuse and dysfunction from everyone involved.   Stalking, financial exploitation, intensely abusive relationships, etc, etc- that mixture of dependence, obligation, entitlement, and (often mutual) loneliness and desperation is poison.

FWIW, the women who get entangled in relationships like this are usually NOT the cold, calculating types who are ""all about money.""  Those dancers generally have enough control over their lives to not enter into inherently risky, unstable Sugar Daddy situations.  

I think it's more likely that, rather than being scammed by a cold-hearted con artist, you got involved with a messed up woman who is (at least emotionally) cheating on her fiance, who has dependency and boundary issues-- someone who is herself not able to draw the line between personal and transactional relationships.  It's possible that she did in fact fall for you, was unable to cut off the client/customer relationship, and the aspect of her being a stripper was less relevant than her being someone who escaped into another relationship and hid it from both her boyfriend and her fiance.  You may unfortunately never get the ""real proof"" you want because this girl may not know the ""real story"" of her relationship with you herself.  

This is still incredibly dysfunctional, and I think you need to exit this relationship (don't stalk her, either), step back, and try to process and recover from your divorce. It sounds like you're in a lot of pain right now, and I hope you find the healing you need--but I'd honestly recommend that you stop going to strip clubs, and spend the money on a credentialed therapist/counselor instead.

I just went through something similar, but involved a marriage and a long one. I think you can look at it another way. How long can you be expected to keep your guard up? When is it time to drop it. Someone can go 10 years as your soulmate, and change in an instant. You can't keep your guard up for 10 years, or even 2 or 3 with the next person you fall for. 

So the answer is, it is futile to think you can be fully protected from heartbreak. It is impossible, without being lonely the rest of your life, which is the very thing that you think you can avoid by being over cautious. You can always be betrayed. So, knowing that, just live your life. There is no way to FULLY protect yourself, so there is no point in trying. You will always be a LITTLE guarded after this, it's ok. Just be free to live your life, and know that after what you went through, nothing else will ever hurt as bad...so LIVE YOUR LIFE, and don't be afraid. It will never hurt as bad as this, because you will never be so completely unguarded and unaware that this can happen, ever again. You've taken a sword through the heart and lived.

"c98c1w4","I found an iPhone on the sidewalk one night while coming home from work. There was nobody around, so I picked it up and luckily it wasn't password protected.

I could've easily taken it home with me and never tried returning it, but I opened up the Facebook app instead, found out who it belonged to, and posted my cell number on his wall explaining how I had found it.

Soon enough I got a call from some girl who had seen the post, claiming she was with him and he was really drunk and unaware that he had even lost the phone. I gave her a location where I could give it back, but she said it would have to wait until the morning. 

The next morning, the owner of the phone calls me, confirming that he can come pick it up. I tell him the main intersection to meet me at and says hell be about 30 mins. While I wait. I decide to look through his pictures to get an idea of what he looks like. 

From what I can see he sort of looks like a scumbag. White dude with 'gangster' clothing, lots of self shots,  pictures of him trying to look cool with weed... and then lo and behold I come across pictures of him taking self shots of himself holding his erect cock. 

By the time he comes to meet me all I can think of when seeing him is the pictures of him and his dick, and I think he knew that I knew, because it was extremely awkward. He ends up giving me 5 bucks and saying ""Thanks bro"" and that was pretty much it. He was acting like it was weird that I had gone out of my way to return the phone.

I thought I would feel really good about myself but it was actually just really anticlimactic. He didn't strike me as the kind of guy that would have even thought of returning a phone. For all I could tell he could've stolen the phone in the first place. 

Either way I did what I thought was right and I'm contributing the story here because no one knows I did this.

"c966lx1","I believe that under such ""enlightened"" circumstances we would most likely as a collective just kind of ""know"" as you so put it through a highly significant majority, similar to a mutually agreeable meeting of the minds amongst people who peacibly assemble. To further qualify this rather philosophical thought, I feel as though that inorder to reach the point of such an evolutionary step as a collective, this ""jump"" if you will - is accomplished as a matter of the natural progression and order of things; there is little to no chaos attached to it... meaning that the ""intellectual fights/debates"" of today would have already been cleared if that makes any sense; that we can all see that we can and will grow and better ourselves through these scientific discoveries only if we each are willing to take personal responsibility without hesitation, question or tolorance for nothing less than its highest responsible use to do good in this world. 



I don't think this process is connected to any ""signal"" (no alien beams, close encounters and/or second, third, fourth comings, etc)... I just think at some point the stark reality has to set in for those who remain blissfully ignorant and unaware that the world cannot continue on the path that it is currently on; that we can gain nothing out of our time and experience here if we continue to prevent progress by means of suppressing people and ideas which have positive scientific merit which stands to become both a gain and benefit for all peoples, solely on the basis of such an idea failing to align with religious, philosophical and or societal mores. I say this, because I think that at such point in time, perhaps akin to a point of critical mass where such an environment exists (and in no way am I describing a state of some ""Utopia""), we will have long since moved into what can best be described as a higher plane of understanding and our minds will have already expanded as such that where for the consideration of such vital discoveries, we've reached a point in society where no longer is any value is placed on competition and outcompeting those with whom we do not agree with on the basis of religion and/or philosophies; the materialism and capitalism profound in our society today will have since lost its seductive and captivating appeal, and science will no longer be held captive to the same. Furthermore, that we at that defining moment in time have and will have reached a point where the very highest majority of individuals are capable of the highest thinking without prejudice, to view and see possibilities for what they truly are and how the same becoming a reality can truly achieve a greater good for a higher purpose. 



While this may seem totally out there, I believe the vast problem that exists today with scientific discovery, its progression (and quite honestly the world in general) is the fact that disputes exist out of ignorance, hatred and greed; where so many are willing to so easily dismiss scientific concepts and areas of promise sheerly because of their relationship to beliefs that do not necessarily match or reflect the reality in existance. This thought process is in no way atheistic, anti-religion or anti-God... it is simply stated to illustrate that until we learn to operate from our highest minds instead of our egos and/or through the constraints of many modern day religions, we will largely be stuck exactly where we are at right now; where someone ends up having to go to all the way to Israel for stem cells in efforts to give their child the ability to walk and speak again after traumatic brain injury (deep in the comments from the OP found [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1bc2gu/my_oldest_son_hasnt_said_a_word_to_his_little/) ) to the many individuals who refuse the gift of life through blood donation and/or transfusions and to those who refuse to become organ donors where a single body in death has the capacity to save 8 lives and improve the life of over 50 other individuals simply because of stated political and/or religious convictions that are supposed to hold life in the utmost and highest regard yet allows for many needless deaths to occur... if this makes any sense. It is my deepest wish for such things to stop and to not be in occurrence in the name of politics, religion or God. Science exists to help us and if anything to bring us closer to an understanding of a higher power and its relation to the Universe we know; not to divide us further and further into the semantics of divisiveness, exclusion and/or intolorence. If there is any ""signal"" to be had or rather sent - it would seem that the more of us who come to appreciate this simple fact and shine the candlelight on this very simple universal truth - the closer we come to achieving greater and greater things in this world in the name of science.



For the record considering I am aware that there has been particular ""undertones"" in my writing which one may easily confuse, I thought I would clarify for purely statistical purposes that I am not Atheist; I was raised and observant in the Roman Catholic Church and was also raised cognizant and observant of Jewish faith/traditions as both coexisted in my household growing up. As an adult, I honor both traditions in my household for what they are in terms of moral guidance (each respectively a different lens through which to view the world and apply its lessons) and where I engage in my own understandings of both God, Spirituality and my ultimate purpose here on Earth in this lifetime.

Maester Thomax’s *Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons* had not been so fortunate.

**THEY ARE DIFFERENT BOOKS.** The confusion arises because ""Death of Dragons"" appears in the lengthy subtitle of *Dragonkin*. Tyrion notes that *The Death of Dragons* has only one surviving copy and no known author. Some think Tyrion is simply mistaken and unaware that Maester Thomax is the author. I find this exceedingly unlikely since Tyrion is a very knowledgeable character and more importantly because he actually mentions Maester Thomax by name and is therefore likely aware of his works:

And you speak of hot air!?

Hunters, by and large receive the lowest level of ""training"" in the form of safety courses offered by.. the State.  The same entity which trains the police.  

These courses are pretty easy to sum up ""Don't shoot at anything unless you know what it is you are shooting at"" and ""wear bright colors to avoid being shot at by people who don't follow rule #1""

There is a bit more to it and I am being a bit silly in my description but it certainly does not include rigorous training in the actual use of firearms.   

Finally.. if someone shot at a police officer and killed them, later to admit to doing it but only intending to shoot and not to murder...

How fucking well do you think that'd go over?

This guy was shot 3 times.  Point blank range.  In the chest.

And you honestly believe the intent was not to kill?

If so you are likely one of the most naive people I've come across on the Internet.

You talk about revolting because ""that's just too much"" for cops to kill citizens.  Have you been under a rock for the last 50 or so years?  This shit happens all the time, all over the world.  

The CIA and FBI were implicated in many missing persons and murder investigations during the civil rights movement.  Our government is currently discussing the concept of assassinating US citizens without due process and without clear indications of when such an action might be called for.  

Yeah, you're right we should revolt.  Unfortunately most people are like you and refuse to believe what is happening right in front of them.  Trying to get any support for a revolution is like talking to a brick wall.

Those people that are eating burgers and smoking cigarettes are not necessarily uneducated and unaware that they are wasting money on fast food and ciggarettes.  They are enjoying them because they are the few pleasures they get out of life.  Would it make more sense to spend that $15-$20 on grocceries?  Definitely.  But smoking is coping mechanism and they are addicting now.  Quitting is stressful and they are already stressed all the time, one more stressor may be too much.  And if they don't have money for grocceries, then they probably don't have food in the house to grab and eat.  Poor or not, if you're hungry, you just want to eat.

Of course we should consider the intelligence, awareness, ability to suffer, etc of something when we decide whether to kill it.

I opened the wrapper, and my friend’s dog, Foy, decided to pester me for a piece, by poking his nose through the dog guard.  Being 6 years old, and unaware that chocolate is toxic to dogs, I gave Foy a single piece and went back to munching on the bar.

Even worse, the boot (‘trunk’ for those of you from the U.S.) had a fresh coat of brown dog-paint.  The funniest part was watching my friends mum cleaning up the dog diarrhea with really, REALLY cheap picnic napkins (which kept bursting, resulting in her hands contacting with the poo).  After receiving a scolding, we got back to their house where my mum was waiting to pick me up, and take me home.  

I sat in the car as my mum, and my friends mum spoke, nodded and made very animated body motions.  I was never a bad kid, but I knew that if I was in trouble, I was really for it.

Just use COMMON SENSE and be thorough (It's your ass if something shitty happens - Not knowing what's up w/ your body as it malfunctions makes for a **Bad Situation** that rapidly evolves into a *veritable* **Nightmare**).

If you are taking any medications prior to (or simultaneously during) use of a new substance, do the research for every pharmaceutical you have in your biological system - taking particular care to note how/if substances you are taking have known interactions with each other...Pay special attention to identifying if any substances ""Stack and Intensify""/ ""Potentiate""/ ""Negate"" or have any Danger of negative consequences to your Physiological and Psychological health resulting from bad interaction(s)...Good example(s) of things to check for, would be things like ""Serotonin Syndrome,"" (a potentially lethal problem resulting from bad/excessive substance interaction/dosing) and things like lowered seizure thresh-holds are good to know about.

Pro-tip: Studying Neurochemistry/Pharmacology is more interesting after taking certain substances! Reading about a substance you're on allows a greater understanding of the Science! Experience/theoretical knowledge dominates in any field really... Makes sense to experience these things first-hand - Though it goes without saying that safe drug-taking is the priority above any experience!

You still have to **study** drugs as a substance-explorer/psychonaut/your drug-title-of-choice academically to fully understand things...but you can do some fun *PRACTICALS* to complement your theoretical knowledge!

Also, I'm inclined to think that you'd pay a little more attention anyhow, especially if you knew you were going to be ingesting the substance(s) in question - Want to be safe right? 

Here's a real-world-hypothetical-scenario (courtesy of the dark recesses of my over-active imagination)...

Simple Bob - A very average man - who lives on through his infamous tale and is notable for nothing at all - Simple Bob - This is his story:

Simple Bob decides to take some **Tramadol Hcl** (an Opiate-Analgesic that can **lower one's Seizure Threshold**) to cope with the boredom of his desk job and deal with anxiety resulting from a peculiar Clock-phobia he has. Bob took the daily max dosage for 24 hrs - 400mg - his simple ass didn't know any better, but he lucked out with dosage - he consumed the drugs throughout the course of his 9 hour work-day at the Cardboard Box manufacturer he works for.

Poor Bob is dumb and useless as shit, but he's useful as a morale booster and unwitting clown - someone to have around to boost anyone's self-confidence. So Bob's overworked, underpaid, tired, very average and a little spacey from the Tramadol Hcl...

An off-kilter, mass-production, cheap, urine-yellow IKEA clock that runs 6.5 mins slow rests above that over-friendly Accounts-Asshole, Brad. It is the object of all of Simple Bob's anger/anxiety and a symbol of all that is wrong in the world in his eyes. 

Somewhat ironically, the **""Face""** of his Chrono-Overlord makes Bob **""Tick.""**

I tried to explain the humorous observation/play on words (stated above) to Bob over the course of our 6 years together... 

Needless to say it was a hopeless endeavor and was a concept not even poorly *grasped* by Bob, let alone being understood enough to be ""lost* upon his unrefined intellect... My charitable efforts served only to achieve numerous ""friendly-but-kinda-dumb"" looks on Simple Bob's very average/emotively-limited countenance (Kind of like an inbred dog... Sweet but dumb and about as expressive as his IKEA Clock-nemesis).

Bob is too short to reach his tormentor, too stupid to get a chair and too socially awkward to ask for help (though if only Brad was available, I would probably build a Sun-dial instead of asking him). Ultimately, Simple Bob can't even set the damn time correctly! He feels impotent and resorts to using his simple mind to ineffectively direct anger at the inanimate object telepathically...

Bob has a singular purpose after arriving at work... Waiting for that piece of shit clock that has gotten the better of him to strike 7pm and free him from his Corporate shackles! He relishes the moment of alignment for an instant. Then grabs his lack-luster and dusty coat and hat, punches his time-card and experiences the overwhelming catharsis and happy relief that only the simple-minded feel from having been temporarily emancipated from his Corporate Bondage. 

As a result of Bob being predictably distracted by his freedom (perhaps understandably for a man of Bob's intellectual capacity, attention-span and his life-long struggle to hold more than 1 thought) - Bob is so happy and unaware, that he confuses natural elation with the chemical helper he had earlier!

-Simple Bob promptly forgets taking 400mg Tramadol hcl.

To celebrate his not-special-at-all-and-recurring-daily-emancipation, Simple Bob buys a gram of ""Speed"" (as Simple Bob knows it), from his drug-dealing, trailer-park-residing, brother-in-law. Unbeknownst to him, Bob is purchasing Desoxyn Crystals AKA Crystal Methamphetamine (A powerful Amphetamine that can **induce seizures** if one is not careful with its use... Seizures may even occur at very low-doses for those pre-disposed to seizures genetically/are Epileptic/take too high a dose).

Does the class remember what Bob took earlier at work? Can you guess what's going to happen? Bob is totally ignorant of his situation...

Simple Bob smokes the entire gram of suprisingly high grade Desoxyn in 20mins (with a crappy tinfoil pipe he fashioned from an old taco-wrapper). Simple Bob promptly falls to the floor, his eyes filled with the fear of not understanding his grave error... the last insignificant seconds of Sad Simple Bob's pitiful existence slip away without epiphany and Bob became just another dumbass victim of Darwin's Law of Natural Selection. He died as a result of his foolhardy drug taking and the resulting fatal seizure-induced Brain aneurism.

He lives on only as a tale of insecurity, insignificance, reckless/uninformed substance use...and more generally...as a testament to human stupidity.

RIP Hypothetical Simple Bob - I'm sure you are hypothetically still making people world-wide feel just a tad smarter :)

Anyways, everyone try and minimize the harm of doing potentially dangerous drugs with common sense and knowledge. Don't forget to enjoy the riiiiiiide!!!",1338748062,"as a result of bob being predictably distracted by his freedom (perhaps understandably for a man of bob's intellectual capacity, attention-span and his life-long struggle to hold more than 1 thought) - bob is so happy and unaware, that he confuses natural elation with the chemical helper he had earlier!  -simple bob promptly forgets taking 400mg tramadol hcl.","happy and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"so happy and unaware","happy",NA,"so",0

I will never accept that a relationship can be any better or stronger by lying about cheating, even if it means the one being cheated on goes blissfully unaware and happy. Therefore, it is in MY OPINION that it would be in everyone's best interest to be told. If your idea of a better relationship is one partner being cheated on and unaware, that is your opinion. It is not mine. In terms of ""meant to be"" I did not mean that there is some magical fate of two people being together, I meant that there are situations in which a relationship can survive cheating and there are some that aren't. I think that either way the truth should be disclosed. I have said *multiple* times that perhaps some people would rather be blissfully unaware but that in my opinion no relationship would be stronger because of it and so I believe that disclosure is the best option. 

As for your first question - it would matter because I would not want to be in a relationship where someone lied to me about that, end of story. I don't care if not a soul found out and there were no outside repercussions - at the end of the day I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who lies to me about cheating.

"c1vbare","So, you're sixteen. You're just old enough to be aware of your own mortality, but not yet old enough to have had a long time to get accustomed to the idea. I was also afraid when I was your age. Despite the stereotype of young people as being reckless and unaware that one day they'll die--maybe the same day they perform some stupid stunt--I think it's normal for you to feel the way you do. And I think it's brave to face it without the comfort of believing you will exist forever in some different form.

When I was a teenager, rational arguments didn't help me get over my fear of being just gone. I already knew it was irrational. What helped was when someone told me that I wouldn't be so scared when I was older and had had some more life experience behind me. That turned out to be true. As I've gotten older, the fear has gone. I'm not ready to die, by any means, but I'm more or less comfortable with the fact that I will someday.

"c1tvn14","&gt;I hope you're not suggesting that anything not explicitly authorized by the Constitution should be forbidden of the federal government. Under what constitutional authority could the government prevent the populace from having nuclear weapons? Should we be allowed to have nuclear weapons?

""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""

That is exactly what I'm suggesting.  We shouldn't we?  The people that have them no are no less fallible human beings than the general populace.  The COME from the general populace.  Disregarding that private ownership of a nuclear weapon would be nearly impossible given the scale of development.  But the military the congress and the president certainly aren't angels and as our current president has shown he doesn't need approval from anyone to direct the military to bomb others.  How many private individuals have committed genocide, how many governments?  How is the state a more legitimate owner of the power of a nuke than an individual?  I would guess there may already be private ownership nukes. With the break up of the USSR there has been concern that a lot of munitions are not accounted for. Not on the scale of ICBMs but on the scale of a 500 pound artillery shell. I would suggest that no one needs nukes, but Pandora's box has already been opened, they exist and nothing is going to close that lid.

A nuke is very unpractical for a private owner, and most people with the means to own or manufacture one privately could even today if they really set about to own one.  However, in the theoretical what you are asking is WMDs in general so if one someday is created that can be made in a home lab kit there's really not much we'd be able to do about preventing people from having it.

&gt;""Showing correlation not causation?"" Isn't that exactly what your North &amp; South Dakota example was? Actually, it is different: the evidence I provided was robust, well-researched, and well-supported, whereas your evidence was a negative correlation you casually noticed in two out of the fifty states. You're holding my evidence to an absurdly high standard while you hold your own to an absurdly low standard.
No statistical study on this subject can provide a 100% guarantee of causality. What I've given you is evidence of a likely (though not definite) causal link. The preponderance of statistical evidence supports the conclusion that guns have made society more dangerous rather than less (I gave you four examples, but there are many, many others). Denying causality so well-established as that between guns and unlawful violence would be like arguing, ""I was hungry, so I ate, and now I'm no longer hungry. But correlation doesn't equal causation, so I cannot conclude that eating alleviates hunger.""

I showed you a counter example negating your proof.  You say the presence of guns must increase the danger of the persons around them.  I showed you a counter example where that is not true ergo your statement is false.    

&gt;In Alaska, most of them. Alaska has the highest per capita suicide rate in the country. Wyoming is toward the top as well. There is an established connection between availability of firearms and suicide risk (the overall suicide risk, not just the firearm suicide risk, increases when guns are more available). Is suicide less serious than homicide?

So Alaska and Wyoming are depressing places to live, the guns don't cause that.  As far as suicide being less serious than homicide, no I wouldn't say less serious.  But there is a huge difference between the victim also being the person making the decision to pull the trigger and the victim being someone who didn't decide to end their life.  

&gt;I suspect that this will be meaningless to you, but a number of studies strongly suggest a connection between aggression and the mere presence of a gun. In other words, people tend to be more aggressive and therefore more prone to violence in the presence of a gun, irrespective of whether or not that gun is used.

From the second study. ""It has been observed with knives as well as guns, with weapon pictures as well as real weapons""  

Would you like to ban knives and pictures of guns as well?  

Reading the  first study says that it was based on shocks given in the presence of a weapon.  I can imagine that in the presence of a weapon the flight of fight response notches up and thus they subjects shock more in response to trying to neutralize a threat in the presence of a weapon.  Again this doesn't really suggest to me carrying a gun is going to cause violence but that brandishing a gun escalates a situation which I would certainly agree with.  Which is why any fire arm self defense classes will admonish against brandishing a gun, it should only be pulled when it needs or is likely to be needed.  As soon as you pull a weapon out other people are going to react to that weapon. 

I would like to see the same study done with the person doing the shocking in control of the weapon and knowing the other person is unarmed and unaware that the shocking person has a weapon.

The second study was on reaction times and equated that to aggression.  Again I believe a fight or flight response may be triggered that gives a heightened awareness but these studies seem to be making very large assumptions from the results.

&gt;That's quite a perversion of my argument. I never said the government should disarm you (even if I did, I'm not sure how this means I want the state ""to do violence"" upon you), and, if you must know, I don't believe that guns should be banned. It's an unfortunate reflection on the state of the gun debate that anyone who isn't utterly and unquestioningly reverent of absolute gun rights is considered an advocate of confiscation of all firearms.
It's no longer relevant thanks to D.C. v. Heller, but prior to that it was well within the federal government's power to regulate or ban firearms provided it did not infringe upon the states' rights to maintain a militia in so doing. I raised this point not to say that the government should ban guns, only to clarify that it could. Even now, the individual right to bear arms does not preclude any kind of regulation; as the Roberts Court said itself, the Second Amendment, like most rights, is not absolute.

I apologize if I misinterpreted your statement that the only way I should be able to own a gun is if I keep it locked up in my own house and never leave with it because then it would be harming you, as your supporting a ban on carry.  As far as the not sure how that means the state to do violence upon me.  The state is violence, that is the only power it has, any regulation any law is eventually enforced through violence.

The federal courts have ruled that the federal govt has the power to make federal laws.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't infringe upon the constitution as written it just means that they've decided thats the case.  Just like Bush decided he could make people ""enemy combatants""  on his say so through executive order.  Just like Obama decided through executive order that he can kill us citizens on his say so or bomb other countries on his say so.

Again this is the difference between how it is and how it should be, but just because the federal government marches in lock step doesn't mean it is right.
