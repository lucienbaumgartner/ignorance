&gt;Words and ideas mean things. If someone tells you they are going to burn down your house, and draws comics about burning down houses, and writes about how cool burning down houses are, do you just wait till your house is burnt down to be like ""hey, that guy wants to burn down my house!""

Thats true but what you linked is not that.

What we have the first one is somthing called cashing in on a trend.

First comic is pointing out the hypocrisy and lack of self awareness of one radical being mad at another radical.

2nd comic: satire of the power rangers. Jokes about colours and relating them to race has been around since they first started.

3rd: i dont quiite know the context. If i had to guess its the rights/conservative view of an enlightened centrist. Its got the horseshoe referencing the horseshoe  theory probably.


So none of those examples are calls to action and if you think they are i want you to explain why.

All that is to be seen are comics that mock ideas and people.

Not too mention these are just the comics where are the references from the man himself that line up with his comics.


These arent some impossible goal posts. What are your references for thinking these comics are nazi material? Because to me it seems like a bunch of people call him and his comics nazi due to either personal distaste or feel they are one of the people being mocked and thus are emotionally blinded.

"hqfu6ag","I got a $50 ticket (permit parking violation - I had no permit, or guest pass, or any idea that cities did that. Dumb naive suburban kid) when I first looked at a Somerville apartment way back in the summer of 2019. I was able to successfully get that ticket waived, but only because I was going to get a parking permit and I talked to one of the people there that does the ticket appeals. She was nice and understanding and said if I was getting a permit today she would waive my ticket. She was very clear this was a 1 time only thing and that it was a valid ticket. I just explained I was unaware and new to the City. I've found this to be the case with other cities too - you can ask nicely and get tickets waived the first time. Sometimes pleading ignorance helps. People are understanding that the first time you might fuck up and not read the signs posted on the street.

Unfortunately I think you're SOL with how many tickets you've racked up. You might try asking them nicely about it, maybe they'd waive one or two tickets to bring the cost down. You could also ask if it's possible to get a permit while still paying off the tickets. Maybe they have a payment plan or something you can work out. I'm not quite certain - this is definitely a question to ask the parking department about. All we can do is guess.

My best guess - you get one or two tickets waived. They probably let you buy a permit if you've successfully garaged your car here. That way you avoid getting new tickets. You'll probably have to pay some amount of those tickets back though. I doubt they're nice enough to waive $300 in tickets. Especially if you were ""too lazy"". Try wording that differently too as a pro tip - you weren't *lazy*, you were *busy*. Don't be a dick about that either, just leave it at ""busy"".

"hqfm8dr","Born in the last week of 96, my memories begin around 2001. Earlier in my life my biological dad left my family and my mom was a single mom to me for a few years. I have no memory of this time or my biological dad.

2001- B. My mom was engaged to the man who would legally adopt me. to this day I have mixed feelings about that, I’m half black and I had to convert to judaism when he adopted me, and I never fit into that religion very well. However I remember enjoying their wedding (first party I can remember, formed strong core memories here) and I was the flower girl.

2002- A+. All I ever wanted was a sibling, and my little sister was born this year. I was so excited to have a new best friend, and had SO much fun with her as a baby (I was 5). She was born the second week of January so the entire year was marked by her coming into the world.

2003- A. Still super happy about having a sibling, and we went to Disneyland for the first time. Disneyland is still one of my favorite places to visit. 

2004- B. My second sister was born, and for some reason I was less thrilled about this. I wanted a brother pretty badly, and I knew with two sisters the three of us would always be “the girls”, and I had began realizing that I didn’t exactly feel like a girl. Still had a fun time being a child and I really loved computer games and video games at the time. Played a LOT of pajama sam and game boy.

2005- C. Started being bullied in school around this time. I became very aware of the things that made me different. My sisters were white and so were my parents, I was obviously half black. This wasn’t as common then as it is now, and people asked me everyday why I was different. I also began having a bad relationship with my adopted dad, and was beginning to struggling intensely with my perceived gender. I’m sure I had some good memories, but this period of my life was really hard. 

2006- C. Pretty similar to the above, but my family forced me to join dance team and I hated it SO much.

2007- D. Started puberty this year, and was MORTIFIED. I was in extreme denial that I was beginning to develop those parts. My mom would frequently yell at me in public stores that I was “becoming a woman” and would force me to try on bras. Yeah I hated this time of my life a lot. The only redeeming thing was the music, I had recently gotten an ipod and I spent so much time listening to music. I’m really nostalgic for music from this period because it helped me get through a lot.

2008- C. More terrible puberty stuff, iykyk. Started middle school. My parents put me in a private middle school for kids who were more artistic (and bullied in public schools) so that helped a lot. Was able to make my first LGBT friends, though nobody came out until many years later. But was deeply uncomfortable with my body and started SH around this age. My mom also had a really terrible alcohol problem which would persist until she went to rehab in 2012.

2009- B+. Was forced to have a Bat Mitzvah, which was pretty ridiculous. I had no choice despite not being born Jewish, and was forced into an ugly dress. The photos are so bad lol. But the music was awesome and Glee had recently started, which I was obsessed with. It had so much queer representation and made me feel more hopeful for my future.


2010- A-. Felt like I really had some solid friends, went on the 8th grade trip to disneyland, made my first film (a documentary about my sisters 1st grade class, really wish I still had it.) My love of film and interest in the entertainment industry began here. Had a lot of energy and was genuinely happy, despite still hating my body.

2011- C. Left the private middle school for a public high school due to financial reasons (couldn’t afford the private high school attached to it), and was brought back down to my low status I had in elementary school. Was making youtube videos at the time, but stopped before 2012 because of bullying. My parents forced me to join speech and debate and I hated it. My moms drinking was really bad. My sisters were young and unaware and to this day I struggle to relate to them because they weren’t old enough to really remember how bad my moms drinking was. 

2012- F. My mom nearly died from alcohol and then went to rehab. I became extremely depressed and fought constantly with both of my parents, and SH a lot. My only refuge was gay tumblr, but I still had imposter syndrome and thought I couldn’t be gay or trans. Turned 16 at the end of the year and was “surprised” with the ugliest car in the world.

2013- D. Still not in a good mental place. Didn’t have any solid friends. Realized I needed to throw myself into school so that I could get a scholarship to go out of state. Everyone told me I couldn’t do it, so I proved them wrong.

2014- B+. Started applying to colleges and was SO prepared. I got a 33 on my ACT and had above a 4.0. Got into every college I applied to, decided to go to the University of Wisconsin on a full tuition scholarship. Was SO FUCKING HAPPY to leave my hometown (on the other side of the country) and finally be my own person. 

2015- A. Left for Madison in August and cried tears of joy. My hometown and family wouldn’t be around to make me feel bad anymore. I made friends so quickly in college with so many different people, and I joined a sorority just for shits (even though I hardly identified or looked like a girl at the time, I was able to find an actually decent sorority with nice ish people). 

2016- A (first half) F (second half). It was great for a while, and the music was the best. But I was sexually assaulted in the summer. My sorority wasn’t there for me. I retreated into my shell. I had to move into the sorority house after summer and it was a much different experience, I only had one friend and I knew I had to drop out otherwise I would lose the rest of my college experience.

2017- B. Left the sorority, had to figure out how I would define myself without it. Still didn’t know who I was, I had repressed my sexuality and gender a lot. I was perceived as a bro-y straight girl who could hang with the boys. In November I cut my hair pretty short, not a true boy haircut but close, and prepared to go abroad.

2018- A++ (one of the best years of my life easily). On January 3rd I left America to study abroad in London. This is the single handed best thing I ever could have done for myself. When I got to London I said fuck it, I’m going to kiss girls here (lol). I didn’t know anybody so it was easy to be myself. I was able to actually experience dating people who weren’t men. It felt so much more correct. I had an amazing internship abroad and I traveled to 20 countries and felt so happy and free. When I came back to America I pretty much instantly went to LA for a summer internship. I was able to meet more girls on Tinder and felt more confident in letting people know I wasn’t attracted to men. When I went back to wisconsin in the fall I started dating girls and felt so powerful lmao. I was super confident and loved the person I was becoming. A+ year for sure.

2019- A+. Met my partner and instantly fell in love no lie. Still together to this day. They ID’d as nonbinary and I thought that was amazing, and very relatable. I was able to talk about my own gender stuff with them and felt so seen and understood. They’re also mixed race and adopted like me so we understand each other on a really deep level. I graduated this yeare and they were going into their junior year, so I moved to chicago for a 2 year advertising grad school program so that we would be close enough to stay together. 

2020- A. Despite what happened with Covid, this year was honestly great for me. My school went 100% remote, so I broke my chicago lease and moved back to Madison to be with my partner. All of my college friends were a year or two younger than me (after leaving the sorority I became better friends with the kids in my orgs) so it was great being able to be back on campus with them again. Became closer to my partner, adopted a kitten and moved to Portland at the end of the year with them. 

2021- A. 2021 was this year and it was pretty great. I was hired at a really solid company in a field related to my interests and abilities where I can make great money (I’m an art director for a big advertising agency). I moved to Long Beach and love it here, I can skateboard every day. I got top surgery last month, which has improved my life in every single way and I’ll never stop being thankful to have been in a place financially and mentally to be able to give myself that gift. My partner is beginning a tattoo apprenticeship and I got like 10 more tattoos this year (hoping for way more next year). My relationship with the family I grew up with isn’t the best but I honestly don’t care at this point. They did a lot of harm raising me with no contact to my Black relatives or any Black positive influences, and I had to unlearn a lot of their bullshit and shame they put on me. But I have my own family with my partner and our cat and I have close friends nearby who moved here after college. 

I turned 25 on the 25th of December and I am honestly really happy to be past my earlier years. People fear this age because it kinda marks you as no longer a super young adult, but I feel like my life is just beginning. I’m making the most money I ever have, I can afford to do fun things, I still look super young, I’m in great shape, and I’m not planning on ever having children so I’m purely making money for my partner and I to travel the world and have a great life.

"hqbl01z","Like most luxury goods there is a range in what people are looking for, what they consider reasonable and worthy, etc when making a purchase. Some enthusiasts are more focused on aesthetics and brand recognition out of a desire to signal membership to a particular lifestyle. Others are more focused on the customer service and hospitality of a brand. And others are dedicated purely to the olfactory experience. Of course most are looking for the optimal combination of all 3 where luxury is concerned.  
Even within the subsection of olfactory experience, for example, there are quite a few considerations.   
Are there candles with enormous throw and longevity, that are more affordable? Absolutely. But just like in perfumery loud and brash doesn’t always equate with quality. And so there are individuals that don’t mind paying for perfumes with less sillage and longevity, in exchange for quality and artistic experience, and the same can be said for candle consumers. But on the other hand, it is our right as consumers to question the quality of the companies we give our money to and assure that we are getting our money’s worth from their products.  
Trudon is my favorite luxury brand. I never considered that I would ever spend this amount of money on a candle and to be honest I’m still amused by it on some days. But no other brand has come close (in my opinion) to being able to craft such unique olfactory experiences. I tried in the earlier days to find dupes of candles like solis rex or carmelite, which were some of my favorites, in an effort cut costs and expand my awareness of other brands. Although their aesthetics are well crafted, I was not beholden to the idea of brand recognition and their customer service didn’t seem particularly stellar especially in comparison to service pros like Diptyque. Even when I was ‘disappointed’ by a candle, I always grew to appreciate it just for the sheer craftsmanship. And that is a rare quality in a candle. Candles that I dislike, I can sell off or give away. But with Trudon, I don’t mind keeping the odd candle that I’m not absolutely fond of out of appreciation for the artistry. So if one day a candle company comes along, offering the same quality of trudon at cheaper prices, I will most definitely give them my patronage. But until then, they can retain their my portion of their market share.  
I recently tried my hand at Diptyqe, for example, as I was always impressed by stories of their fantastic customer service, complete with favorite sales assistants and generous samples. I was quite disappointed in their offerings however. And while I can appreciate the brand as a whole when it comes to their branding, marketing, service, etc. I accepted that it was not for me.   
Mind you there are many affordable candles that can provide you with exactly what you might be looking for, and not everyone is going to be as particular about their scents, nor require the same standards. In fact, I sometimes wish I could return to the days of blissful olfactory ignorance and enjoy some cheaper scents in peace! Alas what has been smelled cannot be unsmelled in any case, though there are many other areas in life of which I remain blissfully unaware and uncultured (my wallet rejoices!). But there are also cheaper candles that I enjoy, and some I still hang on to by their dying dregs for some reason or other (not being able to find the company for example).   
So I don’t know what you should be looking for in a candle, only you can know that. Don’t look for me or others on this board to tell you how to feel or think about a particular candle or brand.  The beauty of a board is that us enthusiasts can come together to discuss our hobbies and passions knowing we are in the company of those similarly inclined and knowledgeable. And for beginners it can be a guidebook and source of information. But it can also be detrimental for those still forming an opinion, as they can feel discouraged or inadequate for not seeing the value in a particular brand. With this in mind, I encourage you to continue your journey! Take your time, mind your finances, and use the resources provided here as a guide but never the final arbiter of your personal taste.",1640723605,"alas what has been smelled cannot be unsmelled in any case, though there are many other areas in life of which i remain blissfully unaware and uncultured (my wallet rejoices!).","unaware and uncultured","unaware","and",FALSE,"blissfully unaware and uncultured","uncultured","blissfully",NA,1

"hq9rnnj","Yours is also a rather disingenuous counterargument. Rape is rape whether or not the person is affected by it. If someone had sex with comatose person but the comatose person was completely unaware and unaffected by it, it's still rape. Obviously the outcome of child molestation is far worse for the victim than beastiality, but outcome doesn't decide the crime. Rape isn't bad purely because of its effects on the victim per se, although that's obviously a major factor, but because it's a display of blatant lack of respect for bodily autonomy, something literally everyone values short of their own life. It is one of the worst things you can steal from another.

The reason that, say, a dog having sex with another dog isn't nearly as bad as a human having sex with a dog is because of the fact that humans are moral agents, dogs aren't. Humans obviously construct systems of morality, dogs live off of instinct. Because of that, we can't expect nor should we force them to live by our moral code.

"hq946vk","By far my favourite vehicle of any game. That feeling of standing in the vehicle and being able to move your head, change cameras and pilot it concurrently was amazing. Being able to build inside, create a moving base, add aquariums and your favourite fish to a vehicle? Insanely cool.

Researching and building all these new things you start venturing into an unknown cave in search of answers tapping sonar to preserve your fuel, except you see it uncover something in the distance. You manually switch to silent mode and turn off all the lights before noticing that its swimming straight towards you screaming before it crashes into your sub. While the awesome music blares, you kick the lights back on and switch back to full power engines trying desperately to escape in an absolute panic. This base is irreplaceable you think, I have so much in here, what about Jim? The first fish you caught upon discovering aquariums exist? I'll save scum before I let Jim down I tell you.

After another hit you are forced to venture outside for immediate repairs. Reluctant, unsure of whether you're going to be immediately eaten or where the bitch is. So you fire off a precious decoy, manually leave the wheel and wade through the water seeping into your sub as fires rage and alarms blare. You jump out the hatch to repair a few holes hoping it stops the sub from perhaps blowing up, unaware and new to the game. Absolutely shitting yourself expecting a jumpscare or to be eaten at any moment. Before swimming for your life back inside, shooting off another decoy and hightailing it back to where you feel safe. When you do, you sit there, contemplating what the fuck just happened.

"hq4ya4u","The Sith code is just how people generally function. Our passions are what drive us, and because of passion we get better in whatever we're passionate about, which grants us victories in our chosen field, which even in mundane environments can be its own form of liberation. And so long as there is something needing doing, you will always be driven to action (that's the ""no peace"" part).  The Sith take this philosophy to martial action, but it can be directed at any facet of life. I also don't understand why it's considered inherently evil )there's nothing inherently evil about emotions and passion, it is NATURAL, HEALTHY, AND HUMAN). The code is equally applicable to a light-sided force user.  If their personal passion was protecting others or tending to their community, then the Sith philosophy would be just as applicable.  They'd likely be more unpredictable than a Jedi, perhaps hot-tempered or impulsive, but not inherently violent or sadistic.

The Jedi are more violent and sadistic than the sith, in a lot of different ways. 
For one, they are simply in disillusion about their own violence, because they have no problem fighting, training to fight, or becoming angry (not all anger lead to violence, it's important to draw a distinction between anger as an emotion and acting on that anger). The Jedi are sadistic in many ways, among them they take children from their parents and what Qui-Gon did to Anakin as a child to bring him to the Jedi temple would actually be illegal according to the law on this planet (stealing a blood sample from a child without parental consent which is a serious invasion of privacy and violation of human rights, and Qui-Gon even made up that whole ""checking your blood for infections"" lie, it's so creepy, it's how a cult treats children, like property, and also lying to them and deceiving them as to what the cult is doing to them). The Jedi also see other beings as their subjects, even their vassals in many cases, for example clones, which are living beings yet to a Jedi they're only marching to their death so the Jedi don't have to do their own job in the galaxy. 

The Jedi are simply unaware and delusional about their own violence and hatred, as well as their own darkness, passion, emotions, desire, etc, they believe balance to the force means only the light side wins (what kind of view of balance is the eradication of the opposing side? balance is a pluralistic society with a plurality of different religions, practices, methods, viewpoints, opinions, beliefs, etc, not a fucking echo chamber) but balance to the force actually means between the light and darkness, embracing and using both, not just the light and that's how the Jedi are delusional. The ""light"" side is the rational side of the force and the ""dark"" side is the emotional side of the force and a human being is made up of both parts, they are both rational and emotional, and there's no balance if one doesn't embrace and use both aspects of what makes them human. 

In the beginning the Jedi studied and used both aspects of the force, until a bunch of Jedi full of prejudice and extreme intolerance decided to outlaw the emotional side of the force or the emotional aspect of human beings and kill every single ""dark"" Jedi or Sith that wanted the right of self-determination and the right to determine their own conscience and beliefs. It was the Jedi's prejudice and extreme intolerance that pushed the Sith further and further into the ""dark""/emotional side. The Jedi are control freaks who don't want people to be allowed to choose and determine their own beliefs without fear of religious oppression and persecutions. A lot of Jedi are not ""good guys"". 

Also the Jedi completely blocked themselves off of feeling any emotions, they have given up their humanity and are fine with basically being machines. If you can'T FEEL, you might as well be physically dead, because you definitely are dead on the inside, life just isn't worth living when you completely block yourself off of feeling any emotions, that is unnatural and messed up and anti-human, anti-humanism. This is one of many reasons why I would rather die than join the Jedi or become a Jedi.

"hq4qeoo","A lot of the genius downsides generally make them more insufferable. Being disconnected with feelings or socially bad tends to just be kind of crap.

I mean, it's okay, as long as they're not actually alone. Have other characters constantly seek them out or whatever.

Robots and edgy ANBU types are annoying af. We like Kakashi as an adult who's a fucking annoying troll, not as an edgy preteen or ANBU robot. Fics that have a rando go into ANBU to be a robot are a dime a dozen.

I think you probably have an idea of what's bad, though, considering you don't want arrogance and what not.

""Genius"" is largely two things. One, being faster at making connections between things. So learning the pattern faster, since that's what learning is, or just connecting the dots in general faster. The other aspect is how much they've done whatever task.

In theory, geniuses of the first type should also be good socially. In real life, they might be autistic/Asperger's, and have actual social issues with their brain. But often times, it's really just the second type, where the genius is the genius because they focused on a speciality early and didn't socialize enough to gain social skills.

Whether you decide to have them deficient in social skills is your choice. But a good idea is to have someone highly skilled in one specific area, not everything, mediocre but not fully socially unaware, and maybe normal or better than normal general pattern matching skills. Motivation is also another huge factor -- genius of hard work and all that.

There are a lot of directions to go for. You just don't want them to be so particularly asocial that it'll drag the story down, because social interactions are the lifeblood of stories.

And as someone else said, maybe Shikamaru is suitable? Otherwise, how genius do they really need to be? SIs are often Kakashi genius out of the academy because they're SIs and want the power fantasy. But boosting them so far can also negatively impact the story, really.

And remember, if you protagonist is genuinely super smart, you may need to make sure enemies are appropriately smart -- as a kid, they should still be outsmarted by Danzo and Orochimaru and Tobi and Madara and so on, who all have information and skill advantages. Stories where the protag can outsmart everybody are boring as fuck, unless they're not motivated or whatever.",1640598906,"but a good idea is to have someone highly skilled in one specific area, not everything, mediocre but not fully socially unaware, and maybe normal or better than normal general pattern matching skills.","unaware, and maybe","unaware","and",TRUE,"socially unaware , and maybe normal","normal","socially","maybe",1

"hq1wse2","I dunno how funny they are outside of the context of the moment,  but when I was in Tokyo, me and my three friends found that the trains shut down at midnight and didn't open again until 5am, so we typically just partied until 5am.  The second night we were there, we got thrashed.  I don't remember everything, but I do remember ending up in this club that had a bunch of mirrors and chandeliers with green lasers bouncing around everywhere, and I think I hula hooped with some random person?

Anyway

It's 5am, and we're stumbling back to the train station.  Train arrives, and we get on.

So if you haven't heard the term ""mind the gap"", it's generally used to indicate that there is a space between the platform and the train.  In Tokyo, it was completely random. Sometimes the gaps are barely over an inch, other times it might be half a foot.  Given I was drunk and unaware, and given that this gap was on the bigger side, it should come as no surprise that my foot went completely into the gap up to my shin.

I recovered quickly, regained my balance, and got back on the train.  A couple minutes later, one of my friends said ""Uhh... You're bleeding"".  I didn't feel anything, so I kind of just laughed and looked down and saw...a lot more blood than expected.

When the bleeding didn't stop, one of my other friends who was wearing a thermal undershirt, started taking it off to make wrap my wound up, as my jeans were getting quite noticeably red.  

Meanwhile there was an American man (who apparently spoke Japanese) and a Japanese woman kind of staring at this weird scene of a drunk guy undressing and wrapping his shirt around the leg of another drunk guy who was bleeding profusely, while two other drunk guys were trying to loudly offer their advice.

As they kept watching, the woman eventually pulled a mask out of her purse and put it on while the American, I assume, tried to explain that all Americans weren't like this.

Bleeding did end up stopping before we got to the guest house we were staying at, I somehow managed to put my bloody jeans in the washer before passing out, and woke up with a new story to tell.",1640544242,"given i was drunk and unaware, and given that this gap was on the bigger side, it should come as no surprise that my foot went completely into the gap up to my shin.","drunk and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"drunk and unaware","drunk",NA,NA,0

"hpox7d4","&gt;And still people are more willing to trust memes and bullshit spewed from politicians than they are to trust the overwhelming majority of scientists.

You must realize that for a while now a bunch of people just say ""science bitch"" and then run away as if that wins them an argument right?

It's to the point that when someone says something like this, for many people, myself included, it rings bullshit detectors immediately. 

In my case, if you told me that, I would throw out your opinion immediately and ask for actual evidence.

In my case it took a bit of reading through various materials from various actually credible institutions and just logicing it out to form an opinion.

In other peoples cases that might not be what they go search. They might want community backed support because *that's all they've ever done* and they trust them (we'll come back to that*.

In fairness to them, when I went searching I will admit most of the stuff I read came across as gibberish to me. I could make  sense out of some of the methodologies and the outputted result, but I can still confidently say I have no fucking idea how MRNA works/is produced, and neither do any of the annoying asshats on reddit who post simplified explanations so simple they literally explain nothing with smug happy looks on their faces as they hit post.

Given that, for me it was more a game of game theory. Both the virus and various vaccines (only thinking about the better ones so basically excluding j&amp;j, astra etc and including Moderna, Pfizer and that russian one that seems surprisingly decent) have very little information about long term effects because they haven't been out long term, but covid shows up with some signs of negative ones long term, and I haven't yet seen signs of likely negative effects long term for vaccines. Both the virus and vaccines have short term effects, but the worse short term effects of vaccines seem either inapplicable to me, or seem relatively small vs the worst effects from covid being no more you. You then combine that information with the idea that eventually its likely that vaccinated or not Im likely to get covid even though seeing how most people act Im probably top 1 percentile in terms of following correct procedure and that's how I came to the conclusion that vaccination makes sense.

That's how someone makes that type of decision without political identity (though just because people are annoying Ill point out that I lean pretty left).

There are so many changes to how I could have grown up, how I could have valued evidence etc, that I can see how people came to a different conclusion than I did.

I could have grown up with people who devalued science. Being black, I could have easily grown up with too much distrust for the government what with the existence of  cases like the Tuskegee syphilis """"""study"""""" (they studied nothing, it was just awful). I could have had less interest in logical thinking/scientific evidence (many people dont, and infact many people who love to say ""science bitch"" dont either).

Thats a very long way of saying that you should at least try to understand how people got into the positions they are in, because you have to remember that everyone started as a little impressionable child, and they weren't molded in a vacuum.

Its easy for you to judge, but you got a vastly different life experience from them.

When you add to the mix the number of people in media and politics who might have also negatively influenced them you can clearly see a path to that opinion.


&gt;So yes, I have trouble understanding people like this because if they don't trust fact based evidence that's been replicated and studied extensively

Let's be real, the speed of this is unusual. You can give any explanations you want about test concurrency, will, funding etc etc, but you must realize that the process at bare minimum is unusual.

If you are unaware and untrusting of course you can see why when your expertise is so far removed, you rely on *gut feelings* and *smell tests* purely. Those arent great nor objective ways to decide things but thats how things work for a lot of people because in reality, you simply cant be an expert on everything. Of course though, thats taking that idea a bit too far.

&gt;Now it's been a year, millions of people have gotten it with almost no serious side effects. 

A year is nothing really. A year is us more or less still assuming that assumptions medical companies have made are correct (that essentially all you are left with after (I believe 2 weeks or so) is the antibodies to deal with covid. A year is us believing that they work the way they think they do.

Obviously when I say assumption in that context its means a bit more than assumption usually means because from what I'
ve read the actual mechanisms for how they work seem understood unlike other medicines where we sorta guess and check and ""hey it does the thing whoopee!"".That being said the point remains that this isn't some 10 year old tried and tested treatment so if especially if you arent an expert, and arent going to try to look things up or reason things out, what are you going to think?

This is brand new technology in terms of usage, and the speed looks and feels different. When your primary method of decision making is gut feeling, you can see how that turns out differently than you might hope.

&gt; Most I've heard from just think covid is an overblown hoax and that the vaccine is unnecessary. The main reason those people aren't getting it is because Biden is telling them they have to.

Like sure some of it is politics, but lets not pretend that this doesn't extend to all sides at least somewhat.

That's not me saying both sides are equal, but that your scatter chart is slightly more scattered than you think.

People unfortunately for you don't all just fit into one neat caricature. They have different life experiences, motivations, and systems of trust.

"hp07fgf","Actually, yes. It is. When I see a brother or sister of humanity who is gouged out of thousands of dollars to get treatment to keep them breathing, its quite upsetting. I would absolutely love to have massive reform in corporate tax laws and spending, but our system is too blinded by petty partisan warfare and corrupted by corporate incentives to make any real change happen. All while thousands die, unable to receive treatment or medication, or forced into lifelong debt to stay alive. 


It must be quite amusing to you. 


I'd love to have the US withdraw to 19th century isolationism. If only to watch chaos consume the world as the floodgates of US deterance release Iran, Russia, and China, and whatever warlords emerge from the chaos, to run rampant on the blissfully unaware and smug critics of the US policies. How long would it take for nuclear proliferation to occur until the middle east, Europe, and southeast Asia were just irradiated wastelands? You dont have to pray you never find out, because you have US bases, warships, and satellites to postpone this eventuality. And who foots the bill? That poor fool, unlucky and stupid enough to pay his taxes for the security of the world at large, all the while being victimized by the inadequacy and indifference of the very same government that won't give a damn if he dies without the medication or healthcare to survive the very next week.

"howsjel","He did- i just rewatched the finale and i guess im mad at the editors in a way bc, while i totally understand WHY erika won and was the correct choice, i cant help but feel like it should have been xander, he was edited in SUCH a likable and good/smart strategist big player who made lots of moves and earned it way. And it comes across as if the wokeness is the reason he lost.  I honestly dont think thats true and that erika won fair and square but by not undermining xander enough, showing the edit and game from his perspective where his moves are explained to us as logical and smart for the most part, it just makes u feel robbed that he lost.   I wish they gave erika a better edit and still gave xander the entertainment content but gave him more of a bad edit gameplay wise like they did with deshawn.  Its so conflicting bc if u look from xanders perspective he really did play a phenomenal game with 1-2 weaknesses (which everyone has a weakness) and couple misreads at the end, but if u look at it from the jurys perspective of him coming across as non threatening and socially unaware and you combine that with how well erika played and is perceived.

"howrlpt","We only see what we are shown. Meaning, social media is not always real life or the full story. The details of Aldo and L's relationship are only known to them. As is any other relationship. At the end of the day and behind closed doors it's just the two of them. No one should judge any relationship based on outward appearances and especially social media. The end.

I see Aldo's point in trying to bring attention to Atlas and his unethical, unprofessional and questionable practices as a coach. He has a very large following of bikini athletes who have drank the Kool-aid and basically signed a deal with the devil. A lot of these girls are more than likely unaware and oblivious to what has and is currently happening with his former athletes. This could easily happen to them as well and I believe Aldo is trying to sound the alarm. L is obviously limited in what she can and cannot say right now due to whatever suit she has been served. However it seems Aldo is not effected by and can speak more freely on the matter. 

L's choice in men and relationships are her own journey. She has to go down these paths by herself. That is life and part of being a growing person. So theorize and speculate all you want, this is L's journey and what she decides to share is entirely up to her.",1639744058,"a lot of these girls are more than likely unaware and oblivious to what has and is currently happening with his former athletes.","unaware and oblivious","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and oblivious","oblivious",NA,NA,1
"hovi4fp","I've quite a few in a 2E game I run as a GM. I think 'Drop' stands out for me though.

In Middenheim, one of my players is dueling the Champion of Middenheim in a festival duel (not to the death or anything) and one of my players who plays a High Elf Mage with a few screws loose, is watching this unfold.

With the motivation that he would like to help out the other player, Galdrea the elf casts the 'Drop' spell on the Champion. This is done as subtly as he can, casting while whispering the words.

It worked, and the Champion is heavily bemused as his weapon drops to the ground. However, the elf player did not account for Ser Gado's honour. You see, the player he's helping plays a honourable Knight from Bretonnia, a slightly naïve one at that. He picks up his weapon, oblivious as to what is really happening, and challenges the Champion to rematch.

The Champ obliges. What happens next is hilarious. Galdrea attempts several more castings of Drop, which are all successful, however, the Champion has to fail a willpower test for it to succeed against him. While he failed the first time, he keeps passing every subsequent one.

Finally, on the last one, just as it looks like Ser Gado is about to be defeated, the Champion drops his weapon. Ser Gado is declared victorious. Slightly confused as he was losing, but none the less, he accepts victory.

However... Consequences are now in play. I make a hidden perception roll for an npc. This npc happens to be a wizard from the Guild of Magic in Middenheim. And he has detected what has been going on here.

Long story short - Ser Gado and Galdrea, the High Elf mage (also an ambassador to the said Guild of Magic from Ulthuan) are arrested and put on trial. Cue two sessions of me doing a court drama, and I make it interesting for my players by allowing those whose characters are not involved in the trial, to play as prosecution and defense while my npcs were the Judges. I make it quite clear to my players that the stakes are high here. The gloves are off due to the serious nature of the charge and that a quick trial is in the interests of the State.

Ser Gado, the Bretonnian knight, is found not guilty, having been deemed that he was unaware and oblivious to all of this.

Galdrea the High Elf is found guilty. Normally, such a breach of magical law along with the circumstances that they conducted themselves in, would result in their head being clamped into a vice and slowly crushed like a melon. However... because they are an important person (Ulthuan magical ambassador of sorts) they are given some leeway, not to mention that the Guild speaks up on their behalf. They must profusely offer their apologies to the Champion, plead for salvation of their soul by kneeling in front of the Statue of Ulric at the Middenheim temple after conducting a 'walk of shame' and finally, be expelled from Middenland, never to return.

I made it clear to the player before hand that this is what I was going to do, that he would have to make a new character for the campaign. He was quite happy with doing that, fully accepted what he did and we just all had a laugh about it. It still pops up in conversation now and again as 'Drop Drop Drop'.",1639714088,"ser gado, the bretonnian knight, is found not guilty, having been deemed that he was unaware and oblivious to all of this.","unaware and oblivious","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and oblivious","oblivious",NA,NA,1
